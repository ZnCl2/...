      <p>Louis Boutard (1880-1958) is one of the French genius that we
        studied and continue to appreciate. The good thing is that such
        genius makes it easier to understand the ideas of Schauberger,
        and vice versa. If you know only one of them, the ideas can be
        hard to understand, and disturbing compared to our little ideas
        of what the world is. </p>
      <p>But as soon as you get ten or thirty such genius, their work,
        their understanding, and when you see that everything fit in a
        global unifying view, with the same strong understanding,
        although with different names and in different matters, then you
        are helped in your understanding of each one of them. </p>
      <p>Boutard's principal discoveries are the origin of electricity,
        origin of magnetism. He was able to create life (not to
        transform it in a twisted and mischevious way, as genetic does).
        He created organic life (totally different from organic matter
        which is not living at all) from inorganic, by Aether
        conduction. </p>

      <p>1. Perpetual Generator, automatic and autonymous: --- A type of
        this fluidic generator functions perpetually in the modest
        laboratory of Mr. Louis Boutard. It reveals which is the
        mysterious nature of the work whose very complex electric fluxes
        are the admirable resultant, entirely different from material
        mechanics or chemical "work", bases equation T, false lemma
        which has as a consequence the ruin of all the erected
        scaffolding mathematism with forgery in the field of the mystery
        up to now unknown, metaphysical, immaterial, of the
        electromagnetic immortal Life, whose logistic laws of indefinite
        multiplication, the great natural law, for which 2x2 does not
        make 4 but 400, are the reverse of the dÃ©perditives
        mathematical laws of the geometrical and mechanical inert
        matter. By the complexes requirements for the perpetual
        operation of this self-generating with 7 ways necessary of flow,
        which depends on immutable eternal principles, are peremptorily
        shown erroneous the ideas taught on the "voltage" and "amperage"
        and their current definitions, "quantity" and "intensity" from
        which nature distinct and the true causes are for the first in
        experiments detected time. The same demonstrations are made
        moreover by Mr. Boutard by means of very simple apparatuses,
        which without reducing the voltage of, and amperes at will, or
        which reduces the voltage of without amperage. </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. </font>Second generator which has the
        property, by special inductions, to multiply and amplify in a
        constant proportion the quantity and the intensity of the flows
        generated by the first generator, of which negligible is the
        initial power necessary and sufficient to produce induction: 22
        milliamperes and 200 millivolts. By a continuation of induction
        successive in several apparatuses progressive in sizes and
        connected in series, one multiplies ad infinitum (and for the
        first time the historical origin of the mathematical sign of
        infinite is shown) quantity and intensity ("voltage" and
        "amperage"), of the continuous currents of the initial
        generator, without any alternation of ruptures and closings, on
        polar data showing the falseness of the "scientific" theories
        taught up to now, just as of those having currently course on
        impossibility of producing induction by D.C. current without
        ruptures of the primary current; induction by ruptures which
        gives remainder only one current to private "voltage" but "of
        amperage"; whereas multiplying generators and amplifying above
        at the same time generate "voltage" and "amperage", and this at
        will, historical origin of the differential and integral
        "fluxions". </p>
      <p>Of course, this amplification is done exactly in the same way,
        under the same conditions, with a primary current having for
        origin the current mechanical "dynamos", all badly conceived and
        all defective by the ignorance of the fateful shape of the Field
        of Force. </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Demonstration models of this nature, of reduced
          size, were built by Mr. Louis Boutard during his work. It
          continued the construction and the assembly of these

      When the magnetic bodies are studied, such as iron-soft, cast iron
      or steel, one discovers by experiment that not all these bodies
      were previously magnetized, but freely suspended as pendulums,
      present naturally and, invariable lies both magnetic poles,
      southern and boreal, and whatever, consequently, their relative
      position with the degree of magnétic slope [declination ] of the
      place, and their orientation by relation with planar of the
      magnetic meridian of the same place. Their boréal [ N ] is high,
      and the south pole is low vertical of the magnetic said body
      following a line to zenith-nadir; as one can realize by means of
      the compass. This position of the poles, southern and boreal, is
      always invariable, as one can show it while reversing suddenly,
      the magnetic fragment subjected to the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      But if, instead of a body unspecified of form, one takes <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">a disc of iron</span>, steel or cast
      iron, and that one directs it in planar magnetic meridian<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>of the place, in parallel
      with it, one realizes that this intrinsic natural magnetization is
      the result posing S zenith-nadir, and 2 North-South terrestrial,
      forming a <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnetic cross</span>.
      Only, resulting from these two components is not, as it is
      supposed, a single magnetic crossing, but is an imposed field on
      each other, so that boreal pole and south pole have their
      equatorial limit following diagonal forming an angle compared to
      ideal line of equator; and what is more, with maximum of intensity
      of magnetic impulse, in two opposite points and I.E.( Internal
      Excitation )&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">extremes</span>
      crossed by planar of the meridian magnetic place, towards G5 by
      relation to this ideal line of equator, as one can realize by
      means of the compasses.<br>
      <br>
      In the same way with one sphere.<br>
      <br>
      It is what must be for bottle pincers, spheroids inorganic, not
      masses entirely of iron, but simply ferruginous; of kind <span
        style="font-style: italic;">(read two points of its circles:
        boreal towards 75, southern towards P&gt; , </span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      considered wrongly, like its poles magnetic, are actually both
      extremites of the diagonal line magnetic of maximum of intensity,
      that which follows, rigorously, the needle of the compass, which
      solli quoted by flow magnetic to maximum of intensity, moves
      there, parallel, by indicating both extreme this intensity, and
      not, as one believed, the same line of the true poles magnetic,
      which would coincide then with those of rotation.<br>
      <br>
      The Earth is thus loving natural, but nonfixed as is the hardened
      steel; because hardening as well as artificial magnetization have
      for coercive effect to bring back magnetic limit bipolar in the
      vicinity of the equator, maximum of intensity being towards 45*.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fragments subjected to the experiment are magnetized
      by the influence of the terrestrial spheroid, subjected itself to
      that of an immense universal magnetic cross which magnetizes it,
      like it magnetizes the worlds, of which it must be the axis; or so
      these magnetic fragments are subjected, just like the Earth
      itself, with the direct influence of this infinite magnetic ?
      Single the experiment could show it which would be made in the
      southern hemisphere, where, in the case of in fluence by the
      Earth, the south pole of magnetic particles subjected to the
      experiment should be above, and the boreal pole below in its
      vertical position.<br>
      <br>
      At all events, any object of a magnetic material like the iron,
      having the shape of a cross with two branches into perfect
      balance, suspended like a pendulum, and rotating freely under its
      point of suspension, is directed immediately and of itself, after
      oscillations, and without any artificial magnetization, aligned
      North-South. It is an object in isoceles triangle concealing a
      disc or a ring, obeying the laws of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      From this magnetic cross thus this idea rises: immense solenoid,
      magnetic screw without fine, with immense layers of whorls i.e. of
      tension, of which the axis or line central would answer
      North-South, its perpendicular, consisted the whorls of tension,
      joining the zenith-nadir (the points have zenith N, just like the
      points have to nadir, merging ad infinitum.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, in order to reach separate lies at all these points
      of tension (bipolar and perpendicular) on the fragment influenced,
      it is not other form only the shape of the cone, for each of the
      two magnetic poles, with trement said of the rhombe or double cone
      oposing by the bases, or double pyramid, who, gyrating, is only a
      rhombe. And experience shows that it is thus. All double cone or
      steel pyramid (or all o#et of a figure deriving is cone or pyramid
      gyrante, is rhombe with the lo sange), in the magnetized state,
      present, because of conjugation of conic handles fluid, maximum of
      intensity at half the height of each cone, or the half of its
      large ray (H or R ), and this, same with the static state. In
      movement dynamic, the two component magnetic forces must be put in
      tension, and theirs flows, variable of intensity, can be put in
      overpressure by means of steel points (themselves lengthened
      cones, attached with different sections on the circumference of
      the rhombe or double pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      One sees consequently why the magnets the good ones, in form of
      iron horseshoe (for example, of the machines of induction
      magnetos, always end up being demagnetized, the position of their
      poles being opposite of the magnetic law, whereas <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">one rhombe in suspension must remain
        magnetized for always</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Each one of these circles of-points into soft vement rotatory,
      with different sections on the circumference of the rhombe, thus
      generates varied tion flow of a point with the other one on the
      same circle, and of flow with intensity different of a circle of
      points to the other circle of points.<br>
      <br>
      If, now, one meditates on the electromagnetic cross of Oerstedt,
      one can idiot clure who one is in the presence of one bicouples
      with quadrangular equation: énergi quement and also solicited by
      one and the other pole (positive, negative of the force élec
      cudgel, two poles magnetic (southern and boreal of the magnetized
      needle, being made balance, tend to remain in cross by rapport
      with the two electrical poles: they are fixed mutually in this
      painful position of tension energetic reciprocal in the reciprocal
      desire. From where it follows that if it were uncoupled bicouple,
      by abrupt suppression of one of the magnetic poles, the two forces
      élec cudgels would make effort at the same time on the magnetic
      pole remained single, to link itself with him, by forming only one
      couple.<br>
      <br>
      That is to say thus, on the one hand, a current electric
      continuous, and made circular by a solenoid; and, in addition, a
      highly magnetized steel rhombe or double pyramid or excited
      towards its fine of equator by one or of induction coils
      electrical, provided with points sharp-edged with different
      sections of the one and the other cone or pyramid, and put in
      rotation being able to reach a large speed (by an unspecified
      motor on a shaft worm tical which holds it in suspension by an
      insulating ring or other device.<br>
      <br>
      This rhombe in suspension, highly manté, perfectly bipolar, will
      thus offer at all its points, including those attached with its
      polar tops, of taken unipolar flow at different tensions.<br>
      <br>
      These circles of points thus show that one in the presence of
      circuits is magnetics of which circular whorls, covering with mud
      itself one in the other one, form solenoids, or a solenoid of
      multiple layers of whorls or tension, magnetic screw whose flows
      are in whorls. From where points in whorls for all taken flows.<br>
      <br>
      To collect this unipolar and magnetic flow, to its different
      carrier rings, and to lead it in the electrical circuit that it
      must intercept, experiment shows us that the good one, perhaps the
      single one means, is a mercury tube (single reed tube with one of
      its ends cut in fluted nozzle, and closed by one naeud with other
      extremity, the other ones naeuds-partitions of pierced wood)
      having been laid out as a preliminary obliquely in front of the
      rhombe; with such given circle, from which the bent points come to
      pass rapidely person in rotatory movement, and to almost rub them,
      on the spout or the spouts of the small mercury tubes, which one
      sees to level the small upper bubble. It is not necessary that
      these tubes are capillary tubes. The heavier the tube is, the
      better, seems it, take place taken and transport of flow which the
      sea cure channels. From where the relationship, already higher
      clarified, between gravity and the attraction magnetic in the
      universal attraction.<br>
      <br>
      Also one is needed heavy coherer which is a resistance with the
      triple confluence of fluid electrical and magnetic flow or ray, a
      coherer through intermolecular cohesion whose this fluidic triode
      takes force of cohesion, C be-with-statement cohere.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">This cohesion of the magnetic ray
        on electrical flows must always take place <span
          style="font-style: italic;">with the shelter of the light :
          darkness, clearness read naire.</span></span><br
        style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      This cohesion, true first cause of sexual fecundation by the
      copulation of one couples, is a fecundation, where the impulse
      magnetic, true force male, fulfills its role of male, where the
      electrical impulse is forces it female, sterile without this

      based on these galvanic effects! Theories without logic!
      Hypotheses without bases! In what precedes, II acts of an outer,
      taken electric current with an other source than that of the
      rhombe pyramidal generator of magnetic energy. It is clear that
      this <span style="font-weight: bold;">rhombe pyramidal with the
        magnetic virtues exposed can be its own generator of electrical
        induction. Pyramidal angles, creating variation of indispensable
        flow for the induction of an electromotive said force, can be
        replaced by scratches or edges, either in straight lines, or in
        curved lines, on the surface of the rhombe.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The induced one will be thus a winding in arc, more or less
      obliquely inclined around and closest to the rhombe, one of ends
      of this arc which can be on a pole, and the other one on another,
      but which can be also on only one and kind pole, difference in

      <br>
      To increase the quantity of current, and to transform it into
      sharp force of intensity (voltage and amperage), by electrical
      induction, one will always employ the long cone which is the

        When the magnetic bodies are studied, such as iron-soft, cast
        iron or steel, one realizes by the experiment that all these
        bodies not magnetized as a preliminary, freely suspended like
        are them pendulums or in the vertical, present naturally and
        invariably the two magnetic poles, southern and boreal, and
        whatever, consequently, their position compared to the degree
        magnetic of slope of the place, and their orientation compared
        to the plan of the magnetic meridian line of this same place.
        Their boreal pole is in top, and the south pole in bottom of the
        vertical of the body known as magnetic not thus magnetized
        considered according to a line zenith-nadir, as one can realize
        by means of the compass it. This position of the poles, southern
        and boreal, is always invariable, as one can show it while
        reversing suddenly, "the head in bottom", the magnetic fragment
        subjected to the experiment. </p>
      <p>But if, instead of an unspecified body of form, one takes a
        disc of iron, steel or cast iron, and that one directs it in the
        plan of the magnetic meridian line of the place, parallel to
        him, one realizes that this intrinsic natural magnetization is
        the result of two components: </p>
      <p>1. zenith-nadir, </p>
      <p>2. North-South terrestrial, magnetic formant cross. </p>
      <p>Only, the resultant of these two components is not, as one
        supposes it, a simple magnetic crossing, but well a chiasma of [
        empiÃ¨tement - imposition ] one on the other, so that pole
        boreal and south pole have their equatorial limit according to a
        diagonal forming an angle of almost 40° compared to the ideal
        line of equator; and which more is, with a maximum of intensity
        in impulse magnetic of the place, towards 65° compared to this
        ideal line of equator, as one can realize by means of the
        compasses it. </p>
      <p>In the same way with a sphere. It is what must be for the
        Earth, spheroid mineral, not whole iron mass, but simply
        ferruginous; so that two points of its circles: boreal towards
        75°, southern towards 72°, regarded wrongly as its magnetic
        poles, are actually the two ends of the magnetic diagonal line
        of maximum of intensity, that which follows, rigorous, the
        needle of the compass, which solicited by the magnetic flux to
        the maximum of intensity, moves there, parallel, by indicating
        the two extremes of this intensity, and not, as one believed,
        the line even of truths poles magnetic, which would coincide
        then with those of rotation. </p>
      <p>The Earth is thus natural magnet, but nonfixed as is the
        tempered steel; because hardening as well as artificial
        magnetization cause coercive to bring back the magnetic bipolar
        limit to vicinity of the equator, and the maximum of intensity
        towards 45°. </p>
      <p>The magnetic fragments subjected to the experiment are
        magnetized by the influence of the terrestrial spheroid,
        subjected itself to that of an immense universal magnetic cross
        which magnetizes it, like it magnetizes the worlds, of which it
        must be the axis; or are these magnetic fragments they
        subjected, just like the Earth itself, with the direct influence
        of this infinite magnetic cross? Only the experiment could show
        it which would be made in the southern hemisphere, where, in the
        case of influence by the Earth, the south pole of the magnetic
        fragment subjected to the experiment should be in the top, and
        its boreal pole in the bottom of its vertical. </p>
      <p>At all events, like logical consequence any object of a
        magnetic matter like iron, having the shape of a cross or
        bracket with two branches in perfect balance, suspended like
        would be a pendulum, and turning freely under its point of
        suspension, is directed immediately and of itself, after
        oscillations, and without any artificial magnetization,
        according to the North-South direction. It in is the same for an
        object in isosceles triangle, a disc or a ring, obeying the laws
        of gravity. </p>
      <p>From this magnetic cross thus this idea rises: immense
        solenoid, magnetic endless screw, with immense layers of whorls,
        i.e. of tension, whose axis or central line would answer north
        south, its perpendicular, consisted the whorls of tension,
        joining the zenith-nadir (points "zenith", just like points "to
        nadir", merging ad infinitum). </p>
      <p>Consequently, in order to reach separately at all these points
        of tension (bipolar and perpendicular) on the influenced
        fragment, it is not other form only the shape of the cone, for
        each of the two magnetic poles, in other words rhombe or cone
        doubles being opposed by the bases, or double pyramid, which,
        gyrante, is only a rhombe. And the experiment shows that it is
        well thus. All double steel cone or pyramid (or any object of a
        figure deriving either from the cone or pyramid gyrante, or of
        the rhombe to the rhombus), at the magnetized state, present,
        because of the conjugation of fluid components, a maximum of
        intensity to half the height of each cone, or half of its large
        ray (H/2 or R/2), and this, even at the static state. Moving
        dynamic, the two component magnetic forces must be put in
        tension, and their flows, variables of intensity, can be put in
        overpressure by means of steel points (themselves cones
        lengthened), fixed at various sections on the circumference of
        the rhombe or double pyramid. One sees consequently why the best
        magnets, in the shape of iron-with-horse (for example, of the
        machines of induction called magnetos), always end up
        demagnetizing oneself, the position of their poles being against
        the magnetic law, whereas a rhombe in suspension must remain
        magnetized for always. </p>
      <p>Each one of these circles of points moving rotatory, with
        various sections on the circumference of the rhombe, thus
        generates flow and flux variation from one point to another on
        the same circle, with intensity different from a circle of
        points to the other circle of points. </p>
      <p>If, now, one meditates "on the electromagnetic cross" of
        Oerstedt, one can conclude that one is in the presence of a
        bicouple with quadrangular equation: energetically and also
        solicited by one and the other pole (positive and negative) of
        the electric force, the two magnetic poles (southern and boreal)
        of the magnetized needle, being made to balance, tend to remain
        in cross compared to the two electric poles: they are fixed
        mutually in this painful position of reciprocal energy tension
        in the reciprocal desire. From where it follows that if this bi-
        were uncoupled couples, by the abrupt suppression of one of the
        magnetic poles, the two electric forces would make effort at the
        same time on the magnetic pole remained only, to link itself
        with him, by forming only one couples. What confirms the
        experiment. </p>
      <p><font size="-0">That is to say thus, on the one hand, an
          electrical current continuous, and made circular by a

          of density, provided with points sharp-edged with various

          unspecified engine) on a vertical shaft which holds it in

      <p><font size="-0">This rhombe in suspension, strongly magnetized,
          perfectly bipolar, will thus offer to all its circles of

      <p>These circles of points thus show that one is in the presence
        of magnetic circuits whose circular whorls, encasing one in the
        other, form solenoids, or a solenoid with multiples layers of
        whorls or tension, magnetic endless screw whose flows are in
        whorls. From where points in whorls for all the catches of flow.
      </p>
      <p>To collect this flow, unipolar and magnetic, with its different
        carrier rings, and to lead it in the electric circuit that it
        must intercept, the experiment shows us that the best, perhaps
        the single means, is a mercury tube (simple pipe of reed open to
        the one of its ends cut in nozzle-of-flute, and closed by a node
        at the other end, the other node-partitions of wood having been
        bored with the precondition) laid out obliquely in front of the
        rhombe; with such circle given, from which the bent points come
        to pass quickly moving rotatory, and to almost rub them, on the
        nozzle or nozzles of the small mercury tubes, which one sees
        levelling the small higher bubble. It is not necessary that
        these tubes are capillary tubes. The heavier the tube is, the
        better, seems T-it, take place taken and transport of flow which
        mercury channels. From where the relationship, already higher
        clarified, between gravity and the magnetic attraction in the
        gravitation. </p>
      <p>Also one needs a heavy coherer which is a resistance to
        confluent triple of the electric fluids and flow or magnetic
        ray, a coherer through cohesion on intermolecular decoherence

        the conical top or the base of the cone, the large circle of
        this base, or between them with an intermediate section; </p>
      <p>2. That number of revolutions of the magnetic core, therefore
        the frequency of variation of its flow, is more or less fast; 3.
        That flow is more or less intense. </p>
      <p>It is the same with the south pole (cone lower and reversed
        pyramidal rhombe), with this difference which the generated
        organic compounds go from the fatty acid until glycerin. To
        start the reactions, it is wise to employ a small quantity of
        sweetened water (dissolved glucose and levulose) mixed to the
        water-mother, or a dissolution of a carbonate (potash or weld,
        detergent of ash). </p>
      <p>II.&nbsp; Running in a gaseous medium (air). - best is to
        employ, for the electric poles, a good oscillator with balls,
        adjustable at will, and charged by the armature of a reel with
        sufficient frequency, with the end of the small mercury tube
        placed between the balls, the whole fixed by fasteners on hard a
        coherer-resistance insulated (held perfectly in suspension by
        wire insulating or in some basket, below which or in which one
        can place a filter: skin, felt, etc). </p>
      <p>The aerated water must fall drip on the magnetoelectric point
        of cohesion, whose coherer, range gradually, disaggregate
        slowly, giving birth, according to its physical nature and its
        chemical composition, with the natural organic substances of
        simplest with most complex, and according to the conditions
        know-indicated of polar catch of flow, of more or less of
        intensity, at the same time as speed and of magnetoelectric
        frequency. </p>
      <p>It is cold which emerges, being able to go, according to the
        intensity of the power magnetic, until freezing in white frost
        water filtering drip, whereas electricity, destroying and
        thermics, produces only heat. It is thus well magnetic energy,
        energy rÃ©atrice, which generates cold; it is thus cold, and not
        calories, which is released in creative work. What explains why
        the two magnetic poles of planets, like the Earth, are
        constantly frozen. What explains the release of the cold which
        results from the storm, being solved in rain, snow, hail and the
        lightning (flash with thunder) not being simply, as one believes
        it in the simple state of our current knowledge, a recombination
        of positive with the negative one of the electricity of the
        clouds, but a magnetoelectric triangular recohesion,
        reconstituting ether in his static state. What one can
        reproduce, in reduced proportions, with the oscillator and its
        tube of mercury, so the volume of the two balls and the power in
        dynes gives to equipment a powerful potential. The magnetic
        junction corresponds, indeed, so that one makes in mechanics
        when one unites the element "shock" with the element "speed";
        the magnetic element is as a "water hammer" which one introduces
        into the element "speed" of the electric circuit: from where it
        results a force combined with the extraordinary effects. It is a
        very powerful brake, which, rubbing in the circuit, can turn off
        the engine. </p>
      <p>And this "cold" coagulates, "takes in frost", such milk that
        one made there drip drop by drop. The coherers can be mineral
        (most various as well as most complex), plants (such as wood),
        animals (bone, horn, etc), giving to the magnetoelectric flow,
        which animate them or the life gives again to them, the infinite
        variety as well physical as chemical of the organic substances
        of the life. Because the life, all that saw, of the plant to the
        animal, is only one magnetoelectric ether emanation on rough
        matter. Because thus shapes magnetoelectric energy. One cannot
        think of enumerating them. To give idea of it, when this coherer
        is ferrous quartz with potash (potash silicate coloured by
        iron), it is a true chlorophyl which created, when one then
        exposes it to sunlight. When the coherer is a basaltic body, the
        generated organic substance is a homogeneous mixture of starch,
        of aleurone and gluten, true wholewheat flour, nitrogen of the
        atmospheric air being comparable each time the coherer contains
        calcium, and organic phosphorus seeming allotropic calcium under
        the double electric magneto influence and that of the light.
        According to the various coherers, it is thus of true vegetable
        saps, adapted with the various plants, their manures
        essentially, which one can procreate, and to provide to the
        vegetable life, where all occurs as during present experiments:
        underground and obscure work of the roots and seed in the
        mineral ground with work in the sheet in the light of the sky.
        When the coherer is an arsenical metal (metal arsenide), there
        are alive dyes with the inalterable color. </p>
      <p><font size="-0">H/2 ou R/2 --- But then the southern and boreal
          magnetic fluxes generate the carbohydrates in general, the
          catch of flow to the maximum of intensity with H/2 or 2/R
          (lower cone of the rhombe) comes to fill the astonishment
          caused by the wonder than is a magnetized cone.</font> </p>
      <p>On a coherer like the slate-coloured schist (aluminous or
        argillaceous) two carbon dioxides are broken up, and their
        carbon linked with hydrogen, formant hydrocarbon, which in an
        incipient state, safe from the light, has an extreme power of
        destroying energy. In its medium, its contact, the sharp skin is
        pricked of blisters, no germ morbid cannot live, the bodies
        become imputrescibles. In the very near future, this penetrating
        force will give to therapeutic means without similar: that,
        inter alia, to destroy not only any gangrene, but still cancer
        accessible. </p>
      <p>In the nontherapeutic order, the protective organic envelopes
        (parenchymas) of the plants such as the esparto, "Stipa
        tenaciscima L", the sparte, "Lygeum spartum L", are entirely
        destroyed, leaving with naked vegetable fibre. Such a near
        future will show how can occur the illustrated leavens, the
        cellular germs, developing themselves by scissiparity, when the
        aerated water dripping on a hard coherer containing of zinc, of
        the iron and a little calcium, carried until incandescence,
        spreads the magnetoelectric sines (spores being whorls) in a
        sweetened dissolution, giving rise to the saccharomyces. But
        when coherer, under triple influences magnetoelectric with very
        high frequency enters in phosphorescence, and in incandescence
        giving heat and light pure, whose radiation can also be
        collected, led and to be made act in the adapted mediums, by
        mercury tubes posed like antennas with the front of the coherer,
        it is necessary to take well guard with the dangerous influence
        of these powerful rays on the mass brain, whose best guard seems
        well to be a helmet in rough skin of squales (dog-of-sea or
        shagreens), because of their silica as well biological as
        mineral. </p>
      <p>Here thus recognized, returned with its author, whole powerful
        to provide, up to now ignored, that one allotted to forgery with
        electricity, half of the couple, whose sovereign role is with
        the other half, is with the generator: magnetic fluid, the
        absolute power or force paramount which dominates the universe
        and holds it in balance, that which sows the life! And here is
        recognized inanity of the theories of the science, which,
        melting general chemistry on the galvanic effects breaking up
        minerals electrically, although this one was without effect on
        the organic compounds, on a side concluded, without concern of
        logic, at the "electric state" of the bodies norganic as well as
        organic, this "electric state" or ionization having all to
        explain: vital phenomena and those of the raw materials; and
        other side affirmed, on the contrary, with an inconsistancy not
        less disconcerting, than the all alone "chimism" could all
        explain, whereas all the chimism was founded on these galvanic
        effects! Theories without logic! Assumptions without bases! In
        what precedes, it acts of an electrical current external, taken
        with a source other than that of the rhombe pyramidal generator
        of magnetic energy. But it is clear that this rhombe pyramidal
        with the magnetic virtues discovered can be its own generator of
        electric flux density. The pyramidal angles, creating essential
        flux variation for the induction of a force known as
        electromotive, can be replaced by scratches or grooves, either
        in straight lines, or in curved lines, on the surface of the
        rhombe. </p>
      <p>The armature will be thus a rolling up in arc, more or less
        obliquely around tilted and with more close to the rhombe, one
        of the ends of this arc which can be on a pole, and the other on
        another, but which can be also on a single pole, the difference
        in intensity fluid on the same polar cone creating the potential
        difference for induction known as electromotive. </p>
      <p>With a rolling up solenoid, there is thus a D.C. current,
        circular, and more undulating, owing to the fact that the flow
        of the one and the other cone are with variable intensity of
        each polar top to the large circle of the base. </p>
      <p>To increase the quantity of current, and to transform it into
        sharp force of intensity (voltage and amperage), by
        electro-electric induction, one will always employ the long cone
        which is the spindle, striated or smooth, right or bent, which
        has the same properties even in a static state, like magnetic
        core for rolling up, and rolling up solenoid, of primary
        education wire and secondary wire. </p>

      <p><font size="-0">What shows the following experiments:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. When one runs a continuous electrical
          current in a discussion thread rolled up on a rhombe, either
          of metal, but of wood, whose cones opposed by the bases are
          very rigorously equal, one notes, by means of the compasses,
          which the intensity of the developed magnetic field is growing
          since the top of the nose bullet until R/2, then decreasing
          from R/2 to the largeest diameter with the large circle of the
          base, boundary line between poles boreal and southern, where
          the impulse becomes null, - to grow again on the cone of exit,
          i.e. the other pole, until R/2, - these variations of
          intensity of the one and the other pole being made balance.
          There is thus Ã©quipollence, with two potentials, as well on
          the southern one as on the boreal one.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. With a rolling up on another wood rhombe
          with two unequal cones: the large one having a height
          equalizes with triple of the radius of the large circle of the
          bases; the small one, a height equal to this large ray, whose
          top thus forms an angle of 90Â°, or lower than this large ray,
          the angle of top having beyond 90Â°, the separating line
          between poles boreal and southern is always with the large
          circle of the bases, but the magnetic intensity of R/2 on this
          small cone or pyramid gyrante is the double of that in R/2 on
          the large pyramid or large cone. There is thus rupture of
          balance between the variations of intensity of the one with
          the other pole. There is no more eqquipolarity.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">3. It is the same, if the small cone is rounded
          in dome, cupola, warhead; with a wood rhombe having
          consequently the shape of a spinning top. The rupture of
          balance is accentuated more still.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">4. If the wood rhombe is tiny room to a cone,
          like a shoe-with-whip, toy of the children, and that rolling
          up even continues in the field of the base, formant spiral as
          on a disc, the southern and boreal bipolarisation is always
          regular, with its separating line with the large circle of the
          base, and the maximum of intensity in R/2 of the spiral of
          this base.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">5. If this wood cone grows hollow in funnel,
          consequently with the smallest cone returning in the large
          one, and that rolling up continues in the same direction
          inside this small cone, the southern</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">and boreal bipolarisation is always to the large
          circle of the base, and the maximum of intensity with R/2 of
          the small cone of funnel. What shows well that this magnetic
          field is a solenoid: layers</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">of magnetic whorls encasing concentric, of which
          a half, axipete, are in tension, under the vibratory effort,
          with other half, axifuge, rigorously with semi-ray: not
          fateful, with increasing of the center with R/2, and
          decreasing intensity of R/2 to the periphery, as the fig. 1
          indicates it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">There are thus two southern flows and two
          boreal flows: an inflow, as well as a peripheral flow,
          southern and boreal, coupled and welded in R/2, being
          stretched as well in length as in width, in tension onto this
          circle under the influence of the shock, the clash and the
          revolving bump, with the whorls in contrary direction, than
          the form of the rhombe or rhomboide makes it possible to reach
          in all their layers, as very well an account of it the
          structure of onion gives. Otherwise to dir: magnetic Bi-couple
          in parallel welded in a neutral monade of impulse, which tends
          to be put in cross under the influence of the shock or
          vibratory movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">If, in addition, on a spindle striated with
          soft iron or steel (double cone lengthened or curved while
          growing) one rolls up formant tablecloth a wire one of money
          fine and gilded with the pure gold, whose ends are left free,
          and that on this tablecloth of whorls of gold wire one rolls
          an isolated copper wire (inductive), above which one
          superimposes several layers of another isolated wire much
          finer (induced wire), one note, with the passage of the
          inductive continuous electrical current, that with the rupture
          and closing the electric armatures occur normally. But if the
          two ends of the gold wire magnetic, or paramagnetic, were it
          finer than a hair, are connected on the ends of the copper
          wire stripped of the armature, with the rupture and closing of
          the primary circuit no armature passes more. No one
          "short-circuit" (deus ex machina of the "technicians"),
          because if one connects only one of the ends of the gold wire,
          of southern for example (and especially sheltered light,
          insulated in a rough wool, and preferably wire, crÃªpu,
          circumvented in volutes or making zigzags), even absence of
          induction. The gold tablecloth formed tablecloth of condensed
          flows, tank which simply runs out, by simple gravity, of R/2
          to the point of southern, the upstream to the downstream, by
          the channel of the wire, sufficient potential, true potential,
          to create a current, without there being a circuit, because if
          all the rivers, with the potential of which one has habit to
          compare the electric potential, run out well indeed of the
          high level of upstream on the low level of downstream, one
          does not see them forming circuit, i.e. to go up with their
          source, their starting level, of another state: of their
          liquid state in a vaporous state, that is to say, in the final
          analysis, volatile, fluidic. From where it follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. That a magnetic impulse can also be induced,
          like the electric impulse, on a magnetic or paramagnetic wire,
          as on copper electricity;</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. That it can be led, i.e. started, on one of

          Consequently, if these fundamental conditions are met: 1.

          themselves, and to form two currents. For the comprehension of
          this proposal, it is necessary to have presents at the memory
          the diagrammatic figure 2, of which here the legend: I and I'
          indicate the inflows: boreal and southern; O and O' indicate
          peripheral flows: boreal and southern;</font> </p>

          the whirling of the fluids on themselves: largest overriding
          the small one. And as flows of contrary direction attract each

      <p><font size="-0">Because of the rupture of balance between the

          the pole which develops weakest, it is with-statement of the
          small cone towards the large one, in other words of R/2 of the
          cupola of the rhombe or dome of the spinning top, which is
          properly the keystone, and whatever its polarization: southern
          or boreal. Experiment attentive showing that the induction or
          creation of rays and fluidic currents, to start with the
          electric one (rupture and closing, bringing together,
          distance, of a primary current), depends primarily and only of
          the shock or clash and the abrupt movement, one will thus take
          drivers, as well inductive as induced, as well electric as
          magnetic, having angles of shocks (not round wire and smooth),
          that they square or are striated, rough in a word, on the
          asperities of which the current jolts and is splashed,
          constantly, on all its course, in all the induction field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">That is to say thus an inductive electric
          driver: a large metal wire as the copper, striated with the
          precondition, for example helical, then offering the aspect of
          a screw, - or braid coward of three striated wire, - different
          sections and metals or alloys different, if one wants. Then,
          for drivers of the magnetic armatures, a gold wire chain
          (gilded money, gold alloy and money, etc.) fixed on helical
          leather thin straps rolled up around the inductive electric
          driver, therefore oblique or in cross constantly with him. The
          unit, protected well by a wool whorl, which shelters and
          isolates the plank from gold, is then enoulÃ© (dextrogyre for
          example: boreal with the entry of the current) on the wood of
          the spinning top being used as mould. The magnetic gold
          armature thus includes/understands three sections:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. First section of I cut with R/2 with the
          circle of K;</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. Second section of cut I' with R/2 with the
          circle of K'. These two sections are connected one to the
          other by gallery or interior passage, with very the wood
          shape, below the circles K and K' (in the field consequently
          of the inflows I and I'), like show it exactly fig. 3a,
          forming circuit DD'.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">3. Third going section of R/2 (circle K) with
          R/2 (K' circle), in the field of peripheral flows O and O',
          forming circuit BB' (fig. 3b). Finally in R/2, with the circle
          K of coupling, therefore</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">of decoupling, consequently of energy effort,
          one can intercalate a ring or crowns magnetic, which will be
          induced of the third flow odd, alternative rupture of the
          welding of both others, but turning on itself, forming circuit
          KK' (fig. 4), which can be coupled with its identical on a
          ring K' K', if one removes BB'.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">There are thus three circuits of three magnetic
          forces, whose fluids must always circulate under wool, hair or
          other of comparable nature, insulating magnetic, safe from any
          light.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The two ends of each one of these circuits come
          to plunge in the medium of test-tubes containing with water,
          like coherer and driver, a certain quantity of a body gross
          mineral: ordinary sand, marble fragments, etc, (according to
          the organic compound or only the effects which one wishes to
          obtain), with which one covers the magnetic seams.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">When the apparatus functions, a quite weak
          electrical current (for example 2 volts) crossing the
          inductor, that it is continuous or alternate, is enough to
          make induce and to put moving the three magnetic fluxes, of
          which conducting chains, under the influence like invisible
          file, of which soon iridescent (circuits II'), or blackened
          (removed the gilt from and oxidized money: circuit BB' and KK)
          on all the course of the contact with the coherer, which
          itself is filed and small-with-small mined, without release of
          heat, the axial II' releasing even a cold which can become
          intense until congelation, that of simply warming ring KK.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">No one electrical current does not traverse
          these conduits, whose magnetic fluxes, true atoms, deja
          endowed with will and desire, advance only slowly, of link in
          link. To measure them, an ordinary "voltmeter" would be
          enough, but whose drivers as well as rollings up would be made
          same wire as, pareillement insulated above. All that precedes,
          for the clearness and the simplicity of the exposure. But like
          flows of II' and OO' of this Bi-couple are both perfectly
          bipolar, with a variation of intensity, increasing and
          decreasing, or double potential, on one and the other pole, as
          one mentioned above, and saw with the fig. 2, they can
          duplicate oneself, producing four currents:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. Running D of I;</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">2. Current of&nbsp; I';</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">3. Running B of O;</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">4. Running B' de O';</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">What, with that odd KK', thus produces five
          currents. There are thus five dynamic, creative powers of any
          organic life, three forces first, of which two are double
          while being bipolar, of which the odd third, neutral and, is
          the union of both others. It is easy to see that it is in R/2,
          with the carrier ring K and K', that this product, resulting
          from the work of magnetic energy, any ray or current of
          electric power, which is nothing in oneself, only the effect
          of the tension of the two plain magnetic forces in a third:
          the monade of the Aether.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">And, indeed, if on these wood rhombes one rolls
          up an electric armature of genuine silver wire, parallel with
          the large inductive wire of which it follows rolling up, in
          inside or apart from the helicoid rolling up of conducting
          plank of gold wire of fluids BB' of OO', it induces (that the
          primary current is continuous or not) two continuous
          electrical currents, which accompany in cross the currents
          magnetic B and B' their setters moving: one on each pole;
          respectively leaving the circles even K and K' to the large
          basic circle commune, neutral line where are neutralized the
          two induced ones going to the meeting, of which one in the
          direction, and the other with misconception of the inductive
          electrical current, - where it is thus necessary to cut the
          discussion thread of the armatures, magnetic as well as
          electric, to make two circuits of them: one on the south pole,
          the other on the boreal one of BB' or O', and answering not
          positive and negative of the common and ambiguous names of the
          electrical current, but well the one and the other of the
          electricities (resinous and glazed) noted in statics, having
          each one their clean positive and clean negative: level of
          upstream, level of downstream, which makes their potential, -
          and answering consequently the two reverse currents of rupture
          and closing of the ordinary reels of induction.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The variations of intensity of two dynamic
          flows creating the potentials can thus be still appeared in a
          way seizing by the diagram of the fig. 5, formant network of
          rhombuses, forms vibration.</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">The same laws applying (same effects of the same
          causes) to any generation of magnetoelectric energy, it is
          followed from there that to have a pile of indefinite and
          "impolarizable" use, it is enough to roll up on a
          shoe-with-whip, like that of the children, a narrow zinc tape
          bored as a preliminary like a grater of kitchen of a multitude
          of small holes to burs, and in which one welds a multitude of
          very small points of pins or trucks (out of galvanized brass,
          money gilded, etc), bent hook to the bottom, starting from the
          R/2 circle until that of the large diameter.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Plunged in water in a terra cotta vase, with at
          the bottom a little of lime, conducting electric, which
          dissolves, this pile even functions at the moment, and without
          worsening.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">At the conducting counter, of which they marry
          the form, monades magnetodynamic Bi-couple come to grate and
          break. By the points which run out it one of the magnetic
          fluxes is launched (B or B' of O-O'), involving transversely
          the electric power of tension and rupture of the Bi-couple:
          the impulse is given, the movement is created, to stop more, -
          only stops at the beginning, and in road the contact, of the
          slow magnetic flux which hesitates being opposed to the
          movement, and consequently with electric movement, of which it
          causes only the stop, known as "polarization", like the
          actuation. Once launched this magnetic impulse, it thus should
          be drawn aside, to cancel it, on a body gross heavy, more
          heavy that the lime of water, conducting electric: rough wall
          of the vase, swell frosted of ground cooked, insoluble clay
          mass with the lime of the bottom, etc. - One can collect it
          also perfectly in circuit using two small tubes (wood, glass,
          pottery) containing a little mercury that one puts in contact
          with similar drivers at those described. - other flows could
          be launched and also led, by means of other points on the
          remainder of the narrow zinc band perforated. On carbon
          dioxides they can produce in water, with the coherers, the
          same bodies organics which can organize same flows of large
          the rhombe striated, out of magnetized steel, armed with
          points, low frequency turning, by the geminated mercury tubes
          which collect and channel, with return of each period, the
          flow of the flow of the points moving rotatory, - while with
          high frequency organize by II' the bodies with soft savour, by
          OO' those with acid savour. Tubes of mercury, with the
          short-nap cloth of the points of the generating steel rhombe
          of magnetoelectric induction, which fulfill the same role as
          the planks of conducting gold wire with the rhombe of wood,
          gauge of the electromagnetic induction which has been just
          described, the effects are identical, except however that with
          the generating steel rhombe the catches of flow by the channel
          of the points can be infinitely varied, these points being
          able to fix itself at all points of the circular tension.</font>

          being the original source of the electric effect by magnetic

          the monades comes to run up, in tension vibratory. On platinum
          sponge which blackens, peripheral flow piles up, untiring and
          ceaseless generator of the organic acids. The astonishing

          shows it, - and not "indivisible", misconception and nonsense,
          impossible fiction which one is astonished to see taken as
          material base by certain scientifism. What reveals the nature
          of the monades: an inflow and bipolar, which suddenly released
          of a peripheral flow which wraps it around, precipitates in
          vertical circles axipetes, in fall accelerated towards a point
          known as to nadir, word-with-word "of that which descends ",
          the Berber one, borrowed by Arabic, ader: to go in bottom, to
          go down, - whereas flow peripheral, also bipolar, goes up in
          circles axifuges towards the point says zenith, literally
          "with released", of Berber, borrowed by Arabic, via Spanish:
          c-Ã©nit (with the accent on the first syllable). From where
          the balance of the monade in a neutral state in the ocean of
          monades, called "vacuum" that is the Ether ocean, - the
          imponderable zenith force making just balance with the nadiral
          ponderable force, which it holds in suspension until the shock
          of rupture. For this reason, it is rolling up in funnel which
          is necessarily the best. It is form c?ur, which is thus
          obligatory to perpetuate the movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The electric flow being always better if one
          inserts the coal of electrode below bottom of the "pile",
          close to the suspended stone, it follows that this fluidic
          current, simple effect of the magnetic tension with its and
          shackle R/2 uncoupling or qoppa-pi (QP), the fate of this ring
          follows, which is the cause of this effect of tension; and
          that, consequently, this flow of the ring of rupture even
          follows the law of the axis, that of gravity; it melts towards
          nadir it, in dextrogyre movement.</font> </p>

          cross-pieces, reduced to a "simple cross".) Without having
          this figure always present at the memory, it is useless to
          undertake a scientific study. However the experiment shows
          that if the electric flow follows the fate of its ring of
          rupture, which follows the law of the axis, that of gravity
          moving dextrogyre, this electric flow to neutralize it the
          inflow and nadiral can never reach, which can consequently to
          accumulate, concomitant and without relaxation, at the same
          time as the electric fluid, on same heavy body, electric
          driver: of metal for example. What is applied, but without
          that one knows why, in the field of force which is the
          "accumulator".</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">But if this known as heavy body is other than a
          conducting metal, or if there does not exist, fluid of tension
          electric always tends to follow in its walk and until in its
          movement the other zenith flow of the periphery, which, very
          slow, is always let reach. And for this reason a current
          electric (to currently preserve this denomination of use,
          although it is extremely vague) be accompanied, and always, in
          more or less large proportion, of the zenith impulse of the
          periphery.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">One can easily see it by means of an old
          ordinary "pile", of which the "porous one" out of use, does
          not stop any more for chemical work of "salt", known as
          "depolarizing", peripheral flow light, which leaps in the
          electrical current that it tends to cancel, and whose sudden
          starts violent one are if abrupt and rapids that the needle of
          the "voltmeter" starts in disordered jumps, like cure of a
          patient reached of fever. It is thus well him it "driving" of
          famous "climbing salts" which go up by coals, cross the edge
          of the vases of pile not coated with paraffin, to follow it
          obstinately "running", - tending to cancel it, at least
          seemingly, but more exactly to modify it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The obviousness is the same one if with this
          old "pile" or that described above, one connects the positive
          one, even without completing, on a rhombe of induction

          electric, that is to say continuous or even discontinuous,
          magnetic induction on each one sections, discontinuous or
          continuous, occurs normally. It follows from there that in
          fact magnetic fluids lead the flow of their tension electric.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">Consequently, in any field of magnetic force,
          the largest diameter of a heavy lorry (like iron, for example,

          determines, of which flow is absorbed by the weight of this
          mass even, angular surface constituting the wall on which
          occurs the vibratory tension, if one rolls up it of a light

          comprises really different sections turning in opposite

          fork it by duplicating his copper driver. "To rectify" wants
          to thus say to print a movement of direction, and of the same
          direction. By one fatal need, this direction must be
          laevogyre, because it is bipolar flow laevogyre of periphery
          which, through wood of the dry tube of reed, escaping from the
          influence from the ring electric of the field of force
          created, will clutch in the passing the inductive electrical
          current to rectify, he printing single sound direction moving

          of force, is also conductive magnetic zenith, i.e. if it

      <p><font size="-0">In fact thus the currents to be rectified are

          vertical, in order to facilitate the continual flow of the
          axial one with nadir by the bottom of the rifle sharpened at a
          peak fine. On the diagram nÂ°4, the field winding with to
          rectify is carried intentionally beside the field of force of

          better do to seize the detail from what occurs.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The energy effort of the Bi-magnetic tension,

      <p><font size="-0">It is thus well the side tension, the
          stretching in width, which is fundamental. Because it is it
          which cause the scission, at the critical point and capital
          R/2, and the open opening of the field of force of Aether,
          producing the electric double effect. It is still the tension
          which causes the stretching between each circle of the
          magnetic flow of axis, just as between each circle of
          peripheral flow, producing qualified effects "parasitic", all
          taken for "electric" and confused together, from which they
          differ radically, as they differ between them, as well
          physically as chemically. That is to say three effects of
          tension:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. The effect of tension critical to the R/2
          circle is the Ãlectrique effect, of the name of Electa,
          mythical generator of Electra = AlcmÃ¨ne, "wife" of Lecture
          theater-tryÃ´n, and frightening mother of the Force of
          Hercules; 2. The effect of tension between each circle of
          peripheral flow is the Dionique effect, of name of Dionis,
          "mother" of Aphrodite Epitragia: that which follows the
          mystical "Goat"; 3. The effect of tension between each circle
          of flow of the axis is the Palladique effect, of crowned name
          of Pallas = "vibrating by shocks", Pallas optilatis: its pure
          light being phosphorescent like that of the glow-worm; Athena¨
          glaukapis: to which is devoted owl and phosphorated oils like
          greases of the brain, sits of Intelligence.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">It is clear that the magnetoelectric "beam", as
          well right as in arc, cannot, by sound obligatory device, that
          to give the electric tension as well as the total, unipolar
          flows or bipolar, of two flows of the axis and the periphery,
          like that of their carrier ring, but without any separation
          nor analytical insulation in the infinite variety of each one
          of these impulses, whose properties differ according to turns'
          from the circles from their own tensions. What rhomboÃ¯de only
          can make it possible to obtain. It is agreed, before
          continuing, that it is necessary to understand by inductor or
          means of induction magneto-electro-dioni-palladic, an
          unspecified cause of shocks: wind, running, moving water or
          beachcomber, tumble of rocks, blows on a sistre, tambourine or
          tambourine, etc. being able to accelerate the natural movement
          of the monades of the Ãther. If one takes preferably, like
          means of induction, an unspecified electrical current or
          magnetic, already preexistent, it is only as average more
          convenient to have a constant cause of shocks by these forces
          in go, but without anything more.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">That is to say thus an electrical current like
          means of induction. But in order to simplify, the talk will be
          tiny room with the only case of the tension at the point
          criticizes R/2 showing how to separate in the armatures the
          magnetic flow of the electric flow, or on the contrary how to
          join together them, - same devices being able to be employed
          for separation or the meeting, in the armatures peripherals:
          magnetic flow and of its effect of dionic tension or flow, -
          in the axial armatures: magnetic flow and of its effect of
          tension or flow palladic. To increase the extent of the
          tension on this joint point of the rupture Bi-fluid, instead
          of limiting this circle with a theoretical circular line, it
          is appropriate to cut off on a pole, boreal for example, the
          heavy wood rhomboide being used as mould until the
          circumference of this ring by lengthening it such an amount of
          that one will want, even beyond the neutral line between the
          southern one and the boreal one by cavity of the southern one.
          The other pole will be tiny room with a hemispherical or
          ogival cap, or with a cone which can be truncated, formant
          "head of bludgeon", and of which the largeest diameter will be
          given by R, - as has and B of figure 6.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In order to be uniform from one end to another
          its length, the electric inductor (large pure copper wire and
          striated helical) will carry helical 5 sections of magnetic
          rollings up, but each one of them forming a stopped,
          discontinuous line:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. section, sinistrorse, for the axial one of
          the boreal point makes hooks of gold, gilded money, etc, on
          narrow leather tape doubled below another band to avoid
          contact with the copper wire (electric inductor) on which it
          is rolled up;</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. section, dextrorse, for boreal QP, made same
          gold hooks, gilded money or amalgamate, iron and lead, with

      <p><font size="-0">5. section, dextrorse, for the axial one of the
          point of southern (like the 1st section). This rolling up with

          the narrow one bandage zinc serving of "pile"
          soleno-rhomboide.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In this state, the 5 sections function
          separately, leading the related magnetic flow whose atoms leap
          by jumps from one point or a granule to another: the axial
          ones rather quickly, slowly those of the periphery, separated
          from the fluids of their own tension: electric, dionic,
          palladic, it is enough to insert between leathers, at the base
          of the hooks or granules, in contact with them, one soutache
          or a conducting plank continues of the same metal. And in the
          studied case, sections 2 and 4 must be joined together, by
          interior passage, or section 2 to advance on the southern one,
          so that there is an electrical current involved in the same
          flow with the double flow of QP reduced to the only dominating
          movement of southern, the movement dextrogyre. It is this
          sexual energy couple which constitutes <i>Heracelia Ãlbia</i>
          or Heraclean Forces , who in this state is deoxidizing being
          able to give rise to hydrocarbons. And in this case, the
          electric flow tending to being parallel with the inductive
          line, two bands of sections 2 and 4, instead of being rolled
          up in whorl, can be folded up and hemmed, engaÃ®nant the
          inductive one. But on the contrary to separately collect the
          fluidic effects of tension: electric, dionic, palladic, it is
          necessary that there is no contact between the continuous wire
          their drivers and discontinuous chains of the magnetic atoms,
          - which continuous wire can be: Pure copper for the electric
          one; Pure money for the dionique one; And pure gold for the
          palladic armature, whereas metal hooks or granules of
          discontinuous drivers of the magnetic atoms can be replaced:</font>

          tension, with an aim of using the specific energy which is
          clean with each one, endowed with virtue different as well
          physical as chemical, it is enough to lengthen such circular
          ring which one wants to obtain energy, instead of limiting it
          to a theoretical circular line (fig. 7), as it has just been
          known as for the circle criticizes R/2. The number of these
          tensions, in other words of these circular rings, can be
          regarded as infinite; but in practice, as the experiment shows
          it, it can be reduced to 3 on each pole axial, to 7 on each
          pole of peripheral flows, as fig. 8 indicates it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">However induction, like already known as, in
          the field of force of Aether, is at two distinct times, from
          where two capital phases:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. That of decoupling by side tension,
          releasing them one of the other, the two forces Aether;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">2. That of the unfolding by tension in length,
          boreal and southern for each of two uncoupled flows. In this
          state of insulations, as well by dual decoupling as by polar
          unfolding, it is clear as the reciprocal desire of the
          insulated atoms, in other words affinity, plays
          instantaneously, - it is in the final analysis with-statement
          the invincible tendency in an initial state of inertia,
          perpetual consequence of constant strength breaking activates
          passive inertia in a state of quietude. Also with the
          rhomboid-solenoid each impulse of comparable nature is put it
          fatally moving in two directions opposed, according to unequal
          tendencies causing the rupture of balance, - the rings of this
          rupture, or starting points of this contrary walk in two
          opposed directions, being fixed as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Axial impulses towards the axis: 1/3 of the
          distance;</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Axial impulses towards P: 2/3 of the distance.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">Peripheral impulses towards P: 4/7 of the
          distance; As fig. 8 indicates it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">As an indication, the respective functions of
          the atoms of the Aether, like organic or vital creative
          forces, are indicated very summarily, by the statement of the
          substances procreate, on the diagram of the fig. 9. As it is
          known as higher, the means of induction could be as well
          current magnetic already preexistent. The importance of such a
          fact is very large, because peripheral or zenith flow light is
          released, accumulated everywhere in enormous quantity,
          everywhere where there are shocks and unspecified porous body:
          air blast, falls of water of stopping, movement of wheel or
          turbine of mills, undulation of waves or movement of the tide,
          grinding on a grinding stone, etc, - as it is easy to see it,
          from the marvellous capacity of the "fascine fascinatrice", of
          the collecting "faggot". These wood light can be divided into
          two categories:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. Those which simply tend to attract light
          peripheral flow, such those already quoted; 2. Those which
          tend to attract it and to monopolize it (to accumulate or
          store). Such are those containing of sodium in an organic
          state: "Capparides", "Frankeniaces", "Salsolaces". In the same
          way for those very rich in potassium: gorses, etc. The
          distinction is important for the case where one only aims at
          helping induction on suitable drivers. Thus on driver prepared
          like aforesaid, discontinuous if one wants to draw aside the
          current dionic, who tends to follow his own flow of tension
          (that tends to also follow the electric flow), this one is
          started as of the moment of the contact with the light
          collectors: faggots of gorses to the bottom of some fall of
          water, protective mantelet of boards of the wheel of a mill,
          wood raft on the waves, moyette of orache out of tree,
          Atriplex halimus L, shack of caper plant, Capparis spinosa L,
          on a rock in the medium of the spray. It is force moving,
          easily collected, without any mechanical apparatus, but being
          able to transform itself into mechanical movement. It can act
          just as it is like chemical energy. It can create field of
          force, magnetoelectric inductor, by a device of form
          rhomboÃ¯de similar to those described. It still can, in this
          field of force creates, to increase, by multiplying it,
          Aetheric energy, by simple parallel juxtaposition of a second
          driver in chain intended for the amplified coating, isolated
          from the inductor by partition of parchemia: what gives to the
          unit (inductive and induced) the appearance of the partitioned
          pod of the astragale. - whose divine art of ancient
          architecture, with the spine roughcasting its prickles,
          decorated the twisted column opened out in Aetheric volutes,
          between which the ritual sheet of acanthus is spread out,
          whose natural petiole shows in half-compartment triple device
          of induction: large line of the inductor, double helical line
          of the armatures. It is with this energy accumulated into
          enormous volumes on small islands, reefs, shelves or outcrops
          friable, clashing violently by recohÃ©sion sudden, which
          produces the relaxation, with equal volume of inflow
          atmospheric in tension electric, that it is necessary without
          any doubt to allot the astonishing sudden detonations that one
          hears of time to other with broad maritime trimmings with not
          very dense, and named emergences "Barizel-gun" (gun of
          Barigel). Such are also the causes of the sudden hurricanes.
          Thus the stupid use of the "radiotelegraphic" waves,
          disconcerting without trÃ¨ve the Ãther of the Earth's
          atmosphere of which it upsets calms necessary by continual and
          frightening settings in breaking stress, by ruining the order
          even seasons necessary to the vegetable life, threatens until
          N its existence the life of humanity. All this study relates
          to the field of force rhomboÃ¯de taken out of cut, illustrated
          by qoppa (Q). Same results and same demonstrations with the
          study in plan, according to the figure of pi (P). Indeed if
          gold wire are embroidered or one covers with bractÃ©es of the
          same metal rectangular a leather panel of the shape, formed of
          cut out bands and imbricating one the other in order to form
          degrees of staircase, but calculated so that the point
          criticizes R/2 is well exactly with the two jambs of P, it is
          easy to see, according to the plan of the fig. 10, that
          peripheral flow, here side flow, tending to rock in horizontal
          cross under the effect of the tension by the shock, to go up
          to the zenith, compared to the vertical impulse of the axis
          which the maximum of this tension will be exactly with the
          angles of incidence indicated by the cross highlighted: what
          precisely makes this panel the quartered ecu of the heraldic
          blazon. On this gold staircase, covered with a cover, slightly
          tilted on the vertical line, attracting the monades Aether
          which run up against it, the field of force is laid out
          according to limits' fixed by carefully calculated surface,
          with a solution of continuity by light rising of the gold
          tablecloth, which forms two small vaults finishing in fork
          with two acute angles, to the two angles of lower incidence of
          crossed ecu.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">1. As it is between the fork of each small
          vault that the rupture of the monades occurs, whose atoms leap
          on the points of each fork, that is to say to go towards the
          axis and to go down with nadir, that is to say to go towards
          the side edges and to go up to the zenith, an electrical
          current results from it, which leaves on driver between the
          southern one the southern axis and side one rocked going to
          boreal side rocked on this southern of the axis, like
          iniquitous the photographic reproduction, deposited to be used
          for the intelligence of description and corresponding to the
          fig. 10. (All this group will be explained besides, in good
          time, in its more meticulous details). One sees now why any
          record player is slowly discharged from its load electric,
          anywhere it is. The electrophorus, on which come to run up
          against the monades in perpetual movement, plays the part of
          the thÃªseion above, laying out a new induction to with it and
          invisible, - as these crowned objects: gold hilastÃ¨re of the

          including/understanding it it "Christian" Constantin: in hoc +
          vinces.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">What completes to show moreover that the "cross
          of Oerstedt" is actually not an electromagnetic cross, but an
          only magnetic cross, the holy cross essentially, as the
          diagram of the fig. 11 the highlight, - the electrical current
          being here (and as always besides) only one inductor which
          creates a field of force. And as the side magnetic flux always
          tends to the cross compared to the axial one, limits extreme
          its deviation, is an angle of 90Â°, it follows that the
          magnetized needle can only tend to the cross compared to the
          current, without it being possible for him never to be put in
          cross, since, taken between the two southern ones and the two
          boreal ones of the field of force created, the extreme limit
          of its possible deviation can be only 45 degrees.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The phenomenon which the fig. 11 explains is
          thus the same one, exactly, except the inversion of the poles,
          which that, natural, from the fig. 2b, - according to which,
          knowing the deviation of the needle of the compass compared to
          the poles of axis of the ground, one could calculate the exact
          position of the transverse branch of his "magnetic cross",
          which varies, one sees it, according to a play of rocker,
          according to the power of the tension.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The perpetual motion is thus shown: the
          perpetual motion fluidic, likely to create the perpetual
          motion fluidic, likely to create the mechanical perpetual
          motion, - and not the reverse, as it is of use, without major
          reflexion, to consider the problem.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">And here shown that the cause of the movement
          is the clash chaotic, is in the jump by jerks; that the
          continuous motion is in oneself impossible, can be only one
          nonsense. Not being able to be without to be discontinuous,
          its continuous aspect is only one vain appearance. That of the
          human heart, eminently discontinuous, jerked, irregular and
          slow, is the typical example. This movement creates the life,
          and the life is only one continuation of bumps. And it is thus
          in truth that are opposed:For the sterile electric purpose,

          frigoric power; With nothing of carbon the sovereignty of the
          Aether; With the factitious straight line the curved arc and
          the zigzag; With the madnesses the speed reason of slowness;
          Health with the fever, and life with death. The present
          addition thus completes to show the intrinsic nature of the
          field of force. - It first of all shows the intimate
          difference of the two forces in duel which make it up: that of
          the axis, ponderable, according to the law of gravity,
          plunging towards nadir it; and that, imponderable, of the
          periphery, going up towards the zenith, - of which atomic
          flows, by the stretching of their circular layers, or by the
          between-shocks in their jumps of progression, have a
          particular tension; radiation vibratory called palladic for
          axial, the and dianique one for the periphery, - two forces
          coupled in a force first, which is trine in power, of which
          uncoupling by the shock and the clash causes the vibratory
          effect called electric. It shows then the means of easily the

          collect them and to put them moving on matters of the three
          "reigns" (mineral, vegetable, animal), as well as the flows of
          their effects of tension. It shows finally how to separate
          them between them as well as their effects of vibratory
          tension or rays their atomic shocks, by discontinuous ways of
          stopped drivers, - proving as well as the jump and the jerk is
          the law of the movement, creator of the life. On these

          ends: physics, chemical or mechanical, can from now on be

          others could be it. But these others, whatever they are, even
          these currently of use (dynamo, magnetoelectric), and whatever
          their goals, depend all from now on, without being able to
          withdraw itself from it, of these major data which reveal the
          admirable one and complex mystery of the eternal Aether: clash
          of its monades to the shock of their atoms, whose jumps
          hopping in their spiral dance make an immortal round.<br>

      Mr. Louis Boutard, residing in Algeria (Province of Alger)<br>
      <br>
      Requested the 12th of November 1926 at 8:30 am , in Alger.<br>
      Delivered the 28th of August 1928  Published March 25 1929.<br>
      <br>
      (Certificate of addendum of which the delivery has been adjourned
      in execution of article 11$7&nbsp; of the Law of July 5, 1844
      modified by the Law of April 7, 1902)<br>
      <br>
      The prior French patent n. 591.115 of November 12, 1924 and n.
      630.832 of November 12, 1925 show that the magnetic force field is
      made up of the a monad of Aether-classical element (individual
      unit or infinite units) placed at a stress tension by the
      collision, bang or abrupt movement, outside of all intrinsic,
      efficient causes attributable to metals or other bodies known as
      magnetic showing a component or antagonism of opposing fluid
      forces, equally bi-polar, which tend to cross forcing a solenoid,
      of which the rhomboid permits&nbsp; us only access at all stress
      points lateral as well as longitudinal and breaking it of an
      equilibrium.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Speaking of these same principles the study goes into depth about
      the rhomboid-solenoid of the narrow band of zinc, holding place of
      the battery/fuel cell leads to the same demonstrations that it
      entirely reveals all the complex mystery of the force field, with
      consequences, which are&nbsp; the corollary of it. <br>
      <br>
      The critical point of the soldering of which the breaking point of
      the two opposing fluid forces in their antagonistic magnetism is
      precisely a circle R/2 formerly figured as in section by the
      schema qoppa(Greek letter)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .became
      the letter Q(suppressed by the Cadmean alphabet for religious
      reasons, deeming it too highly figurative) in the diagram by the
      schematic sign pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )which became the letter P,
      according to figure 1.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The critical point being the original source of the electric
      effect by magnetic tension, it suffices to cause this rupture by
      tension on each of monad producing an electrical charge, arming
      the small bent ends, magnetic conductors the two circles of
      tension(sugg. Valence rings) , south and north to critical point
      R/4 (sic) <br>
      <br>
      The monads, hung up without ending on the south and north crowns
      are broken by the collision and separate into two types of atoms:
      those belonging to the axis and the others to the peripherie- at
      the same time an electrical current is produced, passing along the
      copper wire as on the other fuel cells/batteries.<br>
      The monads, hung without resting on the southernand northern
      crowns, are broken by the collision and
      separatesiteselfintoatomsof two sorts:those belonging to the axis
      or core, and the others belonging tothe peripheralor valance ring-
      at the same timeas an electrical current is produced, passing
      along the copper wireasin the other fuel cells.<br>
      Yet, if it is placed suspended below this fuel
      cellsolen--rhomboide, a heavy minerla weight which isnot
      metallic,such as a non-porous stone, the large electrical surge is
      noted. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The flowof the axis, following the attraction of the
      weights,precipitating there from itself, madeupof the heavy atom
      of split atom in pure(distilled) &nbsp;water from the large terra
      cotta vessel/beakerwhere this fuel cellis submerged. And, in
      effect, one can gatherit there placing it in contact with this
      heavy stone,with the smallest weight of mercury at the bottom of
      the glass tube in which a conductor of fine gold is lowered(or
      simply gilded silver:isolated unde rthe the wool that this
      conductor is a continuous chain formed of a crimped golden wire,
      or to the contrary discontinued, forming a chaplet of golden seeds
      or of buttons of gilded silver wires on fiber or woolen wire. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the other end of the conductor, plunged in a test tube of
      distilled water and without a circuit there, nor a closure
      whatsoever, these heavy atoms arrive slowly by bonds forming a
      cluster of bubbles(oxygen and hydrogen from the analysis of the
      water) on the precious metal, on which the carbon monoxide and the
      the carbon gas is reduced discoloring the metal sheen untilit
      blackens.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This reduction is quicker still if the test tube holds lime/rain
      water instead of distilled water, the bucket playing the role of
      the constant provider of these carbonic gases drawn from the
      atmosphere.&nbsp; To get rid of the lime/rain bucket there is only
      to filter it drop by drop on&nbsp;a very fine sand and bury it
      deeply.&nbsp; This need be done just once and it is done.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the same time: the peripheral flow, the light atom freed from
      the heavy atom, ascends by the pores,in skipping to the ledge of
      the terra cotta vessel, where it is joined by another different
      metal conductor and less heavy than that described above (brass,
      tin or aluminum) discontinued or continued in the same conditions
      of that of the axis flow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can also decelerate it on the ring itself of the vessel, one
      drains the weight of two nails of soft iron dippedin the prior
      until the rusting at the surface of the water of the vessel of the
      fuel cell.&nbsp; Under the influenceof the flow all of the rim
      thus effected changes to a purple red: fuel stain that can be
      gathered when it is dried.&nbsp; If the effect of the oxide is
      made on the exterior under the rim of the vessel, the staining
      fuel material which is produced is golden yellow- a tint which
      fades to a pale yellow slowly that one lower the keys/buttons to
      the lower level of the crown of the fuel cell, armed only with
      this.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results are recorded if one places the conductor on the
      string of corks(oak cork, ivy wood,etc.) floating on the surface
      of the perimeter/circumference of the vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results still occur if the conductor is plugged in to the
      crown of dried iron sticks, Ferula communis L., (Common iron in
      Latin-pig iron in layman's terms) placed like molding on the high
      rim of the vessel, without contact with the water.&nbsp; This
      explains why in Mediterranean countries one places on the neck of
      a breast-feeding cat of whom the kittens have been drown, and
      which dies quickly if it is not allowed to nurse- a small collar
      of corks- which attracts and stops in passing the cerebral
      sinus/sinews of the mammary glands, by the discharge of the flows
      of hairs/ the light, peripheral flow, creator at the expense of
      the glycose, the lactic mucus as willbe shown elsewhere.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      From where the Latin word for cork: s-uber literally "with mammary
      glands/breasts"&nbsp; and no cat dies despite scientific winks and
      smiles. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This explains in the same way the astonishing phenomena of the
      oxidized catalysis due to the porous platinum, and only in this
      porous state or divided (foam or sponge) On the magnetized metal,
      the most eminent conductor, the ethereal multitude of monads
      collide in vibrating tension. On the platinum sponge which darkens
      the peripheral flux accumulator, ceaseless, and unstoppable
      generator of organic acids.&nbsp; This astonishing phenomena is
      therefore,&nbsp;solely magnetic, the platinum acting only by its
      presence like the other metals in the magnetic&nbsp;force field.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The difference of weight between the heavy stone and the light
      porous wood has, therefore, the ability of
      quartering/splitting/shattering and the separation in&nbsp; two
      atomic elements of the&nbsp; of the displaced monad by the
      collision of these points of contact. Of which the name of
      A-volume section of Alpha, the letter A, being the schematic sign
      of the monad of Aether&nbsp;(split by tension), like the
      historical watch of this learned letter- and not
      "indivisible"&nbsp;in opposition to reason or
      nonsensical,impossible fiction that to see held as the material
      foundation by certain scientifism.&nbsp; This which reveals the
      nature of the monads: an axial and bi-polar flux, which suddenly
      freed froma peripheral flux which surrounds everything.&nbsp; to
      move faster in vertical axipetal circles in an accelerated free
      fall toward a point nadir(point zero), word for word "from that
      which goes down" from berber language, borrowed by Arabic ader :
      to go low or descend"- like the peripheral flux, equally bi-polar,
      rises in axi-fugal circles toward the zenith/ horizon, literally
      "with the freed/liberated" from berber, borrowed to Arabic by the
      intervention of Spanish: c-énit ( with the accent of the first
      syllable). From where the equilibrium of the monad in a neutral
      state in the ocean of monads, named "empty" which is the ocean of
      Aether, the imponderable zenith force making an even balance with
      the ponder able zero point force(nadir) which it holds in
      suspension&nbsp;/stasis until the splitting impact.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For this reason it is the winding into a funnel which is
      necessarily the best.&nbsp; It is the heart shape which is
      required&nbsp; to perpetuate the movement.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      l28&nbsp; The electrical flow always being best if the
      electro-carbon is pushed under the bottom of the fuel cell near
      the suspended stone, it follows that this fluid current, simple
      effect of the magnetic tension present to to its unmatching and
      matching ring (even and uneven rings) R/2 or qoppa-pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) following the
      removal of this ring, which is the cause of this tension effect;
      and that in consequence, the flux of the&nbsp;breakaway (or
      valance) ring follows the law of the axi&nbsp; itself, that of the
      weight; if it is found near the nadir (zero point) in
      dextragyneous movement(clockwise rotation)<br>
      The results of which the diagram 2a showing <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1) The uncoupling in lateral tension freeing one from the other,of
      the two magnetic fluxes from the axis and the periphery.<br>
      2) The respective splitting by longitudinal tension north and
      south each of these two radical (ions)&nbsp; once freed, become
      unipolar - I-O, I'-O';<br>
      3) is reduced in the normal case of the two radical/free flows in
      respect to each other, but not polar splitting asin figure 2b.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The kind that, the movement of the southern movement brings it to
      that of the two others.&nbsp; <br>
      1)The axis flux bipolar -I', reduced to the movement of that of
      left to right is dextrogyneous.<br>
      2)That of the periphery is equally bipolar -O' reduced to a
      movement: that from right to left (counterclockwise) is sinestral.
      <br>
      (The double"Cross of Lorraine" at unequal cross points reduced to
      a simple cross.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is useless to undertake a scientific study without having this
      figure imprinted in our memories.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      And yet, the experiment demonstrates that if the flow of
      electrical current follows the jump from its valence ring
      which&nbsp;follows&nbsp; the axis law, that of the weight moving
      dextrogeneously, this flow of electrical current can never attain
      to neutralize the axial and zero point(nadir) which can result and
      build up, without release at the same time as the electrical
      fluid, on the same heavy body, electrical metal conductor, for
      example.&nbsp; This which is applied, but without knowing why, in
      the force field which is the accumulator.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If this said heavy body is other than the metal conductor, or if
      it doesn't exist, the electrical tension flow tends always to
      follow the path until its movement, which very slowly lets it
      reach the other zenith flux from the periphery which it always
      reaches.&nbsp; And it is for this reason that an electrical
      current(to keep this name presently in use, although it is very
      vague) accompanied by and and always in a lesser or greater
      proportion of the zenithal influx from the periphery or outer
      ring.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can easily see by means of an ordinary "fuel cell" of which
      the pores out of use, no longer stop for the chemical work of the
      saline/salt said to be "depolarizing". The mild peripheral flu,
      which leaps in the electrical stream that it tends to
      nullify&nbsp; and of which the violent somersaults are so abrupt
      and rapid that the needle of the voltmeter leaps in a disorderly
      fashion like the heart of a sickly feverish man.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is certainly, therefore, the leader of the famous salt/rock
      climbers" who climbs by the coals, overflowing the rim of the fuel
      cell vessels not insulated with paraffin wax, in order to follow
      stubbornly the current- tending to nullify, at least in
      appearance, but more exactly to modify it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The evidence is the same if with this old fuel cell or that above
      described , one connects the positive ove, even without shutting
      down the circuit or the rhombus of induction previously
      described.&nbsp; The copper conductor, electrical inductor, albeit
      continued or&nbsp;discontinued( whether turned on or off) , the
      magnetic induction on each of the sections, discontinued or
      continued, is produced normally. <br>
      &nbsp;It follows from there that these are the magnetic fluids
      .which conduct the flow of their electric tension.<br>
      &nbsp;Consequentially, in all magnetic force fields the largest
      diameter of a heavy weight (like the iron, for example for its
      powerful effects) determine the limit of the magnetic axis, of
      which the flux is absorbed by the weight of the mass itself, the
      angular surface makes up the inner surface on which the vibrating
      tension is produced, if one surrounds it with a light , and above
      all, porous casing: wood, terra cotta, dry bone - which will
      absorb the peripheral flux and of which it will define the
      boundary of the radius.&nbsp; A veritable wedge of wood placed
      beside a wedge of iron and of an equal force which exactly doubles
      the stress of the tension achieving the complete separation of
      these two forces of Aether in the interval left between the heavy
      axis and the light casing.&nbsp; Simple steel&nbsp;gun in a reed
      tube.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Application of the "Recovery/Correction " of an electrical current
      called alternative.&nbsp; Such a current really contains different
      sections turning inversely, of which some ( counterclockwise
      forces on the southern tip pull the others (northerly clockwise
      forces) whereas the latter can only become engines(self-propelled)
      while propelling themselves, in displacement the southerly
      electrical sections driven by the southerly peripheral&nbsp; in
      counterclockwise motion.&nbsp; Figure 3 indicates the design of
      it.<br>
      &nbsp;One can either correct it as it is or split in two the
      copper conductor. "Recovery/Correction" therefore means to
      transmit a directional movement and of the ame direction.&nbsp; By
      a destined necessity this direction must be counterclockwise,
      because it is the counterclockwise bipolarity of the periphery
      which through the dry reed tube escaping from the hold of the
      electron ring of the force field created, will cling to the
      passage of the&nbsp; inductive electrical current to correct it,
      transmitting its own unique direction&nbsp; in counterclockwise
      motion.&nbsp; This which is efficiency if the wire of the inductor
      and the recovered current in the crossing of the force field is
      also the zenith magnetic conductor, meaning if it contains,
      for&nbsp; example, zinc, tin, aluminum, albeit plated or alloy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the corrective or recovery currents which are
      the creators of the recovery force field.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The brass wrapping, under a permeable envelope at the magnetic
      influx (linen or hemp, etc) is done counter<br>
      clockwise at the reed cane, beginning at the bottom end, the entry
      point of the current, or created on the southerly tip.&nbsp; The
      wood rod must be vertical, so as to facilitate the continual flow
      from the axis to point zero(nadir) from the bottom of the&nbsp;
      sharpened steel point.&nbsp; On image #4, the corrective inductive
      winding is intentionally used next to the force field of the tube
      (instead of being wrapped around) so as to better illustrate the
      detail of what is happening.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The energy effort of the tension bi-magnetic in the void left
      between the wood and the steel and created there a closed circular
      electron ring, a resistance transforming to heat&nbsp;-a device
      with a comparable effect of that of a shoe jamming on a wheel by a
      sole or a wooden skate on the iron rim.<br>
      &nbsp;This heat, which can be intense, following the intensity of
      the field can harm the caliber/steel temper&nbsp;of the fusillade
      used, it is possible by itself to correct its abnormalities, by
      making it absorb two layers of insulation: saturate in flaxseed
      oil&nbsp;on the steel fusillade, eraser and resin powder with
      the&nbsp;flaxseed oil&nbsp;filling the gap.&nbsp; So as the heat
      rises the resins which absorb it tend to melt and harden, and the
      soot hardens to cement.<br>
      &nbsp;It is the same thing which occurs in the "recoveries"
      presently in use,&nbsp;as that the "cohesives" for the Hertz wave(
      an iron tube filled with iron fillings, fragment of galenics,
      gelatin gums, etc) which are only, as one can see, the
      "correctors" of the current. In the phial of mercury, the
      corrective current instead of being on the exterior (as it should
      also be&nbsp; on the phial strainer)&nbsp; penetrates to the
      interior, on mercury steam creating there a force field, of which
      the axial detaches by the attraction of the mercury where it gains
      velocity followed by, but without a neutralizing effect, by the
      circular electron ring of the force field, under the influence of
      which the mercury begins to gyrate in a clockwise motion, the
      result heat (consuming itself) to make it evaporate,- while the
      mild peripheral flux, attracted by the glass of the phial and the
      light steam of the vaporous mercury, taking hold violently of the
      inductive corrective current, that is to say, leading and pulling
      it along in a conducive, directional flow counterclockwise. <br>

      This hollowed out rod which is no other than the Hellenistic and
      mythical dolôn). [(1) A weapon consisting of a long staff with a
      short iron point ]like the rose of Isis which is only, at length
      the religious "fascis"[A bundle carried by lictors before the
      highest magistrates, consisting of rods and an axe, with which
      criminals were scourged and beheaded.]of Flamen dialis

      hawthorn, all wrapped up with conductive straps fasciae' of a

      not only the symbol, but the ideal organism of absolute
      disunion/fission.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But the circular electronic ring of the created force field, lost
      in the creation of heat, can otherwise be gathered&nbsp;or
      induced, and enter into a translatory movement (a locomotion
      movement) provided that it be driven because there can only be an
      electronic flow if there is a magnetic flow present, and an
      electric flow is a defined direction if there is at the same time
      a magnetic flow traveling obliquely with the other, that is it
      pulls it along and guides it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The device amplified- Use either a steel pivot,&nbsp; always&nbsp;
      with sharp angles over with a grooved inner surface, pointed at
      the two ends, for access on the circular crowns of the magnetic
      bi-polar axis - and curved&nbsp; in an arch shape with the sole
      purpose of raising the tension, on the lateral as well as on the
      longitudinal, exciting the mutual affinity of the southerly and
      northerly axis, in reciprocal attraction...<br>

      The inductor, at the same time electro-magnetic, is composed of a
      thin wire (of pure copper) and grooved in helix form, around which
      is wrapped the counterclockwise helix, but without any contact,
      the conductor of the light peripheral magnetic inductor, driver of
      the electrical inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      These various conductors of magnetic inductors are narrow bands of
      leather: carrying and isolating an interrupted, discontinued,
      series, either of hooked tips or of metallic granules(button- or
      pearl-shaped) angular or grooved of various kinds, also of varying
      weights, for both the axial and peripheral influx and&nbsp; their
      paired ring:<br>
      a. Gold hooks, gold-plated silver, an alloy of gold and a fifth of
      silver, an amalgam of mercury with gold or silver, etc.&nbsp; or
      identical grains, for the axial bands and of the valence ring on
      the perimeter of pi(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) on which the grains
      or chips of iron can be used:<br>
      b. Hooks of brass, bronze, aluminized copper, or granules
      (hollowed pearls) identical for the influx bands on the periphery.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Indeed, if these conductive series are not interrupted forming a
      continuous line, the electrical flow of the created force field
      flows the influx there; on the perimeter of qoppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) the alternative of
      the split which is the cause of the electrical effect and in the
      induction on the periphery of the light zenith- and nothing passes
      along the wire of the electric inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The progressions by leaps&nbsp; of the magnetic atoms could not be
      compared to vibrating jumps of the grasshopper (genus: Elator)
      nicknamed still "beaver" and also "Marshall blacksmith" because
      its quivering sound that it produces when jumping, is compared to
      that of a hammer hitting an anvil "perilous jumps" well-studied
      and described by naturalists.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Above the inductor-wrapped from left to right, are
      electro-magnetic inductors, arranged as described above, wound
      from right to left, the two ends, south and north&nbsp;remaining
      free.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Finally, the whole thing is wrapped with a binding as tight as
      possible of long and flexible reed blades, of which the best(
      besides wicker, of wolf bane or holly wood, Daphne enidium, L.,
      the green leaves of the fig etc, for straps of great strength) can
      be of many varieties:<br>
      &nbsp;Mountain gramona, Smilax aspera L,<br>
      Butcher's Broom, &nbsp;Ruscus aculeatus L,<br>
      Old man's beard , clematis vitalba L, etc<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      the details of each piece of this device are given in Figure n.
      5.&nbsp; They are others, besides, except in a vertical order that
      are given by the second column from the left of the great screen
      with four columns of which the semantic signs explain the winding
      of the four arcs which surround like a necklace the high,
      &nbsp;grooved neck&nbsp; of the divine&nbsp;strong "Ram", of the
      "Ram" inductor, of which the rotational movement of the neck is
      admirable depicted by the powerful artist who sculpted the
      prodigious figure on the granite wall of the temple of Ammon, like
      the cliché reproduction illustrated in figure n. 5.- (As for the
      semantic signs of the&nbsp; three other columns, which speak for
      themselves, they are now easy to understand.&nbsp; Explained in
      detail, achieved by experience/ experimentation, they will be
      divulged at the opportune moment, when the key will be given, or
      moreover, discovered, the schematic signs which are the
      alphabet&nbsp; itself of the great, universal ritual language
      known under the classic name of Kuriologic language, birthplace of
      our profane languages and of their written signs or alphabetic
      letters.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the lateral tension,&nbsp;stretched in a
      perpendicular direction, which is fundamental.&nbsp; Because it is
      that the provokes the fission, to the critical point and&nbsp;
      principal, R/2, and the wide opening of the force field of Aether,
      producing the double electric effect.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is still the tension which provokes the stretching between each
      of the&nbsp;rings of the magnetic axial flux,&nbsp; as well as
      between each of the&nbsp;rings of the peripheral flux, producing
      effects deemed "parasitical" taken for "electrical" and confused
      together, of which they are radically different, as they differ
      one from the other, physically as well as chemically.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There be three effects of the tension:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1. The effect of the critical tension of the circle R/2 is the
      Electrical effect, from the name Elec-tryon ou Electron,
      mythological generator of Electra= Alcmena, "wife" of Amphi-tryon,
      and undoubtedly "mother" of Herculean force;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      2. The effect of the tension between&nbsp; each of the peripheral
      flux rings is the Dionic Effect, from the name Dione ,-"mother" of
      Aphrodite Epitragia :&nbsp;&nbsp;she who &nbsp;follows the
      mystic&nbsp; "Goat":<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      3. The effect of the tension between each of the axial flux rings
      is the Palladic Effect, from the sacred name of Pallus =
      "Vibrating by collision"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pallus optiletis: its
      pure light being phosphorescent like that of a glow worm; Athena
      glaukopis: to whom phosphorus <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is clear that the electro-magnetic, as straight as arched, can
      by its required system supply only electrical tension as well, by
      its uni-polar and bi-polar discharges or flows from the two flux
      of the axis and the peripheral as well as by that of the tension
      ring, but without any separation or analytic isolation in the
      infinite variety of each of its influc; of which those different
      properties according to the orbit of rings of their own
      tensions.&nbsp; This can only be achieved by the rhomboids.<br>
      <br>
      It is agreed, before continuing, that it must be understood that
      the inductor or the electro-magnetic diono-pallidic induction
      method, a cause of such colllisions: wind, running water, movement
      or eruption, rockslides, blows on metals, drums or tamboutines,
      etc. can accelerate the natural movement of the monads of Aether.
      If one takes a preference, as well as the method of induction, an
      electricalcurrent or a magnetic one, already pre-existing, it is
      solely the most convenient method to have a constant collision
      caused by these ignited forces but nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      It must be therefore, an electrical current as a method of
      induction. But to simplify things, the exposed will be reduced
      only with the tension at the critical point of R/2 showing how to
      separate them in the inductors, the magnetic flow of the electric
      current or the contrary, how to reunite them- the same devices can
      be employed for the separation/ fission or for the joining/
      fusion&nbsp; processes in the peripheral inductors: from the
      magnetic flow and of the effect of tension or ionic flow -in the
      axial inductors: in the magnetic flow and of its effect of tension
      or paladin flow.<br>
      <br>
      To increase the extent of the tension on this middle point of the
      bi-fluid breakdown instead of limiting this ring to a theoretic
      circular line, it is suitable to cut low on the pole, the
      southerly one for example, the heavy wood rhomboid serving as the
      mold to the perimeter of this ring stretching it as far as one
      will, even to and beyond the neutral line between southerly and
      northerly points and from the southern point.<br>
      <br>
      The other pole will be reduced to a hemispheric cap or nose cone
      or into a cone which can be truncate, forming a "Club-head" and of
      which the greatest diameter will be given R- like a + b of Figure
      # 6.<br>
      Finally to be uniform in length from one end to the other, the
      electrical inductor (thick, pure copper wire, grooved in helix
      form) will hold in helix-form- 5 pieces of magnetic winding, but
      each of these forming an uninterrupted, discontinuous line:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st piece, wrapped counterclockwise, from
      the axis of the southerly point, made of gold hooks,
      silver-plate,etc.. on a narrow band of leather folded underneath
      another strip to avoid contact with the copper wire(electrical
      inductor) on which it is wound.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd piece, wound clockwise, for koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )
      northerly point, made of the same hooks of gold, gold-plate,
      silver or amalgam, iron and lead, with the same strips of leather.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rdpiece, wrapped counterclockwise, for
      the northerly and southerly periphery and not folded:&nbsp; of
      small hooks of tin, bronze, etc. with the same strips of leather.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th piece, wound clockwise for koppa
      pi&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) southern point (
      like the 2nd piece).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th piece, clockwise, for the southerly
      point axis (like the 1st piece).<br>
      <br>
      This winding with hooked points is, therefore, exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;
      like the one used for the narrow zinc band serving as the
      rhomb-solenoid fuel cell.<br>
      <br>
      In this state, the five pieces function separately conducting the
      magnetic flow bustling along the atoms jumping from one point or
      from one granule to the other: the ones from the axis jumping with
      greater velocity than the ones from the periphery, separated by
      the fluids of their own tension: electrical, ionic, paladin, which
      can follow along a conductor without continuous solution and
      obliquely in respect to their causes of tension.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Iron nails embedded in the pivot serving as a mold between the
      spires of the winding, increasing the potential by
      supersaturation.<br>
      <br>
      Above the winding, surrounded, like always by a clissage as thick
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      It can be imagined what could be the frequency multiplied
      infinitely by these cards&nbsp; and these graters,&nbsp; of which
      the length can be excessive, at the hooked points or uncountable
      granules.<br>
      <br>
      To make the magnetic atoms flow along the same conductors by the
      fluids/flows of their tension or of their collisions: electrical,
      ionic, paladin and it suffices to insert it between the leather:
      at the base of the hooks or granules, in contact with them, a
      soutache or a conductive border continuing from the same metal.<br>
      <br>
      And in the case studied, the segments 2 and 4 must be reunited by
      the interior passage or the segment 2 advances along the southerly
      tip, so that there is a driven electrical current in the same flow
      with the alternative flux of koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) reduced to a single, predominant
      southerly movement in a clockwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      It is this pseudo-sexual, energized coupling which constitutes the
      Herakleie bia (Gr.) or Herculean Force, who in this state is a
      di-/ des- oxidant which can create the hydrocarbons.&nbsp; And in
      this case, the electrical flow tending to be parallel to the
      inductive line- the 2 bonds of segments 2 and 4, instead of being
      rolled into a spire, can be folded and hemmed stimulating/
      engainant&nbsp; the inductor.<br>
      <br>
      But to the contrary to gather separately the fluidic effects of
      the tension: electrical, ionic, paladin it is imperative that
      there is no contact between the continued metallic wire of their
      conductors and the discontinuous chaplets /chains of magnetic
      atoms- whose continuous wires can be:<br>
      - pure copper for the electric<br>
      -pure silver for the ionic<br>
      -and pure gold for the palludic inductor, so that the hooks&nbsp;
      or metallic granules of the discontinuous conductors of magnetic
      atoms can be replaced:<br>
      <br>
      For the peripheral, by the small, hollow pearls (glass or false
      stones) or porous marbles of iais-ferauli- seeds emptied of their
      grains: fruits spiked with hay Onobrichis capit-galli Lam.,
      Onobrichis satira Lam. ( esparcette).&nbsp; nuts emptied of
      micocoules Celtis australis, pierced nuts of azerderach, Melia
      azerdarach.<br>
      of merises , Cerasus avium DC - small, empty snail shells, aquatic
      or terrestrial&nbsp; species, etc.<br>
      <br>
      For the axis, by the grains, full like that of the pepper plant,
      Piper Longum L., from gattilier Vitex Agnus-Castus&nbsp; L ( the
      chaste lamb), heavy nuts of the wild juju bier, Zizyphus lotus L.,
      etc. threaded with chaplets, with the intervals either on
      horsehair or on wool.<br>
      <br>
      Now to isolate the magnetic atoms one from the other at each
      circular revolution of their own tension in the purpose or end to
      use specific energy which is each its own, gifted each with a
      different quality, physical as well as chemical, it suffices to
      elongate such a circular ring of which one wants to obtain the
      energy, instead of limiting it to a theoretic circular line
      (figure 7)&nbsp; as it was already stated for the critical circle
      R/2/<br>
      <br>
      The number of these tensions, otherwise, known as the circular
      rings, can be considered infinite, but in practice as experiments
      show: it can be reduced to 3 on each axial pole and to 7 on each
      pole of the peripheral flux, as indicated (in figure 8).<br>
      And yet the induction as was already stated in the force field of
      Aether, is at 2 distinct times from the capital phrases:<br>
      1. That of the decoupler/ splitter by lateral tension freeing one
      from the other, the two forces of Aether.<br>
      2. That of the splitter by tension lengthwise from the southern to
      the northern tip for each of the decoupled flux.<br>
      <br>
      In this state of insulation, as well as duel splitting as by polar
      splitting, it is clear that the reciprocal pull of the insulated
      atom, otherwise known as affinity, begins to react instantly -
      that is to say finally that the invincible tendency to its initial
      state of inertia, perpetual consequence of constant resistance to
      the active rupture of the passive inertia in its state of rest.<br>
      <br>
      Also with the rhomb-solenoid each influx of the same nature begins
      to move (uncontrollably) in movement in two opposite directions,
      according to the unequal tendencies which provoke the rupture of
      equilibrium.- the rings of this rupture, or the starting points of
      this contrary operation in two opposite directions, being fixed as
      the following:<br>
      - axial influx toward the axis: 1/3 of the distance<br>
      - axial influx toward pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ): 2/3 of&nbsp; the
      distance<br>
      -peripheral influx toward&nbsp; the periphery: 3/7 of the distance<br>
      -peripheral influx toward pi(&nbsp;&nbsp; ) : 4/7 of the distance:<br>
      as indicated by figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated by the labels, the respective formulas of the atoms
      of Aether, like creative, organic forces, are indicated very
      summarily, by the announcement of the procreated substances on the
      schema Figure 9. As it had been stated above, the means of
      induction could also be an already existing magnetic current.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of such a fact is very great, because the
      peripheral flux or mild zenith effect is freed everywhere,
      accumulated in enormous quantity everywhere where there are
      collisions and whatever porous bodies: a breath of air, a
      waterfall from a dam, a wheel movement or from a mill turbine,
      movement of the waves or high tides or a grindstone motion etc. -
      so it is very easy&nbsp; that the incredible power of the&nbsp;
      fascinating wood" of the wood faggot collector.<br>
      <br>
      These light woods can be divided in 2 categories: <br>
      1) Those that tend to simply attract the mild peripheral flows,
      such as those mentioned.<br>
      2) Those which tend to attract&nbsp; and accumulate ( accumulate
      or collect) such are those containing some sodium in the organic
      state&nbsp; "Capparides"{shrub}Frankiniace {bacteria),
      Salssolacees{plant}."&nbsp; The same for those very rich in
      potassium, bands, etc. <br>
      The distinction is important for the case where it only helps the
      induction on the appropriate conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Thus on a prepared conductor, as said above, discontinued if one
      needs to separate the dionic current which tends to follow its
      own&nbsp; flux of tension ( which tends to follow the electric
      current.&nbsp; the latter begins to work the minute it comes into
      contact with the light collectors: filled/loaded with rings under
      a waterfall, coat of protective boards of the wheel of the mill,
      wooden raft on the waves, hub of the free shrub: atriplex halimus
      L., hut of the caper bush: Capprier spinosa L. on a rock in the
      middle of sprays.<br>
      <br>
      It is the force in movement, easily gathered without any
      mechanical device, but being able to be transferred into a
      mechanical movement. It can act like a chemical energy. It can
      create a force field electro-magnetic inductor, by a device shaped
      like a rhomboid similar to those described. It can, also, in this
      created force field grow by multiplying it, the ethereal energy,
      by simple parallel juxtaposition of a second conductor in the form
      of a chaplet/ rosary destined to be an amplified inductor
      (induced) isolated from the inductor by partitions: this which
      gives to the whole (inductor and induced). the appearance of a
      partitioned pod/ clove of garlic-like with the gum tree - of which
      the divine art of antique architecture like the hedgehog with its
      quills decorated the tarsal columns radiating in ethereal arches/
      volutes, between which spread the ritual leaf of Acantle {an
      ornamental shrub} of which the natural leaf stem - demonstrate in
      the parabola the triple device of the induction, thick line of the
      inductor, double line in helix-form of the induced.<br>
      It is to this accumulated energy in enormous volumes of streams,
      reefs crumbling reefs, detonating violently, by sudden recohesion,
      which produces the trigger with equal volume of the atmospheric
      axial flux in electrical tension, that it is necessary without any
      doubt attribute the sudden stunning detonations that one hears
      from time to time at large (from the Mantinea area) at sea, at few
      infrequent sightings and named BARIZEL-GUN (Gun of Barizel) such
      are also the stupid use of radiotelegraphic waves troubling
      without respite the Aether of the terrestrial atmosphere of which
      it overwhelms the necessary calm by continuous or intensification
      placed in tension of the breaking point/ collision ruining the
      same order of the seasons necessary to vegetative life:
      threatening even by its existence, human life.<br>
      This whole study is relative to the rhomboid force field taken in
      section configured as qoppa (&nbsp;&nbsp; ).&nbsp; Same results
      and the same demonstrates with the study in&nbsp; the blue print,
      according to the figure pi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      ).<br>
      In effect if one sews with golden thread or one covers with little
      flowers of the same metal in leather panels in rectangular form,
      formed by cut strips and&nbsp;&nbsp; overlap/interlink in a way to
      form the degree of a stair pattern, but calculated so that the
      critical point R/? (unclear) (probably R/2) be exactly the length
      of the two legs of pi (&nbsp; ), it is easy to see according to
      the diagram figure 10 that the peripheral flux, have the lateral
      flux, tending to change forms into a horizontal cross under the
      effect of the effect of the tension of the collision, to go up
      toward the zenith, compared to the vertical influx of the axis
      which descends to point zero(nadir), it is easy to see that the
      maximum of this tension will be exactly at the incident angles by
      the raised cross; this which makes this screen the ecu/crown
      separated from the heraldic coat of arms.<br>
      On this golden stairway, covered with CORER(meaning obscure-
      possibly "copper" appearing more to be "vines"}, lightly inclined
      on the vertical line attracting the monads of Aether, which hit
      each other, the force field forms along the fixed limits by the
      carefully calculated surface, with a solution of continuity by
      lightly raising the cloth of gold, which forms two small archways
      or voutes ending in a fork with two sharp angles, with two&nbsp;
      incidental angles below the cross of the crown.<br>
      Since it is between the fork of each of the small arches where the
      rupture of the monads takes place, of which the atoms leap off the
      tines of each fork, to either go toward the axis and descend to
      point zero (nadir) or go to the lateral edges and rise to the
      zenith, an electrical current results from it, which leaves on the
      conductor between the southernly or lower part of the axis and the
      unbalanced lateral part going toward the norhernly point on the
      southern section of the axis as indicated by the photgraphic
      reproduction, submitted to serve as visual reproduction and
      corresponding to figure 10. <br>
      (This entire group will be explained elsewhere, at a more
      opportune time in its minute details.&nbsp; One can see now why
      any electrophore slowly discharged of its electrical charge no
      matter where it is located.&nbsp; The electrophore, on which the
      monads in constant motion had just collided, plays a signification
      role of "these on" above, arranging a new and invisible induction
      there - like these sacred objects, golden HILASTRE of the arch( of
      pure and massive gold): the induction&nbsp; creating there a
      function of the weight of gold high priest reasoning (that is to
      say "rational" word-for word&nbsp; calculated) augural
      cantabrum&nbsp;&nbsp; and pagan labarum which lightens
      /reduces/relaxes without understanding if the Christain
      Constantine {Emperor of the fourth century known for embracing
      christianity}&lt;in hoc + vinces&gt; L.&nbsp; This which succeeds
      in showing the in addition that the &lt;Cross of Oerstedt&gt;,{The
      oersted is defined as 1000/4p (79.5774715) ampere per meter, in
      terms of SI units.} this cross is in fact not an electromagnetic
      cross but a magnetic cross, the holy cross, in essence, as
      demonstrated in the illustration&nbsp; figure 11- the electric
      current being here ( and as always everywhere else) only an
      inductor which creates a magnetic force.&nbsp; And like the
      lateral, magnetic flux extends to the cross by way of the axis,
      the extreme limit of its deviation, either an angle of 90 degrees
      it follows that the magnetized needle can only stretch to the
      cross in relation to the current, without it being possible to
      ever be placed in&nbsp; the form of a cross, since taken between
      the two southerly and the two northerly points of the force field
      created, the extreme limit of its possible deviation can only be
      45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomena that explains figure 11 is therefore the same,
      exactly, except the reversal of the poles that that one natural of
      figure 2b- according to which, knowing the deviation of the
      compass needle in relation to the axial pole of the earth, one
      could calculate the exact position of the transversal branch of
      its " magnetic cross' which varies, one sees it, according to a
      set of transfers in function of the force of the tension.<br>
      The constant motion is therefore demonstrated; the constant
      fluidic movement, likely to create the constant mechanical
      movement,- not<br>
      the inverse, thus it is of use without deep reflexion, to
      consider/ envisage the problem. So it has been shown that the
      cause of the motion is chaotic collision, is in the leaps of jerky
      motions: that the continuous movement is in itself impossible; it
      can only be nonsensical chaos.&nbsp; Without being discontinuous
      its continuous aspect is only a futile appearance. That of the
      human heart, eminently discontinued, jerky, irregular and slow is
      only a serious of jolts.<br>
      And it thus in truth that they oppose each other:<br>
      -sterile electricity, and the largest creative magnetic issue;<br>
      -caloric energy and frigonic energy<br>
      -the void of carbon and the sovereignty of Aether<br>
      -the straight factice and both the curve and the zigzag<br>
      -the follies of speed and the wisdom of slowness<br>
      -a healthy man and a sick one<br>
      -life and death<br>

      Summary<br>
      <br>
      The addendum herein presented succeeds in showing the intrinsic
      nature of the force field.<br>
      It shows firstly the intimate difference of the two opposing force
      of which it is comprised; that of the axis ponder able, following
      the laws of weight, plunging to point zero(nadir) and that one,
      the imponderable of the periphery rising toward the zenith - of
      which the atomic fluxes by stretching the circular layers/sections
      or by the inter-collisions in their progressive leaps; have a
      particular tension-; vibrating radiation denoted palladic for the
      axial and the dionic for the peripheral - two joined forces in a
      single force which triples in power; of which the splitting by
      collision causes the vibratory effect known as electric.<br>
      It shows then the means of easily splitting by a heavy pivot and a
      light surrounding ring; then that of gathering them and of placing
      them in motion on materials of three realms( mineral, vegetable,
      and animal) thus the flows of their effects of tension.<br>
      <br>
      It shows finally how to separate them from each other thus from
      their effects of tension or vibrating radiation of their atomic
      collisions, by discontinued channels of interrupted conductors -
      thus proving that the jump and the jerky movement, creator of
      life.<br>
      Based on the complete facts, numerous devices for unnamable ends;
      physical, chemical and mechanical; can from then on, be
      constructed/ built.&nbsp; Only the typical ones are described
      herein.&nbsp; The others could be.&nbsp; But these others,
      whatever they are even those actually in use (dynamo,
      magno-electric) and whatever their purpose, all depend from now on
      without being able to escape to it, from these major factors which
      reveal the admirable and complex mystery of the Aether; from the
      collision of monads and the collision of their atoms, of which the
      skipping jumps in their spiral movements do an eternal, circular
      dance.<br>

      Mr. Louis Boutard, residing in Algeria (Province of Alger)<br>
      <br>
      Requested the 12th of November 1926 at 8:30 am , in Alger.<br>
      Delivered the 28th of August 1928  Published March 25 1929.<br>
      <br>
      (Certificate of addendum of which the delivery has been adjourned
      in execution of article 11$7&nbsp; of the Law of July 5, 1844
      modified by the Law of April 7, 1902)<br>
      <br>
      The prior French patent n. 591.115 of November 12, 1924 and n.
      630.832 of November 12, 1925 show that the magnetic force field is
      made up of the a monad of Aether-classical element (individual
      unit or infinite units) placed at a stress tension by the
      collision, bang or abrupt movement, outside of all intrinsic,
      efficient causes attributable to metals or other bodies known as
      magnetic showing a component or antagonism of opposing fluid
      forces, equally bi-polar, which tend to cross forcing a solenoid,
      of which the rhomboid permits&nbsp; us only access at all stress
      points lateral as well as longitudinal and breaking it of an
      equilibrium.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Speaking of these same principles the study goes into depth about
      the rhomboid-solenoid of the narrow band of zinc, holding place of
      the battery/fuel cell leads to the same demonstrations that it
      entirely reveals all the complex mystery of the force field, with
      consequences, which are&nbsp; the corollary of it. <br>
      <br>
      The critical point of the soldering of which the breaking point of
      the two opposing fluid forces in their antagonistic magnetism is
      precisely a circle R/2 formerly figured as in section by the
      schema qoppa(Greek letter)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .became
      the letter Q(suppressed by the Cadmean alphabet for religious
      reasons, deeming it too highly figurative) in the diagram by the
      schematic sign pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )which became the letter P,
      according to figure 1.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The critical point being the original source of the electric
      effect by magnetic tension, it suffices to cause this rupture by
      tension on each of monad producing an electrical charge, arming
      the small bent ends, magnetic conductors the two circles of
      tension(sugg. Valence rings) , south and north to critical point
      R/4 (sic) <br>
      <br>
      The monads, hung up without ending on the south and north crowns
      are broken by the collision and separate into two types of atoms:
      those belonging to the axis and the others to the peripherie- at
      the same time an electrical current is produced, passing along the
      copper wire as on the other fuel cells/batteries.<br>
      The monads, hung without resting on the southernand northern
      crowns, are broken by the collision and
      separatesiteselfintoatomsof two sorts:those belonging to the axis
      or core, and the others belonging tothe peripheralor valance ring-
      at the same timeas an electrical current is produced, passing
      along the copper wireasin the other fuel cells.<br>
      Yet, if it is placed suspended below this fuel
      cellsolen--rhomboide, a heavy minerla weight which isnot
      metallic,such as a non-porous stone, the large electrical surge is
      noted. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The flowof the axis, following the attraction of the
      weights,precipitating there from itself, madeupof the heavy atom
      of split atom in pure(distilled) &nbsp;water from the large terra
      cotta vessel/beakerwhere this fuel cellis submerged. And, in
      effect, one can gatherit there placing it in contact with this
      heavy stone,with the smallest weight of mercury at the bottom of
      the glass tube in which a conductor of fine gold is lowered(or
      simply gilded silver:isolated unde rthe the wool that this
      conductor is a continuous chain formed of a crimped golden wire,
      or to the contrary discontinued, forming a chaplet of golden seeds
      or of buttons of gilded silver wires on fiber or woolen wire. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the other end of the conductor, plunged in a test tube of
      distilled water and without a circuit there, nor a closure
      whatsoever, these heavy atoms arrive slowly by bonds forming a
      cluster of bubbles(oxygen and hydrogen from the analysis of the
      water) on the precious metal, on which the carbon monoxide and the
      the carbon gas is reduced discoloring the metal sheen untilit
      blackens.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This reduction is quicker still if the test tube holds lime/rain
      water instead of distilled water, the bucket playing the role of
      the constant provider of these carbonic gases drawn from the
      atmosphere.&nbsp; To get rid of the lime/rain bucket there is only
      to filter it drop by drop on&nbsp;a very fine sand and bury it
      deeply.&nbsp; This need be done just once and it is done.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the same time: the peripheral flow, the light atom freed from
      the heavy atom, ascends by the pores,in skipping to the ledge of
      the terra cotta vessel, where it is joined by another different
      metal conductor and less heavy than that described above (brass,
      tin or aluminum) discontinued or continued in the same conditions
      of that of the axis flow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can also decelerate it on the ring itself of the vessel, one
      drains the weight of two nails of soft iron dippedin the prior
      until the rusting at the surface of the water of the vessel of the
      fuel cell.&nbsp; Under the influenceof the flow all of the rim
      thus effected changes to a purple red: fuel stain that can be
      gathered when it is dried.&nbsp; If the effect of the oxide is
      made on the exterior under the rim of the vessel, the staining
      fuel material which is produced is golden yellow- a tint which
      fades to a pale yellow slowly that one lower the keys/buttons to
      the lower level of the crown of the fuel cell, armed only with
      this.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results are recorded if one places the conductor on the
      string of corks(oak cork, ivy wood,etc.) floating on the surface
      of the perimeter/circumference of the vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results still occur if the conductor is plugged in to the
      crown of dried iron sticks, Ferula communis L., (Common iron in
      Latin-pig iron in layman's terms) placed like molding on the high
      rim of the vessel, without contact with the water.&nbsp; This
      explains why in Mediterranean countries one places on the neck of
      a breast-feeding cat of whom the kittens have been drown, and
      which dies quickly if it is not allowed to nurse- a small collar
      of corks- which attracts and stops in passing the cerebral
      sinus/sinews of the mammary glands, by the discharge of the flows
      of hairs/ the light, peripheral flow, creator at the expense of
      the glycose, the lactic mucus as willbe shown elsewhere.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      From where the Latin word for cork: s-uber literally "with mammary
      glands/breasts"&nbsp; and no cat dies despite scientific winks and
      smiles. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This explains in the same way the astonishing phenomena of the
      oxidized catalysis due to the porous platinum, and only in this
      porous state or divided (foam or sponge) On the magnetized metal,
      the most eminent conductor, the ethereal multitude of monads
      collide in vibrating tension. On the platinum sponge which darkens
      the peripheral flux accumulator, ceaseless, and unstoppable
      generator of organic acids.&nbsp; This astonishing phenomena is
      therefore,&nbsp;solely magnetic, the platinum acting only by its
      presence like the other metals in the magnetic&nbsp;force field.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The difference of weight between the heavy stone and the light
      porous wood has, therefore, the ability of
      quartering/splitting/shattering and the separation in&nbsp; two
      atomic elements of the&nbsp; of the displaced monad by the
      collision of these points of contact. Of which the name of
      A-volume section of Alpha, the letter A, being the schematic sign
      of the monad of Aether&nbsp;(split by tension), like the
      historical watch of this learned letter- and not
      "indivisible"&nbsp;in opposition to reason or
      nonsensical,impossible fiction that to see held as the material
      foundation by certain scientifism.&nbsp; This which reveals the
      nature of the monads: an axial and bi-polar flux, which suddenly
      freed froma peripheral flux which surrounds everything.&nbsp; to
      move faster in vertical axipetal circles in an accelerated free
      fall toward a point nadir(point zero), word for word "from that
      which goes down" from berber language, borrowed by Arabic ader :
      to go low or descend"- like the peripheral flux, equally bi-polar,
      rises in axi-fugal circles toward the zenith/ horizon, literally
      "with the freed/liberated" from berber, borrowed to Arabic by the
      intervention of Spanish: c-énit ( with the accent of the first
      syllable). From where the equilibrium of the monad in a neutral
      state in the ocean of monads, named "empty" which is the ocean of
      Aether, the imponderable zenith force making an even balance with
      the ponder able zero point force(nadir) which it holds in
      suspension&nbsp;/stasis until the splitting impact.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For this reason it is the winding into a funnel which is
      necessarily the best.&nbsp; It is the heart shape which is
      required&nbsp; to perpetuate the movement.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      l28&nbsp; The electrical flow always being best if the
      electro-carbon is pushed under the bottom of the fuel cell near
      the suspended stone, it follows that this fluid current, simple
      effect of the magnetic tension present to to its unmatching and
      matching ring (even and uneven rings) R/2 or qoppa-pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) following the
      removal of this ring, which is the cause of this tension effect;
      and that in consequence, the flux of the&nbsp;breakaway (or
      valance) ring follows the law of the axi&nbsp; itself, that of the
      weight; if it is found near the nadir (zero point) in
      dextragyneous movement(clockwise rotation)<br>
      The results of which the diagram 2a showing <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1) The uncoupling in lateral tension freeing one from the other,of
      the two magnetic fluxes from the axis and the periphery.<br>
      2) The respective splitting by longitudinal tension north and
      south each of these two radical (ions)&nbsp; once freed, become
      unipolar - I-O, I'-O';<br>
      3) is reduced in the normal case of the two radical/free flows in
      respect to each other, but not polar splitting asin figure 2b.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The kind that, the movement of the southern movement brings it to
      that of the two others.&nbsp; <br>
      1)The axis flux bipolar -I', reduced to the movement of that of
      left to right is dextrogyneous.<br>
      2)That of the periphery is equally bipolar -O' reduced to a
      movement: that from right to left (counterclockwise) is sinestral.
      <br>
      (The double"Cross of Lorraine" at unequal cross points reduced to
      a simple cross.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is useless to undertake a scientific study without having this
      figure imprinted in our memories.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      And yet, the experiment demonstrates that if the flow of
      electrical current follows the jump from its valence ring
      which&nbsp;follows&nbsp; the axis law, that of the weight moving
      dextrogeneously, this flow of electrical current can never attain
      to neutralize the axial and zero point(nadir) which can result and
      build up, without release at the same time as the electrical
      fluid, on the same heavy body, electrical metal conductor, for
      example.&nbsp; This which is applied, but without knowing why, in
      the force field which is the accumulator.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If this said heavy body is other than the metal conductor, or if
      it doesn't exist, the electrical tension flow tends always to
      follow the path until its movement, which very slowly lets it
      reach the other zenith flux from the periphery which it always
      reaches.&nbsp; And it is for this reason that an electrical
      current(to keep this name presently in use, although it is very
      vague) accompanied by and and always in a lesser or greater
      proportion of the zenithal influx from the periphery or outer
      ring.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can easily see by means of an ordinary "fuel cell" of which
      the pores out of use, no longer stop for the chemical work of the
      saline/salt said to be "depolarizing". The mild peripheral flu,
      which leaps in the electrical stream that it tends to
      nullify&nbsp; and of which the violent somersaults are so abrupt
      and rapid that the needle of the voltmeter leaps in a disorderly
      fashion like the heart of a sickly feverish man.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is certainly, therefore, the leader of the famous salt/rock
      climbers" who climbs by the coals, overflowing the rim of the fuel
      cell vessels not insulated with paraffin wax, in order to follow
      stubbornly the current- tending to nullify, at least in
      appearance, but more exactly to modify it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The evidence is the same if with this old fuel cell or that above
      described , one connects the positive ove, even without shutting
      down the circuit or the rhombus of induction previously
      described.&nbsp; The copper conductor, electrical inductor, albeit
      continued or&nbsp;discontinued( whether turned on or off) , the
      magnetic induction on each of the sections, discontinued or
      continued, is produced normally. <br>
      &nbsp;It follows from there that these are the magnetic fluids
      .which conduct the flow of their electric tension.<br>
      &nbsp;Consequentially, in all magnetic force fields the largest
      diameter of a heavy weight (like the iron, for example for its
      powerful effects) determine the limit of the magnetic axis, of
      which the flux is absorbed by the weight of the mass itself, the
      angular surface makes up the inner surface on which the vibrating
      tension is produced, if one surrounds it with a light , and above
      all, porous casing: wood, terra cotta, dry bone - which will
      absorb the peripheral flux and of which it will define the
      boundary of the radius.&nbsp; A veritable wedge of wood placed
      beside a wedge of iron and of an equal force which exactly doubles
      the stress of the tension achieving the complete separation of
      these two forces of Aether in the interval left between the heavy
      axis and the light casing.&nbsp; Simple steel&nbsp;gun in a reed
      tube.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Application of the "Recovery/Correction " of an electrical current
      called alternative.&nbsp; Such a current really contains different
      sections turning inversely, of which some ( counterclockwise
      forces on the southern tip pull the others (northerly clockwise
      forces) whereas the latter can only become engines(self-propelled)
      while propelling themselves, in displacement the southerly
      electrical sections driven by the southerly peripheral&nbsp; in
      counterclockwise motion.&nbsp; Figure 3 indicates the design of
      it.<br>
      &nbsp;One can either correct it as it is or split in two the
      copper conductor. "Recovery/Correction" therefore means to
      transmit a directional movement and of the ame direction.&nbsp; By
      a destined necessity this direction must be counterclockwise,
      because it is the counterclockwise bipolarity of the periphery
      which through the dry reed tube escaping from the hold of the
      electron ring of the force field created, will cling to the
      passage of the&nbsp; inductive electrical current to correct it,
      transmitting its own unique direction&nbsp; in counterclockwise
      motion.&nbsp; This which is efficiency if the wire of the inductor
      and the recovered current in the crossing of the force field is
      also the zenith magnetic conductor, meaning if it contains,
      for&nbsp; example, zinc, tin, aluminum, albeit plated or alloy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the corrective or recovery currents which are
      the creators of the recovery force field.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The brass wrapping, under a permeable envelope at the magnetic
      influx (linen or hemp, etc) is done counter<br>
      clockwise at the reed cane, beginning at the bottom end, the entry
      point of the current, or created on the southerly tip.&nbsp; The
      wood rod must be vertical, so as to facilitate the continual flow
      from the axis to point zero(nadir) from the bottom of the&nbsp;
      sharpened steel point.&nbsp; On image #4, the corrective inductive
      winding is intentionally used next to the force field of the tube
      (instead of being wrapped around) so as to better illustrate the
      detail of what is happening.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The energy effort of the tension bi-magnetic in the void left
      between the wood and the steel and created there a closed circular
      electron ring, a resistance transforming to heat&nbsp;-a device
      with a comparable effect of that of a shoe jamming on a wheel by a
      sole or a wooden skate on the iron rim.<br>
      &nbsp;This heat, which can be intense, following the intensity of
      the field can harm the caliber/steel temper&nbsp;of the fusillade
      used, it is possible by itself to correct its abnormalities, by
      making it absorb two layers of insulation: saturate in flaxseed
      oil&nbsp;on the steel fusillade, eraser and resin powder with
      the&nbsp;flaxseed oil&nbsp;filling the gap.&nbsp; So as the heat
      rises the resins which absorb it tend to melt and harden, and the
      soot hardens to cement.<br>
      &nbsp;It is the same thing which occurs in the "recoveries"
      presently in use,&nbsp;as that the "cohesives" for the Hertz wave(
      an iron tube filled with iron fillings, fragment of galenics,
      gelatin gums, etc) which are only, as one can see, the
      "correctors" of the current. In the phial of mercury, the
      corrective current instead of being on the exterior (as it should
      also be&nbsp; on the phial strainer)&nbsp; penetrates to the
      interior, on mercury steam creating there a force field, of which
      the axial detaches by the attraction of the mercury where it gains
      velocity followed by, but without a neutralizing effect, by the
      circular electron ring of the force field, under the influence of
      which the mercury begins to gyrate in a clockwise motion, the
      result heat (consuming itself) to make it evaporate,- while the
      mild peripheral flux, attracted by the glass of the phial and the
      light steam of the vaporous mercury, taking hold violently of the
      inductive corrective current, that is to say, leading and pulling
      it along in a conducive, directional flow counterclockwise. <br>

      mythical dolôn). [(1) A weapon consisting of a long staff with a
      short iron point ]like the rose of Isis which is only, at length
      the religious "fascis"[A bundle carried by lictors before the
      highest magistrates, consisting of rods and an axe, with which
      criminals were scourged and beheaded.]of Flamen dialis

      not only the symbol, but the ideal organism of absolute
      disunion/fission.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But the circular electronic ring of the created force field, lost
      in the creation of heat, can otherwise be gathered&nbsp;or
      induced, and enter into a translatory movement (a locomotion
      movement) provided that it be driven because there can only be an
      electronic flow if there is a magnetic flow present, and an
      electric flow is a defined direction if there is at the same time
      a magnetic flow traveling obliquely with the other, that is it
      pulls it along and guides it.<br>

      the two ends, for access on the circular crowns of the magnetic

      purpose of raising the tension, on the lateral as well as on the
      longitudinal, exciting the mutual affinity of the southerly and
      northerly axis, in reciprocal attraction...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1. A left or counterclockwise section for the northern tip.<br>
      2. A dextrose section(clockwise wound) on the splitting/fission
      wall which is made up of a steel pivot in its largest diameter.<br>
      3. And thirdly, a clockwise section, for the southerly tip.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The inductor, at the same time electro-magnetic, is composed of a
      thin wire (of pure copper) and grooved in helix form, around which
      is wrapped the counterclockwise helix, but without any contact,
      the conductor of the light peripheral magnetic inductor, driver of
      the electrical inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      These various conductors of magnetic inductors are narrow bands of
      leather: carrying and isolating an interrupted, discontinued,
      series, either of hooked tips or of metallic granules(button- or
      pearl-shaped) angular or grooved of various kinds, also of varying
      weights, for both the axial and peripheral influx and&nbsp; their
      paired ring:<br>
      <br>
      a. Gold hooks, gold-plated silver, an alloy of gold and a fifth of
      silver, an amalgam of mercury with gold or silver, etc.&nbsp; or
      identical grains, for the axial bands and of the valence ring on
      the perimeter of pi(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) on which the grains
      or chips of iron can be used:<br>
      <br>
      b. Hooks of brass, bronze, aluminized copper, or granules
      (hollowed pearls) identical for the influx bands on the periphery.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Indeed, if these conductive series are not interrupted forming a
      continuous line, the electrical flow of the created force field
      flows the influx there; on the perimeter of qoppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) the alternative of
      the split which is the cause of the electrical effect and in the
      induction on the periphery of the light zenith- and nothing passes
      along the wire of the electric inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The progressions by leaps&nbsp; of the magnetic atoms could not be
      compared to vibrating jumps of the grasshopper (genus: Elator)
      nicknamed still "beaver" and also "Marshall blacksmith" because
      its quivering sound that it produces when jumping, is compared to
      that of a hammer hitting an anvil "perilous jumps" well-studied
      and described by naturalists.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Above the inductor-wrapped from left to right, are
      electro-magnetic inductors, arranged as described above, wound
      from right to left, the two ends, south and north&nbsp;remaining
      free.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Finally, the whole thing is wrapped with a binding as tight as
      possible of long and flexible reed blades, of which the best(
      besides wicker, of wolf bane or holly wood, Daphne enidium, L.,
      the green leaves of the fig etc, for straps of great strength) can
      be of many varieties:&nbsp; Mountain gramona, Smilax aspera L,
      Butcher's Broom, &nbsp;Ruscus aculeatus L, Old man's beard ,
      clematis vitalba L, etc<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The details of each piece of this device are given in Figure n.
      5.&nbsp; They are others, besides, except in a vertical order that
      are given by the second column from the left of the great screen
      with four columns of which the semantic signs explain the winding
      of the four arcs which surround like a necklace the high,
      &nbsp;grooved neck&nbsp; of the divine&nbsp;strong "Ram", of the
      "Ram" inductor, of which the rotational movement of the neck is
      admirable depicted by the powerful artist who sculpted the
      prodigious figure on the granite wall of the temple of Ammon, like
      the cliché reproduction illustrated in figure n. 5.- (As for the
      semantic signs of the&nbsp; three other columns, which speak for
      themselves, they are now easy to understand.&nbsp; Explained in
      detail, achieved by experience/ experimentation, they will be
      divulged at the opportune moment, when the key will be given, or
      moreover, discovered, the schematic signs which are the
      alphabet&nbsp; itself of the great, universal ritual language
      known under the classic name of Kuriologic language, birthplace of
      our profane languages and of their written signs or alphabetic
      letters.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the lateral tension,&nbsp;stretched in a
      perpendicular direction, which is fundamental.&nbsp; Because it is
      that the provokes the fission, to the critical point and&nbsp;
      principal, R/2, and the wide opening of the force field of Aether,
      producing the double electric effect.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is still the tension which provokes the stretching between each
      of the&nbsp;rings of the magnetic axial flux,&nbsp; as well as
      between each of the&nbsp;rings of the peripheral flux, producing
      effects deemed "parasitical" taken for "electrical" and confused
      together, of which they are radically different, as they differ
      one from the other, physically as well as chemically.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There be three effects of the tension:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1. The effect of the critical tension of the circle R/2 is the
      Electrical effect, from the name Elec-tryon ou Electron,
      mythological generator of Electra= Alcmena, "wife" of Amphitryon,
      and undoubtedly "mother" of Herculean force;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      2. The effect of the tension between&nbsp; each of the peripheral
      flux rings is the Dionic Effect, from the name Dione , "mother" of
      Aphrodite Epitragia :&nbsp;&nbsp;she who &nbsp;follows the mystic
      "Goat":<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      3. The effect of the tension between each of the axial flux rings
      is the Palladic Effect, from the sacred name of Pallus =
      "Vibrating by collision"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pallus optiletis: its
      pure light being phosphorescent like that of a glow worm; Athena
      glaukopis: to whom phosphorus <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is clear that the electro-magnetic, as straight as arched, can
      by its required system supply only electrical tension as well, by
      its uni-polar and bi-polar discharges or flows from the two flux
      of the axis and the peripheral as well as by that of the tension
      ring, but without any separation or analytic isolation in the
      infinite variety of each of its influc; of which those different
      properties according to the orbit of rings of their own
      tensions.&nbsp; This can only be achieved by the rhomboids.<br>
      <br>
      It is agreed, before continuing, that it must be understood that
      the inductor or the electro-magnetic diono-pallidic induction
      method, a cause of such colllisions: wind, running water, movement
      or eruption, rockslides, blows on metals, drums or tamboutines,
      etc. can accelerate the natural movement of the monads of Aether.
      If one takes a preference, as well as the method of induction, an
      electricalcurrent or a magnetic one, already pre-existing, it is
      solely the most convenient method to have a constant collision
      caused by these ignited forces but nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      It must be therefore, an electrical current as a method of
      induction. But to simplify things, the exposed will be reduced
      only with the tension at the critical point of R/2 showing how to
      separate them in the inductors, the magnetic flow of the electric
      current or the contrary, how to reunite them- the same devices can
      be employed for the separation/ fission or for the joining/
      fusion&nbsp; processes in the peripheral inductors: from the
      magnetic flow and of the effect of tension or ionic flow -in the
      axial inductors: in the magnetic flow and of its effect of tension
      or paladin flow.<br>
      <br>
      To increase the extent of the tension on this middle point of the
      bi-fluid breakdown instead of limiting this ring to a theoretic
      circular line, it is suitable to cut low on the pole, the
      southerly one for example, the heavy wood rhomboid serving as the
      mold to the perimeter of this ring stretching it as far as one
      will, even to and beyond the neutral line between southerly and
      northerly points and from the southern point.<br>
      <br>
      The other pole will be reduced to a hemispheric cap or nose cone
      or into a cone which can be truncate, forming a "Club-head" and of
      which the greatest diameter will be given R- like a + b of Figure
      # 6.<br>
      <br>
      Finally to be uniform in length from one end to the other, the
      electrical inductor (thick, pure copper wire, grooved in helix
      form) will hold in helix-form- 5 pieces of magnetic winding, but
      each of these forming an uninterrupted, discontinuous line:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st piece, wrapped counterclockwise, from
      the axis of the southerly point, made of gold hooks,
      silver-plate,etc.. on a narrow band of leather folded underneath
      another strip to avoid contact with the copper wire(electrical
      inductor) on which it is wound.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd piece, wound clockwise, for koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )
      northerly point, made of the same hooks of gold, gold-plate,
      silver or amalgam, iron and lead, with the same strips of leather.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rdpiece, wrapped counterclockwise, for
      the northerly and southerly periphery and not folded:&nbsp; of
      small hooks of tin, bronze, etc. with the same strips of leather.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th piece, wound clockwise for koppa
      pi&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) southern point (
      like the 2nd piece).<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th piece, clockwise, for the southerly
      point axis (like the 1st piece).<br>
      <br>
      This winding with hooked points is, therefore, exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;
      like the one used for the narrow zinc band serving as the
      rhomb-solenoid fuel cell.<br>
      <br>
      In this state, the five pieces function separately conducting the
      magnetic flow bustling along the atoms jumping from one point or
      from one granule to the other: the ones from the axis jumping with
      greater velocity than the ones from the periphery, separated by
      the fluids of their own tension: electrical, ionic, paladin, which
      can follow along a conductor without continuous solution and
      obliquely in respect to their causes of tension.<br>
      <br>
      Iron nails embedded in the pivot serving as a mold between the
      spires of the winding, increasing the potential by
      supersaturation.<br>
      <br>
      Above the winding, surrounded, like always by a clissage as thick
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      It can be imagined what could be the frequency multiplied
      infinitely by these cards&nbsp; and these graters,&nbsp; of which
      the length can be excessive, at the hooked points or uncountable
      granules.<br>
      <br>
      To make the magnetic atoms flow along the same conductors by the
      fluids/flows of their tension or of their collisions: electrical,
      ionic, paladin and it suffices to insert it between the leather:
      at the base of the hooks or granules, in contact with them, a
      soutache or a conductive border continuing from the same metal.<br>
      <br>
      And in the case studied, the segments 2 and 4 must be reunited by
      the interior passage or the segment 2 advances along the southerly
      tip, so that there is a driven electrical current in the same flow
      with the alternative flux of koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) reduced to a single, predominant
      southerly movement in a clockwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      It is this pseudo-sexual, energized coupling which constitutes the
      Herakleie bia (Gr.) or Herculean Force, who in this state is a
      di-/ des- oxidant which can create the hydrocarbons.&nbsp; And in
      this case, the electrical flow tending to be parallel to the
      inductive line- the 2 bonds of segments 2 and 4, instead of being
      rolled into a spire, can be folded and hemmed stimulating/
      engainant&nbsp; the inductor.<br>
      <br>
      But to the contrary to gather separately the fluidic effects of
      the tension: electrical, ionic, paladin it is imperative that
      there is no contact between the continued metallic wire of their
      conductors and the discontinuous chaplets /chains of magnetic
      atoms- whose continuous wires can be:<br>
      <br>
      - pure copper for the electric <br>
      <br>
      -pure silver for the ionic<br>
      <br>
      -and pure gold for the palludic inductor, so that the hooks&nbsp;
      or metallic granules of the discontinuous conductors of magnetic
      atoms can be replaced:<br>
      <br>
      For the peripheral, by the small, hollow pearls (glass or false
      stones) or porous marbles of iais-ferauli- seeds emptied of their
      grains: fruits spiked with hay Onobrichis capit-galli Lam.,
      Onobrichis satira Lam. ( esparcette).&nbsp; nuts emptied of
      micocoules Celtis australis, pierced nuts of azerderach, Melia
      azerdarach,of merises , Cerasus avium DC - small, empty snail
      shells, aquatic or terrestrial&nbsp; species, etc.<br>
      <br>
      For the axis, by the grains, full like that of the pepper plant,
      Piper Longum L., from gattilier Vitex Agnus-Castus&nbsp; L ( the
      chaste lamb), heavy nuts of the wild juju bier, Zizyphus lotus L.,
      etc. threaded with chaplets, with the intervals either on
      horsehair or on wool.<br>
      <br>
      Now to isolate the magnetic atoms one from the other at each
      circular revolution of their own tension in the purpose or end to
      use specific energy which is each its own, gifted each with a
      different quality, physical as well as chemical, it suffices to
      elongate such a circular ring of which one wants to obtain the
      energy, instead of limiting it to a theoretic circular line
      (figure 7)&nbsp; as it was already stated for the critical circle
      R/2/<br>
      <br>
      The number of these tensions, otherwise, known as the circular
      rings, can be considered infinite, but in practice as experiments
      show: it can be reduced to 3 on each axial pole and to 7 on each
      pole of the peripheral flux, as indicated (in figure 8).<br>
      And yet the induction as was already stated in the force field of
      Aether, is at 2 distinct times from the capital phrases:<br>
      <br>
      1. That of the decoupler/ splitter by lateral tension freeing one
      from the other, the two forces of Aether.<br>
      <br>
      2. That of the splitter by tension lengthwise from the southern to
      the northern tip for each of the decoupled flux.<br>
      <br>
      In this state of insulation, as well as duel splitting as by polar
      splitting, it is clear that the reciprocal pull of the insulated
      atom, otherwise known as affinity, begins to react instantly -
      that is to say finally that the invincible tendency to its initial
      state of inertia, perpetual consequence of constant resistance to
      the active rupture of the passive inertia in its state of rest.<br>
      <br>
      Also with the rhomb-solenoid each influx of the same nature begins
      to move (uncontrollably) in movement in two opposite directions,
      according to the unequal tendencies which provoke the rupture of
      equilibrium.- the rings of this rupture, or the starting points of
      this contrary operation in two opposite directions, being fixed as
      the following:<br>
      <br>
      - axial influx toward the axis: 1/3 of the distance<br>
      <br>
      - axial influx toward pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ): 2/3 of&nbsp; the
      distance<br>
      <br>
      -peripheral influx toward&nbsp; the periphery: 3/7 of the distance<br>
      <br>
      -peripheral influx toward pi(&nbsp;&nbsp; ) : 4/7 of the distance:
      as indicated by figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated by the labels, the respective formulas of the atoms
      of Aether, like creative, organic forces, are indicated very
      summarily, by the announcement of the procreated substances on the
      schema Figure 9. As it had been stated above, the means of
      induction could also be an already existing magnetic current.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of such a fact is very great, because the
      peripheral flux or mild zenith effect is freed everywhere,
      accumulated in enormous quantity everywhere where there are
      collisions and whatever porous bodies: a breath of air, a
      waterfall from a dam, a wheel movement or from a mill turbine,
      movement of the waves or high tides or a grindstone motion etc. -
      so it is very easy&nbsp; that the incredible power of the&nbsp;
      fascinating wood" of the wood faggot collector.<br>
      <br>
      These light woods can be divided in 2 categories: <br>
      <br>
      1) Those that tend to simply attract the mild peripheral flows,
      such as those mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      2) Those which tend to attract&nbsp; and accumulate ( accumulate
      or collect) such are those containing some sodium in the organic
      state : "Capparides" {shrub} Frankiniace {bacteria),
      Salssolacees{plant}. The same for those very rich in potassium,
      bands, etc. The distinction is important for the case where it
      only helps the induction on the appropriate conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Thus on a prepared conductor, as said above, discontinued if one
      needs to separate the dionic current which tends to follow its
      own&nbsp; flux of tension ( which tends to follow the electric
      current.&nbsp; the latter begins to work the minute it comes into
      contact with the light collectors: filled/loaded with rings under
      a waterfall, coat of protective boards of the wheel of the mill,
      wooden raft on the waves, hub of the free shrub: atriplex halimus
      L., hut of the caper bush: Capprier spinosa L. on a rock in the
      middle of sprays.<br>
      <br>
      It is the force in movement, easily gathered without any
      mechanical device, but being able to be transferred into a
      mechanical movement. It can act like a chemical energy. It can
      create a force field electro-magnetic inductor, by a device shaped
      like a rhomboid similar to those described. It can, also, in this
      created force field grow by multiplying it, the ethereal energy,
      by simple parallel juxtaposition of a second conductor in the form
      of a chaplet/ rosary destined to be an amplified inductor
      (induced) isolated from the inductor by partitions: this which
      gives to the whole (inductor and induced). the appearance of a
      partitioned pod/ clove of garlic-like with the gum tree - of which
      the divine art of antique architecture like the hedgehog with its
      quills decorated the tarsal columns radiating in ethereal arches/
      volutes, between which spread the ritual leaf of Acantle {an
      ornamental shrub} of which the natural leaf stem - demonstrate in
      the parabola the triple device of the induction, thick line of the
      inductor, double line in helix-form of the induced.<br>
      It is to this accumulated energy in enormous volumes of streams,
      reefs crumbling reefs, detonating violently, by sudden recohesion,
      which produces the trigger with equal volume of the atmospheric
      axial flux in electrical tension, that it is necessary without any
      doubt attribute the sudden stunning detonations that one hears
      from time to time at large (from the Mantinea area) at sea, at few
      infrequent sightings and named BARIZEL-GUN (Gun of Barizel) such
      are also the stupid use of radiotelegraphic waves troubling
      without respite the Aether of the terrestrial atmosphere of which
      it overwhelms the necessary calm by continuous or intensification
      placed in tension of the breaking point/ collision ruining the
      same order of the seasons necessary to vegetative life:
      threatening even by its existence, human life.<br>
      <br>
      This whole study is relative to the rhomboid force field taken in
      section configured as qoppa (&nbsp;&nbsp; ).&nbsp; Same results
      and the same demonstrates with the study in&nbsp; the blue print,
      according to the figure pi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      ).<br>
      <br>
      In effect if one sews with golden thread or one covers with little
      flowers of the same metal in leather panels in rectangular form,
      formed by cut strips and&nbsp;&nbsp; overlap/interlink in a way to
      form the degree of a stair pattern, but calculated so that the
      critical point R/? (unclear) (probably R/2) be exactly the length
      of the two legs of pi (&nbsp; ), it is easy to see according to
      the diagram figure 10 that the peripheral flux, have the lateral
      flux, tending to change forms into a horizontal cross under the
      effect of the effect of the tension of the collision, to go up
      toward the zenith, compared to the vertical influx of the axis
      which descends to point zero(nadir), it is easy to see that the
      maximum of this tension will be exactly at the incident angles by
      the raised cross; this which makes this screen the ecu/crown
      separated from the heraldic coat of arms.<br>
      <br>
      On this golden stairway, covered with CORER(meaning obscure-
      possibly "copper" appearing more to be "vines"}, lightly inclined
      on the vertical line attracting the monads of Aether, which hit
      each other, the force field forms along the fixed limits by the
      carefully calculated surface, with a solution of continuity by
      lightly raising the cloth of gold, which forms two small archways
      or voutes ending in a fork with two sharp angles, with two&nbsp;
      incidental angles below the cross of the crown.<br>
      <br>
      Since it is between the fork of each of the small arches where the
      rupture of the monads takes place, of which the atoms leap off the
      tines of each fork, to either go toward the axis and descend to
      point zero (nadir) or go to the lateral edges and rise to the
      zenith, an electrical current results from it, which leaves on the
      conductor between the southernly or lower part of the axis and the
      unbalanced lateral part going toward the norhernly point on the
      southern section of the axis as indicated by the photgraphic
      reproduction, submitted to serve as visual reproduction and
      corresponding to figure 10. <br>
      (This entire group will be explained elsewhere, at a more
      opportune time in its minute details.&nbsp; One can see now why
      any electrophore slowly discharged of its electrical charge no
      matter where it is located.&nbsp; The electrophore, on which the
      monads in constant motion had just collided, plays a signification
      role of "these on" above, arranging a new and invisible induction
      there - like these sacred objects, golden HILASTRE of the arch( of
      pure and massive gold): the induction&nbsp; creating there a
      function of the weight of gold high priest reasoning (that is to
      say "rational" word-for word&nbsp; calculated) augural
      cantabrum&nbsp;&nbsp; and pagan labarum which lightens

      in showing the in addition that the &lt;Cross of Oerstedt&gt;,
      {The oersted is defined as 1000/4p (79.5774715) ampere per meter,
      in terms of SI units.} this cross is in fact not an
      electromagnetic cross but a magnetic cross, the holy cross, in
      essence, as demonstrated in the illustration&nbsp; figure 11- the
      electric current being here ( and as always everywhere else) only
      an inductor which creates a magnetic force.&nbsp; And like the
      lateral, magnetic flux extends to the cross by way of the axis,
      the extreme limit of its deviation, either an angle of 90 degrees
      it follows that the magnetized needle can only stretch to the
      cross in relation to the current, without it being possible to
      ever be placed in&nbsp; the form of a cross, since taken between
      the two southerly and the two northerly points of the force field
      created, the extreme limit of its possible deviation can only be
      45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomena that explains figure 11 is therefore the same,
      exactly, except the reversal of the poles that that one natural of
      figure 2b- according to which, knowing the deviation of the
      compass needle in relation to the axial pole of the earth, one
      could calculate the exact position of the transversal branch of
      its " magnetic cross' which varies, one sees it, according to a
      set of transfers in function of the force of the tension.<br>
      <br>
      The constant motion is therefore demonstrated; the constant
      fluidic movement, likely to create the constant mechanical
      movement,- not<br>
      the inverse, thus it is of use without deep reflexion, to
      consider/ envisage the problem. So it has been shown that the
      cause of the motion is chaotic collision, is in the leaps of jerky
      motions: that the continuous movement is in itself impossible; it
      can only be nonsensical chaos.&nbsp; Without being discontinuous
      its continuous aspect is only a futile appearance. That of the
      human heart, eminently discontinued, jerky, irregular and slow is
      only a serious of jolts.<br>
      <br>
      And it thus in truth that they oppose each other:<br>
      <br>
      -sterile electricity, and the largest creative magnetic issue;<br>
      <br>
      -caloric energy and frigonic energy<br>

      Summary<br>
      <br>
      The addendum herein presented succeeds in showing the intrinsic
      nature of the force field.<br>
      <br>
      It shows firstly the intimate difference of the two opposing force
      of which it is comprised; that of the axis ponder able, following
      the laws of weight, plunging to point zero(nadir) and that one,
      the imponderable of the periphery rising toward the zenith - of
      which the atomic fluxes by stretching the circular layers/sections
      or by the inter-collisions in their progressive leaps; have a
      particular tension-; vibrating radiation denoted palladic for the
      axial and the dionic for the peripheral - two joined forces in a
      single force which triples in power; of which the splitting by
      collision causes the vibratory effect known as electric.<br>
      <br>
      It shows then the means of easily splitting by a heavy pivot and a
      light surrounding ring; then that of gathering them and of placing
      them in motion on materials of three realms( mineral, vegetable,
      and animal) thus the flows of their effects of tension.<br>
      <br>
      It shows finally how to separate them from each other thus from
      their effects of tension or vibrating radiation of their atomic
      collisions, by discontinued channels of interrupted conductors -
      thus proving that the jump and the jerky movement, creator of
      life.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the complete facts, numerous devices for unnamable ends;
      physical, chemical and mechanical; can from then on, be
      constructed/ built.&nbsp; Only the typical ones are described
      herein.&nbsp; The others could be.&nbsp; But these others,
      whatever they are even those actually in use (dynamo,
      magno-electric) and whatever their purpose, all depend from now on
      without being able to escape to it, from these major factors which
      reveal the admirable and complex mystery of the Aether; from the
      collision of monads and the collision of their atoms, of which the
      skipping jumps in their spiral movements do an eternal, circular
      dance.<br>

      Mr. Louis Boutard, residing in Algeria (Province of Alger)<br>

      Requested the 12th of November 1926 at 8:30 am , in Alger.<br>
      Delivered the 28th of August 1928  Published March 25 1929.<br>
      <br>
      (Certificate of addendum of which the delivery has been adjourned
      in execution of article 11$7&nbsp; of the Law of July 5, 1844
      modified by the Law of April 7, 1902)<br>
      <br>
      The prior French patent n. 591.115 of November 12, 1924 and n.
      630.832 of November 12, 1925 show that the magnetic force field is
      made up of the a monad of Aether-classical element (individual
      unit or infinite units) placed at a stress tension by the
      collision, bang or abrupt movement, outside of all intrinsic,
      efficient causes attributable to metals or other bodies known as
      magnetic showing a component or antagonism of opposing fluid
      forces, equally bi-polar, which tend to cross forcing a solenoid,
      of which the rhomboid permits&nbsp; us only access at all stress
      points lateral as well as longitudinal and breaking it of an
      equilibrium.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Speaking of these same principles the study goes into depth about
      the rhomboid-solenoid of the narrow band of zinc, holding place of
      the battery/fuel cell leads to the same demonstrations that it
      entirely reveals all the complex mystery of the force field, with
      consequences, which are&nbsp; the corollary of it. <br>
      <br>
      The critical point of the soldering of which the breaking point of
      the two opposing fluid forces in their antagonistic magnetism is
      precisely a circle R/2 formerly figured as in section by the
      schema qoppa(Greek letter)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .became
      the letter Q(suppressed by the Cadmean alphabet for religious
      reasons, deeming it too highly figurative) in the diagram by the
      schematic sign pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )which became the letter P,
      according to figure 1.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The critical point being the original source of the electric
      effect by magnetic tension, it suffices to cause this rupture by
      tension on each of monad producing an electrical charge, arming
      the small bent ends, magnetic conductors the two circles of
      tension(sugg. Valence rings) , south and north to critical point
      R/4 (sic) <br>
      <br>
      The monads, hung up without ending on the south and north crowns
      are broken by the collision and separate into two types of atoms:
      those belonging to the axis and the others to the peripherie- at
      the same time an electrical current is produced, passing along the
      copper wire as on the other fuel cells/batteries.<br>
      <br>
      The monads, hung without resting on the southernand northern
      crowns, are broken by the collision and
      separatesiteselfintoatomsof two sorts:those belonging to the axis
      or core, and the others belonging tothe peripheralor valance ring-
      at the same timeas an electrical current is produced, passing
      along the copper wireasin the other fuel cells.<br>
      <br>
      Yet, if it is placed suspended below this fuel
      cellsolen--rhomboide, a heavy minerla weight which isnot
      metallic,such as a non-porous stone, the large electrical surge is
      noted. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The flow of the axis, following the attraction of the weights,
      precipitating there from itself, made up of the heavy atom of
      split atom in pure (distilled) &nbsp;water from the large terra
      cotta vessel/beaker where this fuel cellis submerged. And, in
      effect, one can gather it there placing it in contact with this
      heavy stone, with the smallest weight of mercury at the bottom of
      the glass tube in which a conductor of fine gold is lowered (or
      simply gilded silver :isolated under the the wool that this
      conductor is a continuous chain formed of a crimped golden wire,
      or to the contrary discontinued, forming a chaplet of golden seeds
      or of buttons of gilded silver wires on fiber or woolen wire. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the other end of the conductor, plunged in a test tube of
      distilled water and without a circuit there, nor a closure
      whatsoever, these heavy atoms arrive slowly by bonds forming a
      cluster of bubbles (oxygen and hydrogen from the analysis of the
      water) on the precious metal, on which the carbon monoxide and the
      the carbon gas is reduced discoloring the metal sheen untilit
      blackens.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This reduction is quicker still if the test tube holds lime/rain
      water instead of distilled water, the bucket playing the role of
      the constant provider of these carbonic gases drawn from the
      atmosphere.&nbsp; To get rid of the lime/rain bucket there is only
      to filter it drop by drop on&nbsp;a very fine sand and bury it
      deeply.&nbsp; This need be done just once and it is done.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At the same time: the peripheral flow, the light atom freed from
      the heavy atom, ascends by the pores, in skipping to the ledge of
      the terra cotta vessel, where it is joined by another different
      metal conductor and less heavy than that described above (brass,
      tin or aluminum) discontinued or continued in the same conditions
      of that of the axis flow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can also decelerate it on the ring itself of the vessel, one
      drains the weight of two nails of soft iron dipped in the prior
      until the rusting at the surface of the water of the vessel of the
      fuel cell.&nbsp; Under the influenceof the flow all of the rim
      thus effected changes to a purple red: fuel stain that can be
      gathered when it is dried.&nbsp; If the effect of the oxide is
      made on the exterior under the rim of the vessel, the staining
      fuel material which is produced is golden yellow- a tint which
      fades to a pale yellow slowly that one lower the keys/buttons to
      the lower level of the crown of the fuel cell, armed only with
      this.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results are recorded if one places the conductor on the
      string of corks(oak cork, ivy wood,etc.) floating on the surface
      of the perimeter/circumference of the vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The same results still occur if the conductor is plugged in to the
      crown of dried iron sticks, Ferula communis L., (Common iron in
      Latin-pig iron in layman's terms) placed like molding on the high
      rim of the vessel, without contact with the water. This explains
      why in Mediterranean countries one places on the neck of a
      breast-feeding cat of whom the kittens have been drown, and which
      dies quickly if it is not allowed to nurse- a small collar of
      corks- which attracts and stops in passing the cerebral
      sinus/sinews of the mammary glands, by the discharge of the flows
      of hairs/ the light, peripheral flow, creator at the expense of
      the glycose, the lactic mucus as willbe shown elsewhere.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      From where the Latin word for cork: s-uber literally "with mammary
      glands/breasts"&nbsp; and no cat dies despite scientific winks and
      smiles. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This explains in the same way the astonishing phenomena of the
      oxidized catalysis due to the porous platinum, and only in this
      porous state or divided (foam or sponge) On the magnetized metal,
      the most eminent conductor, the ethereal multitude of monads
      collide in vibrating tension. On the platinum sponge which darkens
      the peripheral flux accumulator, ceaseless, and unstoppable
      generator of organic acids.&nbsp; This astonishing phenomena is
      therefore,&nbsp;solely magnetic, the platinum acting only by its
      presence like the other metals in the magnetic&nbsp;force field.<br>
      <br>
      The difference of weight between the heavy stone and the light
      porous wood has, therefore, the ability of
      quartering/splitting/shattering and the separation in&nbsp; two
      atomic elements of the&nbsp; of the displaced monad by the
      collision of these points of contact. Of which the name of
      A-volume section of Alpha, the letter A, being the schematic sign
      of the monad of Aether&nbsp;(split by tension), like the
      historical watch of this learned letter- and not
      "indivisible"&nbsp;in opposition to reason or
      nonsensical,impossible fiction that to see held as the material
      foundation by certain scientifism. This which reveals the nature
      of the monads: an axial and bi-polar flux, which suddenly freed
      froma peripheral flux which surrounds everything.&nbsp; to move
      faster in vertical axipetal circles in an accelerated free fall
      toward a point nadir(point zero), word for word "from that which
      goes down" from berber language, borrowed by Arabic ader : to go
      low or descend"- like the peripheral flux, equally bi-polar, rises
      in axi-fugal circles toward the zenith/ horizon, literally "with
      the freed/liberated" from berber, borrowed to Arabic by the
      intervention of Spanish: c-énit ( with the accent of the first
      syllable). From where the equilibrium of the monad in a neutral
      state in the ocean of monads, named "empty" which is the ocean of
      Aether, the imponderable zenith force making an even balance with
      the ponder able zero point force(nadir) which it holds in
      suspension&nbsp;/stasis until the splitting impact.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For this reason it is the winding into a funnel which is
      necessarily the best.&nbsp; It is the heart shape which is
      required&nbsp; to perpetuate the movement.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      l28&nbsp; The electrical flow always being best if the
      electro-carbon is pushed under the bottom of the fuel cell near
      the suspended stone, it follows that this fluid current, simple
      effect of the magnetic tension present to to its unmatching and
      matching ring (even and uneven rings) R/2 or qoppa-pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) following the
      removal of this ring, which is the cause of this tension effect;
      and that in consequence, the flux of the&nbsp;breakaway (or
      valance) ring follows the law of the axi&nbsp; itself, that of the
      weight; if it is found near the nadir (zero point) in
      dextragyneous movement(clockwise rotation)<br>
      The results of which the diagram 2a showing <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1) The uncoupling in lateral tension freeing one from the other,of
      the two magnetic fluxes from the axis and the periphery.<br>
      2) The respective splitting by longitudinal tension north and
      south each of these two radical (ions)&nbsp; once freed, become
      unipolar - I-O, I'-O';<br>
      3) is reduced in the normal case of the two radical/free flows in
      respect to each other, but not polar splitting asin figure 2b.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The kind that, the movement of the southern movement brings it to
      that of the two others.&nbsp; <br>
      1)The axis flux bipolar -I', reduced to the movement of that of
      left to right is dextrogyneous.<br>
      2)That of the periphery is equally bipolar -O' reduced to a
      movement: that from right to left (counterclockwise) is sinestral.
      <br>
      (The double"Cross of Lorraine" at unequal cross points reduced to
      a simple cross.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is useless to undertake a scientific study without having this
      figure imprinted in our memories.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      And yet, the experiment demonstrates that if the flow of
      electrical current follows the jump from its valence ring
      which&nbsp;follows&nbsp; the axis law, that of the weight moving
      dextrogeneously, this flow of electrical current can never attain
      to neutralize the axial and zero point(nadir) which can result and
      build up, without release at the same time as the electrical
      fluid, on the same heavy body, electrical metal conductor, for
      example.&nbsp; This which is applied, but without knowing why, in
      the force field which is the accumulator.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If this said heavy body is other than the metal conductor, or if
      it doesn't exist, the electrical tension flow tends always to
      follow the path until its movement, which very slowly lets it
      reach the other zenith flux from the periphery which it always
      reaches.&nbsp; And it is for this reason that an electrical
      current(to keep this name presently in use, although it is very
      vague) accompanied by and and always in a lesser or greater
      proportion of the zenithal influx from the periphery or outer
      ring.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One can easily see by means of an ordinary "fuel cell" of which
      the pores out of use, no longer stop for the chemical work of the
      saline/salt said to be "depolarizing". The mild peripheral flu,
      which leaps in the electrical stream that it tends to
      nullify&nbsp; and of which the violent somersaults are so abrupt
      and rapid that the needle of the voltmeter leaps in a disorderly
      fashion like the heart of a sickly feverish man.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is certainly, therefore, the leader of the famous salt/rock
      climbers" who climbs by the coals, overflowing the rim of the fuel
      cell vessels not insulated with paraffin wax, in order to follow
      stubbornly the current- tending to nullify, at least in
      appearance, but more exactly to modify it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The evidence is the same if with this old fuel cell or that above
      described , one connects the positive ove, even without shutting
      down the circuit or the rhombus of induction previously
      described.&nbsp; The copper conductor, electrical inductor, albeit
      continued or&nbsp;discontinued( whether turned on or off) , the
      magnetic induction on each of the sections, discontinued or
      continued, is produced normally. It follows from there that these
      are the magnetic fluids .which conduct the flow of their electric
      tension. Consequentially, in all magnetic force fields the largest
      diameter of a heavy weight (like the iron, for example for its
      powerful effects) determine the limit of the magnetic axis, of
      which the flux is absorbed by the weight of the mass itself, the
      angular surface makes up the inner surface on which the vibrating
      tension is produced, if one surrounds it with a light , and above
      all, porous casing: wood, terra cotta, dry bone - which will
      absorb the peripheral flux and of which it will define the
      boundary of the radius. A veritable wedge of wood placed beside a
      wedge of iron and of an equal force which exactly doubles the
      stress of the tension achieving the complete separation of these
      two forces of Aether in the interval left between the heavy axis
      and the light casing.&nbsp; Simple steel&nbsp;gun in a reed tube.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Application of the "Recovery/Correction " of an electrical current
      called alternative.&nbsp; Such a current really contains different
      sections turning inversely, of which some ( counterclockwise
      forces on the southern tip pull the others (northerly clockwise
      forces) whereas the latter can only become engines(self-propelled)
      while propelling themselves, in displacement the southerly
      electrical sections driven by the southerly peripheral&nbsp; in
      counterclockwise motion.&nbsp; Figure 3 indicates the design of
      it.<br>
      <br>
      One can either correct it as it is or split in two the copper
      conductor. "Recovery/Correction" therefore means to transmit a
      directional movement and of the ame direction.&nbsp; By a destined
      necessity this direction must be counterclockwise, because it is
      the counterclockwise bipolarity of the periphery which through the
      dry reed tube escaping from the hold of the electron ring of the
      force field created, will cling to the passage of the&nbsp;
      inductive electrical current to correct it, transmitting its own
      unique direction&nbsp; in counterclockwise motion.&nbsp; This
      which is efficiency if the wire of the inductor and the recovered
      current in the crossing of the force field is also the zenith
      magnetic conductor, meaning if it contains, for&nbsp; example,
      zinc, tin, aluminum, albeit plated or alloy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the corrective or recovery currents which are
      the creators of the recovery force field.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The brass wrapping, under a permeable envelope at the magnetic
      influx (linen or hemp, etc) is done counterclockwise at the reed
      cane, beginning at the bottom end, the entry point of the current,
      or created on the southerly tip.&nbsp; The wood rod must be
      vertical, so as to facilitate the continual flow from the axis to
      point zero(nadir) from the bottom of the&nbsp; sharpened steel
      point.&nbsp; On image #4, the corrective inductive winding is
      intentionally used next to the force field of the tube (instead of
      being wrapped around) so as to better illustrate the detail of
      what is happening.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The energy effort of the tension bi-magnetic in the void left
      between the wood and the steel and created there a closed circular
      electron ring, a resistance transforming to heat&nbsp;-a device
      with a comparable effect of that of a shoe jamming on a wheel by a
      sole or a wooden skate on the iron rim.<br>
      &nbsp;This heat, which can be intense, following the intensity of
      the field can harm the caliber/steel temper&nbsp;of the fusillade
      used, it is possible by itself to correct its abnormalities, by
      making it absorb two layers of insulation: saturate in flaxseed
      oil&nbsp;on the steel fusillade, eraser and resin powder with
      the&nbsp;flaxseed oil&nbsp;filling the gap.&nbsp; So as the heat
      rises the resins which absorb it tend to melt and harden, and the
      soot hardens to cement.<br>
      &nbsp;It is the same thing which occurs in the "recoveries"
      presently in use,&nbsp;as that the "cohesives" for the Hertz wave(
      an iron tube filled with iron fillings, fragment of galenics,
      gelatin gums, etc) which are only, as one can see, the
      "correctors" of the current. In the phial of mercury, the
      corrective current instead of being on the exterior (as it should
      also be&nbsp; on the phial strainer)&nbsp; penetrates to the
      interior, on mercury steam creating there a force field, of which
      the axial detaches by the attraction of the mercury where it gains
      velocity followed by, but without a neutralizing effect, by the
      circular electron ring of the force field, under the influence of
      which the mercury begins to gyrate in a clockwise motion, the
      result heat (consuming itself) to make it evaporate,- while the
      mild peripheral flux, attracted by the glass of the phial and the
      light steam of the vaporous mercury, taking hold violently of the
      inductive corrective current, that is to say, leading and pulling
      it along in a conducive, directional flow counterclockwise. <br>

      in the creation of heat, can otherwise be gathered&nbsp;or
      induced, and enter into a translatory movement (a locomotion
      movement) provided that it be driven because there can only be an
      electronic flow if there is a magnetic flow present, and an
      electric flow is a defined direction if there is at the same time
      a magnetic flow traveling obliquely with the other, that is it
      pulls it along and guides it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The device amplified- Use either a steel pivot,&nbsp; always&nbsp;
      with sharp angles over with a grooved inner surface, pointed at
      the two ends, for access on the circular crowns of the magnetic
      bi-polar axis - and curved&nbsp; in an arch shape with the sole
      purpose of raising the tension, on the lateral as well as on the
      longitudinal, exciting the mutual affinity of the southerly and
      northerly axis, in reciprocal attraction...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1. A left or counterclockwise section for the northern tip.<br>
      2. A dextrose section(clockwise wound) on the splitting/fission
      wall which is made up of a steel pivot in its largest diameter.<br>
      3. And thirdly, a clockwise section, for the southerly tip.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The inductor, at the same time electro-magnetic, is composed of a
      thin wire (of pure copper) and grooved in helix form, around which
      is wrapped the counterclockwise helix, but without any contact,
      the conductor of the light peripheral magnetic inductor, driver of
      the electrical inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      These various conductors of magnetic inductors are narrow bands of
      leather: carrying and isolating an interrupted, discontinued,
      series, either of hooked tips or of metallic granules(button- or
      pearl-shaped) angular or grooved of various kinds, also of varying
      weights, for both the axial and peripheral influx and&nbsp; their
      paired ring:<br>
      <br>
      a. Gold hooks, gold-plated silver, an alloy of gold and a fifth of
      silver, an amalgam of mercury with gold or silver, etc.&nbsp; or
      identical grains, for the axial bands and of the valence ring on
      the perimeter of pi(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) on which the grains
      or chips of iron can be used:<br>
      <br>
      b. Hooks of brass, bronze, aluminized copper, or granules
      (hollowed pearls) identical for the influx bands on the periphery.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Indeed, if these conductive series are not interrupted forming a
      continuous line, the electrical flow of the created force field
      flows the influx there; on the perimeter of qoppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) the alternative of
      the split which is the cause of the electrical effect and in the
      induction on the periphery of the light zenith- and nothing passes
      along the wire of the electric inductor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The progressions by leaps&nbsp; of the magnetic atoms could not be
      compared to vibrating jumps of the grasshopper (genus: Elator)
      nicknamed still "beaver" and also "Marshall blacksmith" because
      its quivering sound that it produces when jumping, is compared to
      that of a hammer hitting an anvil "perilous jumps" well-studied
      and described by naturalists.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Above the inductor-wrapped from left to right, are
      electro-magnetic inductors, arranged as described above, wound
      from right to left, the two ends, south and north&nbsp;remaining
      free.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Finally, the whole thing is wrapped with a binding as tight as
      possible of long and flexible reed blades, of which the best(
      besides wicker, of wolf bane or holly wood, Daphne enidium, L.,
      the green leaves of the fig etc, for straps of great strength) can
      be of many varieties:<br>
      &nbsp;Mountain gramona, Smilax aspera L,<br>
      Butcher's Broom, &nbsp;Ruscus aculeatus L,<br>
      Old man's beard , clematis vitalba L, etc<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      the details of each piece of this device are given in Figure n.
      5.&nbsp; They are others, besides, except in a vertical order that
      are given by the second column from the left of the great screen
      with four columns of which the semantic signs explain the winding
      of the four arcs which surround like a necklace the high,
      &nbsp;grooved neck&nbsp; of the divine&nbsp;strong "Ram", of the
      "Ram" inductor, of which the rotational movement of the neck is
      admirable depicted by the powerful artist who sculpted the
      prodigious figure on the granite wall of the temple of Ammon, like
      the cliché reproduction illustrated in figure n. 5.- (As for the
      semantic signs of the&nbsp; three other columns, which speak for
      themselves, they are now easy to understand.&nbsp; Explained in
      detail, achieved by experience/ experimentation, they will be
      divulged at the opportune moment, when the key will be given, or
      moreover, discovered, the schematic signs which are the
      alphabet&nbsp; itself of the great, universal ritual language
      known under the classic name of Kuriologic language, birthplace of
      our profane languages and of their written signs or alphabetic
      letters.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is, therefore, the lateral tension,&nbsp;stretched in a
      perpendicular direction, which is fundamental.&nbsp; Because it is
      that the provokes the fission, to the critical point and&nbsp;
      principal, R/2, and the wide opening of the force field of Aether,
      producing the double electric effect.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is still the tension which provokes the stretching between each
      of the&nbsp;rings of the magnetic axial flux,&nbsp; as well as
      between each of the&nbsp;rings of the peripheral flux, producing
      effects deemed "parasitical" taken for "electrical" and confused
      together, of which they are radically different, as they differ
      one from the other, physically as well as chemically.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There be three effects of the tension:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1. The effect of the critical tension of the circle R/2 is the
      Electrical effect, from the name Elec-tryon ou Electron,
      mythological generator of Electra= Alcmena, "wife" of Amphi-tryon,
      and undoubtedly "mother" of Herculean force;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      2. The effect of the tension between&nbsp; each of the peripheral
      flux rings is the Dionic Effect, from the name Dione ,-"mother" of
      Aphrodite Epitragia :&nbsp;&nbsp;she who &nbsp;follows the
      mystic&nbsp; "Goat":<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      3. The effect of the tension between each of the axial flux rings
      is the Palladic Effect, from the sacred name of Pallus =
      "Vibrating by collision"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pallus optiletis: its
      pure light being phosphorescent like that of a glow worm; Athena
      glaukopis: to whom phosphorus <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;It is clear that the electro-magnetic, as straight as
      arched, can by its required system supply only electrical tension
      as well, by its uni-polar and bi-polar discharges or flows from
      the two flux of the axis and the peripheral as well as by that of
      the tension ring, but without any separation or analytic isolation
      in the infinite variety of each of its influc; of which those
      different properties according to the orbit of rings of their own
      tensions.&nbsp; This can only be achieved by the rhomboids.<br>
      <br>
      It is agreed, before continuing, that it must be understood that
      the inductor or the electro-magnetic diono-pallidic induction
      method, a cause of such colllisions: wind, running water, movement
      or eruption, rockslides, blows on metals, drums or tamboutines,
      etc. can accelerate the natural movement of the monads of Aether.
      If one takes a preference, as well as the method of induction, an
      electricalcurrent or a magnetic one, already pre-existing, it is
      solely the most convenient method to have a constant collision
      caused by these ignited forces but nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      It must be therefore, an electrical current as a method of
      induction. But to simplify things, the exposed will be reduced
      only with the tension at the critical point of R/2 showing how to
      separate them in the inductors, the magnetic flow of the electric
      current or the contrary, how to reunite them- the same devices can
      be employed for the separation/ fission or for the joining/
      fusion&nbsp; processes in the peripheral inductors: from the
      magnetic flow and of the effect of tension or ionic flow -in the
      axial inductors: in the magnetic flow and of its effect of tension
      or paladin flow.<br>
      <br>
      To increase the extent of the tension on this middle point of the
      bi-fluid breakdown instead of limiting this ring to a theoretic
      circular line, it is suitable to cut low on the pole, the
      southerly one for example, the heavy wood rhomboid serving as the
      mold to the perimeter of this ring stretching it as far as one
      will, even to and beyond the neutral line between southerly and
      northerly points and from the southern point.<br>
      <br>
      The other pole will be reduced to a hemispheric cap or nose cone
      or into a cone which can be truncate, forming a "Club-head" and of
      which the greatest diameter will be given R- like a + b of Figure
      # 6.<br>
      <br>
      Finally to be uniform in length from one end to the other, the
      electrical inductor (thick, pure copper wire, grooved in helix
      form) will hold in helix-form- 5 pieces of magnetic winding, but
      each of these forming an uninterrupted, discontinuous line:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st piece, wrapped counterclockwise, from
      the axis of the southerly point, made of gold hooks,
      silver-plate,etc.. on a narrow band of leather folded underneath
      another strip to avoid contact with the copper wire(electrical
      inductor) on which it is wound.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd piece, wound clockwise, for koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )
      northerly point, made of the same hooks of gold, gold-plate,
      silver or amalgam, iron and lead, with the same strips of leather.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd piece, wrapped counterclockwise, for
      the northerly and southerly periphery and not folded:&nbsp; of
      small hooks of tin, bronze, etc. with the same strips of leather.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th piece, wound clockwise for koppa
      pi&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) southern point (
      like the 2nd piece).<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th piece, clockwise, for the southerly
      point axis (like the 1st piece).<br>
      <br>
      This winding with hooked points is, therefore, exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;
      like the one used for the narrow zinc band serving as the
      rhomb-solenoid fuel cell.<br>
      <br>
      In this state, the five pieces function separately conducting the
      magnetic flow bustling along the atoms jumping from one point or
      from one granule to the other: the ones from the axis jumping with
      greater velocity than the ones from the periphery, separated by
      the fluids of their own tension: electrical, ionic, paladin, which
      can follow along a conductor without continuous solution and
      obliquely in respect to their causes of tension.<br>
      <br>
      Iron nails embedded in the pivot serving as a mold between the
      spires of the winding, increasing the potential by
      supersaturation.<br>
      <br>
      Above the winding, surrounded, like always by a clissage as thick
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      It can be imagined what could be the frequency multiplied
      infinitely by these cards&nbsp; and these graters,&nbsp; of which
      the length can be excessive, at the hooked points or uncountable
      granules.<br>
      <br>
      To make the magnetic atoms flow along the same conductors by the
      fluids/flows of their tension or of their collisions: electrical,
      ionic, paladin and it suffices to insert it between the leather:
      at the base of the hooks or granules, in contact with them, a
      soutache or a conductive border continuing from the same metal.<br>
      <br>
      And in the case studied, the segments 2 and 4 must be reunited by
      the interior passage or the segment 2 advances along the southerly
      tip, so that there is a driven electrical current in the same flow
      with the alternative flux of koppa pi
      (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) reduced to a single, predominant
      southerly movement in a clockwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      It is this pseudo-sexual, energized coupling which constitutes the
      Herakleie bia (Gr.) or Herculean Force, who in this state is a
      di-/ des- oxidant which can create the hydrocarbons.&nbsp; And in
      this case, the electrical flow tending to be parallel to the
      inductive line- the 2 bonds of segments 2 and 4, instead of being
      rolled into a spire, can be folded and hemmed stimulating/
      engainant&nbsp; the inductor.<br>
      <br>
      But to the contrary to gather separately the fluidic effects of
      the tension: electrical, ionic, paladin it is imperative that
      there is no contact between the continued metallic wire of their
      conductors and the discontinuous chaplets /chains of magnetic
      atoms- whose continuous wires can be:<br>
      <br>
      - pure copper for the electric<br>
      <br>
      -pure silver for the ionic<br>
      <br>
      -and pure gold for the palludic inductor, so that the hooks&nbsp;
      or metallic granules of the discontinuous conductors of magnetic
      atoms can be replaced:<br>
      <br>
      For the peripheral, by the small, hollow pearls (glass or false
      stones) or porous marbles of iais-ferauli- seeds emptied of their
      grains: fruits spiked with hay Onobrichis capit-galli Lam.,
      Onobrichis satira Lam. ( esparcette).&nbsp; nuts emptied of
      micocoules Celtis australis, pierced nuts of azerderach, Melia
      azerdarach, of merises , Cerasus avium DC - small, empty snail
      shells, aquatic or terrestrial&nbsp; species, etc.<br>
      <br>
      For the axis, by the grains, full like that of the pepper plant,
      Piper Longum L., from gattilier Vitex Agnus-Castus&nbsp; L ( the
      chaste lamb), heavy nuts of the wild juju bier, Zizyphus lotus L.,
      etc. threaded with chaplets, with the intervals either on
      horsehair or on wool.<br>
      <br>
      Now to isolate the magnetic atoms one from the other at each
      circular revolution of their own tension in the purpose or end to
      use specific energy which is each its own, gifted each with a
      different quality, physical as well as chemical, it suffices to
      elongate such a circular ring of which one wants to obtain the
      energy, instead of limiting it to a theoretic circular line
      (figure 7)&nbsp; as it was already stated for the critical circle
      R/2/<br>
      <br>
      The number of these tensions, otherwise, known as the circular
      rings, can be considered infinite, but in practice as experiments
      show: it can be reduced to 3 on each axial pole and to 7 on each
      pole of the peripheral flux, as indicated (in figure 8).<br>
      <br>
      And yet the induction as was already stated in the force field of
      Aether, is at 2 distinct times from the capital phrases:<br>
      <br>
      1. That of the decoupler/ splitter by lateral tension freeing one
      from the other, the two forces of Aether.<br>
      <br>
      2. That of the splitter by tension lengthwise from the southern to
      the northern tip for each of the decoupled flux.<br>
      <br>
      In this state of insulation, as well as duel splitting as by polar
      splitting, it is clear that the reciprocal pull of the insulated
      atom, otherwise known as affinity, begins to react instantly -
      that is to say finally that the invincible tendency to its initial
      state of inertia, perpetual consequence of constant resistance to
      the active rupture of the passive inertia in its state of rest.<br>
      <br>
      Also with the rhomb-solenoid each influx of the same nature begins
      to move (uncontrollably) in movement in two opposite directions,
      according to the unequal tendencies which provoke the rupture of
      equilibrium.- the rings of this rupture, or the starting points of
      this contrary operation in two opposite directions, being fixed as
      the following:<br>
      <br>
      - axial influx toward the axis: 1/3 of the distance<br>
      <br>
      - axial influx toward pi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ): 2/3 of&nbsp; the
      distance<br>
      <br>
      -peripheral influx toward&nbsp; the periphery: 3/7 of the distance<br>
      <br>
      -peripheral influx toward pi(&nbsp;&nbsp; ) : 4/7 of the distance:<br>
      as indicated by figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated by the labels, the respective formulas of the atoms
      of Aether, like creative, organic forces, are indicated very
      summarily, by the announcement of the procreated substances on the
      schema Figure 9. As it had been stated above, the means of
      induction could also be an already existing magnetic current.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of such a fact is very great, because the
      peripheral flux or mild zenith effect is freed everywhere,
      accumulated in enormous quantity everywhere where there are
      collisions and whatever porous bodies: a breath of air, a
      waterfall from a dam, a wheel movement or from a mill turbine,
      movement of the waves or high tides or a grindstone motion etc. -
      so it is very easy&nbsp; that the incredible power of the&nbsp;
      fascinating wood" of the wood faggot collector.<br>
      <br>
      These light woods can be divided in 2 categories: <br>
      <br>
      1) Those that tend to simply attract the mild peripheral flows,
      such as those mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      2) Those which tend to attract&nbsp; and accumulate ( accumulate
      or collect) such are those containing some sodium in the organic
      state&nbsp; "Capparides"{shrub}Frankiniace {bacteria),
      Salssolacees{plant}."&nbsp; The same for those very rich in
      potassium, bands, etc.&nbsp; The distinction is important for the
      case where it only helps the induction on the appropriate
      conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Thus on a prepared conductor, as said above, discontinued if one
      needs to separate the dionic current which tends to follow its
      own&nbsp; flux of tension ( which tends to follow the electric
      current.&nbsp; the latter begins to work the minute it comes into
      contact with the light collectors: filled/loaded with rings under
      a waterfall, coat of protective boards of the wheel of the mill,
      wooden raft on the waves, hub of the free shrub: atriplex halimus
      L., hut of the caper bush: Capprier spinosa L. on a rock in the
      middle of sprays.<br>
      <br>
      It is the force in movement, easily gathered without any
      mechanical device, but being able to be transferred into a
      mechanical movement. It can act like a chemical energy. It can
      create a force field electro-magnetic inductor, by a device shaped
      like a rhomboid similar to those described. It can, also, in this
      created force field grow by multiplying it, the ethereal energy,
      by simple parallel juxtaposition of a second conductor in the form
      of a chaplet/ rosary destined to be an amplified inductor
      (induced) isolated from the inductor by partitions: this which
      gives to the whole (inductor and induced). the appearance of a
      partitioned pod/ clove of garlic-like with the gum tree - of which
      the divine art of antique architecture like the hedgehog with its
      quills decorated the tarsal columns radiating in ethereal arches/
      volutes, between which spread the ritual leaf of Acantle {an
      ornamental shrub} of which the natural leaf stem - demonstrate in
      the parabola the triple device of the induction, thick line of the
      inductor, double line in helix-form of the induced.<br>
      It is to this accumulated energy in enormous volumes of streams,
      reefs crumbling reefs, detonating violently, by sudden recohesion,
      which produces the trigger with equal volume of the atmospheric
      axial flux in electrical tension, that it is necessary without any
      doubt attribute the sudden stunning detonations that one hears
      from time to time at large (from the Mantinea area) at sea, at few
      infrequent sightings and named BARIZEL-GUN (Gun of Barizel) such
      are also the stupid use of radiotelegraphic waves troubling
      without respite the Aether of the terrestrial atmosphere of which
      it overwhelms the necessary calm by continuous or intensification
      placed in tension of the breaking point/ collision ruining the
      same order of the seasons necessary to vegetative life:
      threatening even by its existence, human life.<br>
      <br>
      This whole study is relative to the rhomboid force field taken in
      section configured as qoppa (&nbsp;&nbsp; ).&nbsp; Same results
      and the same demonstrates with the study in&nbsp; the blue print,
      according to the figure pi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      ).<br>
      <br>
      In effect if one sews with golden thread or one covers with little
      flowers of the same metal in leather panels in rectangular form,
      formed by cut strips and&nbsp;&nbsp; overlap/interlink in a way to
      form the degree of a stair pattern, but calculated so that the
      critical point R/? (unclear) (probably R/2) be exactly the length
      of the two legs of pi (&nbsp; ), it is easy to see according to
      the diagram figure 10 that the peripheral flux, have the lateral
      flux, tending to change forms into a horizontal cross under the
      effect of the effect of the tension of the collision, to go up
      toward the zenith, compared to the vertical influx of the axis
      which descends to point zero(nadir), it is easy to see that the
      maximum of this tension will be exactly at the incident angles by
      the raised cross; this which makes this screen the ecu/crown
      separated from the heraldic coat of arms.<br>
      <br>
      On this golden stairway, covered with CORER(meaning obscure-
      possibly "copper" appearing more to be "vines"}, lightly inclined
      on the vertical line attracting the monads of Aether, which hit
      each other, the force field forms along the fixed limits by the
      carefully calculated surface, with a solution of continuity by
      lightly raising the cloth of gold, which forms two small archways
      or voutes ending in a fork with two sharp angles, with two&nbsp;
      incidental angles below the cross of the crown.<br>
      <br>
      Since it is between the fork of each of the small arches where the
      rupture of the monads takes place, of which the atoms leap off the
      tines of each fork, to either go toward the axis and descend to
      point zero (nadir) or go to the lateral edges and rise to the
      zenith, an electrical current results from it, which leaves on the
      conductor between the southernly or lower part of the axis and the
      unbalanced lateral part going toward the norhernly point on the
      southern section of the axis as indicated by the photgraphic
      reproduction, submitted to serve as visual reproduction and
      corresponding to figure 10. <br>
      (This entire group will be explained elsewhere, at a more
      opportune time in its minute details.&nbsp; One can see now why
      any electrophore slowly discharged of its electrical charge no
      matter where it is located.&nbsp; The electrophore, on which the
      monads in constant motion had just collided, plays a signification
      role of "these on" above, arranging a new and invisible induction
      there - like these sacred objects, golden HILASTRE of the arch (
      of pure and massive gold): the induction&nbsp; creating there a

      say "rational" word-for word&nbsp; calculated) augural

      Constantine {Emperor of the fourth century known for embracing
      christianity}&lt;in hoc + vinces&gt; L.&nbsp; This which succeeds
      in showing the in addition that the &lt;Cross of Oerstedt&gt;,{The
      oersted is defined as 1000/4p (79.5774715) ampere per meter, in
      terms of SI units.} this cross is in fact not an electromagnetic
      cross but a magnetic cross, the holy cross, in essence, as
      demonstrated in the illustration&nbsp; figure 11- the electric
      current being here ( and as always everywhere else) only an
      inductor which creates a magnetic force.&nbsp; And like the
      lateral, magnetic flux extends to the cross by way of the axis,
      the extreme limit of its deviation, either an angle of 90 degrees
      it follows that the magnetized needle can only stretch to the
      cross in relation to the current, without it being possible to
      ever be placed in&nbsp; the form of a cross, since taken between
      the two southerly and the two northerly points of the force field
      created, the extreme limit of its possible deviation can only be
      45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomena that explains figure 11 is therefore the same,
      exactly, except the reversal of the poles that that one natural of
      figure 2b- according to which, knowing the deviation of the
      compass needle in relation to the axial pole of the earth, one
      could calculate the exact position of the transversal branch of
      its " magnetic cross' which varies, one sees it, according to a
      set of transfers in function of the force of the tension.<br>
      <br>
      The constant motion is therefore demonstrated; the constant
      fluidic movement, likely to create the constant mechanical
      movement,- not the inverse, thus it is of use without deep
      reflexion, to consider/ envisage the problem. So it has been shown
      that the cause of the motion is chaotic collision, is in the leaps
      of jerky motions: that the continuous movement is in itself
      impossible; it can only be nonsensical chaos.&nbsp; Without being
      discontinuous its continuous aspect is only a futile appearance.
      That of the human heart, eminently discontinued, jerky, irregular
      and slow is only a serious of jolts.<br>
      And it thus in truth that they oppose each other:<br>
      <br>
      -sterile electricity, and the largest creative magnetic issue;<br>
      <br>
      -caloric energy and frigonic energy<br>

      -the void of carbon and the sovereignty of Aether<br>

      -life and death<br>
      <br>
      Summary<br>
      <br>
      The addendum herein presented succeeds in showing the intrinsic
      nature of the force field.<br>
      <br>
      It shows firstly the intimate difference of the two opposing force
      of which it is comprised; that of the axis ponder able, following
      the laws of weight, plunging to point zero(nadir) and that one,
      the imponderable of the periphery rising toward the zenith - of
      which the atomic fluxes by stretching the circular layers/sections
      or by the inter-collisions in their progressive leaps; have a
      particular tension-; vibrating radiation denoted palladic for the
      axial and the dionic for the peripheral - two joined forces in a
      single force which triples in power; of which the splitting by
      collision causes the vibratory effect known as electric.<br>
      <br>
      It shows then the means of easily splitting by a heavy pivot and a
      light surrounding ring; then that of gathering them and of placing
      them in motion on materials of three realms( mineral, vegetable,
      and animal) thus the flows of their effects of tension.<br>
      <br>
      It shows finally how to separate them from each other thus from
      their effects of tension or vibrating radiation of their atomic
      collisions, by discontinued channels of interrupted conductors -
      thus proving that the jump and the jerky movement, creator of
      life.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the complete facts, numerous devices for unnamable ends;
      physical, chemical and mechanical; can from then on, be
      constructed/ built.&nbsp; Only the typical ones are described
      herein.&nbsp; The others could be.&nbsp; But these others,
      whatever they are even those actually in use (dynamo,
      magno-electric) and whatever their purpose, all depend from now on
      without being able to escape to it, from these major factors which
      reveal the admirable and complex mystery of the Aether; from the
      collision of monads and the collision of their atoms, of which the
      skipping jumps in their spiral movements do an eternal, circular
      dance.<br>
