        <p align="left">Recently it was announced at Mercer University
          (Macon GA), that the Westinghouse Electric &amp; manufacturing
          Co. had offered Dr. Palmer H. Craig, head of the physics
          department of the university, $100,000 for a new device which
          is supposed to replace vacuum tubes as amplifiers and
          detectors. </p>
        <p align="left">The device is called an "electromagnetic
          detector and amplifier" and consists of a series of bismuth
          plates stacked in a pile and interlaced with copper wires. The
          bismuth plates are protected by a coating of sulfur because
          bismuth, a very brittle substance, is likely to crumble. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Long Sought After</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Many attempts have been made by various
          investigators to make use in this manner of the this property
          of bismuth and of similar properties of allied metals but so
          far there has been no claim of success, until Dr. Craig came
          along. The most common attempted application is to the
          rectification of AC for filament and plate voltage supply.
          Lack of efficiency and of dependability have been the main
          causes of failure. Another limitation is the supply of
          suitable metals in commercial quantity. </p>
        <p align="left">One of the metals which displays similar
          properties is molybdenum. This has been used by scientists of
          the Bureau of Standards for converting light energy from the
          sun into electricity. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>From Earth To Sun!</b> </p>
        <p align="left">A certain amount of success has been achieved
          and it seems possible that power may soon be derived directly
          from the sun in this manner. Here, also, lack of efficiency
          and of adequate supply of the metal are limitations. There is
          plenty of molybdenum to be had in different parts of the
          world, but not all molybdenum is suitable for the purpose.
          There seems to be an active component in the metal which is
          responsible for the peculiar property, and it is now the aim
          of the scientists to isolate this substance. </p>
        <p align="left">Apropos the offer to Dr. Craig, Dr. Alfred N.
          Goldsmith, of the Radio Corporation of America, denied that
          any such offer has been made for Dr. Craig’s device. Dr.
          Goldsmith, chief broadcast engineer of the corporation,
          deprecates the idea that the peculiar property of bismuth can
          be used for the purpose claimed by Dr. Craig. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>He is Not Yet Thirty</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Craig emphasizes the point that the device
          will displace batteries as well as vacuum tubes in radio sets.
        </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Craig, who is not yet 30, developed the
          invention, upon which he immediately applied for a patent, for
          his thesis at the University of Cincinnati where he received
          his degree of Doctor of Philosophy last June. </p>
        <p align="left">When asked to show the invention, Dr. Craig drew
          out a small block of substance resembling sulfur. It was an
          inch thick, about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide. Protruding
          from the top were tiny wires. It was encased except for the
          top. </p>
        <p align="left">He styled the device “an application of bismuth
          plates as detectors and amplifiers”, which could be used in
          place of present batteries and vacuum tubes in a radio. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>What He Found Out</b> </p>
        <p align="left">In his research for his Ph. D. degree at the
          University of Cincinnati, Dr. Craig found that the bismuth
          plates might be so used and the actual invention is described
          in part in his doctor’s thesis. </p>
        <p align="left">The inventor today spoke of the device as “a
          series of about 10 thin bismuth plates, piled one on the
          other, with wires running between them and finally on out to
          the actual radio set.” </p>
        <p align="left">Because of the delicate nature of the bismuth
          plates, Dr. Craig has protected them with a covering of
          sulfur. According to the inventor, the bismuth plates will
          generate the energy necessary to operate the radio and serve
          as a detector and amplifier. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Describes Process</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The process is described in the scientist’s
          thesis as follows: </p>
        <p align="left">"The author is at present using this additive
          principle in an application of the Hall effect to
          rectification of alternating current, with a method similar to
          that described by Descoudres. </p>
        <p align="left">"The additive principle used in this connection
          produces a Hall potential of several volts in low fields with
          thin bismuth films, and thus gives the Hall effect a practical
          importance as a rectifier, especially in radio and similar
          applications." </p>

          for a magnetic field strength of&nbsp; from 0.07 to 1.00 gauss
          was accurately determined by improved methods. Production of
          the bismuth films. Various methods for obtaining excessively

          as casting, electroplating, evaporating, sputtering, and
          metallic spraying, of which the last three methods were
          particularly successful. Measurement of very low voltages. By
          refinements made in the potentiometer and measuring circuits,

          Magnitude of the Hall effect at low fields. The value of the
          Hall coefficient, R, is abnormally large between 0.07 and 0.30
          gauss, having a value of -171 at 0.07 gauss, as compared with
          a value of -11 which R had for this film at 15 gausses. The
          value at 4220 gausses was -29, A curve is plotted showing the
          rapid decrease in the value of -R between 0.07 and 0.30 gauss,
          and comparison is made with higher values of field strength.
          It is noted that by putting the Hall potential of one film in
          series with one or more other films we obtain comparatively
          high values of the Hall emf, which may be applied to great
          advantage as an alternating current rectifier in radio and
          similar applications. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Introduction</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Since the discovery of the Hall effect in 1875
          much has been done to elucidate this phenomenon both
          experimentally and theoretically. But, with the exception of
          Righi (Ref. 1), who employed fields comparable to that of the
          earth, and a few others, almost all investigators have used
          strong fields. It is important to know accurately the effect
          of low fields, to compare it with the known facts and to
          determine whether any abnormal relations exist. As the effect
          of the magnetic field is small in all cases, a great
          refinement of the potentiometer and measuring circuits is
          imperative with weak fields, and the preparation of the
          bismuth strips presents great difficulties and requires
          special methods. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Preparation -- Experimental Arrangements</b>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Since the Hall effect increases with the
          thinness of the metallic strips, the first requisite was to
          prepare extremely thin films of metal. Bismuth and tellurium,
          which have the highest Hall coefficient of the ordinary
          metals, were selected and six different methods were tried in
          order to find the best and quickest way of making films which
          would be extremely thin and at the same time electrically
          continuous. These processes were casting, dipping, spraying,
          electroplating, and sputtering. </p>
        <p align="left">Thin films of bismuth cannot be produced by
          casting unless pressure is exerted on the surface of the metal
          as it cools, and provision must then be made for lateral
          expansion when solidifying. </p>
        <p align="left">Surprisingly thin and uniform films were,
          however, obtained by dipping mica sheets into molten bismuth
          and using the metallic film which adhered to the mica. If the
          surface of the mica be slightly roughened with hydrofluoric
          acid, and care be used in withdrawing the mica from the molten
          metal, a very thin and uniform film can be obtained by this
          very simple and rapid method. </p>
        <p align="left">Much work was done by the author to produce very
          thin plates of bismuth and tellurium by the process of
          spraying molten metal. Excellent results were obtained both
          with the "Schoop" compressed air metallic spraying process,
          and also with the "Gravitas" metal dust spraying process.
          Cooperation in this part of the work was kindly rendered by
          the Metals Coating Company of Philadelphia. Both of these
          spraying processes involve spraying metals in the molten state
          by means of a compressed air gun. In the case of bismuth it
          was found advisable to use compressed nitrogen, instead of
          air, in order to prevent oxidation of the sprayed layer. When
          applied to mica, glass, and bakelite, excellent films of both
          bismuth and tellurium were obtained. </p>
        <p align="left">Attempts to produce homogenous films by
          electroplating met with poor results, even when great care was
          used regarding temperature, speed of the rotating cathode, and
          concentration of solution. </p>
        <p align="left">Evaporation of molten bismuth in a partial
          vacuum produced very good results. Bismuth was placed inside
          an evacuated bell-jar and was melted by an electric heater. A
          glass plate, suspended above the arrangement, collected the
          evaporated bismuth in the form of excellent films. </p>
        <p align="left">Cathodic sputtering undoubtedly produces the
          thinnest films of any method. With reasonable care bismuth
          films can easily be prepared by this method so thin as to be
          quite transparent. Sputtering was accomplished by applying the
          secondary current of a 20,000 volt transformer to anode and
          cathode electrodes placed inside a bell-jar evacuated to 30
          microns. Rectification of the secondary current by a kenetron
          accelerated the action. A disc of bismuth 3.5 inches in
          diameter was used as a cathode, and the glass plate on which
          the film was to be sputtered was placed just outside the
          Crookes’ dark space, which was about 2 cm long. With a current
          of 5 milliamperes excellent films were produced on glass in
          about 20 minutes. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Disposition of the Apparatus</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The very weak magnetic films employed in this
          work were obtained from an air core solenoid. When a given
          current is passed through such a coil the field at the center
          is easily calculated. This calculated value was checked by a
          calibrated ballistic galvanometer in conjunction with a flip
          coil. The actual coil employed consisted of 100 turns of wire
          wound on a rectangular wooden form 8 x 11 cm in
          cross-sectional area, the size of this form being just large
          enough to accommodate the film used. The inductance of this
          coil was 2.5 millihenries, and it was therefore necessary to
          pass 35.2 milliamperes through it in order to get a field of
          one gauss at the center. Because of the extremely low values
          of the magnetic field used, it was necessary to shield the
          arrangement carefully from any action of the earth’s and stray
          fields. Several methods were tried to accomplish this
          shielding, the one finally adopted being that of placing the
          set-up so that the plane of the bismuth field coincided
          exactly with the magnetic inclination of the earth’s field at
          that point, thus eliminating any magnetic component in a
          direction perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic film.
          Care was taken to keep all iron away from the vicinity of the
          apparatus, and upon actual measurement stray fields were found
          to be negligible. </p>
        <p align="left">Chemically pure bismuth for producing the films
          was furnished by Eimer and Amend and the film itself, obtained
          by any one of the previously described methods, was mounted on
          bakelite with sodium silicate as a binder. Contact at the ends
          for the longitudinal current was made by phosphor-bronze
          spring clips, and contact at the edges of the film, for
          picking up the transverse Hall potential, was obtained by
          means of small brass fingers attached to machine screws passed
          through the bakelite. The surface of the film was carefully
          cleaned with weak hydrochloric acid solution to remove surface
          oxides, and the entire film and connections were then painted
          with sodium silicate to keep semi-conducting layers of dirt
          and moisture from collecting on the surface of the film. In
          some cases it was even found advisable to mould the entire
          arrangement in sulfur to obviate this difficulty. </p>
        <p align="left">Since the potential differences to be measured
          were of the order of one microvolt, extreme care was taken to
          render the measuring apparatus very accurate and stable. The
          transverse Hall effect potential was measured by means of a
          Leeds and Northrup type K potentiometer, redesigned with a
          system of calibrated external shunts which increased the
          sensitivity of the instrument 10 times. Four galvanometers of
          varying degrees of sensitivity were used with potentiometer
          for null readings, the most sensitive galvanometer having a
          sensitivity of 12.2 mm per MV. The longitudinal current
          through the film was supplied by large storage cells, the
          output of which passed through a large filter system of two
          very large inductances in series with the line, the lines
          being shunted by two condensers of 6 microfarads each. This
          filter eliminated erratic action caused by sudden fluctuations
          of the longitudinal current occasioned by bubbling of the
          cells. </p>
        <p align="left">The main current through the potentiometer
          itself was passed through a similar filter and was allowed to
          flow overnight before taking readings so that greater
          stability could be expected. The null potentiometer reading on
          the standard cell was checked before and after and after each
          measurement. </p>
        <p align="left">Greater care was taken to eliminate all spurious
          effects. Thermal effects, of course, construed the greater
          part of these corrections. Junctions of dissimilar metals in
          the circuit were reduced to a minimum, and the remaining
          potentials due to Thomson and allied effects were accurately
          measured the instant the longitudinal current was broken.
          Grounding one side of the potentiometer circuit was found to
          increase stability. </p>
        <p align="left">For the work at high magnetic fields, a large
          electromagnet was used. This magnet was capable of producing a
          field of 18,000 gausses in a narrow air gap, the field of
          which was measured by a calibrated ballistic galvanometer in
          conjunction with a flip coil. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Experimental Results &amp; Discussion</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Using a bismuth film obtained by metallic
          spraying, 3.5 x 8.0 cm in area and 0.012 cm thick, the results
          shown in Table I were obtained. These results are in agreement
          with those obtained with films of the other type described
          previously. In this table three different ranges of magnetic
          field strength were investigated with the same bismuth film
          and under the same general conditions. A longitudinal current
          of 1.5 amperes was used throughout Table I. The "residual" emf
          (measured in microvolt) which is referred to in the second
          column is the potential difference caused by the fact that the
          brass fingers which pick up the transverse Hall potential
          cannot possibly be placed at exact equipotential spots with
          regard to the longitudinal current. These contacts were placed
          as near to equipotential points as possible and the remaining
          difference of potential was measured as given in the second
          column of the table. The second and third columns
          automatically include the sum of the thermal effects, since it
          is of course impossible to eliminate the thermal potentials
          from the potentials indicated in these columns. However, the
          spurious effects are eliminated when column two is subtracted
          from column three in order to get the net Hall emf in the
          fourth column. The Hall coefficient, R, given in the fifth
          column is calculated from the usual formula (Ref. 2), </p>
        <p align="left">R = Ed / IH , </p>
        <p align="left">Where R is the Hall coefficient, d the thickness
          of the film in centimeters, i the longitudinal current in
          abamperes, H the magnetic field strength in gausses, and E the
          net Hall emf. </p>

        <p align="left">It is immediately apparent that the Hall
          coefficient is abnormally high in the range of very low
          fields, and falls rapidly in value as the field is slightly
          increased. Reference to the graph (Figure 1) shows a slight
          irregularity near 0.1 gauss, a straightening out of the curve
          at about 0.3 gauss, and then an approximately linear relation
          until a field strength of 1.0 gauss is reached. Reading s in
          an intermediate range of zero to 30 gauss showed that -R is
          practically constant at a value of 10.27 which Von
          Ettingshausen and Nernst found for bismuth at a field of 1650
          gausses. In the range from 1000 to 4200 gausses the
          coefficient increases slightly from 15 to 29. This curve was
          selected from a dozen similar graphs as being one of the most
          representative, and the irregularity in the neighborhood of
          0.1 gauss is typical of similar irregularities in all curves
          obtained with the various films. </p>
        <p align="left">These results show that the value of -R at very
          low fields is higher than has been heretofore suspected and
          that the curve for -R, plotted against field strength, shows a
          marked rise in this low range. </p>
        <p align="left">Each of the values in Table I are average values
          for approximately 12 readings at each value of field strength.
          These readings are reproducible to approximately one-tenth of
          a microvolt, and the readings forming the averages did not
          vary more than this amount. </p>

        <p align="left">During the course of the experiments an
          interesting incidental fact was discovered, namely that the
          Hall effect of one film may be put in series with that of one
          or more other films, the sum of these series potentials
          agreeing very well with the calculated sum of the Hall
          potentials of the individual films as observed separately.
          Although this fact has little application where quantitative
          readings of a high degree of accuracy are desired, it is of
          real importance in any application where larger values of Hall
          potential are desirable than those which can be obtained with
          a single film. The author is at present using this additive
          principle in an application of the Hall effect to
          rectification of alternating current with a method similar to
          that described by Descoudres (Ref. 4). The additive principle
          used in this connection produces a Hall potential of several
          volts in low fields with thin bismuth films, and thus gives
          the Hall effect a practical importance as a rectifier,
          especially in radio and similar applications. Work on the
          additive principle is also being done by Sarek (Ref 5). </p>
        <p align="left">The results here presented indicate that there
          is considerable work to be done in further investigating
          abnormalities in the Hall coefficient at very low fields, and
          also suggest that certain modifications or explanations will
          have to be introduced into the theory of the Hall effect to
          account for the interesting changes in the Hall coefficient at
          low fields. </p>
        <p align="left">In conclusion, the author wishes to acknowledge
          his indebtedness to Dr. Louis T. More, Dr. R.C., Gowdy, and
          Sr. S.J.M. Allen for their kind help and valuable advice
          tendered throughout the progress of the work. </p>

        <p align="left">My invention relates broadly to electrical
          apparatus for modifying the behavior of electrical current and
          more particularly an apparatus for effectively employing the
          transverse potential difference in certain metallic plates
          when subjected to the action of a longitudinal current and the
          influence of a magnetic field. </p>

          foil sheets or metallic alloy plates in stacked arrangement
          insulated one from another and electrically connected in

          current characteristic may be secured in a circuit which
          connects to points along the transverse axes of the plates
          when alternating current is supplied to the opposite end of
          the plates and a magnetic field created around the plates. </p>
        <p align="left">Another object of my invention is to provide a
          construction of fixed rectifier for alternating current which
          remains in permanent adjustment and does not require resetting
          from time to time. </p>
        <p align="left">Another object of my invention is to provide a
          device for modifying electrical current of alternating
          characteristic for rectifying, amplifying, or causing the
          generation of electrical oscillations of any selected
          frequency. </p>
        <p align="left">Still another object of my invention is to
          provide an electrical apparatus particularly adapted for
          operation in conjunction with the circuits of a radio
          receiving system for rendering feeble signal currents
          observable. <br>
          A still further object of my invention is to provide an
          apparatus unit which may be connected in circuit with electron
          tube apparatus for facilitating the operation of the electron
          tube apparatus in the reception of signaling energy. </p>
        <p align="left">Other and further objects of my invention will
          be understood from the specification hereinafter following by
          reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 1 represents in perspective view the

          2 is an end view of the apparatus showing more clearly the
          direction of the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of
          the metallic plates; Figure 3 is a schematic view showing the
          arrangement of the metallic films which comprise the apparatus
          of my invention; Figure 4 is a diagrammatic view showing the
          wiring arrangement of the apparatus of my invention when used
          as a rectifier; Figure 5 shows one of the applications of my
          invention in a reflex signaling receiving circuit; Figure 6
          illustrates an application of my invention as a detector in a
          radio circuit; Figure 7 shows a circuit arrangement which
          makes use of the principles of my invention in the
          amplification of signal energy, provision being made for
          facilitating the production of oscillations; Figure 8 shows a
          circuit arrangement wherein the longitudinal current which
          passes through the plates of the apparatus of my invention is
          derived from a source independent of the source which creates
          the magnetic field about the plates; Figure 9 illustrates a
          circuit arrangement employing a plurality of the devices of my
          invention as an amplifier of incoming signaling energy and as
          a rectifier of the amplified energy; and Figure 10 shows the
          fundamental arrangement of the magnetic field transverse to
          the plane of several metallic plates in the apparatus for
          developing the principles set forth herein. </p>

        <p align="left">My invention makes use of the "Hall", "Corbino"
          and similar electromagnetic phenomena for the rectification or
          amplification of alternating currents, and the generation of
          sustained electrical oscillations in electrical circuits. </p>
        <p align="left">The "Hall" effect consists, briefly, of an
          electromagnetic phenomenon observable when a strip or film of
          metal carrying a longitudinal current I, (Figure 3) is placed
          in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of such a
          strip, a transverse potential difference being set up between
          the edges a, a’, of the strip, this difference of potential
          being approximately, under normal condition represented by the
          formula: </p>
        <p align="left">E = HI/d </p>
        <p align="left">Where E = the transverse potential difference; <br>
          I = the current (longitudinal) through the strip; <br>
          d = the thickness of the strip; <br>
          H = the magnetic field strength </p>
        <p align="left">The "Corbino" effect is similar to the "Hall"
          effect, wherein a radial current through a circular disc
          subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of
          the disc, produces a "circular" current through the disc. </p>
        <p align="left">I have discovered that if plates or films of
          metal such as bismuth, tellurium, bismuth-antimony alloy, or
          other metal or alloy, be connected as shown in the drawings,
          the devices will act as a practical electrical rectifier of
          impressed alternating currents. Refering to the drawings in
          Figure 4, the alternating current is sent through the strip 1
          from c to d, in one-half of the cycle, and from d it enters
          the solenoid S, being an air-core or a core of magnetic
          material, thence after passing through the solenoid it returns
          to the alternating current source. In the other half of the
          cycle the operation is, of course, reversed. </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 4 also shows the method of stacking many
          plates 1,2 and 3 on top of one another, with suitable
          insulation between, and then connecting the positive "Hall"
          effect potential point of one plate to the negative "Hall"
          effect potential point of the one below, as represented in the
          drawings at e, f, g, h, i, and j. In other words, the
          transverse potential of all the plates 1,2 and 3 are put in
          series in order to add up to larger values of potential than
          would be obtained with a single plate. </p>
        <p align="left">It is obvious, that since the polarity of the
          "Hall" effect potential difference changes in synchronism with
          either the change in polarity of the points c and d, or with
          the change in direction of the magnetic flux through the
          plate, the polarity of the point e, j (Figure 4) will always
          be the same with respect to each other when both the magnetic
          flux and also the longitudinal current through the plates
          change in phase synchronously with each other, The arrangement
          shown in Figure 4 will then obviously give a pulsating direct
          current at the point e, j. </p>
        <p align="left">The construction of the apparatus of my
          invention is more clearly illustrated in Figure 1 where the
          metallic films have been represented at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
          separated by insulated sheets 7. Opposite ends of the films
          are tapped as represented at c and d. The transverse axes of
          the films are connected in series as represented at e, f ,g,
          h, i, j, k, l, m, and n for delivering a direct current. The
          end view of the apparatus in Figure 2 shows more clearly the
          arrangement of the films and the dielectric sheets. The
          solenoid winding has been divided into two sections for
          producing a transverse magnetic field through the metallic
          films. </p>
        <p align="left">In Figure 3 I have shown a stacked arrangement
          of metallic films separated by insulated sheets in accordance
          with my invention, where the alternating current I passes
          along the longitudinal axes of the films from d to c. I
          provide copper end contacts 8 and 9 which bridge all of the
          metallic films enabling the films to be connected in the
          electrical circuit in parallel. The point contacts across the
          transverse axes of the films have been represented at a and
          a’. </p>
        <p align="left">The device may be used as a rectifier in
          ordinary electrical circuits where the power drawn from the
          rectifier is of sufficiently low value as to render the method
          practicable. The arrangement can also be used as a rectifier
          in radio transmitters and receivers, especially to replace the
          crystal detector or the triode vacuum tube detector in radio
          reception. It could be used either alone or in combination
          with electron tubes, a typical circuit diagram of the latter
          method being given in Figure 5. </p>
        <p align="left">Referring to Figure 5 in more detail the
          receiving antenna system is represented at 10 which connects
          to a ground system at 11 with a coupling inductance 12 therein
          coupled to the tuned input circuit 14 of the electron tube 15
          which functions as a radio frequency amplifier. The output of
          the radio frequency amplification circuit 16 with the input
          circuit of a second stage of radio frequency amplification
          constituted by electron tube 18, the output circuit of which
          includes transformer system 17tuned as represented at 28 for
          supplying exciting current to solenoid S through a series
          circuit which passes through the longitudinal axes of the
          metallic films from points d to c. A direct current is derived
          across the points of contact a and a’ which is directly
          proportional to the incoming signaling energy. The rectified
          current is delivered through a transformer system 20 to the
          input circuit of the electron tube 18 which also functions as
          an audio frequency amplification system delivering its audio
          frequency output through transformer 19 with the input circuit
          of electron tube 15 which serves also to amplify at audio
          frequency delivering its output to telephones T. Battery A
          supplies filament heating current for the several tubes while
          battery B supplies space current for the tubes. The tuned
          system 17-28 permits a relatively large value of current to
          pass through the metallic films and thereby secure maximum
          direct current energy across the transverse axes of the
          metallic films. My invention may be applied to all standard
          circuits as well as to the reflex system of Figure 5. </p>
        <p align="left">Referring to Figure 6 a simplified circuit as
          illustrated showing the application of the principle of my
          invention to a simple radio receiving apparatus. In this
          circuit the incoming signaling energy delivered from tuned
          circuit 14 passes through the longitudinal axes of the
          metallic films from d to c at the same time setting up a
          magnetic field by means of solenoid S for deriving direct
          current across the transverse axes of the metallic films at a
          and a’ proportionate to the incoming signal energy. This
          direct current directly actuates the telephone responsive
          device T. </p>
        <p align="left">It should be noted that, due to the fact that
          this system is a perfect rectifier (that is, it admits of no
          inverse potential or currents in the output) it will produce
          no distortion in the reproduction of radio telephone signals
          and voice, and is, therefore, far superior to either the
          crystal detector or the electron tube from the standpoint of
          faithful reproduction, in addition to its superior qualities
          of stability, ease of operation and lower cost of maintenance.
        </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 7 illustrates a circuit arrangement which
          I employ in the amplification of signaling energy by means of
          the apparatus of my invention. An input circuit has been
          illustrated in the form of an inductive coupler 25 tuned by
          variable condensor 26 and connected through the longitudinal
          axes of the metallic films at d and c. A permanent magnetic
          field may be established about the metallic films by means of
          a local source 21 connected in circuit with the winding S. An
          iron core may be provided for this solenoid S. Incoming
          signaling energy is supplied through winding 27 coupled with
          the windings 25. The transverse axes of the films at a and a’
          are connected in series with a local source 22, and an
          inductance 24 which couples with the inductance system 25. A
          desired degree of regenerative amplification is thus
          introduced for increasing the amplitude of the impulses of
          signaling energy delivered to the output circuit. The
          principle of my invention may be applied to an oscillator
          where the input coil 27 connects to a small local exciter of
          alternating current and the output connected through a
          transformer system. By employing selected values of
          inductance, capacity and resistance the system may be arranged
          to oscillate at either audio or radio frequencies. </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 8 illustrates a method of obtaining
          greater energy amplification in the apparatus of my invention.
          A permanent magnetic flux is set up through the thickness of
          the plates and also a permanent longitudinal current is
          established along the horizontal axes of the plates from a
          battery 28. A tuned input circuit system 27-25-26 is arranged
          to excite the winding s which encloses the stack of
          alternately positioned films and dielectric sheets. The
          longitudinal axes of the films are connected at points a and
          a’ with an output circuit including a source of potential 22,
          and inductance 24. The inductance 24 is inductively coupled to
          an inductance 29 tuned by means of condensor 30 in the output
          circuit of the electrical system. The fluctuating magnetic
          field from the winding S which varies in proportion to the
          amplitude of the signaling energy is superimposed on the
          permanent field which is established. </p>
        <p align="left">The input may also be superimposed on the
          longitudinal current instead of upon the magnetic field. The
          local battery for supplying longitudinal current to the
          conductive field may thus be eliminated. The local battery 22
          in the circuit of the electrical system is provided to boost
          the voltage of the output to a proper value for the operation
          of the succeeding amplifier stages or the reproducing unit,
          the "Hall" fluctuating potential being then superimposed upon
          this steady potential. By increasing the number of conductive
          films in parallel the effective potential may also be
          increased. </p>
        <p align="left">In Figure 9 I have shown an application of my
          invention to an electron tube circuit where the conductive
          films have their longitudinal axes connected in series in the
          output circuit of electron tube 15. A constant magnetic field
          is supplied from battery 21 to the winding S. In this manner
          the device operates as a radio frequency amplifier, delivering
          amplified energy to an output circuit across the transverse
          axes of the conductive films in series as represented at e and
          j, the output circuit including battery 22 and solenoid
          winding S’. The solenoid winding S’ connects in series with
          the longitudinal axes of conductive films as represented at c’
          and d’ and across the transverse axes at a and a’ I connect
          the output circuit which includes the battery 22. The
          arrangement of the conductive films within the solenoid
          winding S’ serves as a rectifier of amplified energy delivered
          by the conductive films within the solenoidal winding S’. </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 10 shows a method I may employ for
          setting up the magnetic field which threads through the
          conductive films. A pair of compressed silicon steel filing
          cores or other suitable magnetic material or alloys are
          arranged on opposite sides of the stack of alternately
          positioned conductive films and dielectric sheets. On these
          coils are provide the windings S2 and S3 supplied from the
          local source 21. The stack of bismuth or metallic alloy
          conductive films may be quite thick but the magnetic field is
          concentrically normal to the plane of the conductive films.
          The magnetic field in some cases is produced by a solenoidal
          coil of approximately 1000 turns on cores of compressed
          silicon steel filings. The resultant transverse pulsating
          direct current is several volts for only one milliampere
          flowing through the field coil and longitudinally through the
          conductive films in parallel. I have found that where four
          amperes alternating current at 60 cycle frequency is passed
          through a 12 turn coil and then through the conductive films
          connected in parallel with themselves longitudinally, the
          resulting pulsating direct current component across each
          conductive films is approximately 50 microvolts. When the
          conductive films above referred to are connected in series
          transversely 200 microvolts may be obtained. The values
          obtainable may readily be used in the operation of electron
          tubes. The arrangement of the apparatus is such that
          connections may be readily made with electron tube circuits as
          represented at Figure 9 without their interposition of
          transformer systems. </p>
        <p align="left">When an iron core is used with the device of my
          invention with the proper permeability curve an asymmetric
          characteristic curve may be obtained with the device similar
          to that obtained with a triode tube. This ability of the
          device of my invention facilitates the generation of
          self-oscillations in the device. The device when properly
          connected will, therefore, operate as an amplifier or as an
          oscillator in addition to its properties as a rectifier. </p>
        <p align="left">While I have described my invention in certain
          preferred embodiments, I desire that it be understood that
          various modifications may be made without departing from the
          spirit of the appended claims. </p>

          <br>
          Abstract: The Hall Effect in bismuth for a magnetic field
          strength of from 0.07 to 1.00 gauss was accurately determined
          by improved methods. Production of the bismuth films. Various
          methods for obtaining excessively thin, homogeneous bismuth
          films were tried and compared, such as casting,
          electroplating, evaporating, sputtering, and metallic
          spraying, of which the last three methods were particularly
          successful. Measurement of very low voltages. By refinements
          made in the potentiometer and measuring circuits readings to
          one-tenth microvolt were accurate and reproducible. Magnitude
          of the Hall Effect at low fields. A curve is plotted showing
          the rapid decrease in the value of -R between 0.07 and 0.30
          gauss, and comparison is made with the higher values of field
          strength. It is noted that by putting the Hall potential of
          one film in series with one or more other films we obtain
          comparatively high values of the Hall e. m. f. which may be
          applied to great advantage as an alternating current rectifier
          in radio and similar applications.<br>

          Heaps, C. W.<br>
          <br>
          The Hall coefficient for a bismuth plate of dimensions
          0.011×0.9×2.0 cm has been measured for magnetic fields ranging
          from 0.07 to 2.40 gauss. The average value of the Hall
          coefficient, R, in this range was 11.5, and variations of R
          due to change of field strength in this range were less than
          experimental errors. For larger fields the Hall coefficient of
          this specimen decreased from 13.5 for a field of 650 gauss to
          5.9 for a field of 8600. It is concluded that for similar
          ranges of field the data reported by Palmer H. Craig are
          erroneous, probably because of insulation leakage or
          uncompensated thermomagnetic effects. A simple method of
          making very thin bismuth plates is described. <br>

          conducting plates 1, 2, 3 arranged in parallel and separated
          by insulating-sheets and thence through a solenoid S producing

          The present work describes the growth of the first thin (0.1–2
          µm) epitaxial films of pure bismuth using
          molecular-beam-epitaxy techniques. These structures were grown
          at elevated temperatures on single-crystal barium fluoride
          substrates of &lt;111&gt; orientation. Electron-microscope
          observations show the films to be featureless and defect free
          on the scale of 0.1 µm. The films grow with their trigonal
          axis parallel to the &lt;111&gt; axis of the substrate, and
          Laue-backscattering pictures show they are epitaxial.
          Mobilities at room temperature are on the order of 2 m2 V-1
          s-1, and increase to over 10 at 20 K and 100 at liquid-helium
          temperatures. These values are far superior to those of other
          bismuth films grown to date, and approach mobilities observed
          in single-crystal bismuth. Further evidence of their
          single-crystal nature is given by the temperature-dependent
          resistivity below 6K, which is more akin to that of a bulk
          single crystal, rather than polycrystal, bismuth, and by the
          thickness dependence of the film mobilities, which are limited
          by scattering on film boundaries. The carrier density, as
          deduced from Hall measurements, is in the range (4–8)×1024 m-3
          at room temperature and decreases as the temperature is
          lowered, becoming constant below about 50 K at approximately
          5×1023 m-3. We also observe Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in
          the resistivity and Hall coefficient at 4.2 and 0.4 K. The
          carrier density calculated from the period of these
          oscillations correlates well with that found from Hall
          measurements.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

        </p>
        <p align="left">Thin bismuth films modify their structure under
          the influence of conducting electrons<br>
          <br>
          The poorly conducting semi-metal bismuth assumes completely
          different crystal structures in thin films than in bulk form.
          The structure of the layers, distance between layers and
          number of layers appear to be formed such that exactly one
          standing wave of conducting electrons can develop. FOM PhD
          researcher Tjeerd Bollmann and his colleagues at the
          University of Twente discovered this when they grew ultra-thin
          bismuth films on a nickel substrate. Thin bismuth films are
          therefore probably far better conductors than the bulk
          crystal. The researchers published their unexpected result
          online today in Physical Review Letters.<br>
          <br>
          Now the researchers have observed this phenomenon in thin
          bismuth films as well. They were surprised to discover that
          bismuth grows with an uneven number of layers at once: the
          Fermi wavelength of bismuth in bulk is about one hundred times
          greater than that of lead and so layers of bismuth just a few
          atoms thick were not expected to influence the Fermi
          wavelength at all. However, they did. Using a low-energy
          electron microscope, the researchers could see that the layers
          in a thin bismuth film had a distinctly different crystal
          structure than the bulk crystal. This crystal structure is
          always in balance with the distance between layers in the film
          and the Fermi wavelength: the bismuth modifies its structure
          and with that the distance between layers such that the total
          film thickness (of three or five layers) equals a multiple of
          the Fermi wavelength associated with the structure concerned.<br>
          <br>
          Bismuth is an ambiguous material at several levels. A piece of
          bismuth ’hovers’ between being a metal or a semiconductor and
          is therefore termed a ‘semi-metal’. It has now been
          demonstrated that in thin films, bismuth modifies its
          structure, density and distance between layers, to maximise
          the energetic advantage that can be obtained from standing
          Fermi waves with a wavelength far smaller than in the bulk
          material. The researchers expect that the structures found in
          the thin bismuth films are far better conductors than ordinary
          bismuth. Other physical and chemical properties of the newly
          discovered crystal structures probably differ from those in
          the bulk bismuth as well. The researchers aim to study these
          properties by means of controlled growth.<br>

          Figure 1. Wavelength adjusts to film thickness<br>
          The distances between two layers in a bismuth film of three
          layers (green dotted lines) are not the same as those in a
          film of five layers (blue lines).The Fermi wavelength that is
          associated with the three-layer bismuth fits exactly 2.5 times
          in the total film thickness. For five layers the distance
          between layers is slightly smaller. Here the associated Fermi
          wavelength fits exactly four times in the total film
          thickness.<br>

          Abstract -- Transformations in a nanosized bismuth layer are
          studied by means of optical spectroscopy, microscopy, and
          gravimetry, depending on the thickness (d = 3–120 nm), thermal
          treatment temperature (T = 373–673 K) and time (t] = 0.05–2500
          min). It is established that, depending on the initial
          thickness of the bismuth films and the thermal treatment
          temperature, the kinetic curves of the degree of
          transformation are satisfactorily described within linear,
          inverse logarithmic, cubic, and logarithmic laws. The contact
          potential difference for the Bi, Bi2O3 films and the
          photo-electromotive force for the Bi-Bi2O3 systems is
          measured. An energy-band diagram for the Bi-Bi2O3 systems is
          constructed. A model for the thermal transformation of Bi
          films that includes the stage of oxygen adsorption, the
          redistribution of charge carriers in the Bi-Bi2O3 contact
          field, and the formation of bismuth(III) oxide is proposed.<br>

          Abstract -- Magnetoresistance (MR) ratios r=R(B)/R(0) have
          been measured in parallel fields on a polycrystalline
          heat-treated bismuthfilm at different temperatures. MR ratios
          vs. B's exhibit “maximums” followed by decreases, described by
          a B-1 law. Electron Fermi energies have been extracted. The MR
          data are explained using a Landau tube “sweeping” model and a
          MR expression of Pippard and of Fawcett. There is a second
          maximum in the MR ratios at View the MathML source followed by
          a second decrease. This second decrease could arise from the
          “sweeping” of the next lowest Landau tubes outside the Fermi
          surface of the single hole pocket.<br>

            Threshold of Bismuth Films of Measured Thickness</span><br>
          Weber, Alfred H.; Eisele, Louis J.<br>
          <br>
          The photoelectric threshold wave-length change with thickness
          in aged bismuth films deposited on Pyrex at room temperature
          in vacuum is investigated further with some important
          modifications in apparatus and method including measurement of
          the average film thickness and extension of the temperature
          range in which the DuBridge analysis is applied. The data show
          that the bismuth films are characterized by: (1), an initial
          value of the threshold wave-length (2497A average) fairly
          independent of film thickness for the first 44 atom layers;
          (2), a definite shift toward higher threshold wave-lengths
          occurring between 44 and 111 atom layers thickness; followed
          by (3), a steady increase of threshold wave-length with film
          thickness above about 111 atom layers. These results are in
          general agreement with the previous preliminary work but show
          some differences which are discussed briefly. <br>

          Bismuth films (200-1400 Å) were grown epitaxially on freshly
          cleaved mica substrates. These films consisted of a mosaic of
          equally oriented crystallites averaging several microns in
          diameter. The plane of the films coincided with the trigonal
          plane of Bi. We have studied the thickness dependence of the
          resistivity, the Hall coefficient, and the transverse
          magneto-resistance, by gradually varying the thickness of a
          single film which was kept under high vacuum during the entire
          experiment. The resistivity at 360 and 77 °K is a smooth
          monotonic function of the thickness. At 12 °K, we observed
          small oscillations in the resistivity and in the
          magnetoresistance. These oscillations are regarded as probable
          manifestations of the quantum size effect (QSE). The thickness
          dependence of the Hall coefficient is in striking disagreement
          with the predictions of the infinite-potential-well model.
          Better agreement between the theory and experimental results
          is obtained when we assume a less rigid boundary condition.
          Also for several films we have investigated the temperature
          dependence of these three transport coefficients and found it
          to be quite different from that of bulk bismuth. We have
          attempted to explain these results in terms of the behavior of
          the carrier concentration and of the different scattering
          mechanisms that can come into play in these films.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Measuring the thickness of a
            thin film of bismuth for Hall Effect experiment.</span><br>
          <br>
          Hello there,<br>
          I'm an undergrad in my 3rd year and i'm doing an investigation
          into the 'Preparation of Thin Films and their use in Hall
          Effect measurements. <br>
          We are making thin films of bismuth on glass (with pre drilled
          terminals) in a vacuum system.<br>
          The way they suggest measuring the thickness is by measuring
          the mass of the film, although they are quick to point out
          that the scales arent the most accurate and will only give a
          very rough approximation.<br>
          One way I know read would work would be to have a rectangular
          / square segment of bismuth and measure its resistance,
          although im not entirely sure how to go about this from a
          practical perspective as the shape of the bismuth film isnt
          rectangular, is it possible to do this for any shape provided
          you can easily calculate the area?<br>
          <br>
          What other methods would there be to calculate the thickness.
          We were told we could request any equipment within reason, I
          doubt they would give us high tech expensive spectroscopy
          equipment for example, however if you know of any reasonably
          accurate and not overly technical, as im only an average 3rd
          year undergrad, then I can at least ask and find out if its
          possible.<br>

          Effect experiment.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          Numerically, you can compute resistance for any shape, but you
          basically need to do finite element analysis. If you're
          comfortable with programming, it's not that hard to do.<br>
          <br>
          If you place an coil next to thin conductor film and apply AC,
          the inductance of the coil at different frequencies will
          depend on the thickness of the material, so long as the film
          is thinner than the skin layer at that frequency. This could
          give you precision of about 1% in measuring the thickness if
          you set it up right, and all you'd need is an oscilloscope and
          a function generator.<br>

          Abstract:<br>
          BiOCH3COO and EDTA-4Na were dissolved in 2 mol/dm3 CH3COOH-2
          mol/dm3 CH3COONa buffer solution, and was adjusted to pH4.1 by
          adding 2 mol/dm3 CH3COOH or 2 mol/dm3 CH3COONa. 100 cm3 of
          this electrolyte was used. Electroplated film was obtained in
          the range of 10-100 mA/cm2. Sono-electroplating was carried
          out smoothly, because the mass transfer accelerated with
          ultrasonic agitation and Bi ion was supplied to electrode
          surface. The mass transfer and crystallization processes were
          most affected with micro-jet and shock wave pressure. Best
          conditions of sono-electroplating were 0.10 mol/dm3 BiY-, pH
          4.0-5.5, 298 K and 10 mA/cm2. Exchange current density and
          reaction rate constant in the sonication increased compared
          with that in the stationary state. As for this, an electron
          reaction became fast by the micro-jet or a shock wave
          pressure. The plated film was smoothness and denseness in
          sonication compared with that in stationary state. It was
          concluded that main factor that the surface became smooth was
          shock wave pressure. [DOI: 10.1380/ejssnt.2009.688]<br>

          Abstract -- Bismuth is a semimetal with unusual transport
          properties, such as long mean free path and large
          magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Here we report on the influence
          of deposition potential, Bi(III) concentration, and thickness
          on the microstructure and morphology of bismuth thin films.
          Polycrystalline bismuth films were deposited on gold from
          bismuth nitrate solution. The texture of the films is strongly
          dependent on deposition potential and Bi(III) concentration,
          but only weakly dependent on film thickness. The film
          morphology is strongly dependent on deposition potential and
          on film thickness. The magnetoresistance (MR) of the
          as-deposited films was highly dependent film morphology and
          grain size. Understanding the structure-property relationships
          is an important first step in optimizing the transport
          properties of as-deposited films and patterned features.<br>

          Abstract -- A study on the preparation and characterisation of
          ex situ formed bismuth film microelectrodes (BiFMEs) is
          presented, focusing in particular on their stable and reliable
          stripping electroanalytical performance. The potentiostatic
          pre-plating of the bismuth film onto a single carbon fibre
          substrate microelectrode was investigated and optimised with
          the aim of achieving long-term electrochemical and mechanical
          film stability. Several important film preparation parameters,
          such as plating agent, potential and time, and composition of
          the plating solution were examined with respect to the current
          signals of 40 consecutive adsorptive cathodic stripping
          voltammetry (AdCSV) measurements of trace Co(II) as model
          analyte. A comparison, also presented, of the stripping
          performance between bismuth and mercury film microelectrodes
          revealed a distinct practical advantage of the BiFME. The
          resulting optimised BiFME exhibited, besides excellent
          long-term film functional stability, attractive stripping
          analytical performance. Employing AdCSV with square-wave
          voltammetric detection, highly linear behaviour was obtained
          in the examined concentration range, with limits of detection
          of 70 and 90 ng/l and excellent reproducibility with 2.4 and
          2.9% relative standard deviation at the 1 µg/l level (n = 10),
          for Co(II) and Ni(II), respectively, achieved using only 2 min
          preconcentration time in the presence of dissolved oxygen. In
          addition, the performance of the proposed ex situ prepared
          BiFME in both anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) of Cd(II) and
          Pb(II) and in AdCSV of Co(II) and Ni(II) from the same test
          solution is demonstrated. The ex situ prepared BiFME
          represents a promising non-toxic, environmentally friendly
          microsensor for detection at microlocations and in
          microvolumes, in particular where in situ bismuth film
          electrode preparation is inappropriate, inconvenient or
          impossible.<br>

          Abstract : Arrays of 10 to 120 nm diameter single crystalline
          bismuth nanowires have been formed inside amorphous alumina
          templates. Since bismuth has a small effective mass compared
          to other materials, significant quantum mechanical confinement
          is expected to occur in wires with diameter less than 5O
          microns. The subbands formed by quantum confinement cause
          interesting modifications to the dielectric function of
          bismuth, This study measures the dielectric function of
          bismuth nanowires in an energy range where the effects of
          quantum confinement are predicted (0.05 to 0.5 eV). Using
          Fourier transform infrared reflectometry, the dielectric
          constant as a function of energy is obtained for the
          alumina/bismuth composite system. Effective medium theory is
          used to subtract the effect of the alumina template from the
          measurement of the composite material, thus yielding the
          dielectric function of bismuth nanowires. A strong absorption
          peak is observed at approx. 1000/cm in the frequency dependent
          dielectric function in the photon energy range measured. The
          dependence of the frequency and intensity of this oscillator
          on incident light polarization and wire diameter are reviewed.
          In addition the dependence of the optical absorption on
          antimony and tellurium doping of the nanowires are reported.<br>

          Abstract -- This article critically reviews the field of the
          recently introduced bismuth-film electrodes (BFEs). Topics
          include the substrate materials, the methods of forming the
          bismuthfilm and cleaning the electrodes, detection techniques,
          interferences and potential target analytes. Finally, it
          discusses the future prospects and the scope for BFEs in
          electroanalysis.<br>

            of Evaporated Bismuth Films</span><br>

          The electrical conductance of Bi films evaporated on Pyrex in
          high vacuum was measured when the films were "dark" and when
          illuminated with 2537A radiation. A photo-conductance effect
          was observed for all films less than about 292 atom layers
          thick whether the Bi was deposited at room temperature or at
          liquid-air temperature. The photo-conductance effect
          disappears with increasing film thickness much more rapidly
          for films kept at liquid-air temperature than for those at
          room temperature. For films deposited discontinuously (that
          is, successive layers are allowed to age), the effect
          disappears at about 11 atom layers thickness for liquid
          air-temperature-deposited films and at about 172 atom layers
          thickness for room-temperature-deposited films. The
          experiments definitely point to the conclusion that true
          photo-conductance is not present in these films, that the
          films which exhibit photo-conductance are patch-like in
          structure; therefore, the observed photo-conductance is
          assigned to photo-electric emission between film patches.<br>

        <p align="left">Critical magnetic fields of ultrathin bismuth
          films</p>
        <p align="left">Critical transverse magnetic fields were
          measured in bismuth films 70 to 18 A thick. It was found that
          for the temperature range (5--1.8/sup 0/K) and fields
          investigated the relation H/sub C/(T) is linear in bismuth
          layers freshly condensed on a liquid-helium-cooled substrate.
          The slope dH/sub c//dT increases the film thickness decreases,
          attaining a value of 95,000 Oe/deg for the thinnest films.
          This increase is correlated with the increase in film
          resistivity, i.e., with the reduction in the mean free path of
          the conduction-band electrons. The value of the factor A
          obtained from the value of the critical magnetic field for a
          film about 20 A thick (H/sub C/ =Ax10/sup 4/ T/sub C/) is 9.5.
          Thus, in ultrathin bismuth films the critical magnetic field
          is much higher than the paramagnetic limit. This behavior is
          explained by the large spin--orbit scattering in
          freshly-deposited ultrathin bismuth films. When the thickness
          of the bismuth film decreases from 40 to 10 A, the density of
          states falls off by approximately a factor of two.<br>

            Directly Heated Bismuth Film Electrodes Based on Gold
            Microwires</span><br>
          <br>
          As a nontoxic substitute for mercury electrodes, bismuth
          electrodes attained a lot of attention during the last years.
          In this report we describe for the first time the preparation
          of two different directly heatable bismuth-modified microwire
          electrodes. We characterized the electrochemical behaviour
          using cyclic voltammetry in acetate buffer and alkaline
          tartrate solution. The bismuth electrodes show a significantly
          wider potential window compared with bare gold wires. In the
          presence of picric acid as one example for the detection of
          explosives, the bismuth electrodes deliver higher signals. By
          applying heat during the measurements, the signals can be
          enhanced further. We used the temperature pulse amperometry
          (TPA) technique to improve the electrochemical response at the
          different types of electrodes. In this preliminary study, we
          were able to detect 3 ppm traces of picric acid.<br>
