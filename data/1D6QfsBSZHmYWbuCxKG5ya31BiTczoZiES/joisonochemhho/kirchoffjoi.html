      JOI Scientific claims to be able to produce hydrogen on the spot
      with very little energy input.The energy is only used at the start
      the process and enough hydrogen is produced to sustain the
      reaction and produce surplus hydrogen. The big question is: they
      claim a small electrical input triggers a chemical reaction. What
      consumable is used in the chemical reaction?<br>
      <br>
      They are not revealing much information until 2016 about the
      process and are busy doing another funding round.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention generally relates to efficient
      generation of hydrogen and more specifically to in-situ hydrogen
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Water is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen
      by mass or volume. Decomposed by any means, two moles of water
      will produce one mole of oxygen gas (02) and two moles of hydrogen
      gas (H2) at a given input of energy E1. When combined together
      through any means, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water,
      releasing a given output of energy E2. By all known principles of
      physics and chemistry, E1&gt;E2 and thus by thermodynamics the
      process is not favored in direct action. For hydrogen to be useful
      as an energy source and economical to use, a means must be created
      to either reduce the dissociation energy of water, or provide
      energy in some other fashion in the process, for example with
      catalytic enhancement, or all the above.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydrogen can be manufactured by a variety of means
      (including, but not limited to chemical, electrical, thermal,
      radiolysis, etc.) from a variety of chemical substances
      (including, but not limited to, water, hydrocarbons, plants,
      rocks, etc.). In the present invention water is used as the
      hydrogen source and a catalytic combination of electrolysis and
      cavitation is used to generate the hydrogen. The method of
      cavitation may be by a variety of means (acoustical, hydrodynamic
      inertial, non-inertial, mechanical, electromagnetic, etc.), or any
      combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Hydrogen, being the most abundant element on earth as well
      as in the Universe, holds particular promise as a fuel source,
      both on earth as well as in space. Hydrogen can power homes and
      factories, transportation modes (planes, trains, and vehicles).
      Thus, hydrogen can serve to eliminate carbon fuels completely in
      the electrical cycle, thus bringing about a net subtraction by the
      contribution of anthropomorphic processes to terrestrial climate
      change. There are four significant “hurdles” cited by numerous
      reviews to the use of hydrogen. Each is noted as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] 1. Production - How to produce massive amounts of hydrogen
      in an efficient, safe, environmentally ‘friendly’ fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] 2. Storage - How to store the low density, flammable gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] 3. Distribution - Hydrogen, being difficult to store, is
      thus difficult to transport.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] 4. Use - How can hydrogen be used is a bigger hurdle in
      light of the prior two items.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Accordingly what is needed is a method and system to
      overcome the problems encountered in the prior art and to provide
      an economical method and apparatus to produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] A method and an apparatus to generate hydrogen gas as H2
      from a hydrogen containing liquid such as water. In one
      embodiment, the structure is a electrolytic cell configured with
      catalytic enhancements to maximize the volume and mass of hydrogen
      produced, and minimize the energy input, thus minimizing cost of
      operation. This device is particularly configured to enhance
      catalytically the decomposition of water and the formation of
      hydrogen gas by: 1) the container apparatus configuration of
      electric and magnetic fields; 2) the use of sonochemistry and
      cavitation; and 3) the use of applicable solutes and solvents in
      the device that change the pH, ionic state, and the chemical
      potential of the device solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The cavitation may be generated by a variety of means
      including but not limited to, acoustic energy, hydrodynamic
      (inertial, non-inertial), mechanical, electromagnetic energy,
      etc., or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] There are four significant “hurdles” cited by numerous
      reviews to the use of hydrogen. Each is noted as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] 1. Production - How to produce massive amounts of hydrogen
      in an efficient, safe, environmentally ‘friendly’ fashion. This
      patent is capable of producing hydrogen from water, and by any
      fashion in its recombination with oxygen to reform water,
      producing no pollution whatsoever and returning water back to its
      original form.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] 2. Storage - How to store the low density, flammable gas.
      This patent eliminates the need for storage, by creating a
      scalable process to generate hydrogen from water in-situ wherever
      it is needed. It thus eliminates the need for dangerous, costly,
      and hazardous storage and transport issues.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] 3. Distribution - Hydrogen, being difficult to store, is
      thus difficult to transport. Again, this patent eliminates the
      need for storage and thus transport, by creating a scalable
      process to generate hydrogen from water in-situ wherever it is
      needed. There is no need for dangerous, costly, and hazardous
      storage, distribution, and transport issues.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] 4. Use - How can hydrogen be used is a bigger hurdle in
      light of the prior two items. With the elimination of those two
      items, the relative cost of the use of fuel cells becomes
      economical even to the middle class. Without the need for
      refueling, or by minimizing the need for refueling, the ability to
      use fuel cells will become ubiquitous to modern life.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A method and apparatus of producing hydrogen is disclosed
      comprising applying an electrical current to flow through an
      aqueous solution. Cavitation is generated within the aqueous
      solution, where the cavitation lowers an amount of energy required
      to break chemical bonds of said aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The foregoing and other features and advantages of the
      present invention will be apparent from the following more
      particular description of the preferred embodiments of the
      invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to an
      apparatus for producing hydrogen gas comprising a container
      adapted to contain an aqueous electrolyte solution containing
      hydrogen, at least one first electrode, wherein the at least one
      first electrode is adapted to be in contact with a solution, at
      least one second electrode, wherein the at least one second
      electrode is adapted to be in contact with a solution, and wherein
      the at least one first electrode is a cylindrically-shaped cathode
      and the at least one second electrode is a cylindrically-shaped
      hollow anode capable of accommodating is the cylindrically-shaped
      cathode within it, and wherein the cylindrically-shaped cathode is
      located along the central axis of the cylindrically-shaped hollow
      anode. Also included in this embodiment of the invention is at
      least a first acoustic transducer per cathode capable of causing
      cavitation in a solution, the at least one first transducer
      transmitting substantially along each cathode's axis; a power
      supply wherein power is supplied to the electrodes and
      transducers; a wave form generator for imposing a wave or other
      function on the power to the transducers; and a gas-liquid
      separation and capturing device.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Another embodiment of the invention additionally comprises
      at least a second acoustic transducer per anode and wherein the
      first and second acoustic transducers are capable of causing
      cavitation in an aqueous solution, said first transducer
      transmitting substantially along the cathodic axis, and said
      second transducer transmitting in a substantially orthogonal
      direction to the first transducer. The first transducer may
      transmit at an acoustic frequency of about <b>38 kHz</b> and the
      second transducer may transmit at about <b>76 kHz.</b><br>
      <br>
      [0022] Another embodiment of the invention includes a gas-liquid
      separation and capturing device that may be selected from the
      group consisting of a tube, a membrane filter, a diffusive
      evaporator, differential pressure and channeling solution flow. If
      the separation device includes a tube, then the tube has a
      different dielectric than that of the surrounding solution and is
      located between the anode and cathode. The tube may also surround
      the cathode and contain and guide gas bubbles to the gas
      separation and capturing device. The tube may also have a
      gas-permeable polymer membrane filter disposed within its length.
      Another embodiment of a gas-liquid separation device is a hollow
      fiber membrane filter. The filter is of the two-phase,
      counter-current design whereby a liquid is admitted at a first
      proximal end, and a sweep gas enters a series of parallel,
      interconnected gas-permeable hollow fiber membranes at a second,
      distal end. The dissolved gases in the liquid permeate the fibers
      and are swept up in the sweep gas. Another embodiment of the
      gas-liquid separation device comprises an expansion tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to the
      above apparatus in combination with an aqueous electrolyte
      solution that comprises an effective amount of <b>dissolved noble
        gas, iodide salt</b> or an iodate salt, and one or more <b>organic




        acids</b>.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to the
      apparatus wherein a wave form is superimposed on the transducer
      power, and a preferred function is a <b>sine wave.</b> In the
      embodiments of the invention where two orthogonally-directed
      transducers transmit into the cell, the individual waveforms from
      the first and second transducers collide in the region between the
      cathode and anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a
      cathode and anode that are arranged in pairs. A further embodiment
      includes more than one cathode may be matched with a single anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Another embodiment of the invention additionally comprises
      an electrolyte recirculation circuit whereby the electrolyte may
      be circulated using a fluid pump between the individual cells of a
      multi-cell unit. The recirculation circuit may also include a
      nozzle for directing electrolyte fluid towards the cathode, and an
      expansion tank or pressure blow-off valve for separating gas from
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a system
      for generating electricity comprising the hydrogen generating
      apparatus in combination with one of an electrical generator, a
      fuel cell, and a hydrogen-burning internal combustion engine.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0052] It should be understood that these embodiments are only
      examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings
      herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the
      present application do not necessarily limit any of the various
      claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to some
      inventive features but not to others. In general, unless otherwise
      indicated, singular elements may be in the plural and vice versa
      with no loss of generality.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In this patent the following definitions apply when these
      words are used:<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Cavitation—Cavitation is the phenomenon of formation
      (irregardless of mechanism) of vapor bubbles in a fluid, in the
      region where the pressure of the fluid falls below its vapor
      pressure. Cavitation can be divided into two classes of behavior:
      inertial (or transient) cavitation, and non-inertial cavitation.
      Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a
      liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Non-inertial
      cavitation is the process where a bubble in a fluid is forced to
      oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy (such as
      acoustic fields) input.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Acoustic Energy—For the purposes of this patent, ultrasonic
      acoustic energy refers to those frequencies from 16 kHz up to and
      including 2 mHz. “Power ultrasound” is commonly understood to
      include the frequency range of from 20 kHz to 100 kHz which is
      where cavitation occurs. Above 1000 kHz ultrasound is useful
      primarily for clinical imaging. Also for the purposes of this
      patent, acoustic energy, as well as any radiation of any frequency
      or wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum, may be employed as
      a single frequency (wavelength) or any frequency combination
      thereof (as a discrete sum, difference, harmonics, sub-harmonics,
      overtones, series, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The term “extractor” is used interchangeably with
      “apparatus” to indicate the hydrogen production
      sonoelectrochemical cell embodiments described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] “Electrolysis” as it is used herein refers to Applicants'
      general protocol for producing hydrogen, but use of the term is
      not an admission that the process is equivalent to the
      conventionally understood term. In point of fact, Applicants have
      demonstrated herein that the hydrogen is produced by a
      sonoelectrochemical process, and not that of pure electrolysis.
      However, the term “electrolysis” is sometimes used to refer in
      shorthand manner to the sonoelectrochemical hydrogen production
      process developed hereunder.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The term “extractor” is used interchangeably with
      “apparatus” to indicate the hydrogen production cell embodiments
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The following examples are illustrations of the embodiments
      of the inventions discussed herein, and should not be applied so
      as to limit the appended claims in any manner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>First Embodiment of Hydrogen Production System</b><br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 1 is a cross sectional side view of the hydrogen
      production system 100 according to the present invention. Hydrogen
      production system 100 consists of a container apparatus 102 in the
      fashion of an electrolytic cell capable of storing a volume of a
      solution 160. Solution 160 is comprised of a solvent and solute.
      The solvent is preferably water or another aqueous solution
      containing hydrogen. The solute is a chemical compound capable of
      carrying an electrical charge i.e. an electrolyte. The sides of
      container apparatus 102 are preferably non-electrically
      conductive. Two electrically-conductive pieces 130 and 132 are
      held above the bottom member 105 of container apparatus 120 by
      supporting members 106 and 108, respectively. The
      electrically-conductive piece 130 is connected to the negative
      terminal 112 of power supply 110. Thus, the
      electrically-conductive piece 130 is a cathode. Likewise, the
      electrically conductive piece 132 is connected to the positive
      terminal 114 of power supply 110. Thus, the
      electrically-conductive piece 132 is an anode. A hollow,
      cylindrical tube 120 is connected to and passes though top member
      104 of container apparatus 102. The bottom of tube 120 is flared
      outward and positioned so that the bottom of tube 120 is below the
      bottom of cathode 130 but not touching bottom member 105 of
      container apparatus 102. Likewise, a hollow, cylindrical tube 122
      is connected to and passes through top member 104 of container
      apparatus 102. The bottom of tube 122 is flared outward and
      positioned so that the bottom of tube 122 is below the bottom of
      anode 132 but not touching bottom member 105 of container
      apparatus 102. Finally, a transducer 140 is connected to one side
      of container apparatus 102. Wires 142 connect transducer 140 to
      power supply 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As previously mentioned, power supply 110 causes cathode
      130 to be negatively charged and anode 132 to be positively
      charged. As a result, an electrical current is created between
      cathode 130 and anode 132. The electrical current electrolyzes
      solution 160 and causes hydrogen to form around cathode 130 and
      oxygen to form around anode 132. Tube 120 funnels the hydrogen out
      of container apparatus 102 for use further use (shown by arrow
      150), such as to provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cells or to
      directly power an engine. Likewise tube 122 funnels the oxygen out
      of container apparatus 102 (shown by arrow 155). As solution 160
      is electrolyzed and the constituent gases are removed from the
      system 100, additional solution can be added through an inlet 170.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Transducer 140 produces acoustic energy waves 144 which
      transmit through and cause cavitation in solution 160. This
      cavitation decreases the energy required to break the chemical
      bonds of solution 160. As a result, in the presence of cavitation,
      a greater amount of hydrogen is produced at cathode 130 at a given
      voltage than in the absence of cavitation. Alternatively, in the
      presence of cavitation, the same amount of hydrogen is produced at
      cathode 130 at a lower voltage than in the absence of cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Hydrogen production system 100 is designed to be portable.
      In one embodiment, hydrogen production system 100 is sized
      approximately 8″ in length by 8″ in width by 8″ in height so that
      it can fit as an engine component in a vehicle. However, it is
      clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production system
      100 and its components can be scaled larger or smaller without
      affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention. Likewise,
      it is clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production
      system 100 and its components can take on many different shapes
      without affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention.
      FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of the present invention where
      container apparatus 102 is shaped to allow maximum transmittal of
      sound waves 144 though solution 160. Finally, it is clear to one
      skilled in the art that any number of transducers 140 may be
      placed at various locations on container apparatus 102 and used to
      produce acoustic energy waves 144 in order to maximize the
      creation of cavitation within solution 160.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Second Embodiment of Hydrogen Production System</b><br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 2 is a cross sectional side view of another
      embodiment, referred to as hydrogen production system 200, of the
      present invention. Hydrogen production system 200 consists of a
      container apparatus 202 in the fashion of an electrolytic cell
      capable of storing a solution 160. The sides of container
      apparatus 102 are preferably non-electrically conductive. A
      hollow, cylindrical, electrically conductive piece 230 is held
      above the bottom member 207 of container apparatus 202 by
      supporting members 232. A second electrically conductive member
      234 is held above the bottom member 207 of container apparatus 202
      by supporting member 205. Electrically conductive piece 230 is
      connected to the positive terminal 214 of power supply 210. Thus,
      electrically conductive piece 230 is an anode. Likewise,
      electrically conductive piece 234 is connected to the negative
      terminal 212 of power supply 210. Thus, electrically conductive
      piece 234 is a cathode. A hollow, cylindrical tube 220 is
      connected to and passes through top member 206 of container
      apparatus 202. The bottom of tube 220 is flared outward and
      positioned so that some portion of cathode 234 is within the tube
      220. Finally, a transducer 240 is connected to one side of
      container apparatus 202. Wires 242 connect transducer 240 to power
      supply 210.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Power supply 210 causes cathode 234 to be negatively
      charged and anode 230 to be positively charged. As a result, an
      electrical current is created between cathode 234 and anode 230.
      The cylindrical shape of anode 230 and the position of cathode 234
      along the axis of anode 230 takes advantage of the electrical
      field produced by cathode 234 and anode 230 and helps to maximize
      the flow of electricity between cathode 234 and anode 230.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] As previously described, the electrical current flowing
      between cathode 234 and anode 230 electrolyzes solution 160 and
      causes hydrogen to form around cathode 234 and oxygen to form
      around anode 230. Tube 250 funnels the hydrogen out of container
      apparatus 202 for further use (shown by arrow 250). Referring to
      FIG. 3, a conical piece 310 is placed on top of anode 230. Conical
      piece 310 funnels oxygen out of container apparatus 202 (shown by
      arrow 340). Referring back to FIG. 2, as solution 160 is
      electrolyzed and the constituent gases are removed from the system
      100, additional solution can be added through an inlet 280.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Hydrogen production system 200 is the same as hydrogen
      production system 100 in that transducer 240 produces sound waves
      244 which transmit through and cause cavitation in solution 160.
      This cavitation decreases the energy required to break the
      chemical bonds of solution 160 via electrolysis. As a result, in
      the presence of cavitation, a greater amount of hydrogen is
      produced at cathode 234 at a given voltage than in the absence of
      cavitation. Alternatively, in the presence of cavitation, the same
      amount of hydrogen is produced at cathode 234 at a lower voltage
      than in the absence of cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Hydrogen production system 200 is designed to be portable.
      In one embodiment, hydrogen production system 200 is sized
      approximately 8″ in length by 8″ in width by 8″ in height so that
      it can fit as an engine component in a vehicle. However, it is
      clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production system
      200 and its components can be scaled larger or smaller without
      affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention. Likewise,
      it is clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production
      system 200 and its components can take on many different shapes
      without affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention.
      FIG. 2 shows one embodiment of the present invention where
      container apparatus 202 is shaped to allow maximum transmittal of
      acoustic energy waves 244 though solution 160. Finally, it is
      clear to one skilled in the art that numerous transducers 240 may
      be placed at various locations on container apparatus 202 and used
      to produce acoustic energy waves 244 in order to maximize the
      creation of cavitation within solution 160.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Third Embodiment of Hydrogen Production System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0069] FIG. 4 is a cross sectional side view of another
      embodiment, referred to as hydrogen production system 400, of the
      present invention. Hydrogen production system 400 consists of a
      cylindrically-shaped container apparatus 402 in the fashion of an
      electrolytic cell capable of storing a solution 160. Container
      apparatus 402 has an electrically conductive inner wall 403 and a
      non-electrically conductive outer wall 470. An electrically
      conducive piece 430 is held above the bottom member 407 of
      container apparatus 402 by supporting member 405. Electrically
      conductive inner wall 403 is connected to the positive terminal
      414 of power supply 410. Thus, conductive inner wall 403 is an
      anode. Electrically conductive piece 430 is connected to the
      negative terminal 412 of power supply 410. Thus, electrically
      conductive piece 430 is a cathode. A hollow, cylindrical tube 420
      is connected to and passes through the top member 480 of container
      apparatus 402. The bottom of tube 420 is flared outward and
      position so that some portion of cathode 430 is within tube 420.
      Finally, a transducer 440 is connected to bottom member 407 of
      container apparatus 402. Wires 444 connect transducer 440 to power
      supply 410.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Power supply 410 causes cathode 430 to be negatively
      charged and anode 403 to be positively charged. As a result, an
      electrical current is created between cathode 430 and anode 403.
      The cylindrical shape of anode 403 and the position of cathode 430
      along the axis of anode 403 takes advantage of the electrical
      field produced by cathode 430 and anode 403 and helps to maximize
      the flow of electricity between cathode 430 and anode is 403.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] As previously described, the electrical current flowing
      between cathode 430 and anode 403 electrolyzes solution 160 and
      causes hydrogen to form around cathode 430 and oxygen to form
      around anode 403. Tube 420 funnels the hydrogen out of container
      apparatus 402 for further use (shown by arrow 450).
      Conically-shaped top member 480 of container apparatus 402 funnels
      oxygen out of container apparatus 402 (shown by arrow 455). As
      solution 160 is electrolyzed and the constituent gases are removed
      from the system 400, additional solution can be added through an
      inlet 490.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Hydrogen production system 400 is the same as hydrogen
      production systems 100 and 200 in that transducer 440 produces
      acoustic energy waves 442 which transmit through and cause
      cavitation in solution 160. This cavitation decreases the energy
      required to break the chemical bonds of solution 160 via
      electrolysis. As a result, in the presence of cavitation, a
      greater amount of hydrogen is produced at cathode 430 at a given
      voltage than in the absence of cavitation. Alternatively, in the
      presence of cavitation, the same amount of hydrogen is produced at
      cathode 430 at a lower voltage than in the absence of cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Hydrogen production system 400 is designed to be portable.
      In one embodiment, hydrogen production system 400 is sized
      approximately 8″ in length by 8″ in width by 8″ in height so that
      it can fit as an engine component in a vehicle. However, it is
      clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production system
      400 and its components can be scaled larger or smaller without
      affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention. Likewise,
      it is clear to one skilled in the art that hydrogen production
      system 400 and its components can take on many different shapes
      without affecting the spirit and scope of the present invention.
      Finally, it is clear to one skilled in the art that any number of
      transducers 440 may be placed on container apparatus 402 and used
      to produce sound waves 442 in order to maximize the creation of
      cavitation within solution 160.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Throughout the descriptions of hydrogen production systems
      100, 200, and 400, a cylindrical tube, tube 120, 250, and 420, is
      used to capture hydrogen formed around the cathode and direct the
      hydrogen out of the systems. It will be clear to one skilled in
      the art that tubes 120, 250, and 450 can be replaced by any means
      to capture and direct the hydrogen. Such means include, but are
      not limited to, tubes and similarly shaped conduits, membrane
      filtering, diffusive evaporation, differential pressures, and
      channeling solution flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Embodiments of Cavitation Sub-System</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] Throughout the descriptions of hydrogen production systems
      100, 200, and 400, transducers 140, 240, and 440 are used to
      produce acoustic energy waves 144, 244, and 442 which cause
      cavitation within solution 160. It will be clear to one skilled in
      the art that transducers 140, 240, and 440 can be replaced by any
      means for generating cavitation. Such means for creating
      cavitation include, but are not limited to, acoustic means,
      mechanical means, hydrodynamic means, electromagnetic means, and
      ionizing radiation means.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIGS. 1, 2 and 4 show embodiments of the present invention
      where the cavitation is produced by a specific acoustic means,
      namely, by using a transducer to pass acoustic energy waves
      through solution 160. However, other acoustic means can be used to
      produce the cavitation. It will be understood by one having skill
      in the art that such acoustic means includes, but is not limited
      to, transducers microphones, and speakers.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] An example of a mechanical means to cause cavitation within
      hydrogen production systems 100, 200, and 400 includes, but is not
      limited to, a propeller system contained within container
      apparatus 102, 202, and 402, which causes cavitation as the
      propeller spins on its axis. FIG. 5 shows a cross sectional view
      of such a propeller system. As shown, propeller blades 520 spin
      about the axis of propeller system 510 causing cavitation to be
      produced in solution 160. Propeller system 510 may be powered by
      power source 110, 210, or 410. It will be understood by one having
      skill in the art that other mechanical means can be used to
      produce the cavitation. Such mechanical means include, but are not
      limited to, a propeller system, pistons, shock tubes, and light
      gas guns.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] An example of a hydrodynamic means to cause cavitation
      within hydrogen production systems 100, 200, and 400 includes, but
      is not limited to, the injection of a compressed gas, for example,
      compressed air, into container apparatus 102, 202, and 402 to
      cause cavitation. FIG. 6 shows a cross sectional view of such a
      compressed gas injection system. As shown, compressed gas
      injection system 610 is affixed to container apparatus 102, 202,
      or 402. Compressed gas travels (indicated by arrows 640) from a
      compressor (not shown) through tube 630 to compressed gas
      injection system 610. The compressed gas flows through tubes 620
      and is introduced into solution 160 as bubbles, i.e. cavitation.
      In one embodiment, compressed gas injection system 610 may be
      separated from solution 160 by a porous membrane that permits the
      transfer of the compressed gas through the membrane while
      preventing solution 160 from entering compressed air system 610.
      An example of such a membrane is Gore-Tex. It will be understood
      by those having skill in the art that other hydrodynamic means can
      be used to produce the cavitation. Such hydrodynamic means
      include, but are not limited to, a compressed gas injector system
      and any device capable of transferring momentum into solution 160
      without transferring mass into solution 160, for example, a shock
      plate or paint shaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] An example of an electromagnetic means to cause cavitation
      within the hydrogen production systems 100, 200, and 400 includes,
      but is not limited to, a laser beam directed to pass into solution
      160 so as to produce a shock wave that causes cavitation within
      solution 160. It will be understood by those having skill in the
      art that other electromagnetic means can be used to produce
      cavitation. Such electromagnetic means include, but are not
      limited to, a laser beam, x-rays, gamma rays, high speed
      electrons, electric arc, magnetic compression, plasma generation,
      and electromagnetic radiation arising from any type of electron or
      proton reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Finally, an example of an ionizing radiation means to cause
      cavitation within the hydrogen production systems 100, 200, and
      400 includes, but is not limited to, passing high energy protons
      into solution 160 where cavitation is formed around the protons.
      Generally, ionizing radiation is any radiation that is capable of
      removing an electron from a chemical bond. Therefore, it will be
      understood by those having skill in the art that such ionizing
      radiation means include, but are not limited to, all
      electromagnetic radiation greater in energy than ultraviolet
      radiation and high energy particles such as photons, protons,
      neutrons, and charged and uncharged nuclei.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Throughout the descriptions of hydrogen production systems
      100, 200, and 400, as well as the examples of the various means of
      causing cavitation, cavitation is said to occur within solution
      160. It will be understood by those having skill in the art that
      causing cavitation “within” solution 160 means causing cavitation
      within the electrolytic zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 7 is a diagram of the major factors affecting the
      production of hydrogen according to the present invention.
      Solution factors 710 are the major factors affecting solution 160.
      These solutions factors include a solvent and solute. As
      previously described, the solvent is water or another aqueous
      solution containing hydrogen. The solute is a chemical compound,
      such as acid (such as HI or HCl), base (NaOH), or salt (such as KI
      or NaI), and is held at a particular density per volume of solvent
      in order to maximize the electrical conductivity of the solution.
      The solution has a particular pH, and it is held at a particular
      temperature and pressure, whether in hydrogen production system
      100, 200, or 400, to minimize the energy required to break the
      chemical bonds of the solvent. Finally, the solution has a
      particular ionic and covalent state (chemical potential).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Power factors 720 are the major factors affecting the
      delivery of power to cathodes 130, 234, and 430, and anodes 132,
      230, and 403. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the
      art that the power factors 720 include voltage applied, current
      applied, and total power applied. Additionally, although hydrogen
      production systems 100, 200, and 400 have been shown with a single
      cathode and single anode, it is apparent to one skilled in the art
      that the number of voltage/current applications points can be
      increased without affecting the spirit and scope of the present
      invention. Likewise it is apparent to one skilled in the art that
      the sizes and shapes of cathodes 130, 234, and 430 and anodes 132,
      230, and 403 can change without affecting the spirit and scope of
      the present invention. Finally, it is apparent to one skilled in
      the art that power supplies 110, 210, and 410 can be any power
      producing device, such as a battery, solar panel, or fuel cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Material Composition factors 730 are the major factors
      affecting the materials of the hydrogen production systems 100,
      200, and 400. The materials comprising cathodes 130, 234, and 430,
      and anodes 132, 230, and 403 are selected to maximize electrical
      conductivity. Such materials include, but are not limited to,
      metals such as copper, platinum, and high order non-linear
      crystals including, but not limited to, lithium niobate and
      lithium tantalate.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The catalytic factors 740 employed to enhance and catalyze
      the production of hydrogen are the major factors affecting the
      energy balance within solution 160. The non-energy input catalytic
      factors lowering the necessary electrolytic input energy ΔE1 to
      ΔE2 include but are not limited to: (1) process temperature (as a
      function of ΔEcav, ΔE2, partial molar concentrations of species),
      (2) container properties (composition, shape), (3) solution
      properties (solute/solvent composition [species, concentrations,
      etc.], pH, chemical potential, pressure, catalytic agents added
      [supported catalysts, gases such as noble gases, etc.]), (4)
      electrode properties (composition [elemental, isotopic, chemical],
      shape, microsurface [crystal planes, etc.], macrosurface [holes,
      edges, etc.], and (5) structure of applied electromagnetic field
      [energized, unenergized]).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Referring to Table 1, a set of equations is set forth
      showing that even in the presence of cavitation, the energy
      required to perform the electrolysis of solution 160 to produce
      hydrogen is greater than the energy that is produced when that
      hydrogen is recombined with oxygen. Thus, it is apparent to one
      skilled in the art that the teachings described herein are not
      directed to a perpetual energy device. Rather, because of the net
      energy loss that results from the electrolysis of solution 160,
      energy is introduced into systems 100, 200, and 400 as represented
      by power supplies 110, 210, and 410 to drive the electrolysis and
      catalytic processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 1<br>
      1&nbsp; Electrolysis (decomposition) of water requires energy
      input: Δ Edec 2 H2O (l) → 2 H2 (g) + O2 (g)&nbsp; Δ Edec&nbsp; Δ
      Edec/2 = Δ E1 ---&gt; energy consumed per mole H2O or H2.<br>
      2&nbsp; Formation of water requires energy output: Δ Eform 2 H2
      (g) + O2 (g)→ 2 H2O (l) Δ Eform Δ Eform/2 = Δ E2→ energy released
      per mole H2O or or H2.<br>
      <br>
      3&nbsp; By the First Law of Thermodynamics, electrolysis is not
      fully reversible since the heat and entropy losses cannot be fully
      accounted for. Thus, we have the result: Δ E1 &gt; Δ E2 always. As
      a result, the process of electrolysis/water reformation, as well
      as the process described herein cannot be termed a “Perpetual
      Motion (or Energy) Machine” of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      4&nbsp; The thermodynamic efficiency relation e = Δ E2/Δ E1 × 100%
      gives a guide to the relative efficiency of the electrolysis/water
      reformation process. An eventual efficiency of 80% or more is
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      5&nbsp; Δ E1 (energy consumed per mole H2O or H2 to decompose
      water to H2 gas) may be represented in the present invention by
      the quantity Δ E3, which is: Δ E3 = Δ Eelectrolysis + Δ
      Ecavitation + Δ Eother where the electrolysis term represents only
      the electrical energy input from the electrodes as electrolysis,
      the cavitation term represents only the electrical energy input
      from acoustical energy (or any means) to cause or sustain
      cavitation, and the ‘other’ term represents any energy input for
      heating, cooling, stirring, or&nbsp; measurement. Here energy is
      represented as the total energy (power) input as the function of
      current and voltage by Ohm's Law.<br>
      <br>
      6&nbsp; In the absence of catalytic factors 740, Δ Eelectrolysis~Δ
      E1. However, for the process described herein to be valid, Δ
      Eelectrolysis must be less than Δ E1: Δ E 1 &gt; Δ Eelectrolysis<br>
      since the process described herein is a catalytic process which
      lowers the necessary energy to form hydrogen gas. Thus, the
      overall equation is:&nbsp; [Δ E3 = Δ Eelectrolysis + Δ Ecavitation
      + Δ Eother] &lt; Δ E2&nbsp; which requires the value Δ E3 to
      approach Δ E2. Since Δ E1 &gt; Δ E2&nbsp; always, the equation Δ
      E1 &gt; Δ E3 is valid.<br>
      <br>
      7&nbsp; Generally, there are two kinds of catalytic factors:
      non-energy input catalytic factors which are based on no energy
      input (e.g. electrode materials, configurations, etc.); and energy
      input catalytic factors which are based on energy input (e.g.
      cavitation, heating, cooling, stirring, etc). Examples of both
      kinds of catalytic factors are set forth in catalytic factors 740.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Referring back to FIG. 7, the energy input factors 750
      lowering the electrolytic input energy ΔE1 to ΔE2 include, but are
      not limited to: (1) ΔEother (energy necessary for the temperature
      control and measurement, mechanical, stirring, etc.), and (2)
      ΔEcav (cavitator properties [size, shape, composition],
      configuration [number, density per unit area/volume, etc.], power
      input [f (V, I)], acoustic frequency spectrum input,
      electromagnetic frequency spectrum input). As described above, a
      cavitator can be any device capable of causing cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] It has been advantageously shown that the following factors
      in one embodiment, hydrogen production system 400, greatly
      increase hydrogen production in the present invention: (1) the use
      of a specific acoustical spectrum to maximize cavitation in
      solution 160; (2) the use of sodium or potassium iodide salt in
      solution 160 to maximize the conductivity and chemical potential
      of solution 160; (3) the dissolution of an effective amount of
      noble gas into solution 160, such that the noble gas is completely
      dissolved in the solution, to electromagnetically enhance the
      production of cavitation thus maximizing the generation of
      hydrogen gas—in the present embodiment, the noble gas is
      preferably argon and an effective amount of noble gas to be
      completely dissolved in solution 160 is up to five percent (5%) at
      Standard Temperature and Pressure; (4) the shape and configuration
      of the electrodes, which for hydrogen production system 400
      comprise the electrically conductive inner wall 403 and
      electrically conductive inner piece 430, to (i) maximize the
      mechanical separation of the hydrogen and oxygen gas products and
      (ii) maximize the electrolysis electric field by use of the
      cylindrical electrode configuration (which maximizes the electric
      field by a multiplicative ratio of the inner and outer radii); and
      (5) the shape of the container, for example, hydrogen production
      system 400 comprises an electrically conductive inner wall 403
      contained within an non-electrically conductive outer wall 470 so
      as to electrically isolate the function of the hydrogen production
      system 400 from the outside world.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Likewise, although it is clear to one skilled in the art
      that the solution 160 may be exposed to any temperature and/or
      pressure and that solution 160 may be contained within either a
      sealed or unsealed container, it has been advantageously shown for
      one embodiment, hydrogen system 400, that the hydrogen production
      using the teachings described herein is preferably performed in a
      sealed, but not pressurized, container at approximately Standard
      Temperature and Pressure (STP).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Additionally, it is self evident that the teachings and
      embodiments set forth herein are focused on minimizing the amount
      of input energy while maximizing the output of hydrogen gas. The
      most important factor affecting the total input energy is
      electrolysis voltage. Thus, it is self evident that requiring less
      input voltage for the same given amount (or greater) of hydrogen
      gas generated will result in requiring less input energy, thus,
      less input power. As a result of requiring less input power, the
      input-output thermodynamic difference is minimized and as a result
      a larger fraction of input power can be generated by energy
      sources such as solar cells, recharged batteries, etc., thus
      maximizing overall efficiency and quantity of hydrogen generated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fourth Embodiment of Hydrogen Production System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0091] A fourth embodiment of the invention is the apparatus shown
      in FIGS. 8-11. Apparatus 500 is generally described as having the
      overall configuration and components of an electrolytic cell, with
      the addition of two ultrasound transducers positioned orthogonally
      to each other. It is to be emphasized that the apparatus is not
      used to conduct electrolysis per se, but is used to create a
      sonoelectrochemical reaction process. Therefore, the device is
      called “sonoelectrolytic cell” 500.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] With attention directed to FIG. 8, sonoelectrolytic cell
      500 is shown in angular perspective. In operation,
      sonoelectrolytic cell 500 would be situated inside a container for
      holding liquids such as aqueous electrolyte. However, for purposes
      of clarity the container is omitted from the drawings. The cell is
      comprised of a cylindrical anode 520 mounted on anode support
      plate 525; a cylindrical cathode 530 (best seen in FIGS. 9-10)
      located inside the anode 520; an ultrasonic bottom transducer 540
      mounted under the anode support plate 525 and oriented to transmit
      along the axis of the cathode 530; and a transverse transducer 550
      mounted at a 90 degree angle to the bottom transducer 540. Each
      transducer has a pair of terminals 541a and 541b for positive and
      negative leads, respectively. Not shown in these figures are the
      electronics for driving the transducers, power supply for the
      electrodes, or a gas removing means for removing any evolving
      Hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The supporting skeleton comprises four support plates 510,
      512, 514 and 525. Base support plate 510 has various holes
      therethrough for receiving and/or supporting various structural
      and functional components such as the tie rods 527 and anode 520.
      Lower anode support plate 525 has a stepped cutout 526 that serves
      to support the lower end of anode 520. Upper anode support plate
      512 has a similar cutout that allows the two anode support plates
      512, 525 to “sandwich” the anode when the opposing nuts 528 are
      tightened thereby clamping the anode in place between upper and
      lower anode support plates 512, 525, respectively. Spacer supports
      513 are non-conductive tubes that thread over support rods 527 and
      provide additional structural rigidity to the device. Gas
      collection tube support plate 514 is the fourth support plate and
      is located above the upper anode support plate. It has a cutout
      for the gas collection tube 515, which extends from the top of
      bottom transducer housing 544 to a gas collection tube adapter
      (not shown). Gas collection tube 515 surrounds the inner electrode
      (cathode 530) and is located between the inner diameter of the
      anode and the cathode. In one embodiment the tube may be 1″
      diameter, in another embodiment it is 2″. The functions of the gas
      collection tube 515 are to collect hydrogen gas evolved in the
      electrolyte volume around the cathode 530, to direct the gas
      upwards either entrained in fluid flow or as bubbles, and it may
      also have a focusing effect on the electromagnetic fields
      generated by the electrodes. The support plates may also have
      orienting criteria such as a notch 516. The plates may be oriented
      horizontally as shown, or vertically. The plates in this case are
      made from NYLON® (DuPont, Wilmington, Del.) approximately 1⁄4 inch
      in thickness, although other materials are equally suitable so
      long as they can maintain some structural rigidity. The four
      plates are held in horizontal orientation by four tie rods 527
      which are also NYLON, and are threaded at their ends to accept
      nuts 528. There are also power leads (anode lead (not shown) and a
      cathode lead 532). Cathode power is defined as being negative, and
      the anode is positive. Power to the bottom and transverse
      transducers was applied through twin leads (not shown in this
      embodiment).<br>
      <br>
      [0094] FIGS. 9 and 10 show the anode 520 and gas collection tube
      515 as partially transparent so that the inner cathode may be
      seen. The anode 520 and cathode 530 may be made from any suitable
      electrically conductive metals commonly used in electrolysis. The
      cylindrical anode 520 was made from solid copper pipe having
      dimensions 5.4 cm OD by 5.1 cm ID, and a height of 6 cm; Grainger,
      Copper streamline tube, Fulton, MS Type M NSE/ANSI, 61-G. The
      cathode 530 is two pieces, a central 14-gauge copper wire (2 mm
      OD), and a cylindrical solid copper mesh 533 slipped over it,
      approximately 2 mm OD, 2 mm ID, height 6 cm; 99.9% pure copper
      mesh; 0.010 thick; Stock no. 6095, K&amp;S Engineering, Chicago,
      Ill. The cathode shape is that of a concentric cylinder having a
      fixed diametric ratio of approximately 1:25 relative to and inside
      the anode, as measured according to the inside diameter of the
      outer anode compared to the outside diameter of the inner cathode.
      The cathode was located concentrically along the axis of the
      anodic volume. The copper wire was sourced from Home Depot, and is
      99.9% pure copper wire—14 gauge; 600 volt; VW-1 rated; Issue No.
      YM-680,590.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] FIG. 11 shows how the transverse transducer 550 was
      supported. Transverse transducer housing cap 553 covers and is in
      direct contact with transverse transducer 550. Mesh 551 is
      provided for terminals 541a,b to penetrate. Mesh 551 is glued to
      transverse transducer support plate 555. Cap 553 is similarly
      affixed to plate 555 thereby resulting in transverse transducer
      550 being contained and supported in a vertical manner and aiming
      directly at the side of anode 520. Bottom transducer 540 is
      contained within the bottom transducer housing base 546 and the
      bottom transducer housing cap 544. They are both threaded to
      receive each other. Split ring 543 and mesh 545 support the
      transducer 540. The top of bottom transducer housing cap 544 is
      affixed to the bottom of lower anode support plate 525 so that
      when the bottom transducer housing base 546 is screwed in, it
      retains all the elements snugly.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] A DC power supply (30 volts/3 amps) (3 channel programmable
      BK Precision Model 903) was used to power the sonoelectrolytic
      process. A frequency generator drives the transducers.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The electrolyte used to generate the attached hydrogen
      production data was an aqueous solution of citric acid, NaCl and
      NaI. 121.731 g NaCl, ACS grade reagent, Aqua Solutions, Deer Park,
      Tex., Cat. No. S2675-2KG was dissolved in 2 liters of water
      purified by reverse osmosis. Next, 20.560 g Citric Acid-ACS grade
      (ACROS, Cat No. 42356-0020) was dissolved in the same solution.
      Then 3.54 mg Reagent Grade NaI from MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio,
      Cat No. 193979 was dissolved in the electrolyte solution. Argon
      was bubbled through the solution prior to use sufficient to
      displace other dissolved gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Hydrogen was produced according to the following
      electrolysis protocol. All potentials mentioned are direct current
      (DC) unless otherwise noted. First, the electrolyte solution was
      “charged” or brought to potential. Priming or charging is the
      process of applying an electric potential to the solution which
      retains a portion of the charge throughout and after the reaction
      has concluded. It is currently understood that the solution
      possesses a complex dielectric function c and thus functions
      similar to a resistive capacitive network. The charging step is
      required of all methods to induce hydrogen production. Bringing
      the solution to potential alleviates the delay normally associated
      with initializing electrolysis. On a molecular level, this causes
      the ion channels to start “flowing,” and promotes electron
      exchange. The initial runs to bring the solution to potential are
      relatively straight-forward. The electrolyte in the apparatus was
      brought to a set current of 1.5 Amps with the voltage set at 20V.
      When the current approached the set value of 1.5 Amps, the voltage
      was observed to be between 6-8 volts. The solution was held at
      these values for approx. 5 minutes and then the power applied was
      turned off. This particular procedure was carried out at least
      once, sometimes twice. At this point, the solution was considered
      to be charged (at potential).<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The positive power lead was attached to the anode; the
      negative lead was attached to the cathode. The transducers were
      attached to the function/frequency generator (if using
      cavitation). The power supply was set to float with a voltage
      ceiling of 20V, while the amperage was set at a fixed value (which
      ranges from 250 mA to 2.0 A). Any suitable function generator can
      be used to drive the transducers, but preferred generators include
      a PROTEK B8012, or a QUAKKO 5000 digital signal generator. The
      transducers were set at 3.3 V, and drew about 10-20 mA.
      Frequencies were set at 38.248 kHz for the transverse/horizontal
      transducer, and 76 kHz for the bottom transducer. The transverse
      transducer 550 was located 2.6 cm from the center of the cell; the
      bottom transducer 540 was located 5.2 cm from the center measured
      from the face of the transducer. Both transducers were oriented
      towards the center of the cell. The central area of the cell is
      thus considered the “reaction zone” for purposes of this apparatus
      500. The transducer used in the present invention was a Piezo Air
      Transducer, Part No. SMUTF40TR18A, Steminc (Steiner &amp; Martins,
      Inc.), Miami, Fla. Hydrogen was produced in the quantities
      indicated in the attached graph (FIG. 12).<br>

      [0100] FIGS. 13-15 are directed to a fifth embodiment of the
      invention, 600. It is also a single-cell sonoelectrolytic cell
      (also described herein as a “hydrogen extractor,”) but varies from
      the fourth embodiment as follows. It was developed with the goal
      of simplifying the construction and assembly of the extractors.
      The superstructure, or external skeleton, of the apparatus is a
      two-part transparent acrylic box 605 commonly available at arts
      and crafts stores. The box is 7.62 cm×6.03 cm×6.03 cm and has an
      acrylic lid 610 with complementary edges that facilitate the lid
      fitting snugly into the box's open end. The centers of both lid
      610 and the bottom of the box 605 were drilled out to 1 inch
      diameter so that they can accommodate a 2.54 cm/1″ OD gas
      collection tube 615 that runs the length of the box
      (longitudinally). Tube 615 is a relatively thin transparent
      acrylic tube (commonly used in aquariums and referred to as a
      gravel tube). In general, tube 615 runs through the middle of the
      box between the cathode 530 and the anode 520 and terminates at
      the lower transducer unit. In operation, apparatus 600 is flipped
      so that lid 610 becomes the bottom of device 600. Gas collection
      tube 615 terminates at an adapter 617, a filter housing 618 and a
      MPT adapter 619. These last three elements are to interface with
      the gas collection apparatus 750, described in more detail infra<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Attached to the middle of the lid 610 are two components
      combined into one unit, the cathode-bottom transducer unit 620
      (see FIGS. 14-15). The bottom transducer 540 is contained within
      the same parts as in the Fourth Embodiment except that the bottom
      transducer housing cap 544 is replaced by cathode housing 622. In
      this embodiment, the transducer 540 is retained by bottom
      transducer housing 625 and cathode housing 622. Each has a
      threaded extension and a threaded receiving portion so that the
      housings may be threadably stacked. Each has a closed bottom and
      an open top. Bottom transducer housing 625 serves two functions:
      to house and keep the bottom transducer 540 isolated from direct
      contact with the electrolyte (which causes surface pitting), and
      to provide a superstructure for mounting the transducer to.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The cathode 530 is retained by the cathode housing 622 and
      cathode housing lid 621 in combination. Transducer housing 622
      screws into the bottom of cathode housing 622. Cathode housing 622
      retains the base of center electrode (cathode) 530 and allows for
      attachment to the box lid 610 by attachment of the cathode
      housing's lid 621 which was previously permanently attached to lid
      610. The transducer itself is located in the second or lower of
      the two threaded boxes, as shown in FIGS. 13-15. The cathode
      housing 622 is 2.23 cm in diameter and 2.54 cm in height. A 1″ OD
      hole was drilled through the cathode housing lid 621 to
      accommodate the gas collection tube 615, which penetrates the
      cathode housing lid 621 and stops at the floor of the housing 622.
      The cathode housing 622 was then affixed to the lid 621 with
      silicone. After the cathode housing lid 621 was attached to the
      box lid 610, the cathode lead 532 was inserted through the center
      hole of the cathode housing lid 621 and up through the box lid
      610. Slots 616 were cut into the bottom of the gas collection tube
      to accommodate the cathode lead 532. The gas collection tube 615
      has some holes, approximately 2 holes per inch of length, 1⁄8 inch
      diameter, to allow for electrolyte communication between anode and
      cathode. All leads were sealed with silicone to ensure
      water-tightness.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Apparatus 600 operates with two identical acoustic
      transducer units, the cathode-bottom transducer unit 620 as
      previously described, and the transverse transducer unit 650, are
      attached to box 605 at the positions indicated in FIGS. 13-15.
      Transverse transducer unit 650 comprises a transverse transducer
      550, a transverse transducer housing 629 with transverse
      transducer lid 626 attached to the side of box 605 at 3 cm above
      the base. Mesh 627 and split ring 628 are used in the same manner
      as in the bottom transducer. Electrical connections to the
      transverse transducer are omitted for purposes of clarity, but are
      presumed to be similar to the wiring scheme shown for the bottom
      transducer, i.e., to CAT5e cable. Installation and removal of the
      transducers is simply a matter of screwing in or unscrewing the
      transducer housing into the lid. For circulation purposes, through
      the sides of box 605 1⁄4 inch holes 606 were drilled in the
      corners to allow the circulation of the electrolyte fluid in the
      cell. Their exact position is not critical.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] With respect to FIG. 15, the cathode-bottom transducer unit
      620 is shown in more detail. Inside each round 2.23 cm dia. bottom
      transducer housing 625, the two transducer leads 541a,b were
      inserted through a round piece of 100% NYLON mesh 623 about 1/16
      inch thick, and then the leads 541a,b were soldered to CAT5e
      cables, shown in FIG. 15 connected via bottom transducer lead 542.
      This assembly sits on a TYGON® split ring 624 (split to allow
      wires to pass) which in turn is in contact with the floor of
      bottom transducer housing 625. The TYGON split ring 624 is simply
      a section of tubing cut to elevate the mesh thereby providing a
      better fit and keeps the transducer from shifting within the
      housing. The bottom transducer lead 542 exits the bottom
      transducer housing 625 through a hole (not shown) and is sealed in
      by 100% silicone sealant. Not shown are the solid-and-striped
      twisted-pair CAT5e Ethernet 100 mHz cables, which are connected to
      the terminals through bottom transducer lead 542 and allow them to
      be bundled. The bundles are then inserted into CAT5e patch
      terminals. The terminal blocks are then soldered into B&amp;C
      connectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Apparatus 600 sits in a watertight tank 660 (FIG. 13) that
      holds the electrolyte solution. Several holes were drilled into
      box 605 and lid 610 to allow fluid to circulate from the tank 660
      to the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The apparatus 600 uses the same two electrodes which are
      cylindrical in shape, previously described in the fourth
      embodiment. As previously described, the two electrodes are
      designed following a specific ratio of 1:25 (cathode:anode)
      diameters, respectively. This ratio has been experimentally
      determined to be optimal for a 5.4 cm OD anode, resulting in best
      efficiency and best hydrogen production to date. The 6 cm high
      inner electrode (cathode) is constructed of a solid copper mesh,
      0.010″ thickness (K&amp; S Engineering, Chicago, Ill.), that has
      been pulled to elongate the diamond-shaped holes and then rolled
      to an outside diameter of 2 mm. The cathode sits inside the 6 cm
      high outer electrode (anode) which is constructed of a 5.4 cm
      OD/5.1 cm ID solid copper pipe to result in 2 concentric
      cylinders, as previously described in the fourth embodiment. The
      anode 520 was inserted into box 605, lid 610 is then attached, and
      then box 605 is inverted. The anode lead 522 is fed through one of
      the holes in the original bottom 606 of the box 605 (now the top)
      and pressed against the anode, forming a simple but solid
      electrical connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The cathode lead 532 is a 14 gauge solid copper wire that
      is inserted vertically through the bottom of the apparatus through
      the cathode housing 622. The copper mesh 533 slips over the lead
      532. The anode lead 522 is likewise a 14 gauge solid copper wire.
      In the fourth embodiment, the lead is formed into a loop and
      encircles the circumference of the anode. However, in the fifth
      embodiment the lead is formed into a semi-circle and only rests on
      an end, in this case the top, of the anode.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sixth Embodiment of Hydrogen Production System: Multi-Celled
        Extractors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0108] Further embodiments of the invention utilize multiple cells
      of the previously described embodiments arranged to generate
      hydrogen together in a common holding tank of recirculating
      electrolyte, thereby multiplying the effective gas production. A
      “cell” is considered to include a cathode/anode combination, its
      supporting structure, the acoustic transducers, and all attendant
      electrical, gas and liquid connections. Scale-up of the fourth
      embodiment is shown in FIG. 16 with six cells comprising the
      embodiment. Other arrangements include four-, 8- and 12-cell
      systems, although there is no limit regarding the actual number of
      distinct cells that may be employed in a multi-cell system.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] As seen in FIG. 16, a six-cell hydrogen extractor 700 was
      designed to include the individual cells and component parts of
      the fourth embodiment and consists of six separate and
      independently functioning cells, all dimensionally stabilized and
      locked by the support plates. FIG. 16 is a front view of a
      partially assembled multi-cell extractor that includes a
      fully-assembled cell on the left, a unit missing its anode in the
      middle, and a right-most unit missing both anode and gas
      collection tube 715 on the right. One significant difference
      between the single cell and this multi-cell configuration is that
      the anode 720 in this design is twice as long as that in the
      single-cell design, which allows space for the addition of another
      transverse transducer. However, the position of the transverse
      transducer in this embodiment is the same as in the single-cell
      design. It is anticipated that the addition of another transducer
      would result in an increase in the amount of hydrogen produced.
      The transverse transducers 550 are present in FIG. 17, in which
      the three transverse transducers 550 are located in front of the
      NYLON mesh 627 through which the transducer terminals project
      slightly. Transverse transducer support plate 755 is also longer
      in this multi-cell unit than in the fourth embodiment. Support
      plate 755 is attached to the spacers 513 which are threaded over
      the tie rods 527. Cell separators 757 are sheets of 1⁄8 thick
      LEXAN or similar material, and serve to physically and
      electrically isolate the cells. Another difference from the
      single-cell is that only three support plates are used in this
      design to secure the electrodes, transducers and associated
      electrical harnesses (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Another distinction, but one not thought to make a
      difference, is the material from which the plates were made. This
      embodiment uses LEXAN instead of NYLON for the plate
      infrastructure—the three plates have been measured to allow the
      placement of six cathode/anode assemblies as well as their
      respective pairs of transducers. The spacing between the plates
      remains the same as that of the single-cell extractors and is
      essentially a design choice. In the case of the six-cell
      arrangement, each plate is 21 cm×15 cm×0.25 cm. In addition, there
      is one vertical plate holding the transverse transducers, the
      previously described transverse transducer support plate 755. This
      plate is 11 cm wide with a height of 4.1 cm, drilled out to
      accommodate the transducers as well as their respective caps, and
      sitting upon 8 cm nylon rods. In FIG. 17 plate 755 is adapted to
      support 3 transducers. Another such plate with three more
      transducer units could be easily accommodated in this design.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The holding tank (not shown) that the six-cell extractor
      sits in was made from LEXAN or similar electrically insulating
      material. Other materials may also be used such as glass or
      polycarbonate so long as they are capable of holding weakly acidic
      aqueous solutions and are electrically insulating thereby reducing
      the risk of electrical shock. A top enclosure, not shown for
      purposes of clarity, seals the electrolyte from the atmosphere and
      allows for the continuous saturation of the solution with Argon.
      The tank was fitted with an external electrolyte recirculating
      pump. Standard pipe fitting connections similar to those used to
      build the gas capture apparatus were used for recirculation of the
      electrolyte. A Flojet Compact Automatic Water System Pump, 12v,
      Part No. LF122202 was used for recirculation, with an approximate
      flow rate of 3.8 liters/minute. A gas collection interface was
      also included in the multi-cell unit, as described in relation to
      the sixth embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gas Separation and Collection Apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0112] Embodiments of the inventions disclosed herein also are
      directed to means and methods for recovering and/or separating the
      evolved hydrogen gas from the liquid electrolyte within the cells.
      Generating the chemical reactions that liberate H2 gas is a
      separate consideration from separating the gas from the liquid.
      One approach is to simply apply a slight vacuum to the saturated
      solution and by doing so extract the evolving hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] A first embodiment of a gas-liquid separation and capturing
      device may include a gas collection tube 715, previously discussed
      in the preceding embodiments as gas collection tube 615, that is
      axially positioned between the anode and cathode as shown in the
      preceding figures. The tube functions to both collect gas in the
      form of bubbles, and to help influence the electric field in the
      gap between the anode and cathode. The diameter of the tube may
      vary, but in the present embodiment preferred versions of the tube
      may be approximately 5.08 to 2.54 cm in diameter. The tube may
      also be adapted to participate in the recirculation of the
      electrolyte and as such it would function as a conduit.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] As best seen in FIGS. 18-19, a gas collection apparatus 750
      for use in the six-cell embodiment is shown. Each individual gas
      collection tube 615 (not shown) may also include a gas collection
      tube adapter 617, a membrane or filter unit 760 within its length
      or positioned immediately thereafter and positioned laterally so
      as to force the full volume of gas in the tube to traverse the
      membrane. The filter/membrane unit 760 functions to at least
      partially separate the aqueous electrolyte from the gaseous
      products evolving within the volume of the tube in the electrode
      area and so comprises a first stage filter. Any filter/membrane
      capable of performing the separation fall within the scope of the
      claims, but particularly preferred are hydrophobic gas-permeable
      membranes capable of resisting rupture under vacuum. Also included
      is tubing connecting the individual filter/membrane units to the
      manifold 768 which functions as a secondary filtration unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] As shown in more detail in FIGS. 20-21, a membrane/filter
      unit 760 comprising a stacked array of the same round acrylic
      boxes used as transducer housings were engineered to function as a
      in-line filter holder to separate the gas being produced from the
      electrolyte. The current membranes are from the PALL Corporation,
      Cat. No. PTF045LHOP-SAMP. They feature a hydrophobic layer that
      faces the electrolyte and prevents liquids from passing but allows
      gases to pass. Construction of the membrane/filter unit 760
      started with gas collection tube adapter 617, which is a section
      of TYGON tubing measuring approximately 5 cm in length and 2.54 cm
      ID. It was sealed with pure silicone adhesive into lower filter
      housing 761 that is 2.23 cm in diameter and 2.54 cm long. Within
      the upper portion of lower filter housing 761 there sits a support
      762 that comprises piece of TYGON tubing that is 1.5 cm long and
      2.225 cm in diameter. Also part of the support and residing on top
      of the TYGON tubing is a 2.225 cm diameter circular piece of 100%
      NYLON mesh, proceeded by a rubber O-ring that is approximately
      2.225 cm in diameter (not shown). Filter/membrane 763 sits on top
      of this supporting assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Filter/membrane 763 was secured into contact with upper
      filter housing 764 by screwing upper filter housing 764 into lower
      filter housing 761. Upper filter housing 764 was then screwed into
      membrane/filter top 765. At the end of upper filter housing 764, a
      3⁄8 in. poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) male pipe thread (MPT)
      adapter (1⁄2 in. pipe to 1⁄2 inch barb) was attached via threaded
      nut 619a and also glued into place. These attached to a 1⁄2 in ID
      TYGON tube. Each peripheral edge of the containers was then
      siliconed to prevent any air leakage. Other filter holders designs
      will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] A similar design was used in the next stage of the gas
      collection and separation system, the manifold 768 that collects
      the outputs from all the membrane/filter units. The filter
      material and filter holder design was the same as that just
      described, but the dimensions are larger. The manifold 768 is
      shown in FIGS. 22-23. As shown, all the gas collection tube
      adapters 617 from the extractors feed into the bottom portion of
      the manifold base portion 770, which is fitted with a plurality of
      male pipe thread to male pipe adapters 772 that reduce from 1⁄2
      inch male pipe thread to 3⁄8 inch ID barb. The manifold base
      portion 770 is the bottom of a two-part round plastic threaded
      container with threaded lid that is approximately 7 cm in diameter
      and 3.2 cm long. It has been adapted to fit three 0.95 cm poly
      vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) male pipe adapters 772 attached and
      glued into place. Off each of these is a barbed Y-adapter 774
      (FIGS. 18-19) that allows two cells' tubing to connect to one of
      the three male pipe adapters. A second round plastic container of
      the same dimensions is screwed into the modified manifold base
      770, which is the lower filter housing 776. Lower filter housing
      776 has been drilled out to roughly 5 cm leaving a “lip” 778 to
      support the edge of the membrane 780. Lip 778 provides a platform
      for the 5 cm circular 100% NYLON mesh 782 and the 5 cm O-ring 784.
      Membrane 780 is placed over O-ring 784. Upper filter housing 786
      is screwed into lower filter housing 776 to secure membrane 780.
      Manifold top 790 having the same dimensions is attached by
      screwing it into the upper filter housing 786. At the end of
      manifold top 790 is a 0.95 cm PVDF male pipe adapter 792 having
      dimensions of ______x______ attached and glued into place.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Another embodiment of the gas recovery and/or separation
      device comprises a hollow fiber membrane filter (not shown). The
      filter is of the two-phase, counter-current design whereby liquid
      electrolyte is admitted at a first proximal end, and a sweep gas
      enters a series of parallel, interconnected gas-permeable hollow
      fiber membranes at a second, distal end. The dissolved gases in
      the liquid permeate the fibers and are taken up by the sweep gas.
      An example of such a filter is the Liqui-Cel model, available from
      Membrana-Charlotte, Charlotte, S.C. Typically it may be located in
      the electrolyte recirculation system. Sweep gas in not necessary
      in all circumstances, especially if the outlet is under vacuum.
      Another embodiment of the gas-liquid separation device comprises
      an expansion tank. An expansion tank may be part of the
      electrolyte recirculation system, and will function to “siphon
      off” the gas from the top of the tank at the same time that liquid
      is recirculated through it. Still another embodiment may include a
      temperature-related gas-liquid separator. For example, it is known
      that the partial pressure of a dissolved gas is related to the
      liquid temperature, with higher temperature of the liquid
      generally correlating to a lower amount of dissolved gas.
      Therefore, by evolving hydrogen at a comparatively low temperature
      and removing gas at a higher temperature, one may be able to cause
      some or all of the hydrogen to be released from the electrolyte in
      the expansion tank. One or more of these gas-liquid separation
      systems may be used in conjunction with the present invention, and
      one of ordinary skill will be able to determine the most effective
      system experimentally given these teachings.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] An embodiment of the invention herein used a gas pump to
      pull the hydrogen gas out of both the extractor modules and the
      electrolyte solution via a hollow fiber membrane-based filter. A
      Parker Aerospace pump, Model No. T1-1HD-12-1, Cleveland, Ohio,
      capacity of 32.5 standard liters/minute (SLPM) was used. The
      bellows-type pump runs at approximately 10V and 1A off its own
      independent power supply. The pump may deliver the gas to any
      suitable container for holding flammable gases such as Propane or
      natural gas. The gas pump used to exert a vacuum on the outlet of
      the Liqui-Cel filter described above has given good results in
      removing dissolved gases from the recirculating electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Acoustical Input</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0120] The fourth embodiment described the acoustic system, and
      the same system is utilized in the fifth and sixth embodiments. In
      all embodiments two specific frequencies of ultrasonic power have
      been utilized in the single- or multi-cell apparatus. These
      frequencies are produced by function or frequency generators that
      are connected to the power lead of the transducers. The function
      generators also power the transducers-transducers require a
      minimal power input to drive the signals-3.3 volts @ approx. 35
      mA.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The transverse transducer is perpendicular to the anode and
      produces a frequency of about 38 kHz. The transducer at the bottom
      of the cell (bottom transducer) produces a frequency of about 76
      kHz which is a 1&lt;st &gt;order harmonic of the bottom transducer
      frequency. The distance of both transducers from the center of the
      cathode has been calculated to ensure that both signals meet at
      the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] While not intending to be held to any particular theory of
      operation of any embodiments of the invention, it is currently
      believed that the transducers operated at these frequencies create
      cavitation in the aqueous electrolyte region between the cathode
      and anode; this results in a very chaotic zone where clouds of
      bubbles are created and destroyed. Given the conditions conductive
      to bubble creation and implosion, high temperatures and pressures
      result in the immediate areas around them, generating radical to
      and high-energy species from water molecules such as H., OH., O.
      and HO2. The radicals created result in a highly reactive
      environment, both oxidative and reductive, with the ultimate
      release of hydrogen and carbon dioxide from water and the citric
      acid in the electrolyte. Additional treatment of the chemical
      theory underlying a possible reaction mechanism is found in U.S.
      patent application Ser. No. 13/______, filed on even date
      herewith.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Electrode Designs</b><br>
      <br>
      [0123] Embodiments of the invention are directed to various
      electrode designs such as shown in FIGS. 24A-K. One embodiment
      includes the concentric cylindrical cathode/anode shape because of
      the electric fields generated when current is introduced into the
      extractor apparatus. Each cylinder generates predictable and
      mathematically calculable electric and magnetic field lines, as
      shown below. The interactions between the field lines generated by
      the anode and cathode cause the entire region around the cathode
      to become a reaction zone where hydrogen is produced, as discussed
      more fully below. Inside the reaction zone, there are areas of
      high potential and low potential. As electrons in these areas are
      either promoted or demoted, they yield energy in the form of
      absorption or emission of photons. It is this energy that helps to
      promote electron transfer and helps to provide some of the energy
      necessary to run the reactions that break down the organic acids
      and produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The cylindrical shapes and the resulting fields allow us to
      create a volumetric phenomenon, rather than a surface-mediated
      phenomenon such as electrolysis. A surface-mediated phenomenon
      typically cannot be accelerated without increasing the number of
      reaction sites, i.e. increasing surface area. In this invention,
      the entire volume around the cathode becomes the reaction chamber.
      This is shown when a volume-specific reaction is created, versus a
      surface only reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] FIGS. 24A-K contain charts of shape versus field possible
      electrode geometries. For the example of two concentric fields,
      the electric fields interact according to the following theory.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] For an electrolyte solution in an electrochemical cell
      having a cathode wire located coaxial with a concentric anode
      tube, with steady (DC) currents and voltages, no local
      distribution will develop, so the Laplace Equation describes the
      potential V as<br>

      <br>
      [0000] subject to boundary conditions, which are well specified on
      the surfaces of the electrodes but more poorly defined on other
      surfaces of the cell. Then the electric field E is<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      E=−∇V  (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and the current density J as a function of field or
      potential is<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="f3-4.jpg" height="139" width="468"><br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      J=∫σE=−σ∇V  (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The total current flowing through any surface is the flux
      of the current density<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      I=∫JdA.  (4)<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The external circuit may limit the current flowing through
      the solution, thus limiting J, E, and the total voltage drop, ΔV.
      In the case of infinitely long concentric cylinders with radii a
      and b, and a potential difference, ΔV, Laplace's equation yields
      potential as a function of the radial coordinate,<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Then the electric fields is<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and the current density is<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Thus the total current per unit length of the cylinders is<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Therefore, the maximum electric field is near the inner
      cylinder (cathode) at r=a:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The field is thus seen to be very different and tunable
      from the standard two flat plate configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The electrical conductivity of a solution may vary with
      time and location. In a weakly conducting medium, if the maximum
      local electric field is strong enough, dielectric breakdown may
      occur, freeing more mobile charge carriers and thus increasing the
      conductivity in a small region for a shirt time. Free ions may
      bond into more weakly ionic species, thus lowering conductivity.
      Gas bubbles that form may block current flow temporarily. If these
      variations in conductivity occur on time scales that are fast
      compared to the relaxation for the bulk medium (τ), charge density
      (ρ) may accumulate. Then the potential will be described by
      Poisson's Equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <img alt="" src="f10.jpg" height="51" width="422"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] As charge density will vary rapidly with time and position
      in a liquid, the system becomes more complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Inside the solution between the two concentric cylinders
      (FIG. 24K) an area we will call the “reaction zone” can be
      observed close to, but not on, the inner cylinder. In this zone,
      reactions involving gas evolution can be seen by the naked eye.
      The volume, v, of the reaction zone inside the solution can be
      found by observing the inner radius, ri, and an outer radius, ro,
      of the reaction. Let the distance between these two radii be, dr.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      v=πh(ro&lt;2&gt;−ri&lt;2&gt;)  (11)<br>
      <img alt="" src="f11.jpg" height="36" width="430"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] where h is the height of the cylinders. The mass, m, of the
      solution inside the reaction zone can be found with the density of
      the solution, ρ,<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      m=vρ.  (12)<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="f12.jpg" height="36" width="430"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] With the mass of the cylinder we can find the number of
      moles, n, with the molecular mass, M, of the solution,<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <img alt="" src="f13.jpg" height="63" width="416"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] From the number of moles we can find the number of
      molecules with Avogadro's constant,<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      n(6.02*10&lt;23 &gt;molecules/mole).  (14)<br>
      <img alt="" src="f14.jpg" height="39" width="433"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] The electric field of the reaction zone inside the solution
      is the sum of all the electric fields at each radius, or the
      integral of the electric field over the volume of the reaction
      zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <img alt="" src="f15.jpg" height="61" width="418"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] The maximum electric field occurs just outside the inner
      cylinder and decreases as it moves away from the inner cylinder.
      In experimentally observing the reaction zone, however, it does
      not start right outside the inner cylinder but is displaced a
      measurable distance away from the cylinders surface. This may be
      because the reaction only can occur in a certain range of electric
      field strength,<br>

      <img alt="" src="f16.jpg" height="41" width="423"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] We observed the reaction occurring at a large electric
      field but not necessarily at the maximum electric field. Another
      factor in determining the reaction zone may be due to the current
      density inside the solution, having the reaction occur only
      between certain current densities,<br>

      [0000] which is also dependent on a certain maximum reactive
      electric field and a minimum reactive electric field. This
      phenomenon may also be explained by ‘ionic acceleration’ in the
      liquid, where the particles must reach a certain speed before the
      reaction can occur. This idea can be compared to the “dark region”
      that occurs during plasma discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Given these teachings, one of ordinary skill may adapt
      other of the electrode geometries disclosed in FIGS. 24A-K
      disclosed to hydrogen production in similar sonoelectrochemical
      apparati. Provisional patent application 61/501,529 filed Jun. 27,
      2011 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] As previously described under the fourth embodiment, a BK
      Precision 3-Channel programmable power supply has been used to
      power the extractors. This is a DC output power supply with a
      limit of 30 Volts and 3 Amps per channel. It is possible to run
      channels 1 and 2 in parallel, thereby achieving a 6 Amp current.
      Channels 1 and 2 are generally set with a current of 3 Amps and a
      voltage ceiling of 30 Volts. As the system runs, it is able to
      pull as much voltage as it requires up to 30 Volts.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The system resembles a capacitor in that the electrolysis
      cell's two electrodes are separated by a dielectric that is able
      to hold some amount of current for a finite period. However, the
      system is complicated by the somewhat changeable resistive pathway
      due to the changing nature of the electrolyte. Added to that is
      the effect of acoustic cavitation, which adds reactive species to
      the electrolyte too. The electrolyte component NaCl is the primary
      charge carrier, and its concentration remains relatively constant.
      However, in various embodiments the hydrocarbon component, such as
      citric acid, is a tricarboxylic acid at about 0.1M which also
      contributes some charge carrying capacity. As the citric acid is
      consumed, the effective charge density of the electrolyte
      decreases and the cell's voltage and amperage will fluctuate in
      response.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Systems for Generating Electricity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0133] It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art
      of hydrogen generation that a source of hydrogen producible “on
      demand” may be mated to any thermo- or electrochemical system for
      converting Hydrogen's chemical potential energy into any one of
      numerous useful forms of energy. For example, rocket engines
      produce thrust by combining liquefied hydrogen and oxygen in a
      combustion chamber, thereby releasing the enormous energy of the
      H2+O2 reaction (286 kJ/mole). In addition to rocket engines,
      hydrogen is a gas at standard temperature and pressure and can be
      used in a manner similar to methane, propane or natural gas, that
      is, it can be burned solely or as a supplementary fuel to power
      boilers to make electricity. Industrial scale boilers have been
      fitted to burn hydrogen such as by Coen Company. Hydrogen can also
      be used directly in Hydrogen Fuel Cells to make electricity.
      Hydrogen can also be used to power cars such as Honda's FCX
      CLARITY, a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric vehicle, or in
      internal combustion engines modified to run on Hydrogen such as
      BMW's Hydrogen 7 car (H-ICE). In fact, any form of modern
      transportation that uses electricity or internal combustion is a
      candidate for conversion to a hydrogen-based energy source.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Although a specific embodiment of the invention has been
      disclosed, it will be understood by those having skill in the art
      that changes can be made to this specific embodiment without
      departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Likewise, it
      will be understood by those having skill in the art that the
      teachings herein can be scaled in size to increase or decrease
      hydrogen production without affecting the scope and spirit of the
      present invention. The scope of the invention is not to be
      restricted, therefore, to the specific embodiments, and it is
      intended that the appended claims cover any and all such
      applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of
