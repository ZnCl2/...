      <br>
      Mar. 23, 2013 — A new wonder material can generate hydrogen,
      produce clean water and even create energy.<br>
      <br>
      Science fiction? Hardly, and there's more -- It can also
      desalinate water, be used as flexible water filtration membranes,
      help recover energy from desalination waste brine, be made into
      flexible solar cells and can also double the lifespan of lithium
      ion batteries. With its superior bacteria-killing capabilities, it
      can also be used to develop a new type of antibacterial bandage.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore,
      led by Associate Professor Darren Sun have succeeded in developing
      a single, revolutionary nanomaterial that can do all the above and
      at very low cost compared to existing technology.<br>
      <br>
      This breakthrough which has taken Prof Sun five years to develop
      is dubbed the Multi-use Titanium Dioxide (TiO2). It is formed by
      turning titanium dioxide crystals into patented nanofibres, which
      can then be easily fabricated into patented flexible filter
      membranes which include a combination of carbon, copper, zinc or
      tin, depending on the specific end product needed.<br>
      <br>
      Titanium dioxide is a cheap and abundant material, which has been
      scientifically proven to have the ability to accelerate a chemical
      reaction (photocatalytic) and is also able to bond easily with
      water (hydrophilic).<br>
      <br>
      More than 70 scientific papers on Prof Sun's work in titanium
      dioxide has been published in the last five years, the latest
      being papers published in Water Research, Energy and Environmental
      Science, and Journal of Materials Chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Sun, 52, from NTU's School of Civil and Environmental
      Engineering, said such a low-cost and easily produced
      nanomaterialis expected to have immense potential to help tackle
      ongoing global challenges in energy and environmental issues.<br>
      <br>
      With the world's population expected to hit 8.3 billion by 2030,
      there will be a massive increase in the global demand for energy
      and food by 50 per cent and 30 per cent for drinking water
      (Population Institute report, titled 2030: The "Perfect Storm"
      Scenario).<br>
      <br>
      "While there is no single silver bullet to solving two of the
      world's biggest challenges: cheap renewable energy and an abundant
      supply of clean water; our single multi-use membrane comes close,
      with its titanium dioxide nanoparticles being a key catalyst in
      discovering such solutions," Prof Sun said. "With our unique
      nanomaterial, we hope to be able to help convert today's waste
      into tomorrow's resources, such as clean water and energy."<br>
      <br>
      Prof Sun's multi-use titanium dioxide can:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concurrently produce both hydrogen and clean
      water when exposed to sunlight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be made into a low-cost flexible filtration
      membrane that is anti-fouling<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desalinate water as a high flux forward osmosis
      membrane<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recover energy from waste desalination brine
      and wastewater<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be made into a low-cost flexible solar cell to
      generate electricity<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doubles battery life when used as anode in
      lithium ion battery<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kill harmful microbial, leading to new
      antibacterial bandages<br>
      <br>
      <b>How the wonder material was found</b><br>
      <br>
      Prof Sun had initially used titanium dioxide with iron oxide to
      make anti-bacterial water filtration membranes to solve biofouling
      -- bacterial growth which clogs up the pores of membranes,
      obstructing water flow.<br>
      <br>
      While developing the membrane, Prof Sun's team also discovered
      that it could act as a photocatalyst, turning wastewater into
      hydrogen and oxygen under sunlight while still producing clean
      water. Such a water-splitting effect is usually caused by
      Platinum, a precious metal that is both expensive and rare.<br>
      <br>
      "With such a discovery, it is possible to concurrently treat
      wastewater and yet have a much cheaper option of storing solar
      energy in the form of hydrogen so that it can be available any
      time, day or night, regardless of whether the sun is shining or
      not, which makes it truly a source of clean fuel," said Prof Sun.<br>
      <br>
      "As of now, we are achieving a very high efficiency of about three
      times more than if we had used platinum, but at a much lower cost,
      allowing for cheap hydrogen production. In addition, we can
      concurrently produce clean water for close-to-zero energy cost,
      which may change our current water reclamation system over the
      world for future liveable cities."<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is a clean fuel which can be used for automotive
      fuel-cells or in power plants to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Producing hydrogen and clean water</b><br>
      <br>
      This discovery, which was published recently in the academic
      journal, Water Research, showed that a small amount of
      nanomaterial (0.5 grams of titanium dioxide nanofibres treated
      with copper oxide), can generate 1.53 millilitre of hydrogen in an
      hour when immersed in one litre of wastewater. This amount of
      hydrogen produced is three times more than when Platinum is used
      in the same situation.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the type of wastewater, the amount of hydrogen
      generated can be as much as 200 millilitres in an hour. Also to
      increase hydrogen production, more nanomaterial can be used in
      larger amounts of wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Producing low-cost flexible forward osmosis membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      Not only can titanium dioxide particles help split water, it can
      also make water filter membranes hydrophilic -- allowing water to
      flow through it easily, while rejecting foreign contaminants,
      including those of salt, making it perfect for desalinating water
      using forward osmosis. Thus a new super high flux (flow rate)
      forward osmosis membrane is developed.<br>
      <br>
      This discovery was published recently in last month's journal of
      Energy and Environmental Science. This is the first such report of
      TiO2 nanofibres and particles used in forward osmosis membrane
      system for clean water production and energy generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Producing new antibacterial bandages</b><br>
      <br>
      With its anti-microbial properties and low cost, the membrane can
      also be used to make breathable anti-bacterial bandages, which
      would not only prevent infections and tackle infection at open
      wounds, but also promote healing by allowing oxygen to permeate
      through the plaster.<br>
      <br>
      The membrane's material properties are also similar to polymers
      used to make plastic bandages currently sold on the market.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Producing low-cost flexible solar cells</b><br>
      <br>
      Prof Sun's research projects have shown out that when treated with
      other materials or made into another form such as crystals,
      titanium dioxide can have other uses, such as in solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      By making a black titanium dioxide polycrystalline sheet, Prof
      Sun's team was able to make a flexible solar-cell which can
      generate electricity from the sun's rays.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Producing longer lasting lithium ion batteries</b><br>
      <br>
      Concurrently, Prof Sun has another team working on developing the
      black titanium dioxide nanomaterial to be used in Lithium ion
      batteries commonly used in electronic devices.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary results from thin coin-like lithium ion batteries,
      have shown that when titanium dioxide sphere-like nanoparticles
      modified with carbon are used as the anode (negative pole), it can
      double the capacity of the battery. This gives such batteries a
      much longer lifespan before it is fully drained. The results were
      featured in the Journal of Materials Chemistry on its cover page
      last year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Next step -- commercialisation</b><br>
      <br>
      Prof Sun and his team of 20, which includes 6 undergraduates, 10
      PhD students and 4 researchers, are now working to further develop
      the material while concurrently spinning off a start-up company to
      commercialise the product.<br>
      <br>
      They are also looking to collaborate with commercial partners to
      speed up the commercialisation process.<br>

        <b>Abstract</b> -- </b>The present invention refers to titanium
      oxide microspheres having photocatalytic properties which can, for
      example, be used in a method for cleaning wastewater which uses a
      submerged membrane reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b> FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention refers to titanium oxide microspheres
      having photocatalyst property which can be used in a process of
      cleaning wastewater which uses a submerged membrane reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0003] Contaminants present in raw water (e.g. natural organic
      matter (NOM) and bacteria) are detrimental to the water quality.
      There is a growing trend in the use of membrane technology for
      removal of such contaminants from raw water for the production of
      good quality potable water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The "membrane" in a membrane reactor works as a filter
      which is based on the separation of substances depending on their
      size. With their micropores the membrane separates particles from
      the wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In recent years, membrane processes have become
      increasingly popular in water treatment for a variety of reasons
      which include prospectively more stringent water quality
      regulations, small footprint and reduced operation and maintenance
      costs due to advancements in membrane technology. One of the
      serious problems when utilizing filtration membrane in water
      treatment process is the decline of permeate flux due to membrane
      fouling and gel formation as learned from U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,841.
      In general, the membrane fouling can be defined as the
      accumulation of contaminated compounds on the surface of a
      membrane which form a solid layer. The solid layer on the surface
      of membrane comprises bacteria, organic and inorganic species,
      non-biodegradable compounds. Especially, the natural organic
      matter is suspected to be one of the major constituents in the
      solid layer causing the fouling problem in the membrane process
      (Sun, D. D., Li, J., et al., 2000, Civil Engineering Research
      Bulletin, NTU, Singapore, No. 13). Thus, the term membrane fouling
      comprehensively refers to a series of phenomenon which comprise of
      pore adsorption, pore blocking or clogging, gel formation or cake
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Gel formation or cake formation specifically refer to the
      layer formed on the surface due to concentration polarization. The
      layer is formed at the membrane liquid interface where larger
      solute molecules excluded from the permeate form a coating. The
      fouling caused by solids or colloids deposited on the membrane
      surface, or gel formation or solid layer formation, is reversible
      and can be overcome by periodic membrane cleaning. However, the
      pore adsorption or pore blocking caused by colloids trapped within
      the pores is usually irreversible and requires membrane
      replacement.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] To date, significant effort has been dedicated to control
      membrane fouling. Several physical membrane cleaning methods such
      as backwashing, aeration, ultrasonic cleaning (U.S. Pat. No.
      7,008,540) have been suggested to minimize membrane fouling. In
      backwashing, permeation through the membranes is stopped
      momentarily. Air or water will flow through the membranes in a
      reverse direction to physically push solids off of the membranes.
      In aeration, bubbles are produced in the tank below the membranes.
      The bubbles will agitate or scrub the membranes and thereby remove
      some solids while creating an air lift effect and circulation of
      the tank water to carry the solids away from the membranes. In
      ultrasonic cleaning, ultrasonic energy is emitted by the
      ultrasonic transducer in the direction of the filtration membrane.
      Dislodged particles cleaned by the ultrasonic energy from the
      filtration membrane are carried away in a cross-flow stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] These methods or combination of these methods are effective
      in removing the reversible membrane fouling like gel layer or
      solid layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] On the other hand, chemical cleaning is applied to reduce
      or eliminate the irreversible membrane fouling. The permeation is
      stopped and a chemical cleaner is backwashed through the
      membranes. In some cases, the tank is emptied during or after the
      cleaning event so that the amount of cleaner can be collected and
      disposed of. In other cases, if the tank remains filled, the
      amount of chemical cleaner is limited and subject to the tolerance
      for the application. Chemical cleaning has to be limited to a
      minimum frequency because repeated chemical cleaning may affect
      membrane life, and disposal of spent chemical reagents poses
      another problem. Thus the control of the irreversible membrane
      fouling is of importance for more efficient use of membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] For example, large molecular size of NOM is retained on the
      membrane surface while the small molecular size of NOM is trapped
      within the membrane pore which leads to irreversible membrane
      fouling that could not be cleaned by merely physical cleaning.
      Irreversible membrane fouling will eventually lead to higher
      long-term operating pressures, and thus, higher operating cost and
      more energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Besides chemical cleaning of the membrane, it has been
      proposed to remove the contaminants from water prior to membrane
      filtration process to prevent irreversible membrane fouling. U.S.
      Pat. No 6,027,649 discloses a process capable of removing
      contaminants from water utilizing a coagulant in combination with
      a semi-permeable membrane. However this process is not effective
      for controlling irreversible fouling because such process does not
      remove trace organic matter or the smaller molecular size of NOM
      which will trap the membrane pores.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is proposed to be used in
      conjunction with membranes to remove organic contaminants by
      adsorption and allow the membrane to separate the larger PAC
      particles (U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,841; JP 2004 016 896). Several
      problems are encountered for the regeneration of PAC. PAC must be
      heated to high temperatures to burn off the NOM. The cost of
      regenerating at such high temperatures has a negative impact on
      the economics of the process using PAC. Further more, when PAC
      particles are heated to such high temperatures, a certain portion
      of PAC are consumed by combustion. At the end of PAC lifespan,
      they must be disposed of, which results in additional disposal
      costs. Moreover, the irregular shape of PAC may damage the surface
      of filtration membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It has been proposed that freshly precipitated iron or
      aluminium oxides, common adsorbents, be used in conjunction with
      membranes to reduce fouling of the membrane. However iron oxide or
      aluminium oxide also requires heat treatment for regeneration. It
      is reported that the freshly precipitated particles themselves
      contribute to the fouling of the membrane. Heated iron oxide
      particles have been proposed to remove contaminants and
      concurrently reduce membrane fouling, the recondition process is
      carried out in acidic or basic condition to restore its adsorption
      capacity (U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,792). This method is not preferable
      for a continuous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Titanium dioxide is proposed to be used as adsorbent for
      the removal of contaminants due to its regenerative potential. The
      spent titanium dioxide can be regenerated via photocatalytic
      oxidation (PCO) process (Fang, H., Sun, D. D., et al., 2005, Water
      Science &amp; Technology, vol. 51, no. 6-7, p. 373-380).
      Commercial titanium dioxide, P25 is the most commonly used
      photocatalyst due to its high photocatalytic activity, chemical
      resistance, and low costs. Irradiation with light of sufficient
      energy creates the formation of electrons and holes on the surface
      of the photoreactive catalyst. The PCO process has been reported
      as a possible alternative for removing organic matters from
      potable water. A redox environment will be created in a PCO
      process to mineralize the NOM's and sterilize the bacteria
      adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst into carbon dioxide
      and water when the semiconductor photocatalyst is illuminated by
      light source (usually UV light) in a PCO process. The theoretical
      basis for photocatalysis in general is reviewed by Hoffmann, M.
      R., Martin, S. T., et al. (1995, Chem. Rev., vol 95, 69-96) and by
      Fox, M. A. and Dulay, M. T. (1993, Chem. Rev., vol. 93, p.
      341-357).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Unfortunately, recycling and reuse of such P25 titanium
      dioxide is an existing problem, particularly separation of P25
      titanium dioxide from treated water. Moreover, P25 titanium
      dioxide does not present individually in aqueous system, but
      rather as physically unstable complex primary aggregates ranging
      from 25 nm to 0.1 [mu]m. These physically unstable complex
      aggregates would reduce the surface area/active sites and
      subsequently affect its photocatalytic activity (Qiao, s., Sun, D.
      D., et al., 2002, Water Science Technology, vol. 147, no. 1, p.

        side shows the surface of the TiO2 microsphere of the present
        invention. The picture showing the surface demonstrates that the
        nano-size TiO2 particles are uniformly distributed over the
        surface of the microsphere.</b><b><br>

      </b><b> [0039] FIG. 4 shows the composition of the products used
        for preparing the TiO2 microspheres of the present invention as
        well as the composition of the calcined TiO2 microspheres. The
        composition products have been characterized by means of powder
        X-ray diffraction by using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer
        with CuKR radiation. The top curve shows the XRD pattern for the
        calcined TiO2 microspheres of the present invention while the
        middle and the lower curve show the XRD pattern for component A
        and B, respectively. The different peaks indicate crystalline
        phase of each product. TiO2 crystallizes in three major
        structures: rutile, anatase and brookite. However only rutile
        and anatase play the role in the TiO2 photocatalysis. Anatase
        phase, a stable phase of TiO2 at low temperature (400-600[deg.]
        C.), is an important crystalline phase of TiO2 Rutile is a
        stable phase of TiO2 at high temperature (600-1000[deg.] C.).
        Hence the product has been calcined at 450[deg.] C. to obtain
        TiO2 with anatase phase. The peak indicating the rutile phase in
        the manufactured microspheres shows the rutile phase TiO2
        contributed by the TiO2 powder. The raw TiO2 powder has in
        general a mixture of anatase and rutile at ratio of 70:30.</b><b><br>

      </b><b> [0040] FIG. 5 shows a comparison of photocatalytic
        activity of TiO2 microspheres of the present invention and
        commercial TiO2 using phenol as targeted compound for cleaning

        concentration: 1 g/l, pH 7). FIG. 5 shows the degradation of
        phenol as a function of the irradiation time at pH 7. It can be
        observed that the degradation of phenol followed an exponential
        decay form. About 40% of phenol is degraded after 60 min of UV
        light irradiation with the absence of the TiO2 microsphere of
        the present invention. The removal efficiency is greatly
        enhanced when the TiO2 microsphere of the present invention is
        added into the solutions. The removal efficiency after 60 min UV
        light irradiation is 60% and 70% for P25 TiO2 and
        nano-structured TiO2 microsphere, respectively. It can be seen
        from FIG. 5 that the TiO2 microsphere of the present invention
        possessed a better photocatalytic activity than P25 TiO2. C/C0

      </b><b> [0041] FIG. 6 shows an exemplary set up of a reactor
        system using the TiO2 microspheres of the present invention. Raw
        water is introduced into the membrane reactor tank through a
        valve. Within the membrane reactor tank the raw water is mixed
        with fresh TiO2 microspheres of the present invention and
        recycled TiO2 microspheres from the PCO reactor. Within the
        reactor tank the raw water and the TiO2 microspheres are mixed
        by the turbulence flow created by coarse diffuser located at the
        bottom of the membrane reactor. As can be seen in FIG. 6 the
        coarse diffusers are connected to an air supply which is also
        connected to the PCO reactor. After cleaning the wastewater is
        passed through the pores of the filtration membrane by suction
        force generated by a pump located outside the membrane reactor.
        The TiO2 microspheres settle to the bottom of the membrane
        reactor once the coarse diffuser stops working. From the bottom
        of the membrane reactor they are transferred via a pump into the
        PCO reactor. The PCO reactor consists of a reaction chamber and
        a UV lamp. The PCO chamber consists of a double glass-cooling
        jacket (e.g., o.d. 70 mm for the outer wall, i.d. 50 mm for the
        inner wall and height of 350 mm). The PCO reactor can be fitted
        with a gas diffuser at the bottom of the PCO chamber for
        diffusing the air. A medium-pressure mercury lamp (12 W) with
        primary emission wavelength of 253.7 nm is installed vertically
        in the middle of the reactor as the UV source (see also Fang,
        H., Sun, D. D., et al., 2005, supra).</b><b><br>

      </b><b> [0042] FIG. 7 shows the graphical illustration of the
        effect of titanium dioxide microspheres on permeates flux
        through a membrane. The initial permeate flux of humic acid
        filtration is 3.3 l*min&lt;-1&gt;*m&lt;-2 &gt;and gradually
        decreased to 2.3 l*min&lt;-1&gt;*m&lt;-2&gt;. There is a flux
        decrease of 30% after 300 min of humic acid filtration. The
        initial permeate flux is increased with the presence of TiO2
        microsphere in solution. The initial permeate flux is enhanced
        to about 5.0 l*min&lt;-1&gt;*m&lt;-2 &gt;with the presence of
        0.5 g/L of TiO2 microsphere in humic acid solution. The permeate
        flux dropped to 4.2 l*min&lt;-1&gt;*m&lt;-2&gt;, about 16% of
        flux drop after 300 min of filtration. However when the
        concentration of TiO2 microsphere increased to 1 g/L, the
        initial permeate flux is reduced to 4.2
        l*min&lt;-1&gt;*m&lt;-2&gt;. Hence, the increase of TiO2
        concentration in solution affects the degree of flux
        enhancement. In general the presence of TiO2 microsphere in
        solution is still beneficial in enhancing the permeate flux.</b><b><br>

        permeate quality shows that the membrane filtration is able to
        remove humic acid to about 75%. The removal rate of humic acid
        can achieve 87% and 93% with the presence of 0.5 g/L and 1.0 g/L
        of TiO2 microsphere, respectively. The increase of TiO2

      </b><b> [0044] FIG. 9 shows the pore size distribution of TiO2
        microsphere and P25 TiO2. Pore size distribution curve was

        stands for pore volume, and cc stands for cubic centimeters) has
        been plotted against the pore diameter in nm. The total pore
        volumes were estimated from the amounts adsorbed at a relative
        pressure (P/P0) of 0.99. The first peak in FIGS. 9 of 2 to 3 nm
        pore size is referred to intercrystalline porosity which is the
        pore within the TiO2 microsphere or the P25 TiO2 agglomerates.
        The pore sizes obtained with the method of the present invention
        for manufacturing the TiO2 microspheres of the present invention
        lies in the mesoporous range (2-50 nm) whereas, for example, the
        microspheres manufactured according to Li, X. Z. and Liu, H.
        (2003, Environ. Sci. Technol., vol. 37, p. 3989-3994) lies in
        the mesoporous range as well as in the macroporous range (&gt;50
        nm). The second peak refers to the interagglomerate pore which
        is the pore between the TiO2 microspheres or the agglomerated
        P25 TiO2. A smaller pore size distribution, i.e. the smaller
        mesoporous structure, of about 2 to 50 nm enhances the

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0045] Considering the continuous need for improved systems for
      effectively and economically removing contaminants such as natural
      organic matter and bacteria from water the inventors have
      developed titanium oxide microspheres having photocatalytic
      property or activity and having a size of about 10 [mu]m to about
      200 [mu]m and a mesoporous structure with a pore size in a range
      of about 2 to about 50 nm. This microspheres are obtained by a
      process which comprises:<br>
      <br>
      preparing a sol by mixing an organometallic titanium precursor
      with an alcohol without adding or using H2O;<br>
      aging the sol;<br>
      mixing the aged sol with titanium oxide powder;<br>
      spraying the mixture to form the titanium oxide photocatalyst
      microspheres;<br>
      calcining the microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The manufacture of those particles is based on the sol-gel
      process. In general, the sol-gel process is based on the phase
      transformation of a sol obtained from metallic alkoxides or
      organometallic precursors. This sol, which is a solution
      containing particles in suspension, is polymerized at low
      temperature to form a wet gel. The wet gel is going to be
      densified through a thermal annealing to give an inorganic product
      like a glass, polycrystals or a dry gel. In general, the sol-gel
      process consists of hydrolysis and condensation reactions, which
      lead to the formation of the sol.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A "sol" is a dispersion of solid particles in a liquid
      where only the Brownian motions suspend the particles. A "gel" is
      a state where both liquid and solid are dispersed in each other,
      which presents a solid network containing liquid components.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The terms "particle", "microparticle", "bead", "microbead",
      "microsphere", and grammatical equivalents refer to small discrete
      particles, substantially spherical in shape, having a diameter of
      about 10 micrometers ([mu]m) to about 200 micrometers. The average
      size of the titanium oxide microspheres referred to herein is
      about 50 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The sol-gel process used in the present invention can be
      performed according to any protocol. The titanium oxide
      microspheres may be formed from an organometallic titanium
      precursor, for example in situ during the reaction process.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In this process, at first the sol may for instance be
      generated by hydrolysis of such a precursor. An exemplary
      precursor can be a titanium alkoxide. The hydrolysis of a titanium
      alkoxide is thought to induce the substitution of OR groups linked
      to titanium by Ti-OH groups, which then lead to the formation of a
      titanium network via condensation polymerisation. Examples of
      titanium alkoxides can include, but are not limited to titanium
      methoxide, titanium ethoxide, titanium isopropoxide, titanium
      propoxide and titanium butoxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Typically, but not limited thereto, sol preparation by
      hydrolysis and condensation of a titanium alkoxide can be
      performed in an alcohol or an absolute alcohol. Any alcohol can be
      used in the present method. Examples of alcohols which can be used
      are ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, butanol or propanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In general the hydrolysis does not require the use of a
      catalyst. However, using a catalyst can accelerate the proceeding.
      Thus, in one aspect, the present invention further comprises
      adding a catalyst to the sol for initiating the reaction between
      the precursor and the alcohol. Any known acidic catalyst, such as
      hydrochloric acid or nitric acid, can be used. In an
      acid-catalyzed condensation, titanium is believed to be protonized
      which makes the titanium more electrophilic and thus susceptible
      to nucleophilic attack. In an acid-catalysed process, the pH value
      may for instance be in the range of about 1 to about 4, such as
      for example about pH 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The ratio of the organometallic titanium precursor to
      alcohol can be about 1 to between about 4 to 100 mol. In one
      example the ratio is about 1 to between about 40 to 60 mol.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Afterwards, the reaction mixture of titanium precursor and
      alcohol and optionally the catalyst is aged. With "aging" it is
      meant that the gel which starts to form from the sol shrinks in
      size by expelling fluids from the pores of the aging sol. Aging
      can take from 24 hours up to 2, 3 or 4 days. In the present
      invention the sol is aged for about 24 hours before it is used for
      mixing with a titanium oxide powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] For the manufacture of the titanium microspheres of the
      present invention no water (H2O) is used for sol preparation
      because water would accelerate the gelation process and the
      precipitation of Ti(OH)2 in sol. "Precipitation" means that the
      sol already precipitates to solids. That means that the present
      invention uses the "sol" condition during the synthesis process so
      that the sol will serve like a "glue" function to give a strong
      binding capacity to form the microspheres during the later
      following spray drying process. Hence, without the use of water a
      much more stable sol can be obtained having a shelf life of more
      than 1 year. With longer "shelf life" is meant that the sol will
      not undergo any changes during the period of storage and can be
      later used for the next step in the process, namely mixing the sol
      with titanium oxide powder and spray drying.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Another advantage of not using water is that the spray
      drying process can be operated at lower temperatures when alcohol
      is used instead of water. Another effect is that the microspheres
      of the present invention show a mesoporous structure, i.e. a pore
      size distribution of between about 2 nm to 50 nm (FIG. 9). In
      general, a mesoporous pore size distribution enhances the
      adsorption of contaminants (Lorenc-Grabowska, E. and Gryglewicz,
      G., 2005, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, vol. 284, p.
      416-423). The enhanced cleaning capacity for microspheres having
      such a pore size distribution has also been demonstrated for the
      microspheres of the present invention (see FIGS. 5 and 8).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In the process of obtaining the TiO2 microspheres of the
      present invention illustrated in FIG. 3, the use of additive or
      templates should also be avoided during the preparation of the
      sol. In general, additives or templates will contribute to the
      unstability of the sol which means that the shelf life of the
      particles will be limited. Additives, like polyethylenglycol
      (PEG), polyvinyl acolhol (PVA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)
      are normally used to create the pore structure of a product, like
      for example a microsphere. Higher molecular weight of an additive
      will lead to larger pore sizes once the additive is decomposed
      (Antonietti, M., 2001, Current Opinion in Colloid and interface
      Science, vol. 6, issue 3, p. 244-248). Another problem that was
      found is that those additives or templates are sometimes difficult
      to remove during the calcination process. In this case, this would
      affect the degree of crystallinity of the TiO2 microspheres which
      is important for their cleaning capabilities. Different additives
      or templates might have different decomposition temperatures and
      therefore might not compromise with the optimum calcination
      temperature for phase transformation of TiO2 into the anatase type
      especially if the low temperature to form anatase phase (400[deg.]
      C.) is used. In the process of obtaining the TiO2 particles,
      amphipilic three-block copolymers, additives like for example
      polyethyleneglycol (PEG), PVA and CMC are not added to the sol as
      it is done for example in the method described in CN 1443601 A
      which was used by Li, X. Z. and Liu, H. (2003, supra).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] After aging, titanium oxide powder is mixed into the aged
      sol. Any titanium oxide powder can be used. In one example
      described herein, titanium oxide powder supplied by Degussa,
      Germany, has been used. This powder is characterized by comprising
      a surface area of about 50 m&lt;-2&gt;g&lt;-1&gt;, having a
      crystal size of about 30 nm and about 70% of this TiO2 crystals
      are of anatase type. Another TiO2 powder which could also be used
      is supplied by Taixing Nano-Materials Company in China. Their
      powder is characterized by comprising a surface area of about 56.7
      m&lt;-2&gt;g&lt;-1&gt;, having a crystal size of about 9.6 nm and
      about 89.4% of this TiO2 crystals are of anatase type.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Different weight ratios are possible for mixing titanium
      oxide powder with the aged sol. The minimal ratio is about 1:3
      whereas the maximal ratio is about 1:10. In one example, the
      weight ratio for mixing aged sol with titanium oxide powder is
      about 1:5. Mixing is carried out using any method for mixing known
      in the art, for example, under stirring conditions using a
      magnetic stirrer for obtaining mixed slurry.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The slurry obtained after mixing is then sprayed to form
      the titanium microspheres. During spray drying the particles
      aggregate to form semisolid microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] After spraying the microspheres are calcined to form solid
      TiO2 microspheres. Calcination reactions usually take place at or
      above the thermal decomposition temperature (for decomposition and
      volatilization reactions) or the transition temperature (for phase
      transitions) of the metalloxide used. The calcination step has the
      effect that the TiO2 particles obtained by spraying are
      transformed from amorphous phase to crystallite phase of anatase
      type. The different composition of crystal types of the different
      components used for the manufacture of the TiO2 microspheres are
      illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In general, calcination is carried out at a temperature
      between about 400[deg.] C. to about 600[deg.] C. Calcination can
      be carried out at a temperature of about 400[deg.] C. as well as
      at 500[deg.] C. In one example, the temperature was about
      450[deg.] C. Calcination is carried out for several hours, for
      example 3, 4, 5 or 6 hours. Calcination is normally carried out in
      furnaces or reactors (sometimes referred to as kilns) of various
      designs including shaft furnaces, rotary kilns, multiple hearth
      furnaces, and fluidized bed reactors. The phase transformation
      might also be induced using the hydrothermal method as described
      by Hildago et al. (2007, Catalysis Today, vol. 129, p. 50-58).
      Using the hydrothermal method, the sample is placed in a Teflon
      recipient inside of a stainless steel autoclave. Hydrothermal
      treatment is performed at a low temperature, for example
      120-150[deg.] C. for several hours up to 24 hours and at high
      working pressures, for example 198.48 to 475.72 kPa.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] As an optional step, the TiO2 particles obtained after
      spraying can be dried before calcination to allow further
      condensation and passing off of remaining liquids (water, alcohol)
      from the gel. Depending on the liquid content in the wet-gel, the
      drying step can be carried out for about one night up to several
      days. In one example, of the present invention, the TiO2 particles
      have been dried overnight. The particles can either be dried at
      room temperature or at a temperature between about 50 to about
      150[deg.] C. FIGS. 1 and 2 show a general overview of the process
      of obtaining the TiO2 particles of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Table 1 illustrates the physical characteristics of TiO2
      microspheres of the present invention and a pure TiO2 powder,
      namely P25 from Degussa, Germany.<br>

      <br>
      [0070] Even though the TiO2 microspheres of the present invention
      are much larger than commonly used TiO2 particles, like P25, the
      BET surface is retained due to its mesoporous structure. According
      to the definition of the International Union of Pure and Applied
      Chemistry (IUPAC) the term "mesopore/mesoporous" refers to pore
      size in the range of 2 to 50 nm and this range enhances the
      adsorption of contaminants (see FIG. 8) (Lorenc-Grabowska, E. and
      Gryglewicz, G., 2005, supra). According to IUPAC, a pore size
      below 2 nm is termed a micropore range and &gt;50 nm is termed
      macropore range.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Thus, the pore size of the microspheres of the present
      invention falls into the mesoporous range only. For example, the
      pore size of the microspheres mentioned by Li, X. Z. and Liu, H.
      (2003, supra) ranges between the mesoporous and macroporous range
      and depends on the additives used. Li, X. Z. and Liu, H. (2003,
      supra) uses another mechanism for forming the porous structure of
      their microspheres. Li, X. Z. and Liu, H. (2003, supra) use the
      additives (i.e. PEG) to create the porous structure. In the
      present invention, the nanosized TiO2 powder (from the sol) is
      embedded within the microsphere in order to create the
      interconnected pore structure of the microspheres. This has the
      effect that the pore size distribution of 2 to 3 nm which is the
      intercrystalline pore within the TiO2 microspheres, is 0.3 whereas
      the pore size distribution of Li, X. Z. and Liu, H. (2003, supra)
      is 0.7.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The photocatalytic activity of the microspheres of the
      present invention is improved due to the quantum size effect which
      is triggered by the embedded nano-sized anatase crystallites as
      illustrated in FIG. 5. Quantum size effect is a phenomenon which
      occurs for semiconductor particles on the order of 1-10 nm in
      size. Particles which fall within this range will have increased
      photoefficiencies as described by Linsebigler, A. L., Lu, G. and
      Yates, J. T. Jr (1995, Chem. Rev., vol. 95, pp. 735-758).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] As can be seen from FIG. 3 the particles of the present
      invention have a very regular spherical shape and thus 'surface
      damage of filtration membranes in a reactor is avoided. Those TiO2
      microspheres can also be used to avoid irreversible membrane
      fouling because they inhibit, for example, that small particles
      dissolved in wastewater clog the pores of the filtration
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Therefore, the present invention is also directed to a
      process of cleaning waste water in a membrane filtration reactor,
      wherein the process comprises:<br>
      <br>
      mixing the titanium oxide microsphere of the present invention
      with wastewater which is to be treated in a membrane reactor;<br>
      <br>
      filtering the mixture treated in the membrane filtration reactor
      through the filtration membrane of the membrane filtration reactor
      by applying a suction force at the filtration membrane of the
      membrane reactor, wherein the diameter of the microspheres in the
      mixture is greater than the diameter of the pores of the membrane,
      to form a cake layer of microspheres on the surface of the
      filtration membrane; and continuing feeding the membrane
      filtration reactor with wastewater until the wastewater is
      cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In one example the process further comprises adding more
      titanium oxide microspheres into the membrane reactor when further
      wastewater is fed into the membrane filtration reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] "Wastewater" "raw water" or "sewage" includes municipal,
      agricultural, industrial and other kinds of wastewater. In
      general, any kind of wastewater can be treated using the process
      of the present invention. In one example, the wastewater has a
      total organic carbon content (TOC) of about 20 mg/l. In one
      example, the wastewater used in the method of the present
      invention has already been treated to remove trace organics or
      soluble organics from the wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] If necessary, this process can comprise further mixing of
      the mixture of TiO2 microspheres and wastewater to achieve a
      uniform distribution of the microspheres in the wastewater. FIG. 6
      illustrates the possible setup of a membrane reactor which uses
      the microspheres of the present invention. A good mixture of
      microspheres with wastewater can be achieved in membrane reactor
      tank by turbulence flow created, for example, by coarse diffuser
      located at the bottom of the membrane reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In general, the microspheres are used for removal of NOM
      and bacteria from water. The nano-structured microspheric titanium
      dioxide photocatalysts are combined with the incoming raw water to
      form a suspension. Combination of wastewater and microspheres can
      take place before entering the membrane reactor shown in FIG. 6 or
      only upon entering the membrane reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] After mixing, the nano-structured microspheric titanium
      dioxide photocatalysts remove NOM and bacteria from water by
      adsorption (Fang, H., Sun, D. D., et al., 2005, supra). An
      immersed filtration membrane is used for separating the potable
      water from the nano-structured microspheric titanium dioxide
      photocatalyst suspension. Wastewater treated with the microspheres
      is passed or filtered through the membrane as permeate when
      suction force is applied to the filtration membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The composition of the membrane and the size of the pores
      of the membrane may vary over a wide range, depending on the
      particular contaminants that are to be removed from the
      wastewater. Such membranes are usually submerged membranes. Such
      membranes can include those known in the art and which are used in
      microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration systems. The
      pore size of such membranes is can be in the range of 0.001 to 0.1
      [mu]m. Such membranes can be made of ceramics or polymers.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Examples of polymers which are used for filtration
      membranes are cellulose acetate, polyamide, polysulphone,
      polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Examples of
      ceramics which are used for such filtration membranes are diatom
      earth, aluminium oxide, titanium oxide, titanium dioxide or zinc
      oxide. In one non-limiting example of the present invention, the
      membrane is made of ceramics, namely diatom earth of the MF type
      (Doulton, USA).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The TiO2 microspheres can adsorb the contaminants from
      wastewater due to its mesoporous structure. The particle size of
      the nano-structured microspheric titanium dioxide photocatalyst is
      preferred to be larger than the membrane pore to prevent clogging
      or irreversible fouling. Thus, a dynamic layer of photocatalyst is
      formed on the membrane surface due to suction force at the
      membrane which prevents the remaining portion of contaminants from
      water to trap within the pores of the filtration membrane. Water
      to be treated is continuously introduced into the tank and
      continued until predetermined hydraulic retention time to reach
      the adsorption equilibrium or the reduction in the degree of NOM
      removal or reduction in permeate flow is observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] At this point, the permeation can be stopped and the
      membrane can be backwashed to remove the layer of spent
      microspheres that formed on the surface of the filtration membrane
      in the membrane reactor. During and/or after the backwashing step,
      a tangential flushing can be carried out in order to flush out the
      inner surface of the filtration membrane and recover the
      microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The spent titanium dioxide microspheres can be regenerated
      via PCO process (Fang, H., Sun, D. D., et al., 2005, supra).
      Therefore, the spent adsorbent is directed to a PCO reactor as
      indicated in FIG. 6. The photocatalyst is activated by UV light at
      254 nm, electron and hole charge carrier pairs are produced within
      the photocatalyst microspheres. These charge carriers then perform
      oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions with the adsorbed species on
      the surface of photocatalyst. NOM is oxidized and bacteria are
      sterilized by the PCO process. A hydraulic retention time is
      provided for the regeneration to restore the adsorption capacity
      of the microspheric TiO2 photocatalyst. The regenerated
      microspheric TiO2 photocatalyst can than be recirculated back to
      the membrane reactor as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The integrated system of membrane filtration and PCO is a
      very efficient and cost-effective technology for the removal of
      NOM and bacteria from water. An important factor that determines
      the economics of this process is the increase of permeate flux in
      both quality and quantity, and the extended membrane lifespan that
      could be achieved due to the use of the TiO2 microspheres which
      avoid membrane fouling. The permeate flux is enhanced by factors
      of 1.5 when the microspheric titanium dioxide photocatalyst is
      added to the wastewater as can be seen from FIG. 7. The permeate
      quality is improved as well as is illustrated by FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In another aspect, the present invention is also directed
      to a method of manufacturing a titanium oxide microsphere having
      photocatalytic property, having a size of about 10 [mu]m to about
      200 [mu]m and a mesoporous structure with a pore size in a range

      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0103] In a non-limiting example of the present invention, the
      coating sol is prepared by dissolving 6.8 mL of
      tetra-n-butylorthotitanate [Ti(OC4H9)4], obtained from Merck in
      58.2 mL of absolute alcohol (CH3CH2OH), obtained from Fluka. A
      uniform TiO2 sol is formed as component A under vigourous mixing.
      During this process, pH is monitored and kept around 3 by the
      addition of 0.5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). The
      sol is aged for at least 24 hours by leaving it alone in a sealed
      bottle before further use. Then the commercial TiO2 powder
      (anatase=70%, surface area=50 m&lt;-2&gt;g&lt;-1&gt;, and crystal
      size=30 nm) supplied by Degussa, Germany is used as component B
      and mixed with component A at a powder:sol ratio of 5:1 by weight
      to form a slurry. Then the slurry is put into a spray dryer
      (capacity 1500 ml/h) with inlet air at 30[deg.] C. and outlet air
      at 30[deg.] C. In the spray dryer, the TiO2 particles aggregate to
      form semisolid microspheres. Finally the semisolid microspheres
      are calcined at higher temperature of 450[deg.] C. for 3 h to form
      solid TiO2 microspheres No water or any additive has been used in
      the preparation of these TiO2 microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0104] Characterization of TiO2 Microspheres</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0105] Humic acid (HA) used in this study is obtained from Fluka
      Chemical. Humic acids in water are harmful compounds with a
      complex nature composed of carboxylic, phenolic and carbonyl
      functional groups. These substances cause a brown-yellow color in
      water and are known to be the precursor of carcinogenic
      halogenated compounds formed during the chlorination disinfection
      of drinking water. A concentrated HA solution is first prepared by
      mixing 4 grams of HA and 50 ml of 1 M NaOH in approximately 1.5
      litres of pure water for at least 30 minutes with a magnetic
      stirrer. When completely mixed, the solution was diluted to 2 l in
      a volumetric flask. The solution was filtered through a 0.45 [mu]m
      membrane filter. The HA concentrated solution was refrigerated and
      used as needed. The concentrations of HA in this study were
      obtained by diluting the concentrated solution. The pH of the
      solution was adjusted by HCl and NaOH with a calibrated pH meter.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Different TiO2 dosages are used together with this solution
      of humic acid, at fixed transmembrane pressures (0.3 Mpa). The
      humic acid is prepared at 20 ppm concentration, with 50 ppm of
      Ca&lt;2+&gt;, at a pH of 7. Polysulfone membrane with molecular
      weight cut-off 50 k is used in the membrane filtration study. The
      filtration study is carried out using a lab-scale membrane
      filtration unit supplied by Nitto Denko with a maximum operating
      pressure at 0.6 Mpa. The flowrate, flux (for the permeate) and pH
      (the permeate and feed) is recorded every 15 mins for the first
      hour, every 30 mins in the second hour and every one hour from the
      third hour till the fifth hour. FIG. 7 shows the graphical
      illustration of the effect of titanium dioxide particles on
      permeates flux through a membrane. Samples of permeate are also
      collected during the operation. The optical absorption spectrum on
      the HA is determined by a Perkin Elmer (USA) Lambda Bio 20
      spectrophotometer. The absorbance at 400 nm is selected for
      quantitative analysis of color. FIG. 8 shows the graphical
      illustration of the permeate quality during the membrane
      filtration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] A PCO test is carried out to compare the photocatalytic
      activity of nano-structured TiO2 microspheres of the present
      invention and commercial P25 TiO2 under the same conditions.
      Phenol (analytical grade) with an initial concentration of 100 ppm
      was chosen as the targeted compound. The choice of this compound
      was motivated by the fact that phenol normally exhibits weak
      adsorption on TiO2 particles. PCO study is carried out in a
      cylindrical PCO reactor. The UV lamp used is a low pressure
      mercury UV lamp. The major emission of the UV lamp is 253.7 nm. An
      air pump is used to supply oxygen and create air bubbles for
      suspensions. TiO2 microsphere is suspended in 1000 mL phenol
      solution in dark for 0.5 hours to attain well mixed condition
      before the PCO study set off. Samples are taken at different time
      intervals after UV light has been turned on. All samples are
      filtered through 0.45 [mu]m membrane filters prior to the
      analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] FIG. 5 shows the results of this experiment. FIG. 5 shows
      the degradation of phenol as a function of the irradiation time at
      pH 7. It can be observed that the degradation of phenol followed
      an exponential decay form. Blank study (absence of photocatalyst)
      is carried out as a background check. About 40% of phenol is
      degraded after 60 min of UV light irradiation with the absence of
      the TiO2 microsphere of the present invention. The removal
      efficiency is greatly enhanced when the TiO2 microsphere of the
      present invention is added into the solutions. The removal
      efficiency after 60 min UV light irradiation is 60% and 70% for
      P25 TiO2 and TiO2 microsphere of the present invention,
      respectively. It is obvious that the TiO2 microspheres possess a
      better photocatalytic activity than P25 TiO2. C0 shows the initial

      <b>Technical Field</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to a method of producing purified
      water from a water source which is suspected to contain
      impurities, and in particular, to a method of producing purified
      water via a <b>forward osmosis process</b>. An apparatus for
      carrying out the purification method is also provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Water scarcity has now become one of the most pressing
      challenges to human civilization in the earth. Growing population
      and industrial activities, increasing living standard and changing
      climate are placing extreme pressure on the already-scarce
      drinking water and energy resources. Wastewater reuse and seawater
      desalination are few options to increase drinking water
      availability. However, current technologies for producing purified
      drinking water from such resources require substantial energy
      input, which at some extent worsen the vicious cycle of greenhouse
      gas emissions and climate change. In order to address these
      problems, tremendous effort has been taken to identify new
      technologies for producing purified drinking water at lower energy
      input capacity in an environmentally sustainable manner. [0004] In
      the field of drinking water production, reverse osmosis (RO)
      membrane process has been widely used globally. The process
      employs high hydralic pressure and internal flow circulation to
      force water through a semipermeable membrane from a high
      concentration solution to a low concentration solution. This is
      the 'reverse' of the water's natural osmosis tendency. Heavy
      consumption of electrical energy for creating high hydralic
      pressure, coupled with severe membrane fouling problem, has led to
      the investigation and development of alternative approaches to the
      RO process.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In contrast to the RO process, forward osmosis (FO) process
      makes use of the natural osmosis phenomenon for the transport of
      water from a feed solution with a low solute concentration to a
      draw solution with high solute concentration across a
      semipermeable membrane, with the osmotic pressure difference
      between the feed and the draw solutions as the driving force.
      After water naturally permeates into the draw solution, the
      diluted draw solution can then be recycled for reuse while high
      quality product water can be produced. Driven by an osmotic
      pressure gradient, the FO process does not require significant
      energy input, only stirring or pumping of the feed and draw
      solutions are involved.' Meanwhile, the FO process offers the
      advantages of less membrane fouling tendency and high rejection of
      solutes. Recently, the FO process has attracted great attention in
      seawater desalination, wastewater reclamation, food and
      pharmaceutical processing, and power generation. However, the
      major obstacle of adopting the FO process industrially and
      globally in the application for producing purified drinking water
      is a lack of low energy methods to separate draw solutes and the
      purified water from the diluted draw solutions. Summary<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Various embodiments provide for a method to separate draw
      solutes and purified water from a draw solution without a need for
      considerable amount of energy such as heat and pressure. The
      method employs a forward osmosis process thereby using much less
      energy than a reverse osmosis process.<br>

      water but essentially impermeable for solutes contained in the

      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] The following detailed description refers to the
      accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific
      details and embodiments in which the invention may be practised.
      These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable
      those skilled in the art to practise the invention. Other
      embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and
      electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of
      the invention. The various embodiments are not necessarily
      mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one
      or more other embodiments to form new embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Osmosis is defined as the net movement of water across a
      selectively permeable membrane driven by a difference in osmotic
      pressure across the membrane. A selectively permeable membrane (or
      semipermeable membrane) allows passage of water molecules, but
      rejects solute molecules or ions. The semipermeable membrane
      filters the impurities from a water source (feed solution) which
      is suspected to contain impurities, leaving purified water on the
      other side (permeate side) of the membrane called permeate water.
      The impurities left on the membrane may be washed away by a
      portion of the feed solution that does not pass through the
      membrane. The feed solution carrying the impurities washed away
      from the membrane is also called "reject" or "brine". <br>
      <br>
      [0013] Various embodiments of the invention make use of a forward
      osmosis (FO) process developed as an alternative membrane
      technology for wastewater treatment due to the low energy
      requirement as a result of low or no hydraulic pressure applied,
      high rejection of a wide range of contaminants, and low membrane
      fouling propensity compared to pressure-driven membrane processes,
      such as reverse osmosis (RO). FO process uses the osmotic pressure
      differential across the membrane, rather than hydraulic pressure
      differential (as in RO processes) as the driving force for
      transport of water through the membrane. The FO process results in
      concentration of the feed solution and dilution of a highly
      concentrated stream (referred to as the draw solution). In other
      words, the FO process utilizes the natural osmosis phenomenon,
      which makes use of concentration differences between the two
      solutions across a semipermeable membrane. The semipermeable
      membrane acts as a selective barrier between the two solutions,
      and dominates the efficiency of freshwater transportation in the
      FO process. A concentrated draw solution on the permeate side of
      the membrane is the source of the driving force in the FO process.
      Different terms are used in the literature to name this solution
      including draw solution, osmotic agent, or osmotic media to name
      only a few. In a FO process the draw solution has a higher osmotic
      pressure than the feed solution (or reject or brine).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The semipermeable membranes used may be polymer-based.
      Further, the membranes may have a dense selective layer embedded
      onto a support layer for providing rejection of dissolved
      compounds and providing mechanical strength respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Various embodiments provide for a method of producing
      purified water from a water source which is suspected to contain
      impurities, and an apparatus therefor. Fig. 1 illustrates a
      schematic flow diagram in one embodiment. The water source shown
      in this illustration is wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The apparatus may include a first container 10 configured
      to receive a semipermeable membrane 12 placed therein thereby
      forming a first portion 10a for containing the wastewater and a
      second portion 10b for containing a draw solution. Wastewater may
      be fed to the first portion 10a by any suitable means, such as a
      pipe. The draw solution may be fed to the second portion 10b by
      any suitable means, such as a pipe. Sufficient time is given to
      allow water from the water source to flow through the
      semipermeable membrane to the draw solution, thereby diluting the
      draw solution and concentrating the water source.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The semipermeable membrane 12 is permeable for water but
      essentially impermeable for solutes contained in the water of the
      draw solution. The semipermeable membrane 12 may be of any
      suitable type conventionally used in forward osmosis or reverse
      osmosis process. The membrane materials for such semipermeable
      membranes can be cellulose, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and
      polyamide.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The draw solution contains a chemically precipitable
      water-soluble salt in a concentration that allows the draw
      solution to draw water from the wastewater by osmosis to thereby
      form a diluted draw solution. The diluted draw solution may be
      withdrawn from the second portion 10b by any suitable means, such
      as a pipe. The wastewater may be withdrawn from the first portion
      10a by any suitable means, such as a pipe, and is now concentrated
      with impurities that cannot pass through the semipermeable
      membrane 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The salt is soluble in the water of the draw solution and
      can be precipitated upon addition of a precipitant. <br>
      [0020] In various embodiments, the chemically precipitable
      water-soluble salt may be selected from the group consisting of
      aluminium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, manganese sulfate, iron
      chloride, iron sulphate, and aluminium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the draw solution
      contains (A12(S04)3) as the chemically precipitable water-soluble
      salt, which is commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The apparatus may also include a second container (or
      separator) 14 for containing the diluted draw solution. The second
      container 14 may be fluidly connected via a pipe to the second
      portion 10b of the first container 10 so that the diluted
      A12(S04)3 draw solution (or A12(S04)3 recycle) withdrawn from the
      second portion 10b is fed to the second container 14 for
      separation. The second container 14 may be configured to receive a
      precipitant feed whereby a precipitant is added to the diluted
      draw solution to precipitate the salt, and whereby the
      precipitated salt thus formed may include a plurality of gel
      particles dispersed in water. The precipitant may be added to the
      second container 14 via a separate pipe, for example.
      Alternatively, the precipitant may be added to the A12(S04)3
      recycle stream before entering the second container 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In various embodiments, the precipitant may be selected
      from the group consisting of calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide,
      sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium oxide, and barium
      silicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the precipitant is
      calcium oxide (CaO), which is commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The second container 14 may be further configured to
      receive a coagulant feed wherein a coagulant is added to the
      plurality of gel particles to coagulate the plurality of gel
      particles. The coagulant may be fed to the second container 14 by
      any suitable means, such as a pipe. The second container 14 may
      also be configured separate the coagulated gel from the water,
      thereby producing purified water separated from the diluted draw
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In various embodiments, the coagulant may be negatively
      charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In various embodiments, the coagulant may be in the form of
      a particulate.<br>
      The size of the particulate coagulate may be from about 1 nm to
      about 100 [mu][pi][iota].<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In various embodiments, the coagulant may be selected from
      the group consisting of activated silica, anionic polyelectrolyte,
      iron (III) oxide, zeolite and silicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In one embodiment, the coagulant may be sodium silicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In another embodiment, the coagulant may be anionic
      polyacrylamide.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In further embodiments, the coagulant may also be magnetic.
      The coagulant may consist of a core/shell nanoparticle. In one
      such embodiment, the coagulant may consist of an iron (III) oxide
      core and an activated silica shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In various embodiments where the chemically precipitable
      soluble salt is aluminium sulfate and the precipitant is calcium
      oxide, each gel particle is a mixture of aluminium hydroxide and
      calcium sulfate. When aluminium hydroxide is precipitated in water
      as the solvent, the hydrated aluminium hydroxide forms gels which
      are positively charged. Due to such electrical charges, each gel
      particle repels one another and is dispersed in water as a
      plurality of gel particles. A negatively charged sodium silicate
      (Na2Si03) is added as a coagulant to coagulate the gel particles
      of aluminium hydroxide and calcium sulfate. The coagulated gel
      mixture of aluminium hydroxide, calcium sulfate, and sodium
      silicate clump together and form a floe. The floe may be deposited
      to the bottom of the diluted draw solution and is withdrawn while
      the top liquid is removed as purified water from the second
      container 14. [0033] The second container 14 may be further
      configured (not shown) to receive an acid feed, wherein the acid
      is added to the coagulated gel to recover the chemically
      precipitable water-soluble salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In various embodiments, the acid may be selected from the
      group consisting of sulfuric acid, chloric acid, and nitric acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one embodiment where the chemically precipitable
      water-soluble salt is aluminium sulfate, the acid is sulfuric
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The recovered chemically precipitable water-soluble salt
      aluminium sulfate may then be reused in the draw solution again.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Calcium sulfate present in the floe may be subsequently
      precipitated as a useful by-product. Calcium sulfate has wide
      applications in construction, fertilizer and biomedicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The coagulant may also be subsquently recovered from the
      floe and reused in the purification process again.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The concentrated wastewater withdrawn from the first
      portion 10a may be rich in organic matters and may be fed to an
      anaerobic reactor 16 to generate a biogas (methane) as a useful
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In order that the invention may be readily understood and
      put into practical effect, particular embodiments will now be
      described by way of the following non- limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] The following illustrates examples of various negatively
      charged coagulants used to coagulate positively charged gel
      particles dispersed in water. The draw solution consists of
      aluminium sulfate as the chemically precipitable soluble salt and
      the precipitant is calcium oxide. The resultant gel particles are
      mixtures of aluminium hydroxide and calcium sulfate, and are
      positively charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Fe304@Si02 core/shell nanoparticles that are negatively
      charged and magnetic are added to the diluted draw solution to
      coagulate the gel particles. The floe is formed by ionic binding
      between the positively charged gel particles and the negatively
      charged Fe304@Si02 coagulant. The floe is then easily and fully
      removed under application of an external magnetic field. When
      placed near a permanent magnet, the draw solution becomes clear
      within minutes and the floe is deposited near the magnetic field
      due to the magnetic coagulant particles. The clear top liquid is
      then taken out as the final water product. The roles of the
      negatively charged and magnetic Fe304@Si02 core/shell
      nanoparticles are to both coagulate the gel particles and to
      increase the rate of separation via a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Anionic Polyacrylamide (PAM) as Coagulant</b><br>
      <br>
      [0043] Anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) is added to the diluted draw
      solution to coagulate the gel particles. The floe is formed by
      ionic binding between the positively charged gel particles and the
      negatively charged PAM coagulant. The floe is then precipitated to
      the bottom of the draw solution. The clear top liquid is then
      taken out as the final water product.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3: Sodium Silicate (NaiSiOV) as Coagulant </b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] Sodium silicate (Na2Si03) is added to the diluted draw
      solution to coagulate the gel particles. The floe is formed by
      ionic binding between the positively charged gel particles and the
      negatively charged Na2Si03 coagulant. The floe is then
      precipitated to the bottom of the draw solution. The clear top
      liquid is then taken out as the final water product.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Technical Field</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to a method of preparing a
      nanocomposite semipermeable membrane for forward osmosis
      applications in wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, food
      and pharmaceutical processing, and power generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Forward osmosis (FO) process makes use of the natural
      osmosis phenomenon for the transport of water from a low solute
      concentration feed solution to a high solute concentration draw
      solution across a semipermeable membrane, with the osmotic
      pressure difference between the feed and the draw solution acting
      as the driving force. After the water naturally permeates into the
      draw solution without external energy input, the diluted draw
      solution can then be recycled for reuse in the FO process while
      high quality water product can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The FO process has recently shown great potential for
      wastewater reuse and seawater desalination. It has various
      advantages over current membrane technology, especially the
      reverse osmosis (RO) process. These advantages include a lower
      energy consumption needed for the osmosis process and a lower
      fouling potential of the membrane. One of the most important
      challenges in utilizing the FO process for practical applications
      is the lack of such suitable membrane. Water permeate flux
      obtained with current FO membrane is usually lower than expected.
      The low permeate flux attributes to the severe internal
      concentration polarization (ICP) effect occurring in the porous
      support layer of the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Due to the limitations posed by the severe ICP effect on
      water permeate flux for current forward osmosis membranes, new
      forward osmosis membranes with superior water permeate flux and
      high solute rejection rate are desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] Various embodiments provide for methods of preparing
      nanocomposite semipermeable membranes that contain dispersed
      nanomaterials within the polymer matrix for forward osmosis
      applications such as wastewater treatment, seawater desalination,
      food and pharmaceutical processing, power generation, and the
      like. With the addition of nanomaterials dispersed within the
      polymer matrix of the porous support layer of the membranes,
      significant increase of water permeate flux is achieved, while
      high solute rejection rate is maintained, compared to membranes
      having no added nanomaterials.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Various embodiments provide for a method of preparing a
      nanocomposite membrane. The method may include:<br>

      solution and nanomaterials;<br>
      <br>
      (b) subjecting the nanocomposite solution to a cold water bath to
      produce the nanocomposite membrane in a gel-like form; and <br>
      <br>
      (c) subjecting the gel nanocomposite membrane to a heat treatment
      to -solidify the nanocomposite membrane, wherein the nanomaterials
      are dispersed within the polymer matrix of the nanocomposite
      membrane.<br>

      comprises nanomaterials dispersed within a polymer matrix.<br>

      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      [0017] The following detailed description refers to the
      accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific
      details and embodiments in which the invention may be practised.
      These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable
      those skilled in the art to practise the invention. Other
      embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and
      electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of
      the invention. The various embodiments are not necessarily
      mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one
      or more other embodiments to form new embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Osmosis is defined as the net movement of water across a
      selectively permeable membrane driven by a difference in osmotic
      pressure across the membrane. A selectively permeable membrane (or
      semipermeable membrane) allows passage of water molecules, but
      rejects solute molecules or ions. The semipermeable membrane
      filters the impurities from a water source (feed solution) which
      is suspected to contain impurities, leaving purified water on the
      other side (permeate side) of the membrane called permeate water.
      The impurities left on the membrane may be washed away by a
      portion of the feed solution that does not pass through the
      membrane. The feed solution carrying the impurities washed away
      from the membrane is also called "reject" or "brine".<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Various embodiments of the invention make use of a forward
      osmosis (FO) membrane developed as an alternative membrane
      technology for wastewater treatment due to the low energy
      requirement as a result of low or no hydraulic pressure applied,
      high rejection of a wide range of contaminants, and low membrane
      fouling propensity compared to pressure-driven membrane processes,
      such as reverse osmosis (RO). FO process uses the osmotic pressure
      differential across the membrane, rather than hydraulic pressure
      differential (as in RO processes) as the driving force for
      transport of water through the membrane. The FO process results in
      concentration of the feed solution and dilution of a highly
      concentrated stream (referred to as the draw solution). In other
      words, the FO process utilizes the natural osmosis phenomenon,
      which makes use of concentration differences between the two
      solutions across a semipermeable membrane. The semipermeable
      membrane acts as a selective barrier between the two solutions,
      and dominates the efficiency of freshwater transportation in the
      FO process. A concentrated draw solution on the permeate side of
      the membrane is the source of the driving force in the FO process.
      Different terms are used in the literature to name this solution
      including draw solution, osmotic agent, or osmotic media to name
      only a few. In a FO process the draw solution has a higher osmotic
      pressure than the feed solution (or reject or brine).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Various embodiments provide for a method of preparing a
      nanocomposite membrane. The method may be a phase inversion type
      for preparing asymmetric nanocomposite membranes. The membranes
      may be polymer-based. Further, the membranes may have a dense
      selective layer disposed adjacent a porous support layer whereby
      the dense selectively layer is used for rejecting solutes in the
      wastewaste stream, for example, and the porous support layer is
      used for providing mechanical strength to the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The method may include providing a nanocomposite solution
      comprising a polymer solution and nanomaterials. The polymer
      solution is first prepared in a suitable solvent or system of
      solvents. Suitable solvent or system of solvents include solvents
      that are miscible with the polymer so that a homogeneous solution
      may be formed thereafter. In one embodiment, the system of
      solvents may include N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone, Dimethylformamide,
      acetone and water (see Examples below).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In various embodiments, the polymer of the polymer solution
      is a natural polymer. Examples of the natural polymer include
      cellulose-based polymers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose
      triacetate, cellulose acetate proprianate, cellulose butyrate,
      cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose
      dibutyrate, cellulose tributyrate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and
      nitrocellulose. In one embodiment, the polymer in the polymer
      solution is cellulose acetate.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In various embodiments, the polymer of the polymer solution
      is a synthetic polymer. Examples of the synthetic polymer include
      polyamide, polybenzimidazole, polyethersulfone, polysulfone,
      polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrole, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
      polyethylene glycol, saponified polyethylene-vinyl acetate
      copolymer, triethylene glycol, and diethylene glycol.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials may be
      nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanowires, nanotubes, or nanospheres.
      In one embodiment, the nanomaterials are nanotubes. In another
      embodiment, the nanomaterials are nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials are inorganic
      materials. Examples of suitable inorganic materials include
      titanium, silicon, aluminium, zirconium, indium, tin, magnesium,
      calcium, including the respective oxide thereof and - alloy
      thereof. In one embodiment, the nanomaterials may be titanium
      oxide nanotubes or nanoparticles. In another embodiment, the
      nanomaterials may be tetraethyl orthosilicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials may be mesoporous
      materials. Examples of suitable mesoporous materials include
      aluminosilicate, aluminophopsphate, and zeolite.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials may be organic
      materials. Examples of suitable organic materials include
      dendrimers, graphite, graphene, carbon nanotube, and fullerene.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials are present in
      the polymer matrix in the range of about 0.1 wt% to about 20 wt%
      (based on total weight of the polymer matrix).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In various embodiments, the nanomaterials are in the size
      from about 1 nm to about 1,000 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The method may further include homogenizing the
      nanocomposite solution. In various embodiments, the nanocomposite
      solution may be stirred continuously until a homogenized
      nanocomposite solution is obtained. The stirring may be carried
      out via a mechanical stirrer or magnetic stirrer, for example. In
      various embodiments, the stirring is continued for more than one
      day. In one embodiment, the stirring is continued for about two
      days.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In various embodiments, the obtained homogenized
      nanocomposite solution may be subjected to an ultrasound bath to
      remove air bubbles or partially evaporate volatile components of
      the solvent. The volatile components may be vaporized at room
      temperature. <br>
      <br>
      [0032] The method may also include -subjecting the -homogenized
      nanocomposite solution to a cold water bath to produce the
      nanocomposite membrane in a gel-like form. The method may further
      include subjecting the gel nanocomposite membrane to a heat
      treatment to solidify the nanocomposite membrane, whereby the
      nanomaterials are dispersed within the polymer matrix of the
      nanocomposite membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In various embodiments, after obtaining the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution and prior to subjecting the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution to a cold water bath, the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution may be cast on a plate to form a cast film.
      For example, Fig. 1 illustrates the general process used for
      preparing nanocomposite membranes by solution casting. Phase
      inversion is used for the preparation of flat sheet membranes. In
      the polymer solution casting, a polymer solution, comprising
      polymers and nanomaterials (0.1 to 20 wt%, based on total weight
      of the polymer matrix) in solvents, is stirred continuously until
      the solution become homogenous. The polymer solution is then
      casted on a glass plate using a casting knife. The cast film was
      then immersed into the cold water bath (or coagulation bath) to
      complete the phase inversion. The membranes were then post-treated
      in a hot water bath.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In alternative embodiments, after obtaining the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution and prior to subjecting the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution to a cold water bath, the homogenized
      nanocomposite solution may be extruded through a hollow fiber
      spinneret. For example, Fig. 2 illustrates the general process
      used for preparing nanocomposite membranes in the form of hollow
      fiber by dry- wet spinning. In the dry- wet spinning process, the
      polymer solution (same as that used for preparing the flat sheet
      membranes) flows through the ring nozzle of the spinneret while a
      bore fluid flowed through the inner tube of the spinneret. The
      fiber passes through a controlled environment air gap before
      entering -the cold water bath (or coagulation -bath). The hollow
      fiber filament then passes through a series of rollers in the
      coagulation bath. Following that, it is then passed through a
      washing bath. The fully formed hollow fiber is then continuously
      collected on a wind up drum. Prior to evaluation test, the
      membranes are subjected to a pretreatment process to reduce pore
      size of the membranes. In the pretreatment process, the membranes
      are immersed in a water bath at room temperature and the water
      bath with the membranes in it are gradually heated from ambient
      temperature to about 60 to 100 [deg.]C range in about 20 to 30
      minutes. The final temperature is kept constant for about 10
      minutes. The water bath together with the membranes are then
      cooled drastically to below 60 [deg.]C by pouring cold water
      directly into the bath to freeze the membrane structure. The
      membranes are then ready to undergo solvent exchange to prevent
      fibers from collapsing during evaluation tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In various embodiments, the nanocomposite membrane prepared
      thereof by the above-described method may be a porous support
      layer for providing mechanical strength to subsequent layers
      disposed thereon. In various embodiments, the nanocomposite
      membrane may include a porous support layer and a dense selective
      layer. The dense selective layer is disposed adjacent the porous
      support layer. The dense selective layer is permeable to water but
      is impermeable to solutes. The porous support layer comprises
      nanomaterials dispersed within a polymer matrix. The porous
      support layer may provide mechanical strength to the nanocomposite
      membrane. Both the porous support layer and the dense selective
      layer may be formed of the same polymer. Alternatively, the
      polymer of the porous support layer and the dense selective layer
      is different.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In various embodiments, the membrane may include a smooth
      layer disposed adjacent the dense selective layer and away from
      the porous support layer. The smooth layer may be used to prevent
      or minimize membrane fouling. The materials for the smooth layer
      can be polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In various embodiments, the membrane may also include an
      intermediate layer between the dense selective layer and the
      porous support layer. The intermediate layer may be a polymer
      which is the same as the dense selective layer, the same as the
      porous support layer, the same as both the dense selective layer
      and the porous support layer, or different from any of the layer.
      The mateials for the intermediate layer can be cellulose,
      polysulfone, polyethersulfone and polyacrylonitrile.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In various embodiments where the membrane include a dense
      selective layer and a porous support layer, the dense selective
      layer may be formed and disposed on the porous support layer by a
      method selected from the group consisting of phase inversion,
      interfacial polymerization, spray coating, and dip coating. In
      various embodiments, the dense selective layer may be formed
      simultaneously with the porous support layer. In alternative
      embodiments, the dense selective layer is subsequently formed on
      the porous support layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In one embodiment, the nanocomposite membranes may be used
      in forward osmosis processes. For example, the nanocomposite
      membranes may be used in wastewater treatment, seawater
      desalination, food and pharmaceutical processing, or power
      generation via forward osmosis processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The water permeate flux of the nanocomposite membranes were
      found to be dependent on the amount of nanomaterials used.
      Compared with the forward osmosis membrane fabricated without
      nanomaterials, a breakthrough in the water permeate flux of the
      nanocomposite forward osmosis membranes was achieved, with almost
      unchanged solute rejection performance. <br>
      [0041] In order that the invention may be readily understood and
      put into&lt;^&gt;practical &lt;~&gt; effect, particular
      embodiments will now be described by way of the following non-
      limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Forward Osmosis Tests of Nanocomposite Membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the following Examples, membranes prepared according to
      the invention were tested in forward osmosis mode without
      hydraulic pressure. Each membrane was tested in a crossflow mode
      with 1M A12(S04)3 as draw solution and DI water as feed solution.
      The feed solution was directed against the dense selective layer
      of the membranes and the draw solution was directed against the
      support layer. Both the feed and draw solutions were maintained at
      room temperature 25 [deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Results of the solute rejection rate by the nanocomposite
      membranes of the following Examples are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
      <br>

        Membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Determination Of Water Permeate Flux And Solute Rejection</b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] In the following Examples, water permeate flux is
      determined by measuring the weight change of the draw solution
      over a selected time period. As water transports across the
      membrane from the feed water into the draw solution, the weight of
      draw solution was increased. The solute concentration is
      determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer
      (ICP). Example 1: Flat Sheet Nanocomposite Membranes with TiO[3/4]
      Nanotubes Dispersed in Cellulose Matrix<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Ti02 nanotubes were fabricated as follows: Commercial Ti02
      (P25, degussa) powders were mixed with a 1 OM NaOH aqueous
      solution by magnetic stirring, then the mixture was added into a
      Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated
      to 160 [deg.]C from room temperature in 2 h, then maintained at
      160 [deg.]C for 48 h and finally cooled to room temperature. The
      obtained precipitates were firstly washed with distilled water,
      then adjusted the pH to neutral with 0.1M HC1 solution, and
      finally were washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol
      until no CF was examined in the solution. After ultrasound
      treatment for 10 min, the Ti02 nanotubes were obtained. The
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Ti02 nanotubes is shown
      in Fig. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Conventional phase inversion was used for the preparation
      of flat sheet nanocomposite forward osmosis membranes. A solution
      comprising cellulose acetate (MW 30,000 g/mol, 39.8 wt% acethyl
      content) 22.0 wt%, acetone 66.7 wt%, water 10.0 wt%, magnesium
      perchlorate 1.0 wt% and Ti02 nanotubes (Fig. 3) 0.3 wt% was
      stirred continuously for two days. The solution was homogenized
      and put into an ultrasound bath for 30 min to remove air bubbles
      before casting. Then the casting solution was casted on a glass
      plate using a casting knife. The cast film was then immersed in an
      ice water bath to complete the phase separation. The membranes
      were heat-treated at 80 [deg.]C in a hot water bath for 10 min.
      Then the membranes were immersed in a 50 wt% glycerol water
      solution for another 24 h and then were dried in air at room
      temperature for evaluation tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Under the same forward osmosis experimental conditions, the
      nanocomposite membrane had a notably higher water flux than
      commercially available HTI(TM) membrane (Fig. 6). <br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Flat-Sheet Nanocomposite Membranes With T1O2
        Nanoparticles Dispersed In Cellulose Matrix</b><br>
      <br>
      [0048] Conventional phase inversion was used for the preparation
      of flat-sheet nanocomposite forward osmosis membranes. A solution
      comprising cellulose acetate (MW 30,000 g/mol, 39.8 wt% acethyl
      content) 22.0 wt%, acetone 66.7 wt%, water 10.0 wt%, magnesium
      perchlorate 1.1 wt% and Ti02 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) 0.2 wt%
      was stirred continuously for two days. The solution was
      homogenized and put into an ultrasound bath for 30 min to remove
      air bubbles before casting. Then the casting solution was casted
      on a glass plate using a casting knife. The cast film was then
      immersed in an ice water bath to complete the phase separation.
      The membranes were heat-treated at 80 [deg.]C in a hot water bath
      for 10 min. Then the membranes were immersed in a 50 wt% glycerol
      solution for another 24 h and then were dried in air at room
      temperature for evaluation tests.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3: Flat-Sheet Nanocomposite Membranes With Silica
        Nanoparticles Dispersed In Cellulose Matrix</b><br>
      <br>
      [0049] Conventional phase inversion was used for the preparation
      of flat-sheet nanocomposite membranes. An acetate solution
      comprising cellulose acetate (MW 30,000 g/mol, 39.8 wt% acethyl
      content) 22.0 wt%, acetone 66.0 wt%, water 10.0 parts, magnesium
      perchlorate 1.1 wt% and Tetraethyl orthosilicate 0.9 wt% was
      stirred continuously for two days. The solution was homogenized
      and put into an ultrasound bath for 30 min to remove air bubbles
      before casting. Then the casting solution was casted on a glass
      plate using a casting knife. The cast film was then immersed in an
      ice water bath to complete the phase separation. The membranes
      were heat-treated at 80 [deg.]C in a hot water bath for 10 min.
      Then the membranes were immersed in a 50 wt% glycerol solution for
      another 24 h and then were dried in air at room temperature for -
      evaluation tests.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4: Nanocomposite Membranes In The Form Of Hollow Fiber</b><br>
      <br>
      [0050] Spinning of the hollow-fiber membrane was based on the
      dry-wet technique.<br>
      <br>
      A homogenous spinning solution was prepared same as that for the
      flat-sheet membrane. Afterward, the dope was extruded through a
      hollow fiber spinneret. Both the core liquid and the external
      coagulant were pure water, and the external coagulant temperature
      was controlled at 80 [deg.]C. The air gap which is the distance
      between the tip of spinneret and the surface of external coagulant
      was kept 20 cm. After coagulation in iced water, the resulting
      hollow fiber was wound up with a take-up roller and rinsed with
      water to remove residual solvents. Then the fibers were annealed
      in a hot water bath at 80 [deg.]C. Finally, the fibers were
      immersed in a 50 wt% glycerol solution for another 24 h and then
      were dried in air at room temperature for evaluation tests.<br>
