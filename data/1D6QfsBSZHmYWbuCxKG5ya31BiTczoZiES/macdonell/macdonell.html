      <div align="center"><big><b>Proven one-step process to convert CO2
            and water directly into liquid hydrocarbon fuel</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A team of University of Texas at Arlington chemists and engineers
      have proven that concentrated light, heat and high pressures can
      drive the one-step conversion of carbon dioxide and water directly
      into useable liquid hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <br>
      This simple and inexpensive new sustainable fuels technology could
      potentially help limit global warming by removing carbon dioxide
      from the atmosphere to make fuel. The process also reverts oxygen
      back into the system as a byproduct of the reaction, with a clear
      positive environmental impact, researchers said.<br>
      <br>
      "Our process also has an important advantage over battery or
      gaseous-hydrogen powered vehicle technologies as many of the
      hydrocarbon products from our reaction are exactly what we use in
      cars, trucks and planes, so there would be no need to change the
      current fuel distribution system," said Frederick MacDonnell, UTA
      interim chair of chemistry and biochemistry and co-principal
      investigator of the project.<br>
      <br>
      In an article published today in the Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences titled "Solar photothermochemical alkane
      reverse combustion," the researchers demonstrate that the one-step
      conversion of carbon dioxide and water into liquid hydrocarbons
      and oxygen can be achieved in a photothermochemical flow reactor
      operating at 180 to 200 C and pressures up to 6 atmospheres.<br>
      <br>
      "We are the first to use both light and heat to synthesize liquid
      hydrocarbons in a single stage reactor from carbon dioxide and
      water," said Brian Dennis, UTA professor of mechanical and
      aerospace engineering and co-principal investigator of the
      project.<br>
      <br>
      "Concentrated light drives the photochemical reaction, which
      generates high-energy intermediates and heat to drive
      thermochemical carbon-chain-forming reactions, thus producing
      hydrocarbons in a single-step process."<br>
      <br>
      Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research commended the
      researchers on their success.<br>
      <br>
      "Discovering a one-step process to generate renewable hydrocarbon
      fuels from carbon dioxide and water is a huge achievement," Dimos
      said. "This work strengthens UTA's reputation as a leading
      research institution in the area of Global Environmental Impact,
      as laid out in our Strategic Plan 2020."<br>
      <br>
      The hybrid photochemical and thermochemical catalyst used for the
      experiment was based on titanium dioxide, a white powder that
      cannot absorb the entire visible light spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      "Our next step is to develop a photo-catalyst better matched to
      the solar spectrum," MacDonnell said. "Then we could more
      effectively use the entire spectrum of incident light to work
      towards the overall goal of a sustainable solar liquid fuel."<br>
      <br>
      The authors envision using parabolic mirrors to concentrate
      sunlight on the catalyst bed, providing both heat and
      photo-excitation for the reaction. Excess heat could even be used
      to drive related operations for a solar fuels facility, including
      product separations and water purification.<br>
      <br>
      The research was supported by grants from the National Science
      Foundation and the Robert A. Welch Foundation. Wilaiwan Chanmanee,
      postdoctoral research associate in mechanical and aerospace
      engineering, and Mohammad Fakrul Islam, graduate research
      assistant and Ph.D. candidate in the department of Chemistry and
      Biochemistry at UTA, also participated in the project.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell and Dennis have received more than $2.6 million in
      grants and corporate funding for sustainable energy projects over
      the last four years.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell and Dennis' investigations also are focused on
      converting natural gas for use as high-grade diesel and jet fuel.
      The researchers developed the gas-to-liquid technology in
      collaboration with an industrial partner in UTA's Center for
      Renewable Energy and Science Technology, or CREST, lab, and are
      now working to commercialize the process.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell also has worked on developing new photocatalysts for
      hydrogen generation, with the goal of creating an artificial
      photosynthetic system which uses solar energy to split water
      molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
      used as a clean fuel.<br>

      <b>Significance</b><br>
      <br>
      An efficient solar process for the one-step conversion of CO2 and
      H2O to C5+ liquid hydrocarbons and O2 would revolutionize how
      solar fuel replacements for gasoline, jet, and diesel solar fuels
      could be produced and could lead to a carbon-neutral fuel cycle.
      We demonstrate that this reaction is possible in a single-step
      process by operating the photocatalytic reaction at elevated
      temperatures and pressures. The process uses cheap and
      earth-abundant catalytic materials, and the unusual operating
      conditions expand the range of materials that can be developed as
      photocatalysts. Whereas the efficiency of the current system is
      not commercially viable, it is far from optimized and it opens a
      promising new path by which such solar processes may be realized.<br>
      Abstract<br>
      <br>
      A one-step, gas-phase photothermocatalytic process for the
      synthesis of hydrocarbons, including liquid alkanes, aromatics,
      and oxygenates, with carbon numbers (Cn) up to C13, from CO2 and
      water is demonstrated in a flow photoreactor operating at elevated
      temperatures (180–200 °C) and pressures (1–6 bar) using a 5%
      cobalt on TiO2 catalyst and under UV irradiation. A parametric
      study of temperature, pressure, and partial pressure ratio
      revealed that temperatures in excess of 160 °C are needed to
      obtain the higher Cn products in quantity and that the product
      distribution shifts toward higher Cn products with increasing
      pressure. In the best run so far, over 13% by mass of the products
      were C5+ hydrocarbons and some of these, i.e., octane, are drop-in
      replacements for existing liquid hydrocarbons fuels. Dioxygen was
      detected in yields ranging between 64% and 150%. In principle,
      this tandem photochemical–thermochemical process, fitted with a
      photocatalyst better matched to the solar spectrum, could provide
      a cheap and direct method to produce liquid hydrocarbons from CO2
      and water via a solar process which uses concentrated sunlight for
      both photochemical excitation to generate high-energy
      intermediates and heat to drive important thermochemical
      carbon-chain-forming reactions.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims priority to United States
      Provisional Application No.: 61/928,719 filed January 17, 2014.
      The entire text the above -referenced disclosure is specifically
      incorporated herein by reference without disclaimer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>A. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention generally concerns thermal, photocatalytic
      processes and systems that can be used to produce hydrocarbons
      from water and Ci feedstocks, e.g., CO and/or C02.<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Recycling C02 to produce hydrocarbons, particularly long
      chain hydrocarbons, in a commercially viable manner has long been
      a goal of scientific research. Such a process could produce a
      chemical fuel and assist in curbing the effect of climate change.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In order to achieve commercial viability, the energy
      required must be provided from a renewable source. One source that
      holds particular promise is the sun. Solar light energy provides a
      seemingly infinite source of energy. Thus, harvesting the energy
      of solar light and its subsequent storage in the form of chemical
      fuels hold promise to address the current and future demand of
      energy supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Despite nearly 40 years of research on the photocatalytic
      reduction of C02, the scientific community is still a long way
      from efficient and commercially viable devices. Presently, yields
      are too low to be viable and predominantly produce methane. The
      highest rates of product formation generally do not exceed tens of
      μιηοΐ of product per hour of illumination per gram of
      photocatalyst. Habisreutinger et al., "Photocatalytic Reduction of
      C02 on Ti02 and Other Semiconductors," 52 Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed.
      7372, 7373 (2013). Longer chain hydrocarbons are produced at even
      lower concentrations. See e.g. , Varghese et al., "High-Rate Solar
      Photocatalytic Conversion of C02 and Water Vapor to Hydrocarbon
      Fuels," Nano Letters, vol. 9, no. 2, 2009, at p. 734.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] The present application is directed to compositions,
      devices, systems, and methods that generate heavier hydrocarbons
      (i.e., hydrocarbons having &gt;2 carbons) by way of coupling the
      photo-oxidation of water and the photo-reduction of CO or C02 with
      thermal- chemical carbon-chain formation. The energy for which can
      be largely if not entirely provided by the sun through the use of
      concentrated solar radiation. Harnessing the sun's energy for the
      photochemical excitation of a photoactive material as well as the
      heat needed to favor carbon-chain formation reactions make the
      described processes energy efficient.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In particular, the present application involves a
      continuous gas phase process for the photochemical water oxidation
      under conditions that favor the transfer of the associated
      electrons and/or protons to drive the reduction of C02 or CO and
      the conversion of the reduced CO or C02 products to longer
      carbon-chain products. Some of these conversion reactions involve
      Fischer-Tropsch processes that are thermal and pressure driven
      processes. In addition, the presence of alkylbenzene products
      suggests that surface bound alkynes are also formed and
      cyclotrimerize as another method of forming higher carbon number
      hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>

      accordance with the present disclosure. In various embodiments,

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] Various features and advantageous details are explained
      more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are
      illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the
      following description. It should be understood, however, that the
      detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating
      embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration
      only, and not by way of limitation. Various substitutions,
      modifications, additions, and/or rearrangements will become
      apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from this
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In the following description, numerous specific details are
      provided to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed
      embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will
      recognize, however, that the invention may be practiced without
      one or more of the specific details, or with other systems,
      methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances,
      well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or
      described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The present invention is predicated upon the unexpected
      realization of a substantially improved process and system for
      generating heavier hydrocarbons from a Ci feedstock and water
      according to a process that generates the required activation
      energies mostly if not entirely from sunlight. While not wishing
      to be bound by any particular theory, the present invention is
      directed at an improved process for generating heavier
      hydrocarbons from CI feedstock and water using photocatalytic and
      Fischer-Tropsch type processes in a single reactor. The improved
      process can generate heavier hydrocarbons with the use of
      renewable energy sources. (It should be realized, however, the
      invention contemplates the optional use of features that provide
      energy from nonrenewable sources.) Among the advantages,
      hydrocarbons can be produced at yields greater than 100 μg/g of
      catalyst per hour and even greater than 200 μg/g of catalyst per
      hour. In addition, the percentage of heavier hydrocarbons is
      greater than the percentage of methane and/or methanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As described in detail below, the present disclosure
      contemplates that one or more photochemical reactions and thermal
      reactions take place in tandem, preferably within a single
      reaction chamber or single zone within a reaction vessel.
      Moreover, the photochemical reactions take place at the relatively
      high temperatures and/or the relatively high pressures needed to
      facilitate the thermal reactions that produce heavier hydrocarbons
      at yields greater than 3 μιηοΐ/g of catalyst per hour. Preferably,
      the reaction chamber is maintained so that the Ci feedstock and
      water therein are at a temperature greater than or equal to 100°C,
      and more preferably higher than 120°C. The reaction chamber may
      exhaust into a recovery unit wherein the generated hydrocarbons
      are extracted from the exhausted gas stream, and a return path
      from the recovery unit may couple to the reaction chamber to form
      a closed loop system, as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The catalyst of the present disclosure is a composite
      material preferably in the form of particles that are sufficiently
      small to be characterized as nanoparticles (e.g., they have an
      average diameter less than about 100 nm). The catalyst composite
      comprises a photoactive material and a conductive species (e.g., a
      supported metal catalyst) on which (not wishing to be bound by a
      particular theory) water oxidation, Ci feedstock reduction, and
      Fischer-Tropsch type reactions are believed to occur causing a
      gaseous mixture of Ci feedstock and water, exposed to both
      sunlight and thermal energy, to generate hydrocarbons, a majority
      portion of which are heavier hydrocarbons. Ci feedstock are simple
      carbon- containing substrates that contain one carbon atom per
      molecule and include, e.g., methane, carbon dioxide, carbon
      monoxide, and methanol. In various embodiments, the gas stream
      comprises Ci feedstock that is substantially CO and C02. In
      various embodiments, the gas stream comprises Ci feedstock that is
      substantially CO or C02.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A. Photoactive Catalysts</b><br>
      <br>
      [0038] In accordance with the present disclosure, the photoactive
      catalysts can comprise a photoactive material and a conductive
      species disposed or interspersed on at least a portion of the
      surface of the photoactive material. With respect to the
      photoactive material, it can comprise any material that provides
      suitable band gap excitations (e.g., semiconductive materials).
      With respect to the conductive species, it can comprise any
      material that accepts the photo-generated electrons and
      facilitates transporting such electrons to the surface for
      participation in the reduction process and carbon-chain formation.
      In various embodiments, the photoactive catalyst is a supported
      metal catalyst. [0039] While not wishing to be bound by a
      particularly theory, with reference to FIG.<br>
      <br>
      1, in various embodiments, the semiconductor(s) is selected to
      have a band gap that spans the range of the reduction and
      oxidation potentials relevant to the photo-catalyzed reactions,
      namely the oxidation of water (&gt;0.82 V vs NHE at pH 7.0) (1)
      and the reduction of Ci feedstock (&lt;-0.41 V vs NHE at pH 7.0)
      (2), the later predominantly occurring on the conductive material
      deposits. For example, the band gap of titanium dioxide is 3.0 and
      3.2 eV for rutile and anatase, respectively, and thus, only
      radiation shorter than 400 nm is absorbed, which is not very
      matched with the majority of the solar spectrum reaching the
      earth's surface. The valence band edges for rutile and anatase are
      well in excess of 0.82 V and the conduction band edge is
      approximately -0.40 V) In certain embodiments, other
      semiconductor(s) are selected so that the photoactive catalyst
      absorbs a wide spectrum of solar radiation. For example, BiV04 is
      a semiconducting metal oxide which absorbs light at wavelengths
      less than 550 nm and which could be used as a photoactive support
      for the metal co-catalyst to drive the desired reaction utilizing
      a greater portion of the solar spectrum. In certain embodiments,
      the supported metal catalyst is adapted to absorb electromagnetic
      radiation having wavelength less than 700 nm, less than 600 nm, or
      less than 500 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Combined with the semiconductive material, conductive
      materials can comprise a material, such as a metal or metal oxide,
      that facilitates transporting the photo- generated electrons from
      the semiconductive material to the surface for reduction of Ci
      feedstock (2) and subsequent carbon-chain formation (3). While not
      wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
      the semiconductor serves as the photo-anode, oxidizing water and
      transferring electrons and protons to the conductive material
      islands. Presumably, these form surface hydrides that are the
      reducing agents for Ci reduction and subsequent carbon-chain
      formation reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The oxidation and reduction reactions are summarized below
      with an example of reaction conditions. With the use of the
      described photoactive catalyst and methods of the present
      disclosure, reactions (l)-(3) can take place in a single reactor.<br>

      <br>
      It is noted, particularly where the CI feedstock includes CO, a
      series of thermochemical reactions are possible (e.g., reverse
      water-gas shift chemistry coupled with Fischer-Tropsch chemistry),
      and could also yield hydrocarbons. To the extent such reactions
      are occurring, it would be in addition to the coupled
      photo-thermochemical process described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Semi-conductive materials can comprise metal oxides,
      preferably Ti02. The<br>
      <br>
      Ti02 can be in any form such as anatase or rutile. Other examples
      of semi-conductive materials include CdS, TaON, ZnO, and BiV04.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In some embodiments, the semi-conductive material is a
      nanoparticle. The nanoparticle can comprise any shape. The term
      nanoparticles, refers to a particle having an average width of
      less than about 200 nm. These nanoparticles may be spherical or
      close to spherical in shape. Nanoparticles can have a smooth
      surface or a rough surface, e.g., a highly varied surface with
      cracks, pits, pores, undulations, or the like to increase the
      overall surface area. Nanoparticles that are in the form of
      nanowires, nanotubes, or irregular shaped particles may also be
      used. Nanoparticles, such as nanotubes, can have a low wall
      thickness that facilitates transfer of photo-generated charge
      carriers to the conductive species. If the particles do not have a
      spherical shape, the size of the particles can be characterized by
      the diameter of a generally corresponding sphere having the same
      total volume as the particle. In some embodiments, the
      nanoparticles have an average diameter of at least 5 nm. In some
      embodiments, the nanoparticles have an average diameter of less
      than about 50 nm and even less than about 20 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In various embodiments, the conductive material comprises
      any material suitable as a catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch
      reaction. In some embodiments, the conductive material comprises
      or consists essentially of a metal or metal oxides of the metal
      selected from the following group: Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd,
      Pt and Ag or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the
      conductive material comprises Co and/or C02O3. In certain
      embodiments, the conductive material is at least 90%, 91%, 92%,
      93%, 94%, 95%, 96%o, 97%), 98%o, or 99% C02O3. In various
      embodiments, the conductive material comprises a plurality of
      small particles, such as metal crystallites or nanoparticles. As
      schematically illustrated in FIGS. 2 A to 2B, the conductive
      material 152 can be surface decorated or wet- impregnated onto the
      semi-conductive material 154 such that conductive particles or
      deposits 152 are disposed or interspersed on the semi-conductive
      surface 154, referred to together as a metal supported catalyst
      150. The % weight of conductive material relative to the semi-
      conductive material can be any amount between 1% to 30%&gt;, such
      as about 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%,
      15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%), 24%), 25%), 26%),
      27%, 28%, 29%, or any value or range there between. In some
      embodiments, the % weight of the conductive material relative to
      the semi-conductive material is between about 2% to about 15%.
      [0045] In some embodiments, the semi-conductive material can
      comprise a combination of semi-conductive materials and one or
      more dopants to enhance the efficiency of the catalyst through
      extension of the absorption range and/or improvement in the charge
      separation to increase the number of photo-excited electrons and
      decrease the number that return to the valence band. For example,
      Ti02 can be doped with nitrogen, such as nitrogen in the form of
      ammonium flouride. The % weight of the dopant relative to the
      semi- conductive material can be any amount between 0% to 5%, such
      as between about 1% and 3%.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Alternatively or in addition thereto, a hygroscopic
      additive can be applied or added to the semiconductor to aid in
      the stabilization or formation of a surface hydration layer to
      enhance proton transport during active catalysis. For example,
      depositing hygroscopic salts or acids onto the semiconductor
      particles can favor hydration under the process conditions
      described herein and support proton transport from the sites of
      water oxidation on the semiconductor surface to the conductor
      material deposits. Examples of hydroscopic salts include the
      various salts and acidic salts that can form from combining at
      least one of the following anions: P04&lt;3"&gt;, HP04&lt;2"&gt;,
      H2P04&lt;"&gt;, S04&lt;2"&gt;, HS04&lt;"&gt;, C03&lt;2&gt; ,
      OH&lt;"&gt; , F&lt;"&gt;, CI&lt;"&gt;,<br>
      <br>
      I _|_ _|_ _|_ _|_ 2"!" 2 I<br>
      <br>
      Br&lt;"&gt;, or Γ, with at least one of the following cations: Li
      , Na , K , Rb , Cs , Be , Mg , Ca , Sr&lt;2+&gt;, Ba&lt;2+&gt;, or
      Al&lt;3+&gt;. Examples of acids include H2S04, H3P04, HF, HC1, HBr
      and HI. The % weight of the hygroscopic additive relative to the
      semi-conductive material can be any amount between 0% and 5%,
      preferably 1% and 3%.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Alternatively or in addition thereto, a redox-active
      additive could be applied or added to the semiconductor to enhance
      water oxidation. For example, depositing a redox- active
      transition-metal salt onto the semiconductor particles can
      facilitate or enhance the water oxidation process. Examples of the
      redox active transition metal salts include the various salts that
      can form from combining at least one of the following cations:
      Mn&lt;2+&gt;, Mn&lt;3+&gt;, Mn&lt;4+&gt;, Fe&lt;2+&gt;,
      Fe&lt;3+&gt;, Co&lt;2+&gt;, Co&lt;3+&gt;, Ni&lt;2+&gt;,
      Ru&lt;2+&gt;, Ru&lt;3+&gt;, Ru&lt;4+&gt;, Rh&lt;+&gt;,
      Rh&lt;2+&gt;, Rh&lt;3+&gt;, Ir&lt;+&gt;, Ir&lt;2+&gt;, and
      Ir&lt;3+&gt; and at least one of the following anions:
      P04&lt;3"&gt;, HP04&lt;2"&gt;, H2P04&lt;"&gt;, S04&lt;2"&gt;,
      HS04&lt;"&gt;, C03&lt;2"&gt;, O&lt;2"&gt;, OH&lt;"&gt;,
      F&lt;"&gt;, CI&lt;"&gt;, Br&lt;"&gt; and Γ. The % weight of the
      redox-active additive relative to the semi-conductive material can
      be any amount between 0% and 5%, such as between 1% and 3%.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Alternatively or in addition thereto, a supported metal
      catalyst can be further modified by addition of a basic metal
      oxide promotor of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction. For
      example, the basic metal oxide promotor can comprise an oxide salt
      comprising at least one of the following cations: Sc , Y , La , Ce
      , Pr ,
      Nd&lt;3+&gt;,Sm&lt;3+&gt;,Eu&lt;3+&gt;,Gd&lt;3+&gt;,Tb&lt;3+&gt;,Dy&lt;3+&gt;,Ho&lt;3+&gt;,Er&lt;3+&gt;,Tm&lt;3+&gt;,Yb&lt;3+&gt;,




      Ac&lt;3+&gt;, Th&lt;3+&gt;, Pa&lt;3+&gt;, and U&lt;3+&gt;. The %
      weight of the basic metal oxide promotor relative to the
      semi-conductive material can be any amount between 0% and 5%, such
      as between 0.5% and 3%.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In various embodiments, metal supported catalyst 150 is
      deposited on the surface of a substrate-providing member 140,
      referred to together as a catalyst body 130. Substrate-providing
      member 140 can be a molded or extruded body. The surface can be
      smooth or porous. Substrate-providing member 140 can comprise any
      suitable material able to withstand the process temperatures and
      be substantially inert. In various embodiments, the catalyst
      comprises water soluble components, but is still adapted to
      withstand the reactant gases and not be significantly dissolved
      during use. In various embodiments, the material is substantially
      transparent to visible and ultraviolet light at least within the
      absorption range of semiconductor. In some embodiment, the
      material can absorb the infrared radiation received from the
      sunlight or from the ongoing reaction to facilitate maintaining
      the high reaction temperatures the reaction chamber, as described
      below. Examples of material of which substrate-providing member
      140 can be composed include glass, quartz, or any other solid UV
      transmitting medium that is solid at process temperatures, such as
      temperatures up to 250°C.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Substrate providing member 140 can be any shape for
      optimizing the surface area upon which catalyst composite 150 is
      disposed to receive electromagnetic radiation. For example,
      substrate member 140 can define any shape, e.g., a planar,
      spherical, ovoidal, elliptical, prismoidal, polyhedron, or
      pyramidal body. In some embodiments, the catalyst composite 150
      can be coated on bead(s), pellet(s), or the like. In other
      embodiments, catalyst composite 150 can be coated on a body having
      a generally planar or corrugated surface, such as a fin(s)
      radially extending out from a central core or a cylindrical body
      having an outer surface comprising a plurality of undulating or
      otherwise protruding features to form a corrugated surface. In yet
      other embodiments, substrate-providing member can comprise
      three-dimensional substantially porous body or web-like body that
      provides a substrate and allows sunlight to pass through its full
      depth. [0051] In addition, substrate providing member 140 can be
      of any suitable size. For example, when in the shape of a bead,
      pellet, or particle, substrate providing member 140 can have a
      minimum width of greater than approximately 1 mm, and can have a
      maximum width of less than approximately 20 mm. In some
      embodiments, substrate providing member 140 is substantially
      spherical, and has a diameter in the range of approximately 1 mm
      to 10 mm, such as 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, or 9
      mm. In other embodiments, when substrate providing member provides
      a generally planar or corrugated surface or is a porous or
      web-like body, the dimensions can be such that substrate member
      140 extends the length and width of a reaction chamber discussed
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The catalyst body 130 can further comprise a medium within
      which the metal supported catalyst 150 are dispersed. The medium
      can allow catalyst 150 to adhere to a substrate. In addition, the
      medium can facilitate surface redox reactions and improve the
      efficiency of catalyst 150. For example, a medium can comprise an
      ionomer, e.g., a perfluorosulfonic acid (H&lt;+&gt;
      form)/polytetrafluoroethylene copolymer (Nafion&lt;®&gt;). Other
      suitable mediums include QPAC (poly(alkylene carbonate)), QPAC 25
      (PEC, polyethylene carbonate), QPAC 40 (PPC, polypropylene
      carbonate), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene
      oxide) (PS-b-PEO) polymers, and the like. Other ionomers or
      guidelines for selecting or designing an ionomer may be found in
      the following article: Viswanathan &amp; Helen, "Is Nafion, the
      only choice?", Bulletin of the Catalysis Society of India, 6
      (2007) 50-66, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. The % weight of a medium relative to the semi-conductive
      material can be any amount between 0% and 10%, such as 1%, 2%, 3%,
      4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, or 9%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Photoactive Catalytic Reactor </b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] With reference to FIG. 3 A, another aspect of the present
      disclosure comprises an apparatus for carrying out the
      thermochemical and photochemical reactions. In particular, the
      reactor 200 comprises a reaction vessel 210 having a vessel wall
      212 defining a reaction chamber 214 and having one or more gas
      inlet(s) 216 configured for gaseous inflow of water and Ci
      feedstock and a gas outlet 218 configured for gas outflow
      comprising hydrocarbons, both of which are in fluid communication
      with chamber 214. In some embodiments, a plurality of catalyst
      bodies 230 can sufficiently fill reaction chamber 214 to form a
      "packed bed." In other embodiments, a catalytic body can comprise
      a corrugated surface or a porous or web-like body coated with the
      described catalyst. Reaction vessel 210 can further comprise a
      filter (not shown) at gas outlet 218 to prevent escape of catalyst
      bodies 130. <br>
      <br>
      [0054] During use, the reaction vessel 210 can be exposed to solar
      radiation and heated at or above the boiling temperature of water
      to convert the gaseous mixture of water and Ci feedstock into
      hydrocarbons including alkanes or alcohols having at least 2
      carbons. Examples of the hydrocarbons that can be formed include
      methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, septane,
      octane, nonane, decane, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,
      butanol, hexanol, acetic acid, acetone, alkyl benzene and
      oxygenates thereof, as well as longer alkanes, alcohols, and/or
      organic acids, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, reactor
      200 can generate hydrocarbons having at least 2 carbons at a rate
      of at least 50 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 60 μg/g of catalyst per
      hour, 70 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 80 μg/g of catalyst per hour,
      90 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 100 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 150
      μg/g of catalyst per hour, 200 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 250 μg/g
      of catalyst per hour, 300 μg/g of catalyst per hour, 350 μg/g of
      catalyst per hour, or more. For example, as can be discerned from
      Table 3 in Example 4 below, a reactor in accordance with the
      present disclosure was shown to generate hydrocarbons having at
      least 2 carbons at a rate of approximately 87 g/g of catalyst per
      hour (at 2.7 atm and 0.6 Pw/C), and when including CO, methane and
      methanol in this calculation, the productivity value of the
      catalyst is even greater, such as at 121 μg/g of catalyst per
      hour. <br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some embodiments, the process conditions of the reactor
      can be adapted to generate one or more alkybenzene derivatives
      including toluene (C7H7), ethylbenzene (CgHio), propylbenzene
      (C9H12), ortho-, meta-, and para-xylenes (CgHio), ortho-, meta-,
      and para-methylethylbenzene (C9H12), ortho-, meta-, and
      para-methylpropylbenzene (C10H14), ortho-, meta-, and
      para-diethylbenzene (C10H14) as well as thier oxygenates. For
      example, the process conditions can comprise a Pw/C between 0.2
      and 1 , such as 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, or 0.3. In various
      embodiments, the process conditions are adapted such that alkyne
      cyclotrimerization reactions occur in the reactor in addition to
      the Fischer-Tropsch reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Reaction vessel 210 is configured to operate at
      temperatures greater than 100°C and to permit electromagnetic
      radiation, e.g., sun light, to pass through at least a section of
      vessel wall 212 and into chamber 214 where a plurality of
      catalytic bodies 130 are disposed. For example, vessel wall 212
      can be composed of a substantially transparent material that is
      substantially heat tolerant and substantially UV tolerant
      material. In addition, in some embodiments, vessel wall 212
      material may be required to withstand higher pressures, e.g.,
      absolute pressures between 1 atm to 20 atm or any range
      therebetween. In some embodiments, vessel wall 212 can have a
      thickness less than about 10mm, 5mm, 4mm, 3mm, 2mm, 1mm, or any
      amount therebetween. In some embodiments, vessel wall 212
      comprises any material through which radiation, such as sunlight,
      can pass through, and that can maintain high tensile strength at
      process temperatures, such as, temperatures up to 250°C, e.g.,
      quartz, glass, (such as tempered glass and borosilicate glass), or
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] One or more of walls 212 of the reaction vessel 210 or a
      portion thereof may be formed of transparent material. It is also
      possible that most or all of the walls 212 of reaction vessel 210
      are transparent such that light may enter from many directions.
      For example, with reference to FIG. 3B, reaction vessel 210 may be
      a glass cylinder that is surrounded by an trough-like solar
      concentrator 206 that reflects light back into the reaction
      vessel. In another embodiment, reactor vessel 210 may have one
      side that is transparent to allow the incident radiation to enter
      and the other sides may have a reflective interior surface that
      reflects the majority of the solar radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Reaction vessel 210 can be configured to operate at ambient
      operating pressures. Other embodiments, reaction vessel 210 can be
      configured to operate at much higher pressures to improve or vary
      hydrocarbon yields as appropriate. For example, operating
      pressures can be up to 30 atm. In some embodiments, reaction
      vessel 210 is configured to maintain an operating pressure of
      between about 1.0 atm and about 15 atm, or a smaller range
      therebetween. For example, operating pressures can be about 1 atm,
      2 atm, 3 atm, 4 atm, 5 atm, 6 atm, 7 atm, 8 atm, 9 atm, 10 atm, 1
      1 atm, 12 atm, 13 atm, and 14 atm, 15 atm, 16 atm, 17 atm, 18 atm,
      19 atm, 20 atm, 21 atm, 22 atm, 23 atm, 24 atm, 25, atm, 26, atm,
      27 atm, 28 atm, or 29 atm. [0059] In some embodiments, reactor 200
      can be heated largely if not entirely by solar energy. For
      example, again with reference to FIG. 3B, reactor 200 can be
      configured to receive solar radiation from a solar concentrator
      206. Solar concentrator 206 comprises a reflective surface
      configured to direct solar radiation to reactor 200 and can be
      used to heat reactor 200 to a reaction temperature of 100°C, 1
      10°C, 120°C, 130°C, 140°C, 150°C, 160°C, 165°C, 170°C, 175°C,
      180°C, 185°C, 190°C, 195°C, 200°C, 205°C, 210°C, 215°C, 220°C,
      225°C, 230°C, 240°C, 250°C, 260°C, 270°C, 280°C, 290°C, 300°C, or
      any range thereof or value therebetween. In the same or different
      embodiments, reactor 200 can be heated by a heater 270 to the
      desired reaction temperature. In some embodiments, reactor 200 may
      comprise radially extending conductive fins to distribute heat in
      reactor 200. Reactor 200 may also comprise a thermocouple 222 to
      monitor the temperature. Heater 270 can be used to regulate the
      reaction temperature as needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some embodiments, heat from reactor 200 can be used to
      change water in liquid form to vapor form in a vaporization unit,
      further described below. As such, a heat exchanger (not shown)
      containing a heat transfer fluid can be disposed within reactor
      200 to absorb some of the thermal energy provided by the sun or
      from the ongoing redox reactions and a conduit can transport the
      heated transfer fluid to the vaporization unit also comprising a
      heat exchanger to transfer the heat from the fluid to the water in
      the vaporization unit to convert the water feedstock to vapor.
      Moreover, heat transfer fluid can be used to facilitate regulation
      of the reaction temperature within reaction chamber 214. [0061]
      With reference to FIG. 4A, another aspect of the present invention
      comprises a system in which the above described reactor 200 is
      incorporated to generate hydrocarbons and separate the generated
      hydrocarbons from the gas outflow. A system can also comprise the
      described reactor 200 comprising an array of reaction vessels 210,
      as shown in FIG. 4B.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In order to convert a gaseous mixture of Ci feedstock and
      water to hydrocarbons, gaseous feedstock of Ci feedstock and water
      flows into the reaction chamber of reactor 200 containing the
      described catalyst. In some embodiments, the molar flow ratio of
      the water to Ci feedstock is between 0.1 to 10.0, and such as
      between 0.1 and 3.0 or 0.1 and 4.0. In some embodiments, within
      the reaction chamber, the partial pressure ratio of water to CI
      feedstock (Pw/c) can be maintained approximately at a value
      between 0.1 to 3, such as 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9,
      1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2,2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, or any
      value or range therebetween. The reaction chamber can be heated to
      or maintained at a desired reaction temperature and configured
      such that the described catalyst is exposed to solar radiation
      while the gaseous feedstock mixture is flowing there-through,
      thereby causing reactions that generate hydrocarbons from the Ci
      feedstock and water.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] When providing a flow of reactants into reactor 200, Ci
      feedstock and the water in vapor form can flow into the reaction
      chamber as a mixture or as discrete inflows. System 300 can
      comprise a supply conduit 301 for providing Ci feedstock. Ci
      supply conduit 301 can merge with the water vapor supply conduit
      302 to mix the two components at the desired ratios. In some
      embodiments, system 300 can comprise a gas proportioner or mixer
      303 to facilitate mixing the gaseous components at the desired
      ratio. In some embodiments, the flow rate of each can be adjusted
      to control the relative ratio of the two components.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In order to provide water in vapor form, system 300 can
      also comprise a vaporization unit 304 configured to convert liquid
      water to steam. The steam generated flows from vaporization unit
      304 into water vapor supply conduit 302. In some embodiments,
      vaporization unit 304 can comprise a heat exchanger through which
      a heat transfer fluid can flow. In some embodiments, the heat
      transfer fluid can flow from reactor 200 through the heat
      exchanger via conduit loop 307 to heat a surrounding bath of
      water. In the same or different embodiments, vaporization unit 304
      can comprise, a mister, a humidifier, such as a evaporative
      humidifier, a natural humidifier, an impeller humidifier, a
      ultrasonic humidifier or a forced air humidifier, a vaporizer, or
      any other suitable device. In some embodiments, vaporization unit
      304 also operates as a mixer or proportioner 303 such that Ci
      feedstock can flow into vaporization unit 304 and mix with water
      vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In order to extract the generated hydrocarbons, system 300
      can further comprise separation device 305 for extracting a
      substantial portion of the hydrocarbons from the gaseous outflow.
      For example, separation device 305 can comprise at least one of a
      condensation column, membrane, centrifuge, an adsorbent material,
      or some combination thereof. While not shown in the figure, it is
      understood that in certain embodiments, once the hydrocarbons are
      extracted, the gaseous outflow may be recycled back to reactor
      200. [0066] In order to reduce or substantially remove unwanted
      products from the outflow, system 300 can further comprise another
      separation device (not shown). For example, dioxygen can be
      separated by passing the outflow through the separation device,
      such as at least one of a condensation column, an adsorbent
      material, membrane, or centrifuge. This separation device can
      intercept the outflow before or after it passes through to
      separation device 305. Once removed, in certain embodiments, the
      outflow can be recycled from the separation device into the
      reaction chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] To facilitate heating reaction chamber and to enhance the
      efficiency of the described catalyst, system 300 can comprise a
      solar concentrator 206 comprising a reflective surface(s) that
      directs sunlight to one or more reaction vessels 210. As shown in
      FIG. 4B, a system can also comprise a plurality of solar
      concentrators 206 and a plurality of reaction vessels 210.
      Reaction vessels 210 can be in fluid communication with each other
      or isolated therefrom. Reaction vessels can be configured so that
      the outflow from each flows into a single separation device 305.
      [0068] In some embodiments, heating the reaction chamber can be
      caused by directing solar radiation from solar concentrator 306 to
      the reaction chamber. Alternatively or in addition thereto, a
      heater can be used to heat the reaction chamber. In addition, a
      heat exchanger can be located in reaction chamber facilitating the
      transfer of heat from chamber to a heat transfer fluid or vice
      versa. D. EXAMPLES<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The present invention will be described in greater detail
      by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered
      for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the
      invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily
      recognize a variety of noncritical parameters that can be changed
      or modified to yield essentially the same results.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>PREPARATION OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE/COBALT CATALYST</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0070] Titanium dioxide-cobalt catalyst were prepared by incipient
      wetness impregnation of Ti02 (rutile) with sufficient aqueous
      solution of C0NO3 (Alfa Aesar) to give a loading of 5 % by mass
      cobalt when dried, calcined, and reduced. The impregnated Ti02 was
      dried at room temperature for overnight and calcinations under air
      at 225°C for 3 h and then sieved using No 100 (opening 0.15 mm).
      The dried catalyst was reduced at 400°C in a flow of H2 for 8 h.
      XPS spectroscopy indicated that only 1% of the cobalt present was
      in the metallic state, the remainder was present as C02O3.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>PREPARATION OF THE CATALYST ON A SUBSTRATE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0071] The catalysis supports were Pyrex glass pellets having a 2
      mm diameter.<br>
      <br>
      Before Co-Ti02 catalyst was immobilized on the Pyrex glass
      pellets, these glass pellets were etched in 5M NaOH solution for
      24 h at 70°C. After they had been rinsed with DI water, the glass
      pellets were soaked in an aqueous suspension, which was prepared
      with 3 g of catalyst as prepared in Example 1 and dispersed in 3.0
      mL of DI water with the aid of an ultrasonic bath to which 3.0 mL
      of 5% w/w Nafion PTFE was added. After removing from the
      Catalyst-PTFE solution, the glass pellets were heated at 70°C in a
      vacuum oven. The resulting pellets were opaque with a dull gray
      powder thinly coated on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>PREPARATION OF PACKED-BED THERMOPHOTOCATALYTIC REACTOR</b><br>
      <br>
      [0072] A quartz tube having a length of 10 in. and a diameter of
      1.4375 in. and a wall thickness of 1/8 in. and two plastic caps
      that fit on each end of the tube comprised the catalytic chamber.
      A stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 0.25 in. and a
      length of 10 in. was placed along the center of the center of the
      quartz tube, and a cartridge heater was placed inside the
      stainless steel tube. The quartz tube was filled with the
      catalytic pellets as prepared in Example 2. Three holes were
      drilled on one of the caps and one hole was drilled in the other.
      Graphite tape, metal camps, and high temperature PTFE O-rings were
      placed between the caps and the tube to provide the necessary
      seal. A thermocouple was inserted into one hole, the cartridge
      heater was inserted through a central hole, and a fitting for the
      inflow gas line was placed in the third. A fitting for the outflow
      gas line was placed in the hole of the other cap. The C02 gas was
      regulated by a digital flow meter and directed into a water
      saturation unit that humidified the gas. The cartridge heater was
      controlled by a discrete feedback controller to maintain the
      desired reaction temperature as measured by the thermocouple. The
      quartz tube was surrounded by four Hg UV producing lamps with a
      total power of 850W. A schematic is shown in FIG. 4. EXAMPLE 4<br>

      <b>CONVERSION OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER INTO HYDROCARBONS USING
        THE CATALYST</b><br>
      <br>
      [0073] The system as described in Example 3 was used to study
      catalyst performance and carbon products produced under various
      process conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In a first study, the reaction was run under 1 atmosphere
      pressure for 8 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon dioxide flowed into the saturator having 20 mL of water to
      mix the carbon dioxide with water vapor. The temperature of the
      saturator was set to produce the desired flow rate of water vapor.
      The input of carbon dioxide was set at the desired flow rate of 50
      mL/min at 0 psig. The water flow rate was 0.03 mL/min. This
      corresponds to a CC^fLO molar ratio of 1 :3. Many runs were
      conducted at six different reactor temperatures: 110°C, 130°C,
      150°C, 180°C, 200°C , and 220°C. Two phase of Ti02 were tried,
      rutile and anatase.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Liquid aliquots were collected and tested on a Shimadzu
      GC-MS-2010SE chromatograph coupled with a MS QP2010 detector and a
      AOC-4 20S sampler. The column was a Shimadzu SHRX105MS (30-m
      length and 0.25-mm inner diameter, part # 220-94764- 02) set at
      45°C for 5 minutes then increased to 150°C at a rate of 10°C/min.
      The MS detector was set at 250°C, and helium was used as the
      carrier gas. A l μΐ^ sample of the liquid aliquot was injected
      into the GC-MS. The results are provided in Table 1 below.<br>

      <br>
      [0077] A second study was also conducted in a similar manner with
      the set up as described in Example 3. A titanium dioxide-cobalt
      catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation as described in Example
      1 , except that the anatase form of Ti02 was used for this study.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] For the runs conducted, carbon dioxide flowed into the
      saturator having 20 mL of water to mix the carbon dioxide with
      water vapor. The temperature of the saturator was set to produce
      the desired flow rate of water vapor. The input of carbon dioxide
      was set at the desired flow rate of 50 mL/min at 0 psig. The water
      flow rate was 0.03 mL/min. This corresponds to a C02:H20 molar
      ratio of 1 :3. The reaction temperature, the reaction pressure,
      and the partial pressure ratios of the reactants, water and C02
      were varied for purposes of this study.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] For most runs, to determine the amount and type of products
      in the gaseous effluent, the effluent was passed through an
      online-reactor gas analyzer by Custom Solutions Group (CSG),
      Houston, TX. The gas analyzed is built on a Shimadzu Model GC-2014
      and equipped with a split/splitless injection port, a three
      channel automated pressure control and auto flow control, and TCD
      and FID detectors. The instrument was precalibrated by CSG for
      analysis of light to medium hydrocarbons and their oxygenates, CO,
      C02, 02, H2, and N2.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The permutations of pressure, temperature, and partial
      pressure ratio that were studied are summarized in Tables 2 and 3
      alongside the results of those runs. Each run was conducted for 8
      hours. Results for the runs conducted at 200 C are provided in
      Tables 3 and 4.<br>

      [0082] As gleaned from the results in Table 2, methanol was
      observed at the lower temperatures (i.e., 110 to 150 C), but
      higher Cn products (&gt;C1) began to appear at temperatures of 180
      C or higher, predominantly as iso-propanol (Run 4), and increased
      upon going to 200 C (Run 5) and 220 C (Run 6) with an apparent
      yield maximum at 200 C. Lowering the Pw/C from 1.2 to 0.6 resulted
      in an increase in the number of products obtained to include
      ethanol, acetic acid, isopropanol, and acetone (Run 7). The most
      striking result was obtained with the application of 2.7 atm of
      pressure at 200 C (Pw/C =0.6) as seen in Run 11. Now in addition
      to the CI -3 products, hydrocarbons with Cn of 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10
      were also obtained, with the last three (C8-10) being pure
      hydrocarbons. Control reactions have established that light, Ti02,
      Co, C02, and elevated temperature (180-200 C) are all required.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In specific runs, isotopically labelled reactants, 30%
      enriched &lt;13&gt;C02 (Run 8) or 99 % enriched D20 (Run 9) or
      were used to establish that H20 and C02 where the sources for
      hydrogen and carbon in the products, respectively. In both cases,
      the organic products showed the expected incorporation of the
      label as determined by GC-MS (see supporting information). The
      13-carbon label appearing in the relative amount expected
      statistically for a 30% enriched feedstock. Deuterium
      incorporation was lower than expected for a 99 % enriched
      feedstock but still the dominant isotope of hydrogen found in the
      product (i.e. the formation of products such as<br>

      The non-statistical level of H over D incorporation is likely due
      to kinetic isotope effects, and the presence of surface bound H20
      in the reactor and catalyst despite an initial purge with C02.<br>

      [0086] In this second study, product carbon number (Cn)
      distribution and incident photon quantum yields (IPQYs) show a
      strong dependence on the reaction pressure, temperature,
      irradiation levels, and the PH2o / Pco2 ratio (Pw/C), suggesting
      that the photochemical steps are not rate determining here. For
      example, at 200 C, an increase in pressure from 1 atm to 6.1 atm
      increased the average productivity increased from 80 to 200 μg/gh
      (units: μg fuel/gcataiysth), respectively, an overall increase of
      250 % and shifts the product distribution to higher molecular
      weight products. The products and mass yields obtained in this
      latter run (200C, 6.1 atm, Pw/c 0.6) are H2 (6.5%), CO (25.5%),
      CH4 (0.7 %), CH3OH (0.1%), C2H4 (1.3%), C2H6 (1.2%), H3C202H
      (34.2%), C3H8 (0.9%), C3H7OH (0.2%), C4H8 (3.7%), C4HioO (21.9%),
      C8Hi0 (0.4%), and C9Hi2 (3.3, of which 64% are liquid products.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] 02 was also isolated in a 2 to 5-fold stoichiometric excess
      compared to the reduced product obtained at 1 atm. At higher
      pressures, the 02 yield was either near stoichiometric (~75 % for
      the runs at 2.6 atm) or only present in modest excess (107-138%
      for the runs at 6.1 atm). As the products should be present
      stoichiometrically, these data suggest we have not accounted for
      all the reduction products in certain runs. For runs at 1 atm,
      these are likely to be high boiling point oxygenates adsorbed onto
      the catalyst or surface of the reactor, especially near the exit
      zone at which the temperature drops considerably. At 6.1 atm, the
      missing product could be either oxygenates like above or heavy
      hydrocarbons which condense in the exit zone or transport tubes.
      Lastly, dioxygen plus both components of syngas, CO and H2, are
      observed as co-products in the studied reactor, so it seems
      reasonable that a water splitting reaction and a reverse water gas
      shift reaction are functional, but it may be that most of the H2
      and CO are not released from the cobalt surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The presence of an excess or near stoichiometric amount of
      02 suggests that the back reaction, 02 oxidation of H2 or
      hydrocarbon products, is somewhat inhibited, most likely due to
      the low 02 concentration, estimated to be between 4% and 0.4% v/v
      in any given run. One explanation for the large excess of 02 seen
      at 1 atm, but not at 2.6 or 6.1 atm, is that the space velocity is
      faster at lower pressures, meaning the 02 is swept from the
      reaction chamber more quickly and has less time to participate in
      the back reaction. As such, mass flow rates and space velocity can
      be adjusted to remove 02 more quickly from the reactor so it can
      be separated from the flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] As mentioned, CO and H2 are both observed as products, yet
      both are reactants for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Also
      mentioned, the data suggests that not all of the CO or H2
      equivalents (i.e. surface cobalt hydrides) are released in the gas
      phase but instead are generated on the surface of the cobalt
      islands and consumed immediately in subsequent chain-forming
      reactions. The reasoning here is similar to the poor 02 back
      reaction rates, even with 100 % release into the gas phase, the
      resulting low partial pressures of CO and H2 would make it very
      unlikely that a chain-forming reaction mechanism could be
      sustained. In some embodiments, these flow with these products and
      can be recycled into the reactor chamber to further favor C02
      reduction and Fischer-Tropsch type reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The presence of alyklbenzene products reveals that one of
      the chain-forming reactions is likely proceeding via the formation
      of alkyl alkynes and subsequent alkyne trimerization. While higher
      hydrogen yields may be anticipated with more water, the better
      selectivity towards higher Cn products at Pw/C of 0.6 is, in part,
      a reflection of an unusual synthetic pathway that appears to be
      operational at this lower water partial pressure. All of the
      products with Cn&gt;6 are all identified as variously substituted
      alkylbenzenes or oxygenates thereof, which is atypical of
      traditional FTS product distributions.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Currently, the highest IPQY obtained is 0.19% on a per
      electron stored basis<br>
      <br>
      (or 0.105% on a H2 equivalent basis), but this is a reflection of
      the early stage of this work rather than any practical limitation.
      There is a significant (2 to 3 -fold) jump in ICPY upon increasing
      the pressure from 1 atm to 2.6 atm, but little further change upon
      increasing the pressure to 6.1 atm. In theory, quantum yields of
      30-50%) at 200 C are possible and if the Ti02 could be replaced by
      a semiconductor absorber that covered more of the visible spectrum
      (i.e. &lt;700 nm), then overall solar to fuel (STF) conversion
      efficiencies of 5-15% are reasonable goals. However, the process
      in the study is not optimized and these initial studies indicate
      that higher yields and/or higher order hydrocarbons are accessible
      at higher pressures, higher temperatures, and other Pw/c ratios.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0017] The disclosure provides processes for the conversion of
      lignites, subbituminous coals and other carbonaceous feedstocks
      into synthetic oils, including oils with properties similar to
      light weight sweet crude oil. The disclosure further provides
      methods for the preparation of solvents that may be used in
      processes for the conversion of lignites, subbituminous coals and
      other carbonaceous feedstocks into synthetic oils. In certain
      embodiments, such processes may be carried out under mild
      operating conditions with a low cost stoichiometric co-reagent
      and/or a disposable catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Definitions</b><br>
      <br>
      [0018] The term “carbonaceous feedstock” refers to compositions
      comprising lignite, subbituminous coal, low-ranked coal, and/or
      heavy petroleum. In certain embodiments, the carbonaceous
      feedstocks comprise 10% to 100% volatile carbon material, such as
      low rank coals. The term “volatile material” as set forth herein,
      refers to compounds, other than water, that are released from the
      feedstock when it's heated in an inert gas, like nitrogen. In
      certain embodiments, the volatile material comprises a mixture of
      short and long chain hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The term “lignite” refers to a yellow to dark brown or, in
      some embodiments, a black coal that is an intermediate between
      peat and subbituminous coal according to the coal classification
      used in the United States and Canada. In certain embodiments,
      lignite comprises between 15% to 70% of moisture, an equal mix of
      volatile and fixed carbon, and some inorganic compounds, such as
      metal oxides and sulfur. Furthermore, certain forms of lignite
      have high levels of oxygen in its polymeric structure, up to 20%
      of its dry weight. As coals get higher in rank, the fixed carbon
      increases, volatiles decrease, and oxygen decreases.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The term “substantially” and its variations (e.g.,
      “approximately” and “about”) are defined as being largely but not
      necessarily wholly what is specified (and include wholly what is
      specified) as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In
      any disclosed embodiment, the terms “substantially,”
      “approximately,” and “about” may be substituted with “within [a
      percentage] of what is specified, where the percentage includes
      0.1, 1, 5, and 10 percent.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The terms “a” and “an” are defined as one or more unless
      this disclosure explicitly requires otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The terms “comprise” (and any form of comprise, such as
      “comprises” and “comprising”), “have” (and any form of have, such

      <b>Liquefaction Methods for Carbonaceous Feedstock</b><br>
      <br>
      [0025] Some embodiments of the present methods for the preparation
      of synthetic oil (synoil) comprise mixing carbonaceous feedstock
      with oils to generate slurries; contacting the slurries with
      iron-containing conversion agents to generate a slurry-agent
      mixtures; reacting the slurry-agent mixtures at a hydrogen
      pressure of from 700 psi to 1,200 psi and a temperature of from
      280° C. to 450° C. to generate reaction-product mixtures, whereby
      some or all of the carbonaceous feedstocks are converted into
      synthetic oils (synoils); and separating solids from the
      reaction-product mixtures. In some embodiments, the oil comprises
      light to intermediate crude oils and/or hydrogenated pyrolysis
      oils.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Some embodiments of the methods provided herein may be
      used, for example, for the conversion of lignites, subbituminous
      coals and other carbonaceous feedstocks into synoils, including
      oils with properties similar to medium to light weight sweet crude
      oil. Such methods may be conducted, for example, under mild
      operating conditions with stoichiometric co-reagents and/or
      disposable catalysts. In some embodiments, the methods disclosed
      herein may serve as low cost processes for producing a synthetic
      crude oil feedstock from, for example, lignite or subbituminous
      coal supplies. Synoil may serve as an acceptable substitute or
      alternative to petroleum based crude oils as a feedstock for oil
      refineries.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In some embodiments, synoil produced from the processes
      disclosed herein is lower in cost than such crude-oil
      alternatives. Moreover, in some embodiments, it is low in sulfur.
      In some embodiments, the method may produce less greenhouse gases
      than crude oil alternatives. In some embodiments, it is equivalent
      to, or of higher quality than petroleum crudes. Synoil produced
      using the methods provided herein may also serve as substitute for
      crude oil for the plastics industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In some embodiments, the processes disclosed herein may
      emit less greenhouse gases and/or other pollutants than
      conventional crude extraction and refining, the Fischer-Tropsch
      process, and/or direct combustion of the coal.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 1 depicts a simplified process-flow diagram
      illustrating general, exemplary embodiments of the apparatuses and
      methods of the present disclosure. This diagram is offered for
      illustrative purposes only, and thus it merely depicts specific
      embodiments and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims
      in any way. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
      lignite/subbituminous coal and/or other carbonaceous feedstock is
      mixed in a first step (step 1 in FIG. 1) with a solvent (slurry
      oil) to produce a slurry. In certain embodiments, the solvent or
      slurry oil is light crude oil, pyrolysis oil, hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil, intermediate crude oil, used motor oil, diesel,
      xylenes, tetralin, aliphatic hydrocarbons or aromatic hydrocarbons
      or mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In certain embodiments, the feedstock is dried to less than
      20% moisture prior to mixing with a solvent. The slurry is heated
      under hydrogen pressure in a suitable reactor at a temperature
      above 200° C. while being mixed. In some embodiments, the reactor
      may be a continuously stirred, or backflow mixed, batch, or
      continuous plug flow type. An iron containing conversion agent or
      catalyst may be introduced, for example, as fine particles into
      the slurry or as a fixed bed in the reactor. During this step, a
      significant portion of the coal is transformed into liquid and/or
      gas. The gases can be used as fuel gas to provide heat for the
      overall process. In other embodiments, the mixture of the
      carbonaceous feedstock and solvent is allowed to sit for a period
      of time prior to the introduction of the conversion agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The heated slurry is delivered to a separator in a second
      step, in some embodiments, where the solids are removed from the
      liquid carrier phase. This could be accomplished, for example,
      with a large scale centrifuge. Keeping the slurry temperature
      above 200° C. reduces the viscosity of the oil. The solid material
      removed in this step is expected to be mostly inorganic (minerals,
      metal oxides, etc.) with some small amount of fixed carbon. The
      liquid volume exiting this step is expected to be larger than the
      liquid volume entering the first step. The net difference
      represents the synthetic crude product or synoil, which can be
      processed by oil refineries.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In certain embodiments, a portion of the synoil is recycled
      for use in the preparation of the slurry of the carbonaceous
      feedstock. When the synoil is generated, a portion of it is mixed
      with the slurry oil or solvent that is added to the carbonaceous
      feedstock to form a slurry. This “recycling” of the generated
      synoil is illustrated in FIG. 1 where a portion of the synoil
      designated as “solvent” is added to the reactor containing the
      slurry prepared from carbonaceous feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In other embodiments, the portion of the synoil that is
      recycled is hydrogenated prior to recycling. This step is
      illustrated in FIG. 2 where a portion of the synoil designated as
      “solvent” is hydrogenated prior to being added to the reactor
      containing the slurry prepared from carbonaceous feedstock. The
      hydrogenation step is carried out in accordance with known
      methods. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,723, U.S. Pat. No.
      4,379,744, U.S. Pat. No. 4,251,346, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,527, U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,783,065, all of which are incorporated herein by
      reference. In certain embodiments, the hydrogenation of the
      recycled liquid volume is carried out at a temperature of 300-400°
      C. In other embodiments, the hydrogenation step is carried out for
      a period of 10 minutes to an hour at a pressure of 100 to 1000
      psi. Following the hydrogenation step, the recycled liquid synoil
      is added to the reactor as a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 3 depicts one embodiment of the present processes for
      the preparation of a solvent that is useful for mixing the
      carbonaceous feedstock during the preparation of the slurry
      discussed previously. In a first step of this process, a
      carbonaceous feedstock is pyrolyzed in a reactor under vacuum
      conditions (1 atmosphere absolute pressure or less). The pyrolysis
      reaction is either a fast pyrolysis reaction or a slow pyrolysis
      reaction. The pyrolysis reaction generates water, char (carbon
      rich solid fuel), gas and pyrolysis oil as product. The pyrolysis
      oil generated in this process has a specific gravity between 0.9
      and 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In a second step of the process set forth in FIG. 3, the
      pyrolysis oil generated in the first step is heated under hydrogen
      pressure in a suitable reactor at a temperature above 200° C. for
      a period of up to 2 hours. In certain embodiments, the pyrolysis
      oil is heated in the presence of an iron-containing catalyst at a
      temperature of 300-400° C. An oil product that results from the
      second step may be used as a solvent (oil product solvent) for the
      carbonaceous feedstock in a process for the liquefaction of the
      feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In certain embodiments, the steps of the process for the
      preparation of synoil are repeated (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2). In some of
      these embodiments, some or all of the slurry oil used in a
      repeated mixing step comprises synoil from a previous reacting
      step.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In certain embodiments, prior to use, the oil product
      solvent is mixed and diluted with pyrolysis or hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oils derived from the same carbonaceous feedstock from
      which the oil product solvent is derived. In other embodiments,
      the oil product solvent is mixed and diluted with pyrolysis or
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oils derived from a carbonaceous feedstock
      that is different from the feedstock that produced the oil product
      solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an embodiment, a portion of the synoil obtained from the
      liquefaction process is removed and reused in the preparation of a
      slurry of the carbonaceous feedstock. When the synoil is reused,
      additional solvent may be optionally added to the synoil. In
      certain embodiments of the invention, the quantity of the synoil
      that is reused in the liquefaction process ranges from 15% to 85%
      by volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In certain embodiments, the synoil obtained in the
      liquefaction process is subjected to a separation method. In an
      embodiment, the synoil is subjected to fractional distillation and
      the components of the synoil are separated out. One or more of the
      separated synoil components may be mixed together to provide
      solvents for use in the preparation of slurries of carbonaceous
      feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIGS. 4-6 depict chromatograms for pyrolysis oil,
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oil, and synthetic crude oil respectively,
      produced by some embodiments of the processes disclosed herein.
      The pyrolysis oils contain a significant amount of oxygenated
      species that are removed in the hydrogenation process. All three
      oils have a strong aliphatic hydrocarbon distribution, although
      the synthetic crude has the highest concentration. The
      distribution of boiling fractions is comparable to petroleum crude
      oil. Further details are provided in the Working Examples below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Carbonaceous Feedstocks</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] A wide variety of carbonaceous materials may be used as
      feedstocks for the methods disclosed herein, including, but not
      limited to, lignite, sub-bituminous coal, low-ranked coal, and
      heavy petroleum. In the case of lignites, the ash content may
      vary. For example, in some embodiments, it may be less than 37%,
      preferably, less than 15% on a dry basis. In some embodiments, it
      is advantageous to remove moisture from the carbonaceous feedstock
      prior to the mixing step. In some embodiments, the ratio of
      carbonaceous feedstock to the slurry oils (discussed in greater
      detail below) is about 1:1 to 1:3 by weight. In some of these
      embodiments, the iron-containing conversion agent (also discussed
      in greater detail below) is mixed with a loading factor of from
      10% to 30% by weight with the carbonaceous feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In some embodiments, in the case of lignites, source and
      composition have an effect on product yield, as discussed further
      in Example 7. In some embodiments, the lignite would be fresh and
      have high volatile carbon content and low ash content. In some
      embodiments, such lignite may need to be cleaned to remove clay
      and ash, which may be done by methods such as froth flotations,
      float/sink separation, reverse froth flotation, centrifugation,
      acid or caustic washes, with or without surfactants, and dry
      fluidized bed separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In certain embodiments, the carbonaceous feedstock material
      used in the processes is crushed to a particle size of 10-mesh or
      less, which are particles that can pass through a 10-mesh sieve.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydrogenated Pyrolysis Oil and Other Slurry Oils</b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] The carbonaceous feedstock may be mixed with a variety of
      solvents or slurry oils, including for example, light crude oil,
      pyrolysis oil, hydrogenated pyrolysis oil, intermediate crude oil,
      used motor oil, diesel, xylenes, tetralin, aliphatic hydrocarbons
      or aromatic hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof. In some of the
      embodiments disclosed herein, hydrogenated pyrolysis oil is an oil
      that is derived from the pyrolysis of a carbonaceous feedstock
      followed by a hydrogenation step. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical
      decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the
      absence of oxygen, typically occurring under low pressure and at
      operating temperatures above 430° C. (800° F.). The oil derived
      from a carbonaceous feedstock that is subjected to pyrolysis is
      referred to as “pyrolysis oil.”<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In certain embodiments, the pyrolysis oil is derived from
      lignite. In other embodiments, the pyrolysis oil derived from
      lignite is subjected to a hydrogenation step to form a
      hydrogenated lignite pyrolysis oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The initial pyrolysis oil, e.g., the pyrolysis oil used for
      the first one or more process cycles, may be made by rapidly
      heating lignite or other carbonaceous material in the absence of
      oxygen. In this embodiment, 80 mL of oil can be produced from 1.0
      kg of lignite. Such an oil may be further hydrogenated using
      conventional techniques to produce an effective
      lignite/subbituminous solvent, which is also referred to as
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oil herein. In some embodiments,
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oils are obtained from processes comprising
      heating the carbonaceous feedstock in the absence of oxygen to
      produce a pyrolyzed lignite oil, and hydrogenating some or all of
      the pyrolyzed lignite oil with hydrogen in the presence a
      conversion agent to produce the hydrogenated pyrolysis oil.
      Suitable reducing conditions include heating at temperatures from
      250° C. to 350° C., H2 pressures from 400 psi to 700 psi and
      reaction times from 30 to 360 minutes. Catalysts that may be used
      for the hydrogenation/reduction include, for example, the
      iron-containing conversion agents described below. In some
      embodiments, the catalyst comprises 5-40% by mass metallic iron on
      alumina support.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Suitable hydrogenated pyrolysis oils that may be used with
      the methods disclosed may be characterized by some or all of the
      following properties, including a boiling range between 80 to 600°
      C. as determined using the ASTM 2887 protocol, which is
      incorporated herein by reference, and/or an elemental composition
      comprising 80 to 85% carbon by mass and 8 to 12% hydrogen by mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In subsequent cycles of the method, the hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oils may comprise synoil resulting from the methods
      provided herein. For example, some or all of the slurry oil used
      in a repeated mixing step may comprise synoil from a previous
      reacting step.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Iron-Containing Conversion Agent</b><br>
      <br>
      [0049] A broad range of iron containing conversion agents are
      compatible with the liquefaction methods disclosed herein,
      including, for example, substances derived from bauxite, red mud,
      iron oxide(s), and/or various iron-containing salts deposited on
      alumina. Suitable iron containing conversion agents will have iron
      contents from 5% to 40% by weight in some embodiments and/or have
      an average particle size of 60 to 300 mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In the case of bauxite, the substance may be prepared by a
      process comprising crushing bauxite ore. Bauxite is a general term
      for a rock composed of hydrated aluminum oxides and is usually
      found containing up to 30% iron oxides. Typically, bauxite is
      mostly comprised of the minerals gibbsite Al(OH)3, boehmite
      γ-AlO(OH), and diaspore α-AlO(OH), in a mixture with two iron
      oxides, goethite and hematite, the clay mineral kaolinite, and
      small amounts of anatase TiO2. Typical mesh sizes for the crushed
      bauxite particles will range from 60 to 300 mesh. Once they are
      crushed, the bauxite particles may be calcined in some
      embodiments, for example, at 300 to 600° C. in the presence of
      oxygen to produce calcined bauxite particles. Reduction of crushed
      bauxite or calcined bauxite particles with H2 produces
      iron-containing conversion agents. In some embodiments, the
      reducing further comprises heating the bauxite particles to about
      250° C. to 400° C. and an H2 pressure is from 0.5 psi to 1,000
      psi. Under such conditions, calcined bauxite particles will
      typically be reduced in about 30 to 180 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Iron-containing conversion agents may also be prepared by
      wetting Al2O3 particles with aqueous solutions of iron salts to
      generate iron-alumina compositions. Examples of suitable iron
      salts include: iron(III) nitrate, iron (III) chloride, iron (III)
      citrate, iron (II) chloride, iron (II) sulfate, iron (II) ammonium
      sulfate, and combinations and/or hydrates thereof. Calcining the
      iron-alumina composition at, for example, at from 300° C. to 600°
      C. in the presence of oxygen may then be used to produce a
      calcined iron-alumina composition, which can then be reduced with
      H2 to produce the desired iron-containing conversion agents.
      Suitable reducing conditions include temperatures from 250° C. to
      400° C., H2 pressure from 0.5 psi to 1000 psi and reaction times
      from 30 to 180 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Substances derived from red mud may also serve as suitable
      iron containing conversion agents. Red mud is composed of a
      mixture of solid and metallic oxide-bearing impurities, and is
      typically a disposal problem for the aluminum industry. The red
      color is attributed to oxidized iron (rust), which can account for
      up to 60% of the mass of the red mud. In addition to iron oxide,
      e.g., Fe2O3, red mud typically comprises silica (SiO2), residual
      aluminum, alumina (Al2O3) and titanium oxide. In some embodiments,
      the iron oxide content of the red mud is 30% to 60% by mass. In
      some embodiments, the Al2O3 content of the red mud is 10% to 20%
      by mass. In some embodiments, the SiO2 content of the red mud is
      3% to 50% by mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Further preparation steps include, for example, calcining
      the red mud particles at 300 to 600° C. in the presence of oxygen
      to produce calcined red mud particles, and then reducing the
      calcined red mud particles with H2 to produce the iron-containing
      conversion agent. Suitable reducing conditions include
      temperatures from 250° C. to 400° C., H2 pressure from 0.5 psi to
      1,000 psi and reaction times from 30 to 180 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Other suitable types of iron-containing conversion agents
      may also be derived from the solids separated from the
      reaction-product mixture. In some embodiments, the iron-containing
      conversion agents comprise metallic iron finely dispersed on a
      substrate of aluminum oxide having an average particle size of
      60-300 mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some embodiments, the iron-containing conversion agent
      is made by crushing bauxite ore having an iron content between 5
      and 40% by mass, to particles with a mesh size of 60-300 mesh.
      These crushed particles are then washed with water, dried in air,
      calcined at 300° C. for approximately 30 min Afterwards the iron
      content in the particles is reduced to metallic iron at 300° C. by
      addition of H2 gas (0.5 psi to 1000 psi).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In some embodiments, the iron-containing conversion agent
      is disposable. In other embodiments, it may be isolated from the
      solid by-products and regenerated by back addition of iron salts,
      calcining, and hydrotreatment. In this aspect, it may be used in a
      catalytic fashion. In still further embodiments, the solid by
      products may be isolated and sold as a bauxite-type ore.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Iron-containing conversion agent comprising both aluminum
      oxide and metallic iron may be used in some embodiments to improve
      liquefaction yields. For example, a liquefaction run using 3 g
      iron-containing conversion agent and 25 g lignite coal gave synoil
      yields of up to 50% of the theoretical value that may be expected
      from the carbon content of the lignite feedstock (MAF yield). This
      is compared to a yield of up to 20% MAF yield when the same
      process is repeated in the absence of this iron-containing agent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydroconversion Reactions</b><br>
      <br>
      [0058] In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein combine
      the hydrogenation and liquefaction of the carbonaceous material in
      a single step. By combining these two steps, it is possible to
      avoid the need for a separate hydrogenation step to recharge the
      solvent, which in turn reduces equipment and operating costs.
      Also, the H2 pressures utilized in some of the embodiments are
      significantly less than the pressures used in current commercial
      coal-to-liquids processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] An example of a suitable process for the liquefaction of a
      carbonaceous feedstock can be summarized as comprising the
      following: (a) mixing and dispersion of the feedstock in a slurry
      oil in a 1:2 mass ratio, (b) addition of an iron-containing
      conversion agent with a loading factor of 10-30% by mass with
      respect to the feedstock mass, (c) placing the resulting slurry
      under a hydrogen atmosphere in a pressure vessel and rapidly
      heating to 280-450° C. and adjusting the partial pressure of
      hydrogen to 700 to 1,200 psi hydrogen at maximum temperature, (d)
      agitating mechanically with a residence time of 10-30 min at
      maximum temperature, and (e) separating the solids and water from
      the resulting liquid, which will be present in greater amounts
      than that of the initial slurry oil by 110% to 140% by weight. The
      liquid (synoil) will be comparable to a medium sweet crude oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Suitable reactors for the hydroconversion reactions include
      continuous flow or batch hydrogenation reactor technology. Scaling
      up the processes disclosed herein should enable the production of,
      for example, 1,000 to 20,000 barrels of synoil per day. In some
      embodiments, the hydroconversion reactions may be used to convert
      35 to 75% of the carbon content in the original solid feedstock to
      a liquid product. For coal this corresponds to synoil yields of

      [0061] In some embodiments, only mild pressure and temperature are
      needed (around 320° C. and 1000 psi of H2). In some embodiments, a
      digestion time of 20 to 30 minutes is optimal. In some
      embodiments, lignite quality is important (specifically lignite
      should be fresh and have a low ash and high volatility content).
      In some embodiments, the removal of moisture from the lignite is
      optional. In some embodiments, a catalyst is preferred; for
      example, Fe/alumina may be used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthetic Oil (Synoil)</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] Oils produced though pyrolysis of lignite, without
      isolating specific boiling fractions, are effective solvents for
      the liquefaction of lignite/subbituminous coal. In addition, the
      liquids obtained through pyrolysis can be hydrogenated with mild
      process conditions (&lt;1,000 psi) compared to processes used to
      hydrogenate coal tar distillates derived from bituminous and
      subbituminous coals, which typically require H2 pressures
      &gt;2,500 psi.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The methods disclosed herein provide a process that may be
      used to produce higher proportions of mid-weight hydrocarbons
      (boiling range 200° C. to 500° C.) and lower proportions of the
      less desirable light (gases, naphthas) and high molecular weight
      hydrocarbons (waxes, asphaltenes) than the other reported
      processes. In an embodiment, a profile for a synoil generated by
      the process comprises approximately 2% naphtha, approximately 20%
      kerosene, approximately 30% diesel and approximately 40%
      lubrication oils and asphaltenes.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Compared to crude petroleum, the synoil may have lower
      amounts of trace elements that can make refining more difficult,
      as detailed further in Example 8. The concentrations of these
      trace elements and carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen can be traced
      from the lignite and the hydrogenated pyrolysis oil to the synoil
      and the inertinite (solid waste). The composition of synoil
      produced by an embodiment of the processes enclosed herein
      resembles that of common fuels, such as diesel and Jet-A. Synoil
      having such properties are typically more desirable to a refinery,
      since the refinery can in turn produce more high value diesel and
      jet fuel products from the same amount of starting material.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 7 depicts an exemplary &lt;1&gt;H NMR of a synoil
      produced by one embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Table 2 shows estimated refinery products of the synoil
      made by an embodiment of the methods disclosed herein. This is
      comparable to the yield of crude petroleum alternatives.<br>

      [0067] The environmental cost of making Jet-A (JP-8) fuel using an
      embodiment of the process disclosed herein can be calculated, in
      some embodiments, by comparing air pollutants produced, water
      pollutants produced, and environmentally beneficial waste products
      produced compared to alternatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The synoil yields of the current process range from 40 to
      80% by mass of the available carbon and hydrocarbons in the
      lignite or subbituminous coal feedstock being converted into
      synoil (MAF yield) which is comparable with most of the existing
      CTL processes reported in the literature; however, the process
      conditions disclosed herein are significantly milder and therefore
      more economical. Typical temperature and pressure process
      conditions for the processes disclosed herein range from 280-450°
      C. and 700-1200 psi, whereas typical pressures for other reported
      processes are in excess of 2000 psi and temperatures are usually
      between 380-500° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In some embodiments, it may be desirable or even necessary
      to removing water from the reaction-product mixture in order to
      generate a substantially water-free synoil.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Synoil may be characterized in some embodiments by one or
      more of the following parameters: a specific gravity of 0.84 to
      1.00 g/mL and an API gravity between 37 and 10, a sulfur content
      of less than 1.0% sulfur by mass, and kinematic viscosity of less
      than 15.0 cSt at 38° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Moreover, in some embodiments, the synoil may be
      characterized by its boiling range. For example, the methods
      provided herein may be used to produce synoil wherein 90% of the
      synoil boils below 538° C. as determined using the ASTM 5307
      protocol, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Synoil may also be characterized by its elemental
      composition. For example, the methods of the present disclosure
      may be used to synthesize synoil having an elemental composition
      comprising 82% to 86% carbon by mass and 10% to 14% hydrogen by
      mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Solubility in other solvents may also be used to
      characterize synoil. In some embodiments, the synoil is readily
      soluble in toluene and heptane.<br>
      <br>

      characteristics of the synoil generated from lignites.<br>

      <b>Oil Product Solvent</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] In certain embodiments, a solvent is derived from the
      pyrolysis of a carbonaceous feedstock coupled with the treatment
      of the resulting pyrolysis oil with an iron-containing conversion
      agent. This solvent may be used to prepare a slurry of a
      carbonaceous feedstock. A further embodiment is directed to a
      carbonaceous composition comprising a material formed from the
      pyrolysis of a carbonaceous feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In a first step of the process for preparing an oil product
      solvent, a carbonaceous feedstock is pyrolyzed in a reactor under
      low pressure conditions (1 atmosphere absolute pressure or less).
      The pyrolysis reaction is either a fast pyrolysis reaction or a
      slow pyrolysis reaction. The pyrolysis reaction generates water,
      char (carbon rich solid fuel), gas and pyrolysis oil as product.
      The pyrolysis oil generated in this process has a specific gravity
      between 0.9 and 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In a second step of the process, the pyrolysis oil
      generated in the first step is heated under hydrogen pressure in a
      suitable reactor at a temperature above 200° C. for a period of up
      to 2 hours. In certain embodiments, the pyrolysis is heated in the
      presence of an iron-containing catalyst at a temperature of
      300-400° C. An oil product that results from the second step may
      be used as a solvent for the carbonaceous feedstock in a process
      for the liquefaction of the feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In certain embodiments, prior to use, the oil product
      solvent is mixed and diluted with pyrolysis or hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oils derived from the same carbonaceous feedstock from
      which the oil product solvent is derived. In other embodiments,
      the oil product solvent is mixed and diluted with pyrolysis or
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oils derived from a carbonaceous feedstock
      that is different from the feedstock that produced the oil product
      solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In an embodiment, the oil product solvent derived from a
      particular feedstock has a chemical profile that is similar to the
      synoil derived from the same feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] An embodiment is directed to a solvent comprising between
      40-60% of aromatic compounds. In certain embodiments, the solvent
      comprises between 40-60% of saturated compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Suitable solvents that may be used with the methods
      disclosed may be characterized by some or all of the following
      properties, including a boiling range between 80 to 600° C. as
      determined using the ASTM 2887 protocol, which is incorporated
      herein by reference and/or an elemental composition comprising 80
      to 85% carbon by mass and 8 to 12% hydrogen by mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Any embodiment of any of the present systems and/or methods
      can consist of or consist essentially of—rather than
      comprise/include/contain/have—any of the described steps,
      elements, and/or features. Thus, in any of the claims, the term
      “consisting of’ or “consisting essentially of’ can be substituted
      for any of the open-ended linking verbs recited above, in order to
      change the scope of a given claim from what it would otherwise be
      using the open-ended linking verb.<br>

      [0083] Other objects, features and advantages of the present
      disclosure will become apparent from the following working
      examples. It should be understood, however, that the detailed
      description and the specific examples, while indicating specific
      embodiments, are given by way of illustration only, since various

      [0084] The following examples are included to demonstrate
      preferred embodiments. It should be appreciated by those of skill
      in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that
      follow represent suitable techniques for practicing embodiments of

      still obtain a like or similar result.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hydroconversion of Lignite</b><br>
      <br>
      [0085] Lignite (23% moisture; 9% ash; 28% volatiles; 40% fixed
      carbon) from Jewett, Tex. (25 g) was placed in a 450 mL Parr
      reactor with 50 mL hydrogenated pyrolysis oil. Moisture was
      removed from the mixture by heating above 100° C. under flowing
      hydrogen. The vessel was sealed and the reactants were heated and
      stirred. The mixture was heated to 375° C. for 30 min. and then
      cooled. The slurry was diluted with THF and filtered to remove the
      solids. Approximately, 1.8 g synoil (11% MAF yield) was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hydroconversion of Texas Lignite at 1,000 psi H2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0086] About 25 g of lignite (23% moisture; 9% ash; 28% volatiles;
      40% fixed carbon) placed in 49 g of hydrogenated pyrolysis oil
      with 3 g of 25% iron on alumina co-reagent called BXF1. The
      mixture was placed in a 450 mL Parr pressure reactor and charged
      with 400 psi of hydrogen gas at room temperature. The reactor was
      sealed and heated to 350° C. while stirring for 3 hours. The
      pressure reached 1000 psi. Here the moisture was not removed from
      the lignite before placing it in the reactor. The slurry was then
      cooled and filtered. About 55 g of oil was collected with 3 g of
      solid residue remaining (excluding co-reagent weight). This
      represents a 35% synoil yield based on moisture, ash-free (MAF)
      coal.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The experiment was repeated. In this case, 50 g of
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oil was used, other amounts were the same
      as previous run. The mixture was brought to 320° C. for 2 hours
      while stirring. About 56.5 g of oil was recovered (38% MAF yield).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hydroconversion of Lignite from Luminant</b><br>
      <br>
      [0088] Lignite from Luminant (30% moisture, 8% ash, 29% volatiles,
      33% fixed carbon) was crushed and sieved to 16 mesh. Twenty-five
      grams of this lignite was added to 40 g of hydrogenated pyrolysis
      oil and 3 g of 25% iron on alumina co-reagent. The vessel was
      sealed and charged with 300 psi H2 at room temperature, the
      mixture was brought to and held at 320° C. for 30 min while
      stirring. During this time the pressure reached a maximum value of
      900 psi. After cooling and work-up, 47 g of oil was recovered (48%
      MAF yield). The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oil was 85.2%, 10.2%, and 4.7% by mass,
      respectively. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the oil
      recovered at the end of the experiment was 85.7%, 9.0%, and 6.5%
      by mass, respectively.<br>

      grams of this lignite was added to 50 g of hydrogenated pyrolysis
      oil and 3 g of 25% iron on silica co-reagent. The mixture was
      brought to and held at 320° C. for 30 min while stirring. After

      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hydroconversion with Bauxite from Arkansas</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0090] Bauxite from Arkansas was crushed into fine powder ( ̃200
      mesh) and reduced at 300° C. under 17 psi H2. The resulting solid
      was called BXF9. About 25 g of lignite coal from Luminant (30%
      moisture, 8% ash, 29% volatiles, 33% fixed carbon; 16 mesh) was
      mixed with the BXF9 co-reagent (3 g) and 50 g of hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil in a 450 mL Parr vessel. The reactor was sealed,
      charged with 300 psig of H2 and heated to 320° C. The temperature
      was held for 30 minutes while stirring at 150 rpm, during which
      time the pressure reached 1000 psi. After cooling and work-up, 59
      g of oil remained (59% MAF yield). The carbon, hydrogen and
      nitrogen content of the hydrogenated pyrolysis oil was 85.2%,
      10.2%, and 4.7% by mass, respectively. The carbon, hydrogen and
      nitrogen content of the oil recovered at the end of the experiment
      was 84.3%, 9.0%, and 5.9% by mass, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Lignite from Luminant was crushed and sieved to 16 mesh and
      dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. to 2% moisture or less. Eighteen
      grams of this lignite was added to 50 g of hydrogenated pyrolysis
      oil and 3 g of 25% iron on alumina co-reagent. The reactor was
      sealed, charged with 300 psi of H2 and heated to 320° C. The
      mixture was held at 320° C. for 30 min while stirring during which
      the pressure rose to a maximum of 900 psi. After cooling and
      workup, 58 g of oil was recovered (52% MAF yield).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Scale Up</b><br>
      <br>
      [0092] A larger scale reaction of 400 g lignite (20% moisture, 1%
      ash, 40+ mesh from NRG) was slurried with 812 g hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil and 48 g of 25% iron on alumina co-reagent in a 2
      gallon pressure reactor. The head space was charged with 234 psi
      H2 gas. The mixture was heated at 15° C./min to a final
      temperature of 320° C. at which it was held for 30 min while
      stirring continuously at 150 rpm. Once the temperature reached
      320° C., additional H2 was introduced to make the reactor pressure
      1000 psi. After cooling and work-up, 923 g of oil was recovered
      (49% MAF yield). The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the
      hydrogenated pyrolysis oil was 85.6%, 9.8%, and 3.9% by mass,
      respectively. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the oil
      recovered at the end of the experiment was 82.5%, 9.0%, and 4.7%
      by mass, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] A second larger reaction was performed with identical
      amounts with a higher yield of 51.8%) (933 g of oil recovered).
      The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil was 83.83%, 9.72%, and 2.72% by mass, respectively.
      The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the oil recovered at
      the end of the experiment was 81.22%, 9.28%, and 2.43% by mass,
      respectively.<br>

      [0094] A reaction identical to the first large reaction was
      carried out at the smaller scale (25 g lignite, 50 g hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil, and 3 g co-reagent Fe on alumina) using the same
      reagents. This small scale reaction gave 53 g oil recovered or a
      20% MAF yield. This result suggests that there may be increases in
      yield upon scale-up.<br>

      <br>
      [0095] Factors such as time, pressure, and catalyst composition
      were examined to determine slurry oil varieties made by
      hydrogenation of synoil or pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil or synoil
      of the composition shown in Table 4 was reacted with the given
      catalyst and support at the given temperature and pressure for the
      given time. The resulting slurry oil with catalyst, recovered at
      the yield and composition shown, could be mixed with a
      carbonaceous feedstock and then reacted to form synoil. In some
      embodiments, alumina was found to be a more effective support than
      carbon, but certain other variables resulted in similar yields,
      allowing for optimization based on costs.<br>

      [0096] Once a hydrogenated pyrolysis oil or synoil is made,
      lignite is slurried in this oil under a hydrogen atmosphere at
      various temperatures and pressures in the presence or absence of a
      catalyst, yielding synoil after work-up. Many variables were
      considered including lignite source, composition, and inherent
      moisture; type of catalyst; type of catalyst support; temperature;
      pressure; hydrogen partial pressure; steam partial pressure; rate
      of heating and cooling; stirring rate; lignite particle size,

      [0097] A typical run consisted of loading 25 g of lignite (with
      known ash and moisture content, shown in Table 4) into a 450 mL
      Parr pressure reactor with 50 g of slurry oil and various amounts
      of BXF1 or other conversion agent. The reactor was sealed and
      charged with different partial pressures of hydrogen. The reactor
      was then heated to the desired temperature for 30 min with
      stirring at 100 rpm. After cooling and work-up, the product is
      analyzed. Best yields were typically found with mild temperature
      and pressure, 20-30 minute digestion time, and Fe/alumina
      conversion agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Yields also depended on the type of coal, as shown in Table
      5. Removal of moisture in the lignite was optional, but the
      freshness, ash content (lower the better) and volatility (higher
      the better) were significant. The results in Table 6 can thus be
      explained by the compositional analysis in Table 7.<br>

      </b><b>Characterization of Synoil</b><br>
      <br>
      [0099] Lignite is slurried with hydrogenated pyrolysis oil under a
      hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a conversion agent under
      varied temperature and pressure, resulting in synoil. This synoil
      is then tested and determined to have an elemental composition of
      between 80 and 85% carbon, 7 to 10% hydrogen, and 0.5 to 5%
      nitrogen by mass. This is close to the ideal oil values of 86%
      carbon and 14% hydrogen. Sulfur content was typically 0.5% or less
      which classifies this as a low sulfur or “sweet” crude substitute.
      By difference, the oxygen content ranged from 2-8%, most typically
      around 5%.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Trace metal content is important as high levels of certain
      metals are known to make refining the synoil into finished
      products more difficult, and thus can cause the synoil product to
      lose some value. Table 8 shows trace metal as well as sulfur
      contents in the synoil produced compared to crude oil
      alternatives. The synoil made by this embodiment is of low
      viscosity (13 cSt @ 38 C), is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, and has
      a specific gravity of 0.82-1.0. By boiling fractions and viscosity
      it can classified as a medium sweet crude oil.<br>

      [0101] Low-ash lignite (25 g) was slurried with 50 mL hydrogenated
      pyrolysis oil with no conversion agent. The reaction was kept at
      100° C. for 1 hour and 45 minutes with minimum H2 flow monitored
      through bubbler. The reactor was sealed and heated to 375° C. for
      30 minutes, with maximum temperature 388° C. and maximum pressure
      350 psi. This uncatalyzed reaction yielded 2-3 g of oil.<br>
