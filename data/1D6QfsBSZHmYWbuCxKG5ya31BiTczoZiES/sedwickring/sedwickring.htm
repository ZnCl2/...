      COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- New electromagnetic propulsion technology
      being tested by the University of Maryland's Space Power and
      Propulsion Laboratory (SPPL) on the International Space Station
      could revolutionize the capabilities of satellites and future
      spacecraft by reducing reliance on propellants and extending the
      lifecycle of satellites through the use of a renewable power
      source.<br>
      <br>
      Because a finite propellant payload is often the limiting factor
      on the number of times a satellite can be moved or repositioned in
      space, a new propulsion method that uses a renewable, onboard
      electromagnetic power source and does not rely on propellants
      could exponentially extend a satellite's useful life span and
      provide greater scientific return on investment.<br>
      <br>
      Associate Professor of Aerospace Engineering Ray Sedwick and his
      research team have been developing technology that could enable
      electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF), which uses locally
      generated electromagnetic forces to position satellites or
      spacecraft without relying on propellants. Their research project
      is titled Resonant Inductive Near-field Generation System, or
      RINGS.<br>
      <br>
      RINGS was sent to the International Space Station on August 3 as
      part of a payload launched on Japan’s HTV-4 Cargo Ship from the
      Tanegashima Space Center. The project is scheduled for four test
      sessions on the research station. Astronauts will unpack the
      equipment, integrate it into the test environment and run
      diagnostics. From there, RINGS will undergo three science research
      sessions where data will be collected and transmitted back to the
      ground for analysis.<br>
      <br>
      RINGS is composed of two units, each of which contains a specially
      fabricated coil of aluminum wire that supports an oscillating
      current of up to 18 amps and is housed within a protective
      polycarbonate shell. Microcontrollers ensure that the currents
      oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase to produce attracting,
      repelling and even shearing forces. While aluminum wire was chosen
      for its low density in this research prototype, eventual systems
      would employ superconducting wires to significantly increase range
      and performance.<br>
      <br>
      In the spring of 2013, RINGS was tested for the first time in a
      microgravity environment on NASA's reduced gravity aircraft. UMD
      graduate students Allison Porter and Dustin Alinger were on hand
      to oversee the testing. RINGS achieved the first and only
      successful demonstration of EMFF in full six degrees of freedom to
      date.<br>
      <br>
      "While reduced gravity flights can only provide short, 15-20
      second tests at a time, the cumulative test time over the four-day
      campaign provided extremely valuable data that will allow us to
      really get the most from the test sessions that we’ll have on the
      International Space Station," said Sedwick.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to EMFF, the RINGS project is also being used to test
      a second technology demonstrating wireless power transfer (WPT).
      WPT may offer a means to wirelessly transfer power between
      spacecraft and in turn power a fleet of smaller vessels or
      satellites. Having the power to support multiple satellites, and
      using EMFF as a propellant-less means to reposition those same
      satellites, provides the flexibility to perform formation control
      maneuvers such as on-orbit assembly or creating synthetic aperture
      arrays. A synthetic aperture array uses a network of smaller
      antennas to function collectively as one large antenna. Larger
      antennas are capable of producing higher resolution images and
      better quality data.<br>
      <br>
      The RINGS project has been a collaborative effort between UMD SPPL
      and partners from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
      and Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS). MIT's SPHERES (Synchronized
      Position Hold Engage Re-orient Experimental Satellites) program
      provided SPPL an existing test bed of miniature satellites and
      control algorithms that will be used to integrate and test the
      RINGS technology. AFS has provided hardware development and
      support for the integration of RINGS onto the SPHERES platform.<br>
      <br>
      SPPL began work on RINGS in 2011, and the project is funded under
      a joint DARPA/NASA program that aims to demonstrate and develop
      new technologies that could enable future space missions by using
      a network of smaller spacecraft. <br>

      RINGS (Resonant Inductive Near-field Generation System) is a
      demonstration of combined technology for electromagnetic formation
      flight (EMFF) and wireless power transfer (WPT) that will launch
      to the International Space Station (ISS) in July 2013. Currently,
      multi-satellite constellations use traditional thrusters to
      maneuver into a desired position and orientation relative to each
      other which shortens the operational lifetime of the constellation
      due the limited onboard propellant. Electromagnetic formation
      flight is a propellant-less propulsion technology that aims to
      mitigate this operational lifetime constraint. Magnetic forces and
      torques are generated by circulating electrical current through a
      coil attached to each vehicle which can be used to reorient the
      satellites relative to one another.<br>
      <br>
      fig 4This approach uses electrical energy which is readily
      available through the use of solar panels rather than expending
      propellant. Inside the ISS, two RINGS vehicles will be used to
      develop and test EMFF control algorithms in a full six
      degree-of-freedom microgravity environment. The two RINGS are each
      attached to a SPHERES vehicle (launched to the ISS in April 2006)
      that will provide metrology information, commanding, and data
      storage for the RINGS. Additionally, RINGS will demonstrate
      another technology – wireless power transfer using the same coils
      as highly coupled resonators for magnetic induction. One RINGS
      unit will act as the primary by actively driving current in the
      coil while the other unit will act as the secondary by passively
      receiving power from the current induced by the primary unit’s
      magnetic field. Expected power transmission is about 50 Watts over
      an axial distance of 1 meter.<br>

      A wireless energy transfer system includes a primary and one (or
      more) secondary oscillators for transferring energy therebetween
      when resonating at the same frequency. The long range (up to and
      beyond 100 m) efficient (as high as and above 50%) energy transfer
      is achieved due to minimizing (or eliminating) losses in the
      system. Superconducting materials are used for all current
      carrying elements, dielectrics are either avoided altogether, or
      those are used with a low dissipation factor, and the system is
      operated at reduced frequencies (below 1 MHz). The oscillators are
      contoured as a compact flat coil formed from a superconducting
      wire material. The energy wavelengths exceed the coils diameter by
      several orders of magnitude. The reduction in radiative losses is
      enhanced by adding external dielectric-less electrical capacitance
      to each oscillator coil to reduce the operating frequency. The
      dielectric strength of the capacitor is increased by applying a
      magnetic cross-field to the capacitor to impede the electrons
      motion across an air gap defined between coaxial cylindrical
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This utility patent application is based on the Provisional
      Patent Application No. 61/350,229 filed 1 Jun. 2010.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention is directed to power transfer
      systems, and more in particular to a system for wireless energy
      transfer between electromagnetic resonant objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] More in particular, the present invention is directed to
      the power transfer between resonators (also referred to herein
      intermittently as oscillators) in highly efficient and low loss
      manner, thereby permitting long range wireless power transfer.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The present invention is further directed to a system for
      wireless power transfer with diminished resistive, dielectric, and
      radiative losses, where such is operated at reduced frequencies to
      produce higher efficiencies at long range distances.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The present invention also is directed to a system for
      wireless power transfer between electromagnetic oscillators spaced
      apart at a desired distance from each other where the system
      components are manufactured from superconductive materials for
      diminishing resistive losses. Use of dielectric materials is
      minimized or avoided to decrease the dielectric losses, and the
      operating resonant frequency is maintained below a predetermined
      level to attain a desired amount of power transfer at an increased
      efficiency level.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In addition, the present invention is directed to a system
      for wireless power transfer, where the oscillators are formed as
      superconductive dielectric-less compact (flat) coils coupled to
      dielectric-less (and preferably superconductive) capacitors
      contoured in a shape permitting the application of a magnetic
      field for increasing the effective dielectric strength of air or
      other medium between the capacitor electrodes thereby permitting a
      dielectric-less capacitive element with satisfactory dielectric
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] Wireless energy (or power) transfer is a promising approach
      for environmentally friendly, convenient and reliable powering of
      electrical and electronic devices, such as computers, electric
      vehicles, cell phones, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Resonant Inductive Coupling pioneered by Nikola Tesla in
      the early 20thcentury has later found applications in power
      transfer systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Recent developments in the field of power transfer have
      demonstrated the ability to transfer 60 W power with 40%
      efficiency covering 2 m distance. This medium-range wireless
      energy transfer system (called "WiTricity") has been developed by
      a group of MIT scientists based on strong coupling between
      electromagnetic resonant objects, i.e., transmitters and receivers
      that contain magnetic loop antennas critically attuned to the same
      frequency. As presented in A. Karalis, et al., "Efficient Wireless
      Non-Radiative Mid-Range Energy Transfer", Ann. Phys., 10.1016
      (2007), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,741,734 and 7,825,543, the system for
      wireless energy transfer includes a first resonator structure
      configured to transfer energy non-radiatively to a second
      resonator structure over medium range distances. These distances
      are characterized as being large in comparison to transmit-receive
      antennas, but small in comparison to the wavelength of the
      transmitted power.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The resonators in these energy transfer systems are formed
      as self-resonant conducting coils from a conductive wire which is
      wound into a helical coil of a predetermined radius r and height h
      surrounded by air, as shown in FIG. 1. The non-radiative energy
      transfer in this system is mediated by a coupling of a resonant
      field evanescent tail of the first resonator structure and a
      resonant field evanescent tail of the second resonator structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The ability to effectively transfer power over desired
      distances, depends on losses in the resonance system which may be
      attributed to ohmic (material absorption) loss inside the wire,
      radiative loss in the free space, as well as dielectric losses in
      dielectric materials used in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In "WiTricity," the maximum power coupling efficiency of
      coils fabricated from standard conductors occurs at the 10 MHz
      range, where the combination of resistive and radiative losses are
      at a minimum. The effective range of these systems, i.e., a few
      meters at non-negligible efficiencies, has significant application
      within everyday life to provide power to personal electronics
      (laptops, cell phones) or other equipment within the confines of
      room. However, this type of system is incapable of efficient power
      transfer with respect to relatively long range applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It would be highly desirable to extend the reach of the
      resonant inductive power transfer for applications in space, for
      example, for the on-orbit power transfer between the elements of a
      satellite cluster or on the surface of the moon between a
      centralized power station and a rover. In order to attain greater
      distances in wireless power transfer, higher efficiencies of power
      transfer are necessary. Therefore, it is highly desirable to
      provide a long range power transfer system where the loss paths
      existing in the mid-range system are minimized or eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0014] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide a long range wireless power transfer system where high
      efficiencies of power transfer are attained due to a reduction in
      or elimination of parasitic loss mechanisms attributed to the
      internal material dissipation (resistive, or ohmic, losses) as
      well as radiative losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] It is a further object of the present invention to provide
      a long range inductive power transfer system in which the
      oscillators are manufactured, based on superconducting principles
      (superconducting materials, as well as compactness for
      cryo-cooling) to reduce the ohmic losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is another object of the present invention to provide an
      efficient long range wireless power transfer system in which the
      system components are free of dielectric losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
      long range inductive wireless power transfer system in which
      external capacitances are coupled to the superconductive
      oscillators to lower the operating frequency, thereby attaining
      higher efficiencies and thus permitting power transfer over
      greater distances. Preferably, the capacitors are manufactured
      from superconductive materials and are dielectric-less.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is still a further object of the present invention to
      provide a power transfer system using superconducting
      dielectric-less system components while operating the system at a
      reduced operating frequency to attain effective power transfer
      over extended distances.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In one aspect, the present invention is envisioned as a
      system for long range wireless power transfer which comprises a
      primary oscillator and one (or a plurality of) secondary
      oscillator(s) displaced from the primary oscillator at a distance
      D (which may fall in any desired power transfer range, including
      both mid-range, as well as long-range over 100 m, for instance) to
      receive energy from the primary oscillator. The oscillators are
      configured into flat compact coils formed from a superconducting
      material and resonating substantially at the same frequency. The
      frequency is maintained below a predetermined frequency level
      (below 1 MHz, and preferably, at or below ~200 KHz) which provides
      a significant reduction in radiative losses in both the primary
      and secondary oscillators. It is important that the system is
      operated at wavelengths that exceed the diameter of the coils by
      several orders of magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The system includes a source of energy coupled up-stream of
      said primary oscillator and one or a plurality of power consuming
      unit(s) each coupled down-stream of the respective secondary
      oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] A uni-turn drive coil is coupled between the source of
      energy and the primary coil. A drain coil is coupled between the
      secondary oscillator and the respective power consuming unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A plurality of capacitors may be employed in the instant
      system. Each capacitor is coupled to a respective oscillator. The
      capacitor includes a pair (or more) of coaxially disposed
      cylindrical electrodes including an inner cylindrical electrode
      and one (or more) outer cylindrical electrode(s) disposed in a
      co-axial surrounding relationship with the inner cylindrical
      electrode. An air gap is defined between cylindrical walls of the
      inner and outer cylindrical electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Preferably, the capacitor, similar to the oscillators, is
      formed from a superconducting material. The superconducting
      material for the oscillators and the capacitors may be any
      superconductor, including for example, Type I superconductors,
      High Temperature Superconductors, such as BSCCO, or YBCO, as well
      as room temperature superconductors.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Although, the air gap in the capacitor, and spaces between
      windings in coils may be filled with a dielectric material having
      a low dissipation factor, it is preferred that dielectric-less
      components are used in the system. In order to provide
      dielectric-less capacitor, having a satisfactory dielectric
      strength, a magnetic field is applied axially to the capacitor to
      increase a breakdown voltage threshold in its air gap, thereby
      increasing the effective dielectric strength of air in the air gap
      of the dielectric-less capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] A booster resonator coil may be positioned between the
      primary and the secondary oscillators to permit even larger
      transfer distances. The booster resonator coil resonates in phase
      with the primary oscillator structure to receive energy from it
      and is in phase with the secondary oscillator to transfer power
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A thermo-control system is provided in the subject system,
      which controls the cryo-equipment operatively coupled to the
      oscillators and capacitors. The shape and dimensions of the coils
      and capacitors must be compatible with dimensional abilities of
      the cryo-equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The present invention also is envisioned as a method for
      long range wireless energy transfer, which includes the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      fabricating primary and secondary oscillator structures as compact
      flat coils formed from a superconducting material,<br>
      displacing the secondary oscillator from the primary oscillator a
      desired distance which may fall in the range below as well as
      exceeding 100 m,<br>
      generating an oscillating current of a resonant frequency in the
      primary oscillator so that the oscillating current creates an
      oscillating field, and<br>
      sensing the oscillating current of the primary coil by the second
      oscillator, thereby causing oscillation of the secondary
      oscillator structure at the same resonant frequency, thus
      transferring energy from the primary to the secondary oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In the subject method, by maintaining the resonant
      frequency below a predetermined frequency level (for example,
      below 1 MHz, and preferably at or below ~200 KHz), a reduced
      radiative loss in both the primary and secondary oscillators may
      be attained.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The method further comprises the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      coupling a capacitor element to each of the primary and secondary
      coils where the capacitor is preformed to include an inner
      cylindrical electrode and one (or more) outer cylindrical
      electrode(s) co-axially disposed around the inner cylindrical
      electrode. Specific care is taken to define an air gap between
      cylindrical walls of the inner and outer cylindrical electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Finally, a magnetic field is applied axially to the
      capacitor to increase the effective dielectric strength of air in
      the air gap, thereby permitting formation of a dielectric-less
      capacitor which, however, has a satisfactory dielectric strength.
      The capacitor preferably is formed from a superconducting
      material.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0050] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the system 10 for a long range
      inductive power transfer includes a source oscillator 12 (also
      referred to herein as a transmitting oscillator, or a primary
      oscillator) which is connected to a power source 14, and one or
      several receiving (also referred to herein as secondary)
      oscillator(s) 16 physically separated by a distance D from the
      source oscillator 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] As presented in FIG. 2, the system 10 may include a number
      of receiving oscillators 16, each for powering a corresponding
      power consuming device 18, such as, for example, cell phones, TVs,
      computers, etc. It is to be understood by those skilled in the
      art, that although any number of the secondary oscillators 16 is
      envisioned in the present system, for the sake of simplicity
      further disclosure will be presented based on a single secondary
      oscillator design.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The energy provided by the power source 14 to the source
      oscillator 12 is wirelessly transferred in the system 10 in a
      non-radiative manner to the receiving oscillator(s) 16 over the
      distance D using the electromagnetic field. The distance D may
      fall in the range between meters to hundreds (or over) of meters,
      depending on the application and the ability of the power transfer
      system. As will be presented in further paragraphs, the present
      system 10 is designed with the ability to effectively transfer
      power over long distances, i.e., 100s of meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As shown in FIGS. 2-3, and 5-6, the source oscillator 12,
      i.e., the primary oscillator, is formed as a multi-winding coil.
      The receiving oscillator, i.e., the secondary oscillator 16 is
      similarly formed as a multi-winding coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Mounted close to each of the resonant coils, i.e., the
      primary coil 12 and the secondary coil 16 is a single turn coil.
      The single turn coil 20 mounted between the power source 14 and
      the primary coil 12 is the drive coil 20. The energy flows from
      the drive coil 20 to the primary coil 12 as shown by the arrow 24.
      The drive coil 20 is connected to the power supply 14 for being
      driven at the natural frequency of the primary coil 12. At this
      frequency, a large oscillating current is generated in the primary
      coil 12. This oscillating current creates an oscillating magnetic
      field that is then sensed by the secondary coil 16 which, as a
      result, will start oscillating. As the current increases in the
      secondary coil 16, more energy will be available for powering the
      respective power consuming device 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A single turn coil 22, referred to herein as the drain
      coil, couples to the secondary coil 16. The energy flows from the
      secondary coil 16 to the drain coil 22 as shown by the arrow 26.
      The load, i.e., the power consuming device 18, is connected to the
      drain coil 22 to receive power.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The ends of each resonant coil, i.e., primary coil 12, and
      secondary coil 16, may or may not be connected to capacitors. As
      shown in FIG. 2, the ends 28, 30 of the primary coil 12, as well
      as the ends 32, 34 of the secondary coil 16 are not connected.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In an alternative embodiment, in the equivalent circuit
      diagram shown in FIG. 3, as well as in FIGS. 8-9, the primary and
      secondary coil components are each shown connected to a capacitor,
      i.e., the capacitor 36 is coupled to the primary coil 12, and the
      capacitor 38 coupled to the secondary coil 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Even if the resonant coils 12 and 16 are not connected to
      the capacitors 36 and 38, respectively, they have a
      "self-capacitance", which in conjunction with their self
      inductance causes them to resonate at a particular frequency. By
      adding an additional external capacitance, this frequency may be
      lowered, so that it becomes easier to match the frequencies of the
      primary and secondary coils 12, 16, respectively. The operation of
      this system 10 is based on the ability to cause resonation of the
      primary and the secondary coils at the same frequency. By adding
      additional capacitances 36, 38 to the primary and secondary coils
      12, 16, respectively, in addition to matching of the frequency of
      the coils 12 and 16, coils of different sizes may be used. The
      resonant coils, when fabricated from a superconductive material,
      as will be presented further herein, may be as small as 10 cm in
      diameter or as large as several meters in diameter. The
      superconductor material may be selected for example, from Type I
      superconductors, High Temperature Superconductors, such as BSCCO,
      and YBCO, as well as room temperature superconductors.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As long as the two coils, i.e., the primary coil 12 and the
      secondary coil 16, have the same resonant frequency, they may be,
      but do not have to be of the same physical size. The larger
      product of the two coil areas, e.g., of the primary coil 12 and
      the secondary coil 16, leads to the larger amount of power which
      can be transferred from the primary coil 12 to the secondary coil
      16 as shown by the arrow 40. In some cases it may be advantageous
      to increase the diameter of one coil and decrease the diameter of
      another coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] By lowering the losses in the primary coil 12, a higher
      level of the oscillating current may be created, thereby resulting
      in a larger magnetic field. Likewise, by lowering the losses in
      the secondary coil 16, a higher level of the oscillating current
      may be created, and more energy will be available to the load
      device 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The power flow is shown schematically in FIG. 4 where the
      power PIN comes into the primary (transmitting) coil 12 from the
      power supply. Energy is stored in the primary coil 12 in the form
      of an oscillating electric and magnetic field. This energy Pk may
      be either transmitted to the secondary (receiving) coil 16 via the
      channel 40, or lost as presented by P[Gamma]1.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The received power at the secondary (receiving) coil 16
      also may be either transmitted (Pw) to the power consuming device,
      or lost as shown by P[Gamma]2.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The mechanisms for power loss are attributed either to the
      resistive losses in the coil wire, losses in the dielectric
      material that may be used in the construction of the coils and/or
      the capacitors, as well as to the losses due to radiated energy.
      It is clear that by lowering the losses in the system, a higher
      energy level may be available for the secondary coil 16, and a
      higher overall efficiency of the system 10 is attained.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In order to reduce the losses in the present system,
      multiple approaches have been considered and implemented,
      including:<br>
      <br>
      A. Use of superconducting material in the construction of the
      components,<br>
      B. Minimizing or avoiding the use of dielectric materials in the
      system components, and<br>
      C. Lowering the operating frequency (to below 1 MHz).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] With respect to lowering the operating frequency, it is to
      be taken in consideration that the operating frequency cannot be
      lowered excessively since this approach will lower the amount of
      power that may be transmitted. Therefore, a balance has to be
      maintained between lowering the operating frequency for increasing
      the efficiency with which the power may be transmitted and keeping
      the satisfactory amount of transmitted power.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] As presented in FIGS. 5 and 6, the transmitting and
      receiving oscillator coils 12 and 16 are contoured as compact flat
      multiturn coils. As opposed to the helical geometry of the
      oscillators used in prior systems shown in FIG. 1 which was used
      to reduce the self capacitance of the coil in order to target a
      particular frequency (10 MHz) which was optimal with the regular
      conductors being used, the present system uses lower frequencies
      (below 1 MHz). Therefore a compact flat spiral contour is used
      which is advantageous in occupying a lesser volume which is
      important in the case of using a superconducting coil in the
      present system since it facilitates enclosing the coil in the
      cryogenic equipment 42, 43 schematically shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Shown in FIG. 6, the coil of the present invention is held
      in close-up position by a structure 44 which holds each turn of
      the coil spaced a predetermined fixed distance each from the other
      without introducing a significant amount of dielectric material
      between the windings. There are several structures 44 holding the
      coil in close-up shape as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Although, it is possible to manufacture the coils 12, 16
      with a thin layer of dielectric 45 between the windings as shown
      in FIG. 8, it is preferable that there is no dielectric material
      used between the turns of the coils in order to diminish or
      eliminate dielectric losses in the coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The principle of the oscillator design, as well as the
      detailed principle of the design of the capacitors 36, 38 will be
      presented in following paragraphs.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Referring to FIGS. 7-9 an air-gap capacitor 36, 38 is
      constructed from two coaxial cylinders 50 and 52 having different
      radii (a&lt;b). Shown in FIG. 8 is the connection of the ends of
      the coil 12 or 16 to the cylindrical capacitor 36, 38 where one
      end 28, 32 of the coil 12, 16, respectively, is connected to the
      outer cylinder 52, while another end 30, 34 of the coil 12, 16,
      respectively, is connected to the inner cylinder 50. The inner and
      outer cylinders 50 and 52 of the capacitor 36 or 38 each
      corresponds to a respective electrode of the capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In order that the system 10 be functional, the capacitor
      36, 38 does not have to be superconducting or even
      dielectric-less. However, current flowing in and out of the
      capacitor will suffer from ohmic (resistive) losses if it is
      fabricated from a regular conductor material, and likewise there
      will be dielectric losses present if a dielectric is used. FIG. 9
      shows a section of the air gap 62 filled with a dielectric 47.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The capacitor design shown with two cylindrical electrodes
      is an exemplary embodiment. Any geometry may be used for the
      capacitor in question. The advantage of the concentric cylinders,
      however, is that such permits the use of a magnetic field to act
      as a dielectric medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The purpose of the dielectric in a capacitor is to allow
      electrodes of the capacitor to be placed closer together in order
      to raise the capacitance. Without the dielectric, the electrons
      penetrate the gap between the electrodes and cause shorting in the
      capacitors. However, molecules of the dielectric material respond
      to the changing electrical field by trying to align with it, thus
      resulting in their oscillation. This effect causes an internal
      friction that dissipates energy causing a dielectric loss. By
      using a magnetic field, instead of the dielectric, the electrons
      can be partially stopped or blocked from crossing the electrode
      gap, thus allowing the electrodes to be closer together without
      the risk of shorting. At the same time, since there is no material
      present, the usual dielectric losses are not seen.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The superconducting capacitor may be made of the same
      material as the wire of the primary and secondary coils in the
      system, for instance, BCCO or YBCO, or of a Type I superconductor,
      or a room temperature superconductor. However, as opposed to the
      ribbon wire of the coils, the electrodes in the capacitor are
      formed from solid pieces of the superconducting material.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 9, the capacitor also may
      be constructed from several concentric electrodes. In the example
      shown in FIG. 9, there are four concentric cylinders 52, 58, 60
      and 63 in total connected alternately to the ends 28, 32, and 30,
      34 of the oscillators 12, 16, respectively, thus increasing the
      overall capacitance. The outer cylinder 52 encircles one of the
      inner cylinder electrodes 58 which in turn encircles the electrode
      60, etc. Any number of the concentrically disposed cylinders may
      be used for the capacitor design.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The theoretical and design principles of the oscillating
      structures as well as the capacitors in the subject system 10 will
      be presented further herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The coupled-mode theory (CMT) presented in Haus, et al.,
      "Waves and Fields in Optoelectronics", Prentice-Hall, N.J. (1984)
      is a convenient framework to analyze performance of the subject
      system 10. For small loss levels, the formalism provides for a
      more physical understanding of the relevant processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Using a resonant circuit shown in FIG. 3, a complex
      amplitude corresponding to the instantaneous power is defined as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where C, L are the capacitance and inductance, Vmax, Imax
      are the peak voltage and current, v, i are the instantaneous
      voltage and current and W is the total energy contained within the
      circuit. With this definition, losses that are small with respect
      to the recirculated power can be introduced as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [Gamma]1a1 relates to an unrecoverable drain of power
      to the environment and [kappa]12a2 is an exchange of power with a
      second resonant device with complex amplitude a2 .<br>
      <br>
      [0082] It may be shown by energy conservation that under this
      definition the coupling coefficients must be equal
      ([kappa]12=[kappa]21=[kappa]) and it will be assumed throughout
      that the oscillators 12, 16 are identical
      ([Gamma]1=[Gamma]2=[Gamma]. The figure of merit (FOM) of such a
      configuration is given by [kappa]/[Gamma] which may be seen as the
      rate of power coupling divided by the rate of power dissipation.
      The regime of interest where this quantity is much greater than
      one is referred to as "strong coupling".<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As stated earlier, in the system for power transfer, the
      two sources of dissipative losses are ohmic and radiative. At
      radio frequencies, the current travels on the outer surface of the
      conductor (skin effect) and the characteristic skin depth is given
      by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [rho] is the resistivity, [omega] is the frequency,
      and [mu] is the material permeability.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] For small values of [delta] compared to wire radius, the
      resistance is therefore<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where R, N and w are the coil radius, number of turns in
      the coil and wire width respectively, and f=f/(10 MHz). The wire
      of the oscillating coils 12, 16, although other implementations
      are envisioned, as an example, is assumed to be a ribbon with a
      width (w) much greater than its thickness. The radiative losses
      are given in the quasi-static limit as-presented in [C. Balanis,
      et al., "Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design", Wiley, N.J.,
      (2005)]:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0000] where the last equality is simply an identification of the
      usual ohmic dissipation as a function of the RMS (Root Mean
      Square) current, which is Imax/[square root of]{square root over
      (2)}.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] From this it may be seen that the loss coefficient can be
      related to the inductance and dissipation of the coil by<br>

      <br>

      [0088] In the quasi-static limit and at large distances D&gt;R the
      magnetic flux density at the secondary coil 16 as a result of the

      <br>

      [0090] and from the definition of crad, the FOM becomes<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where D is in meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] It may be seen that the FOM goes to zero at low frequencies
      as a result of slowly decreasing ohmic losses, as well as at high
      frequencies as a result of rapidly increasing radiative losses.
      The frequency dependence of the ohmic losses shown in Eq. 12 does
      not actually hold at very low frequencies where it approaches a
      constant value, however this does not change the result that
      follows. The FOM therefore has a maximum, and its value and
      corresponding frequency are easily found from differentiating Eq.

      [0092] The loss mode ratio governing the optimal frequency is
      related to the coil design parameters by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0093] For a copper coil used in the prior art system with
      parameters R=30 cm, w=4 mm, N=1 is seen to have an optimal
      frequency of 10.6 MHz ( f=1.06) and a corresponding coupling ratio
      (FOM) equal to 117. Eqs. 13 and 14 provide a method of designing a
      set of coils for a particular frequency in such a way as to
      maximize the coupling with minimum loss.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] An immediate consequence of the result of the analysis
      presented supra is that a reduction in the resistivity of the
      oscillator provides for an increase in the efficiency of the
      coupling. By eliminating the resistive losses of the primary and
      secondary coils 12, 16, there is freedom to drive the frequency to
      lower values, reducing the radiative losses as well. FIG. 10 shows
      the frequency dependent portion of the FOM (Eq. 12) for three
      different loss mode ratios. As expected, the optimal value of the
      frequency is tending toward lower frequencies in the limit that
      the resistive losses are zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] It is instructive to adopt the definition given in [A.
      Kurs, et al., "Wireless Power Trans. Via Strongly Coupled Mag.
      Resonances", Science, 317 (2007)] for the efficiency of the power
      transfer, given as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where 2[Gamma]¦a1¦&lt;2 &gt;and 2[Gamma]¦a2¦&lt;2 &gt;are
      the rates of power dissipation in each oscillator coil as
      discussed in the previous paragraphs, and 2[Gamma]W¦a2¦&lt;2
      &gt;is the rate of power transferred into a load coupled to the
      secondary coil 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A similar loss may be attributed to the amplifier driving
      the primary coil 12, but the efficiency will be defined as
      relative to the output power of the amplifier. In steady-state,
      the power that is coupled to the secondary coil 16 must equal the
      total power consumed by both dissipation and the load draw. This
      results in a relationship between the energy content of each
      resonator<br>

      of loss and coupling parameters<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Differentiating this expression with respect to
      [Gamma]W/[Gamma], the maximum efficiency occurs when<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [Gamma]W&lt;2&gt;-[Gamma]&lt;2&gt;=[kappa]&lt;2&gt; (Eq. 18)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and at this condition, the efficiency may be expressed as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0097] While efficiency is certainly a driver of the subject
      system design, the actual power level that can be transferred to a
      load 18 on the receiving end is of a great importance as well.
      This power is related to the recirculating energy of the coil and
      using Eq. 16 may be expressed as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0098] This expression may also be differentiated with respect to
      [Gamma]W/[Gamma] to find the ratio of load to dissipation that
      maximizes the power. This results in [Gamma]W/[Gamma]=1, and the
      maximum power to the load is therefore<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] showing that for maximum power transfer, the dissipation
      should be at a minimum and the energy content and coupling should
      be at a maximum. Also shown is the resulting efficiency at the
      condition of maximum power transfer, and it may be seen that the
      efficiency approaches a maximum value of 50% as the FOM increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] To estimate the power and efficiency at a nominal distance
      of 100 meters, Eq. 12 is used in the superconducting limit<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and at 200 kHz, f=0.02, so that [kappa]/[Gamma] 41 and
      [eta]max 95%.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] To estimate the power delivered, the product of [Gamma]L is
      given by Eqs. 5 and 7 as [Gamma]L=[1/2]CRad f&lt;4&gt;, again with
      no ohmic losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Assuming a coil design having 100 turns of wire and a
      radius of 0.5 meters, cRad=237. At maximum efficiency<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and if Imax=100 amps then the power delivered at 100 meters
      is 7.8 Watts. However, if the maximum power coupling is desired,
      [Gamma]W is matched to [Gamma], and from Eq. 21 the efficiency is
      ~50%. The power delivered at 100 meters in this case is 80 Watts.
      From Eqs. 19 and 21, and from the performance numbers just
      discussed, it is seen that there is a conflict between maximizing
      efficiency and maximizing power delivered.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Consider the case when maximizing the efficiency is the
      goal. Eq. 19 shows that the efficiency is not appreciably affected
      until [kappa]/[Gamma] drops below a value of around 3,
      corresponding to a frequency-distance product ( fD) approaching
      ~5. At this point the maximum efficiency drops to 50% and at 200
      kHz this corresponds to a distance of 250 meters. Reducing the
      frequency by a factor of 10 will extend this 50% value of maximum
      efficiency out to 2.5 km. The relationship between maximum
      efficiency and fD in the limit of no ohmic dissipation is shown in
      FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The results discussed above are for optimal efficiency,
      where the power drawn by the load is related to the radiative
      losses and coupling coefficient by Eq.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] 18. This condition can be maintained by actively varying
      the load to shunt excess power into onboard storage or extract it
      from storage when needed. It is of interest to investigate how the
      efficiency changes as a result of off-nominal operations to assess
      how closely such a system would have to track power usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In the strong coupling regime, the maximum efficiency
      occurs when [Gamma]W/[kappa] 1, but from Eq. 17, the efficiency
      can be found that results over a continuum of load to coupling
      ratios, spanning either side of the optimal value.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In FIG. 12, the variation of efficiency with
      [Gamma]W/[kappa] for several values of [kappa]/[Gamma] is shown.
      It may be seen that the sensitivity of the efficiency to a
      mismatch in power goes down as the coupling strength increases. In
      fact, the half-max value of the efficiency occurs where
      [Gamma]w/[kappa]=([kappa]/[Gamma])&lt;+-1&gt;. The FOM may
      therefore also be interpreted as the effective 'bandwidth' for
      efficient power coupling. Thus, operating in the strong coupling
      regime means that closely matching the load to an optimal value is
      not critical, and in fact a considerably large mismatch may only
      reduce the efficiency by an acceptably small amount.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Oscillator Design Considerations</b><br>
      <br>
      [0107] In the previous paragraphs, a frequency of 200 kHz was
      selected for use with a superconducting oscillator 12, 16 to
      improve the efficiency over what can be achieved using
      non-superconducting materials. As opposed to the design of
      "WiTricity" where a regular conducting wire was used in order to
      create a coil that has a natural resonance in the 10 MHz range to
      provide maximum efficiency, helical coils having large torsion
      were used as a way of reducing their self-capacitance. Since lower
      frequencies (below 1 MHz, and, for example, preferably at or below
      200 KHz) are of interest in the present system, more compact coils
      are considered for the oscillators 12, 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The subject oscillators 12, 16 are formed from a
      superconducting wire, for example, one that is commercially
      available and is formed in the shape of ribbon that can be
      conveniently wound into a flat spiral 12, 16. An example of such
      wire is Bismuth Strontium Calcium Copper Oxide (BSCCO). BSCCO
      ("bisko") is a family of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS),
      having a critical temperature of around 110 K. As such, they can
      be easily cooled using liquid nitrogen (77 K at 1 atmosphere), or
      by using a thermocontroller 42 for controlling a plurality of
      cryo-coolers 43, as schematically shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. BSCCO is
      a high temperature superconductor which does not contain a rare
      earth element, and is formed into wires and offered commercially.
      Also, Type I superconductor materials, as well as room temperature
      superconductors, may be used as a material of the spirals 12, 16.
      In one embodiment, a dielectric 45, such as 2 mil Kapton tape, may
      be present between the windings of the coils 12, 16, as shown in
      FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The inductance for such a winding is given by {E. Rosa,
      "The Self and Mutual Induct. Of Linear Conductors", B. of the
      Bureau of Standards, 4, 2 (1908)].<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where h (hereafter assumed negligible) is the difference
      between the inner and outer radii of the windings and the other
      parameters are as previously defined.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The issue of "self-capacitance" of the oscillators 12, 16
      is more complicated. The flat spiral can be thought of as a long
      parallel plate capacitor, wrapped around onto itself. The
      capacitance per unit length around the spiral is a constant,
      however the voltage distribution across the capacitor is not
      constant from one end to the other, resulting in a variation in
      the energy distribution. With the ends 38 of the spiral 30
      unconnected, the fundamental frequency of the coil will correspond
      to a half wavelength standing wave across the entire coil, such
      that the current in the coil goes to zero at the ends. The
      distribution of current, charge and potential around the spiral
      can be given by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where the time phase of the current has been arbitrarily
      chosen, and the resulting functional forms of charge and potential
      satisfy charge conservation and Poisson's equation around the
      spiral. Vmax has been defined as the potential across the entire
      coil (end to end) and will be used to define the capacitance.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The energy per unit volume of insulator between the
      windings of the coil at any given location around the spiral is
      given by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where the voltage difference is taken between any point on
      the spiral 12, 16 and the nearest point one turn farther along the
      spiral, directly across the dielectric between the windings.
      Multiplying by the cross-section of the dielectric (wd), and
      integrating over the length of the spiral (1 2 [pi]RN), the
      maximum total energy stored in the electric field is given as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where N&gt;1 has been assumed. Combining the results of
      Eqs. 23 and 26, the natural frequency of the flat spiral coil is
      given by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0112] A coil radius of R=0.5 m may be assumed along with the
      aforementioned 200 kHz target frequency. The HTS wire mentioned
      above may be 4 mm wide, so using 2 mil Kapton with a dielectric
      constant of 4.0 in this baseline design results in a natural
      frequency of 96 kHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The required strength of the dielectric can be found by
      equating the energy contained in the magnetic field at peak
      current to the energy stored in the electric field at zero
      current, given by Eq. 26. The peak current (Imax) is related to
      the RMS current over [1/2] wavelength (denoted RMS/2) by a factor
      of [1/2], resulting in the relation<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and consequently<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0113] From Eq. 24, the maximum potential difference across the
      dielectric will occur near the center of the coil length where the
      gradient of the potential around the coil is the largest.
      Multiplying the maximum gradient by the length of a single turn,
      the largest potential seen across the dielectric is given by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Using the baseline numbers, the maximum electric field seen
      across the dielectric will be 262 V/mm, which is well below the
      dielectric strength of Kapton (197 kV/mm).<br>
      <br>
      [0115] A problem associated with this design results from
      dissipative losses in the dielectric. The dissipation factor, also
      known as the loss tangent under the relation DF=tan [delta],
      represents the ratio of resistive power loss to reactive power in
      the capacitor. Under the current formalism, the dissipation factor
      is introduced in the same manner as the previous resistive loss
      term<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where the matching of the reactance of the coil 12, 16 and
      capacitor 36, 38 at resonance has been used. This result is
      somewhat problematic for the efficiency, since the dissipation in
      the dielectric scales identically to the power that can be
      coupled. It is therefore of utmost importance either to eliminate
      the dielectric whatsoever from the coils 12, 16 and the capacitors
      36, 38, or to use dielectrics with the smallest possible
      dissipation factor.<br>
      The effect of DF (dissipation factor) can be inserted directly
      into Eq. 12, resulting in<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where elimination of the resistive losses in the coil has
      still been assumed. The ratio of the loss coefficients is then<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and the need for a low dissipation factor becomes quite
      evident. At low frequencies, the dissipation in the dielectric
      will dominate the radiative losses, just as was the case for the
      ohmic losses previously.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] To get a feel for this limitation, consider the use of
      fused quartz as a dielectric, which has a relatively low
      dissipation factor (~10&lt;-4&gt;). For the baseline design of
      R=0.5 m, the ratio in Eq. 33 is approximately equal to 0.33. The
      dissipation due to the dielectric would then be comparable to the
      radiation losses at a frequency of f= 0.69 or about 7 MHz.
      Evidently, a comparable loss level to what existed before the
      superconducting wire was introduced has returned.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] To return to the efficiency offered by reducing the
      frequency to below 1 MHz, for example to about or below ~200 kHz,
      the ratio of dissipative loss to radiative loss given in Eq. 33
      would have to be reduced by a factor of at least 10&lt;-5&gt;.
      This does not appear to be a viable approach unless the dielectric
      is removed altogether as shown in the presented embodiment of
      FIGS. 5-6. Even the presence of a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen
      to cool the superconducting wire will result in a loss tangent of
      approximately 5(10&lt;-5&gt;), so designs apparently must avoid
      the use of any dielectric in the inter-electrode space.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Superconducting Capacitor Design</b><br>
      <br>
      [0118] Once the ohmic and dielectric losses are removed from the
      coil 12, 16, the resulting natural frequency may not be at the
      level desired for the system operation. Further reduction in
      frequency may be made possible by adding more capacitance 36, 38
      externally to the coil 30, as shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 8. The use
      of capacitors without dielectrics is desired in order to retain
      the high Q-values of the superconducting oscillator 12, 16. The
      limitation of the dielectric-free capacitor 36, 38 is the low
      dielectric strength of the remnant gas in the gap. An approach
      taken herein with the goal to increase the breakdown voltage of
      the capacitor 36, 38 without introducing dielectric loss is to
      inhibit the avalanche ionization of the gas medium by applying a
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, an air-gap capacitor 36, 38 is
      constructed from two coaxial cylinders 50, 52 of radii a and b
      (with a&lt;b), respectively. An axial magnetic flux density Bz is
      applied, either by placing permanent magnets at the end of the
      cylinders, or by inducing an azimuthal current in the outer
      cylinder. In FIG. 7, IC is the circuit current between the
      capacitor 36, 38 and the coil 12, 16, respectively, and IB
      represents a steady current that could produce the desired
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The electric field in the capacitor 36, 38 is purely
      radial, but its magnitude changes in time cyclically over a period
      1/(10 f) [mu]sec. As the electric field at the surface of each
      cylinder 50, 52 increases, electrons will leave the surface until
      an avalanche occurs near the dielectric strength of the air gap.
      In the presence of a uniform axial magnetic field, the motion of
      electrons that leave the surface of either cylinder can be
      idealized to three primary components-cyclotron, E*B drift and
      polarization drift. These are given respectively as:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where the first notion describes perpendicular motion
      around the magnetic field lines, the second notion is azimuthal
      motion around the inner electrode cylinder, and the third notion
      corresponds to the radial motion across the air gap. In these
      expressions, K is the kinetic energy of the electron, and [Omega]
      is the electron gyro frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] If the cyclotron radius is small compared to the air gap
      62, then the motion will be a superposition of these small
      gyrations with a bulk spiral motion whose direction depends on the
      changing electric field. By limiting the otherwise unimpeded
      radial motion of free electrons to that of the polarization drift
      velocity across the field lines, the expectation is that breakdown
      in the air gap 62 can be suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] From Gauss' law, the radial electric field is found as a
      function of radial position and substituted into the polarization
      drift expression to yield<br>

      [0000] giving the ratio of initial to final radial position of the
      electron over a change in the inner conductor charge state. FIG.
      13 shows the variation in charge state of the inner (Qinner) and
      outer (Qouter) conductors over a full cycle, indicating the
      notional regions (regions 1, 2) where significant electron release
      would typically occur as a result of the electric field at the
      conductor surface. Note that the electron emission from the inner
      electrode 52 will have a lower threshold due to a smaller radius
      of curvature and higher electric field. Also indicated by shading
      are the regions where free electrons will drift outward (region A)
      or inward (region B) across the magnetic field lines due to the
      polarization drift.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] While dielectric breakdown would normally initiate as the
      charge magnitude on the inner conductor passes a critical negative
      value (region 2), the polarization drift forces these electrons
      back toward the inner electrode surface (region B).<br>
      <br>
      [0124] It is not until the charge reaches its peak and the
      polarization drift changes direction (region A-right) that the
      charges may start to migrate outward. Migration continues until
      the polarization drift again changes direction (region B) and the
      charges begin to migrate back toward the inner electrode. By the
      time the outer electrode 52 reaches its peak negative value, these
      charges have been returned to the inner electrode 50 where they
      started, and the cycle repeats. The same process occurs for
      electrons emitted from the outer electrode over the other half of
      the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The capacitor size and magnetic field strength are to be
      chosen to ensure that the electrons are turned around prior to
      reaching the opposite electrode. The full change in charge state
      of the capacitor 36, 38 over the time it takes for the electrons
      to cross the gap is 2qmax=2Imax/[omega]. The limiting ratio of
      electrode radii is then found using Eq. 37<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where acm is the inner cylinder 50 radius in centimeters,
      and the other terms are as previously defined. To find the
      capacitor length, a set of concentric cylinders is assumed with an
      impedance matched to that of the coil 12, 16 at resonance.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] This assumes the capacitance of the coil 12, 16 is
      negligible, but it could be included in the calculation at this
      point. Ignoring the coil capacitance results in<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where lcm is the capacitor length in centimeters.
      Substituting Eq. 38 into Eq. 39 then implies<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] showing that the volume of the cylindrical capacitor is
      driven by the choice of maximum current, frequency and magnetic
      field. The most compact geometry is when lcm 2bcm, and the
      capacitor 36, 38 fits within a cube. For the baseline case and
      assuming an applied magnetic flux density of 0.3 Tesla, the volume
      given by Eq. 40 is 216 cm&lt;3&gt;. This results in a capacitor
      length of 12 cm, an outer electrode radius of 6.0 cm and an inner
      electrode radius of 4.6 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Returning to FIG. 2, in order to boost the range of power
      transfer, passive repeaters 70 are envisioned in the subject
      system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The passive repeaters 70 are the intermediate coils which
      resonate in phase with the primary oscillator 12, to receive the
      power therefrom, and in phase with the secondary resonator 16 to
      further transfer power to the secondary oscillator 16.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Attenuation and Environmental Coupling</b><br>
      <br>
      [0129] There are a variety of ways in which the transmitting 12
      and receiving 16 coils can interact with the environment,
      potentially resulting in a shift in the frequency, attenuation of
      the delivered power or reduction of overall efficiency. The degree
      to which each of these would occur is highly specific to the
      properties and distribution of materials within the reach of the
      magnetic field. A general overview of the effects and their
      insertion into the current formalism may be discussed.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The frequency shift results from a change of the effective
      inductance of either of the coils, resulting from the presence of
      a material with magnetic permeability above unity, similar to
      placing an iron core within a solenoid. The larger the volume of
      material present, and the closer it is to the coil, the greater
      the shift in frequency that will result. The effect of the
      presence of the material on the inductance can be estimated as
      follows. The reactive power within the coil is given by
      PR=L[omega]Imax&lt;2&gt;, which can also be written as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0131] In a region with a material that has a permeability greater
      than unity, the ratio of Bmax with the material present to that
      without the material present is (1+[chi]), where [chi] is the
      susceptibility. If the magnetic field is uniform within this
      region, the increase in the effective inductance, normalized by
      the original value is then<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where Bmax is evaluated locally, and [Delta]v is the volume
      occupied by the material. A term such as this can be included for
      each region where magnetic material is present. From Eq. 9, the
      term Imax&lt;2 &gt;will divide out and only geometric dependencies
      will remain. The amount of frequency shift that results is found
      simply by taking the differential of expression for the resonant
      frequency of the coil<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where it can be seen that a positive increase in the
      inductance will result in a drop in the natural frequency of the
      coil. Because the effect on each coil will be different, depending
      on it location in the environment, the simplest solution is to
      compensate for this shift at each coil independently by adjusting
      the capacitance until the proper resonant frequency is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] For any given placement of the coils in a static
      environment, this may be done initially and should not need to be
      altered. However, it would be straightforward to track the
      frequency and dynamically update it to compensate for changes in
      the environment or for the motion of either of the coils through
      the environment. This effect is therefore not thought to be
      problematic from an operational standpoint.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Likewise, attenuation of the signal by the environment is
      of little concern. Unlike electromagnetic radiation, which can be
      very effectively attenuated by the presence of conductors, the
      magnetic field is much more difficult to shield. A particular
      application resulting from this phenomenon is the ability to
      penetrate the depths of the ocean, either for the delivery of
      power, desirable for recharging Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
      (AUVs), or for transferring information by modulating the signal.
      When magnetic field attenuation is desired, it is typically
      necessary to completely enshroud the item to be shielded in a high
      permeability material. The attenuation results from the
      'conduction' of the field lines around, rather than through the
      device that is to be shielded. The amount of attenuation, given as
      the ratio of un-attenuated to attenuated field strength is
      approximately<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [mu] is the permeability of the shielding, [Delta] is
      the thickness of the shielding and R is the characteristic size of
      the shielded region. Effective attenuation without excessive mass
      therefore requires a high permeability material, and the smallest
      possible enclosure volume. In most cases of interest, it is
      unlikely that a situation will naturally exist to produce
      appreciable levels of signal attenuation.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Of greater concern is the possibility of power lost to the
      environment, resulting in a reduction of overall efficiency.
      Sources of such power loss include dipole oscillations in
      paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the dissipation associated
      with eddy currents induced in conducting materials and the
      hysteretic loss resulting from domain reconfiguration in
      ferromagnetic materials. The first of these is treated in a
      similar manner to the dielectric losses of Eq. 31. In fact, under
      the proper definition of the loss tangent, the effect would be
      introduced into the formalism in an identical manner. However, the
      evaluation of this effective loss tangent will depend on the total
      volume and distribution of this material within the dipole field,
      just as with the effect on induction. If at the location of the
      material the magnetic field is again assumed to be spatially
      constant, the reactive power per unit volume at this location is
      given by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] which could also be found by performing the integration of
      Eq. 41 over only the volume of magnetic material. Inserting Eq. 9
      for the magnetic dipole field at the location of the material, and
      dividing by Imax&lt;2 &gt;gives the effective reactance of the
      material (per unit volume) referenced to the recirculating coil
      current. This is then multiplied by the volume of material under
      consideration and inserted into Eq. 31 in place of the product
      L[omega], along with the appropriately defined loss tangent of the
      material for magnetic dipole oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] A similar situation exists for ferromagnetic materials,
      however the dissipation resulting from domain hysteresis is given
      per unit volume as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where HC is the coercivity of the material (where B=0) and
      Brem is the remnant magnetization (where H=0). The product HCBrem
      is referred to as the energy product and represents an
      approximation to the area under the hysteresis loop, provided that
      the material is being fully saturated. Unless the material is very
      close to one of the coils, it is unlikely that this will be the
      case. An approximation for the case when saturation has not been
      reached can be made with<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where a linear scaling with magnetic field strength has
      been assumed along the magnetic flux density axis of the
      hysteresis diagram, as well as along the magnetic field strength
      axis. This is now a function of Imax&lt;2 &gt;as before, and the
      expression Phys/Imax&lt;2 &gt;is then substituted into Eq. 7 as a
      resistance term.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Finally, we consider the case of induced eddy currents in
      conductors that may be present. From a straightforward application
      of Faraday's Law, the power dissipated per unit volume from
      currents induced in a conductor with finite resistance scales
      approximately as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [sigma] is the conductivity of the material, and d is
      the characteristic size of the region perpendicular to the local
      magnetic field direction. Because the loss per unit volume is seen
      to scale with the size of the region, it is important to
      distinguish between a single continuous region of conducting
      material versus a region of comparable size where multiple
      unconnected sub-domains of conducting material may exist. As
      above, this loss can be converted into a resistance, referenced to
      the recirculating current in the coil, and inserted into the
      formalism via Eq. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] For all of the cases except for the attenuation (shift in
      frequency, or the various dissipation mechanisms) the dependence
      of the effect in question on the local magnetic field strength is
      quadratic. For a constant volume of a given magnetic material, Eq.
      9 shows that the impact this material will have on the system
      performance scales with distance to the center of the coil as
      D&lt;-6&gt;, and the impact of these effects rapidly diminishes
      with distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] For instance, if a volume of iron placed one meter from the
      coil was able to shift the frequency by 10%, at two meters the
      effect would be reduced to only 0.16%. Proper placement of the
      coil within the environment can therefore significantly reduce the
      effects that have been discussed. Alternatively, the coupling
      between the coils has the same D&lt;-6 &gt;scaling. So, as a
      fraction of the power coupled, the effect of these materials is
      scale invariant. In other words, a material placed halfway between
      two coils that dissipated 10% of the total coupled power, would
      still dissipate 10% of the total coupled power if the separation
      distance between the coils was increased by a factor of ten. Under
      this increase in distance, both of these power values would be
      decreased by 10&lt;-6&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Development of the low-loss antenna circuit is presented
      herein to allow for inductive power coupling at high efficiency
      over long distances (over 100 meters). To achieve low loss,
      superconducting materials are used for all current carrying
      elements, dielectrics are avoided and the system is operated at
      low frequencies (below 200 KHz), and at wavelengths that exceed
      the antenna diameter by several orders of magnitude. Maximum power
      coupling and maximum efficiency cannot be achieved simultaneously,
      however efficiencies as high as 50% have been achieved with the
      present system at maximum power coupling.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Further reduction in the radiative losses may be achieved
      by adding an external capacitance in which no dielectric is used.
      To address this, electrical breakdown of a cylindrical capacitor
      is suppressed by the application of a magnetic cross-field that
      acts to impede the motion of electrons across the air gap. The
      resulting capacitor size is very reasonable in comparison to the
      baseline size of the coil. The interaction of the system with the
      environment is quite weak, however mechanisms for power
      dissipation, attenuation and modification of the natural frequency
      are identified and examined parametrically.<br>
