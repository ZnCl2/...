          cleaner diesel blend</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>29 November 2016</b><br>
      <br>
      Old tyres can be completely recycled into lower emission diesel
      engine oil, instead of being dumped in dangerous, highly flammable
      stockpiles that become breeding grounds for malaria and
      dengue-carrying mosquitoes.<br>
      <br>
      QUT mechanical engineers tested the oil extracted from old tyres
      in a process developed by Australian company Green Distillation
      Technologies (GDT).<br>
      <br>
      QUT’s Professor Richard Brown and PhD student Farhad Hossain
      tested the oil’s emissions and output at QUT's Biofuel Engine
      Research Facility.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Brown said that when the oil was blended with diesel it
      was found to produce a fuel with reduced emissions and no loss of
      engine performance.<br>
      <br>
      “Globally, 1.5 billion tonnes of tyres are discarded each year.
      Australia, alone, will generate 55 million disused tyres a year by
      2020," Professor Brown said.<br>
      <br>
      “Getting rid of old tyres in an environment-friendly way is a
      universal nightmare.<br>
      <br>
      “Stockpiles of used tyres around the world are a health hazard, as
      demonstrated by the recent Broadmeadows fire in Victoria, which
      was difficult to put out and generated huge amounts of toxic
      smoke.”<br>
      <br>
      Mr Farhad said the QUT engineering team, including process
      engineer Dr Tom Rainey and air-quality expert Professor Zoran
      Ristovski, performed rigorous tests on the oil.<br>
      <br>
      “We tested the oil which GDT produces from both recycled natural
      and synthetic rubber tyres in 10 per cent and 20 per cent diesel
      blends,” Mr Farhad said.<br>
      <br>
      “We tested the tyre oil blends in a turbocharged, common rail,
      direct injection, six-cylinder engine in the Biofuel Engine
      Research Facility at QUT.<br>
      <br>
      “The engine is typical of engine types used in the transport
      industry.<br>
      <br>
      “Our experiments were performed with a constant speed and four
      different engine loads of 25, 50, 75 and 100 per cent of full
      load.<br>
      <br>
      “We found a 30 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxide which
      contributes to photochemical smog, and lower particle mass which
      means fewer problems for emission treatment systems.”<br>
      <br>
      GDT chief&nbsp; operating officer Trevor Bayley said the oil could
      also be used as a heating fuel or further refined into automotive
      or aviation jet fuel.<br>
      <br>
      “The process recycles end-of-life tyres into oil, carbon and
      steel, leaving nothing wasted and even uses some of the recovered
      oil as the heat source,” Mr Bayley said.<br>
      <br>
      “Carbon is the most common recovered ingredient and the steel rim
      and framework is the third most common ingredient, while the oil
      is the most valuable.<br>
      <br>
      “We are delighted at the findings of the QUT research as it will
      help us promote the sustainable use for end-of-life&nbsp; tyres.<br>
      <br>
      “The potential of this source of biofuel feedstock is immense, and
      it is more sustainable than other bio-oils from plants such as
      corn, or algae.<br>
      <br>
      “A recycled 10kg car tyre yields 4 litres of oil, 1.5kg of steel
      and 4 kg of carbon,, and a 70kg truck tyre provides 28 litres of
      oil, 11kg of steel and 28kg of carbon.<br>
      <br>
      “GDT plans to have the first fully operational commercial plant
      delivering eight million litres of oil a year from mid-2017,
      followed by a world-first mining tyre processing plant in either
      Qld or WA.”<br>
      <br>

          First</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Green Distillation Technologies has achieved an Australian world
      technological breakthrough by effectively and profitably recycling
      end of life car and truck tyres (ELTs) into saleable commodities
      of oil, carbon and steel.<br>
      <br>
      End of life car and truck tyres are a blight on the environment
      ever since they were invented over a century ago, because until
      now no means had been found to effectively and economically
      recycle them.<br>
      <br>
      Grinding up old tyres to make crumbs or flakes is not a means of
      recycling tyres as the rubber has not been changed and there is a
      limit to how much of this material can be used for kindergarten
      playgrounds and soccer fields and using it as a furnace fuel in
      Asia creates noxious greenhouse damaging emissions.<br>
      <br>
      As well as the environmental problem caused by dumps of old tyres
      or illegally discarding them in bushland and waterways, after rain
      they become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and a source of such
      dangerous diseases as Dengue and Ross River Fever.<br>
      <br>
      However, using a technique known as destructive distillation,
      Green Distillation Technologies is able to convert this wasted
      resource and an environmental hazard into high demand valuable raw
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      The process is emission free and the recycled oil is used as the
      heat source for the production process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The GDT Tyre Recycling Process – How It Works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Destructive Distillation is the name GDT gives to their tyre
      recycling process which is developed from basic chemistry, the
      genius of Technical Director Denis Randall and his thirty five
      years of study and experimentation into organic waste streams. As
      a result GDT has developed the knowledge of getting the chemical
      reaction to occur.<br>
      <br>
      The process begins by loading whole end of life tyres into a
      process chamber, which is evacuated of air and sealed. In the
      initial steps no further processing of the tyres, such as chopping
      or crumbing is required.<br>
      <br>
      Heat is applied, which acts as a catalyst for the chemical
      reaction, which sees the tyre destructed into different compounds,
      one of which is collected and condensed into ‘manufactured’ oil.
      At the end of the process and the chemical reaction is over, the
      carbon and steel can be extracted cooled and separated.<br>

          to go ahead</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Green Distillation Technologies, the Australian company that has
      proposed building the $8.5 million plant to process end of life
      car and truck tyres at Longford, Tasmania is still determined to
      proceed despite encountering delays in securing Government
      approvals.<br>
      <br>
      GDT’s Australian developed technology is a world first and
      recycles end of life car and truck tyres into oil, carbon and the
      steel reinforcing with a typical end of life 10 kg car tyre
      yielding 4kg of carbon, 1.5kg of steel and 4 litres of oil, while
      a 70kg truck tyre provides 28 kg of carbon, 11 kg of steel and 28
      litres of oil.<br>
      <br>
      GDT Chief Operating Officer Trevor Bayley who was in Tasmania last
      week for meetings with the Government and Northern Midlands
      Council said that they had applied for Development Approval for
      the plant, but still had to secure an OK from the Environmental
      Protection Authority.<br>
      <br>
      “From my discussions, I believe that the Government is aware that
      they have a responsibility to fix the problem of tyre recycling in
      Tasmania and that the first step should be to put it on a sound
      financial footing.<br>
      <br>
      “Clearly the Longford site, where there is an estimated 900,000
      tyres waiting for processing is a priority, although of course
      this stockpile is being added to by the 480,000 to 500,000 end of
      life car and truck tyres that Tasmania generates each year. We
      estimate that it will take three years to get rid of the existing
      stockpile.<br>
      <br>
      “The obvious place to start with generating funds to pay for tyre
      recycling is with the fee paid by each motorist when they dispose
      of their old tyres and get a new one fitted. This amount varies
      with different retailers across the State, but could be as high as
      $8 to $9 and of this a fixed amount of $2.50 is paid for
      collection and storage, but not for end of life management” Mr
      Bayley said.<br>
      <br>
      GDT had initially planned to start work on the site in Longford on
      November last year and estimates that it will take six months for
      the plant to become operational from the time they receive
      Government approval to proceed.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Bayley said that their plant in Warren New South Wales is going
      through the commissioning stage after operating as a test facility
      since 2009 and is now producing their first commercial quantities
      of oil, carbon and steel from old car and truck tyres.<br>
      <br>
      “We have been operating the pilot plant in Warren western New
      South Wales since 2009 and the upgrade to full production will see
      it capable of processing 19,000 tonnes, or a mix of 658,000 car
      and truck tyres per year. This represents approximately 3% of the
      24 million end-of-life tyres that are generated in Australia each
      year.<br>
      <br>
      “The reason we have been attracted to Tasmania is entirely due to
      the work of Tim Chugg of Tyrecycle Tasmania who has been to our
      plant at Warren and seen for himself how it works and came away
      enthusiastic to establish a plant in Tasmania.<br>
      <br>
      “By the time Tyrecycle Tasmania’s stockpile has been recycled it
      is anticipated that we will have extended the scope of our
      operations to include mining and agricultural tyres for which
      there is currently no solution.<br>
      <br>
      “Our process is unique as the oil produced from the GDT process
      can be used as a heating fuel, direct into some stationary diesel
      engines or is capable of further refinement into automotive or
      aviation fuels, while the carbon is a high grade product that can
      replace those sourced from fossil fuels and the steel is returned
      directly to tyre manufacturers for reuse.<br>
      <br>
      “The process is not only emission free but the recycled oil is
      used as the heat source for the production process.<br>
      <br>
      “It is the only process available in the world that remanufactures
      the rubber from old tyres into a different energy form as the
      other recycling methods merely change the shape or appearance of
      the rubber into crumbs or chips,” Mr Bayley said.<br>
      <br>
      Tim Chugg of Tyre Recycle Tasmania said that he believed that the
      GDT technology is by far the best option to recycle end of life
      tyres in Tasmania.<br>
      <br>
      “I have been trying to get a viable recycling plant established at
      Longford for sixteen years and I am still committed to work to get
      it operating.<br>
      <br>
      “The delays have been frustrating and I only hope some wise heads
      will prevail to come up with a solution as the stockpile of old
      tyres at Longford just gets larger.<br>
      <br>
      “Tasmanians are very environmentally conscious and I am sure that
      everyone in the State will want to see a solution found for the
      disposal of end-of-life tyres, which are such a major
      environmental problem,” Tim Chugg said.<br>

        <b>Process and system for recovering energy from
          carbon-containing materials</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Inventor: RANDALL DENIS A [AU] &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention provides processes and systems for generating heat
      from a carbon-containing material or converting a
      carbon-containing material to a combustible gaseous fuel,
      comprising (a) pyrolysing the material in a reactor to produce a
      carbon-enriched solid and a first gaseous product, (b) burning at
      least part of the first gaseous product and/or a second gaseous
      product obtained by reacting the carbon-enriched solid with water
      vapour to generate heat, and (c) returning combustion products
      from the burning step to the reactor and/or removing part of the
      first gaseous product and/or the second gaseous product as a
      combustible fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to processes and systems for converting
      carbon-containing materials, in particular waste materials
      containing organic substances, into combustible fuels and thereby
      recovering energy from the carbon-containing materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The disposal of ever-increasing quantities of waste materials is a
      significant challenge in many parts of the world and is becoming a
      more significant problem as the world's population becomes
      increasingly urbanised. Furthermore, the increasing human
      population and increasing levels of affluence are resulting in
      larger quantities of waste materials of various kinds being
      generated. Disposal strategies currently utilised for dealing with
      wastes include landfill, biological degradation by various means,
      combustion, and various chemical treatment processes. However,
      each of these methods suffers from one or more disadvantages. For
      example, existing disposal methods may cause pollution, may be
      energy intensive, or may be wasteful of limited resources such as
      land. Additionally, many waste materials constitute a source of
      useful energy if efficient means of recovery of that energy can be
      devised. For example, waste incineration is an effective way of
      decreasing the bulk of waste material for disposal, but typically
      the heat generated by the incineration is not recovered, and in
      addition the process can lead to the generation of pollutants such
      as nitrogen oxides and dioxins, and the generation of large
      quantities of greenhouse gases. Hence there is a need for improved
      waste treatment or disposal processes which are environmentally
      benign and which result in the recovery of useful energy from the
      wastes.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient
      method for the recovery of useful energy from carbon-containing
      materials, and simultaneously to provide an environmentally
      acceptable way of disposing of waste materials with minimal
      adverse environmental impact.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In a first embodiment of the invention there is provided a process
      for generating heat from a carbon-containing material which
      includes the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      (a) pyrolysing said material in a pyrolysis zone of a reactor at
      an elevated temperature to produce a carbon-enriched solid and a
      combustible gaseous product;<br>
      (b) burning a first part of said combustible gaseous product to
      produce a first gaseous combustion product and to heat said
      pyrolysis zone so as to maintain said elevated temperature;<br>
      (c) removing a second part of said combustible gaseous product
      from said reactor;<br>
      (d) burning said second part of said combustible gaseous product
      to generate heat and produce second gaseous combustion products;
      and<br>
      (c) returning said first and second gaseous combustion products to
      said pyrolysis zone.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the process of the first embodiment provides a process
      whereby useful energy may be recovered from a carbon-containing
      material, but which produces substantially no gaseous emissions,
      since substantially all of the gaseous products produced in tile
      process are returned to the process after they have been burned.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the process of the first embodiment of the
      invention, the carbon-enriched solid may be contacted with steam
      at a temperature at which the water gas reaction occurs, so as to
      produce therefrom a mixture containing hydrogen and carbon
      monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in a second embodiment of the invention there is provided a
      process for generating heat from a carbon-containing material
      Which includes the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      (a) pyrolysing said material in a pyrolysis zone at a first
      elevated temperature to produce a carbon-enriched solid and a
      first combustible gaseous product;<br>
      (a') transferring said carbon-enriched solid and said first
      combustible gaseous product to a reaction zone;<br>
      (b) reacting said carbon-enriched solid with water vapour in said
      reaction zone at a second elevated temperature to produce a second
      combustible gaseous product containing hydrogen gas and carbon
      monoxide;<br>
      (c) burning a first part of said second combustible gaseous
      product to produce first gaseous combustion products and to heat
      at least said reaction zone so as to maintain said second elevated
      temperature;<br>
      (d) removing a second part of said second combustible gaseous
      product from said reaction zone;<br>
      (e) burning said second part of said second combustible gaseous
      product to generate heat and second gaseous combustion products;
      and<br>
      (f) returning said first and second gaseous combustion products to
      said pyrolysis zone.<br>
      <br>
      In a further form of the process of the invention, a part of
      combustible gaseous products produced by pyrolysis of the
      carbon-containing material, and/or produced by reaction of water
      vapour with the carbon-enriched solid, are removed from the
      reactor as a combustible gaseous fuel which may be transported if
      desired to a location remote from the reactor and from which
      energy may be recovered by any convenient method.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a third embodiment the invention provides a process for
      converting a carbon-containing material to a combustible gaseous
      fuel which includes the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      (a) pyrolysing said material in a pyrolysis zone at a first
      elevated temperature to produce a carbon-enriched solid and a
      first gaseous product;<br>
      (b) reacting said carbon-enriched solid with water vapour in a
      second reaction zone at a second elevated temperature to produce a
      second gaseous product containing hydrogen gas and carbon
      monoxide;<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In the processes of the invention, the carbon-containing material
      usually contains carbon in chemically bound form, and may contain
      other elements. Usually, the material additionally contains the
      element hydrogen in chemically bound form. It may also contain
      oxygen and/or other elements. The material is typically a waste
      material, but it need not be. Thus, materials for use in the
      process of the invention may also include conventional solid fuels
      such as coal, coke, anthracite, bituminous coal, peat etc, or
      other materials such as timber, paper, cardboard, etc. However,
      advantageously the carbon-containing material is a waste material,
      which may be any organic waste such as sewage; municipal solid
      waste, agricultural products and waste of various kinds including
      wood waste, bagasse, rice hulls, prunings, abattoir waste and
      manure; industrial wastes of various kinds including pulping
      liquor from paper pulp mills, solids and sludges from waste water
      treatment, plastics, coal washing solids, shale, spent solvents,
      oil refinery wastes, contaminated soils, car tyres and so on. The
      composition of the waste is not critical to the process of the
      present invention, nor is its moisture content. However, typically
      the waste will have been processed in a preliminary step to remove
      gross quantities of water, where present, by one or more methods
      which are generally known in the art for that purpose such as
      centrifuging, filtering, skimming, evaporation, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrolysis reaction in the processes of the present invention
      typically occurs at a temperature in the range of about 200[deg.]
      C. to 600[deg.] C. more typically in the range 200[deg.] C. to
      400[deg.] C. Generally, in the processes of the second and third
      embodiments the pyrolysis reaction occurs in the same reactor as
      reaction step (b) but it can occur in a separate reactor. A
      substantially oxygen-free atmosphere is typically generated in the
      pyrolysis zone by conducting the pyrolysis in a closed vessel so
      that any oxygen which the vessel contained initially is consumed
      by reaction with the carbon-containing material, or with elemental
      carbon, at the temperature of the pyrolysis zone. Alternatively
      the pyrolysis reaction zone may be initially purged with an
      oxygen-free gas, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, steam or
      mixtures thereof. For example, in the processes of the second and
      third embodiments a part of the gaseous product generated in
      reaction step (b) may be passed from the reaction zone for step
      (b) into the pyrolysis reaction zone so as to-sweep out oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrolysis reaction results in coking or charring of the
      carbon-containing material to produce a carbon-enriched solid
      material and simultaneously generates low molecular weight organic
      substances which typically vaporise at the temperature of the
      pyrolysis reaction. Water vapour is also typically liberated as
      steam by the pyrolysis process, unless the carbon-containing
      material is dry and the carbon-containing substances present are
      mainly hydrocarbons (for example used car tyres). In the latter
      case, it will be necessary to add steam or water to the reaction
      zone in the processes of the second and third embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrolysis reaction produces a carbon-enriched solid material
      and a vapour phase. Optionally, the vapour phase may be cooled to
      liquefy any condensable materials which it contains before the
      remaining gas, or part of it, is sent either to the reaction zone
      for step (b) (in the processes of the second and third
      embodiments) or for burning (in the process of the first
      embodiment). However usually the vapour phase is directed to its
      destination without cooling and condensation. Alternatively, in
      the processes of the second and third embodiments the vapour phase
      may be taken off from the pyrolysis zone and exploited for its
      energy content in any convenient way. In that case, it will be
      necessary to provide water or steam to the reaction zone.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the process of the third embodiment, at least part
      of the vapour phase from the pyrolysis zone is removed from the
      reactor and a portion of it is burned to generate at least part of
      the heat necessary to maintain the first and/or second elevated
      temperatures. In this form, part or all of the combustion products
      generated by burning the vapour phase removed from the pyrolysis
      zone is provided to the reaction zone to provide at least part of
      the water vapour required for step (b).<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the process of the third embodiment step (c)
      consists of burning a first part of a mixture of the first gaseous
      product and the second gaseous product. Typically, in this form of
      the process the combustion products of step (c) are returned to
      the reactor such that they must pass through the carbon-enriched
      solid in the reaction zone before leaving the reactor. Usually in
      this form of the process of the third embodiment, the first part
      of the mixture of first gaseous product and second gaseous product
      is typically obtained from a gas separation step whereby it is
      relatively enriched in carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide,
      compared to the mixture of first and second gaseous products as a
      whole. Typically, the gas separation step produces a fraction of
      the mixture of the first gaseous product and the second gaseous
      product, which fraction contains substantially all of the carbon
      monoxide and carbon dioxide present in the mixture of first and
      second gaseous products. This fraction which contains
      substantially all of the carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is
      then combusted, and the combustion products are returned to the
      interior of the reactor in such a way that they must pass through
      the reaction zone and contact the carbon-enriched solid in the
      reaction zone before leaving the reactor once again.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, in the processes of the invention, the amount of oxygen
      provided for burning the part or parts of the of the gases which
      are removed from the reactor and combusted, is a stoichiometric or
      sub-stoichiometric amount, so that the combustion products which
      are returned to the reaction zone typically contain substantially
      no oxygen gas.<br>
      <br>
      Condensable products obtainable by cooling the vapour phase
      removed from the pyrolysis zone depend on the nature and
      composition of the carbon-containing material. For example, the
      carbon-containing material may contain essential oils or
      relatively volatile natural oils which may be recovered by cooling
      the vapour phase removed from the pyrolysis zone to a suitable
      temperature. Leaves or other parts of plants containing natural
      oils may thus be used as the carbon-containing material, for
      instance, from which may be recovered at least part of the natural
      oils they contain, such as coconut oil, palm oil, cottonseed oil,
      corn oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, sunflowerseed oil, linseed
      oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In step (b) of the processes of the second and third embodiments
      the carbon-enriched solid from the pyrolysis step is contacted
      with steam in a reaction zone at a second elevated temperature,
      thereby undergoing a water gas reaction to produce a gaseous
      mixture containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Some carbon
      dioxide may be produced in this reaction also. Typically, a
      mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is generated, but it
      will be appreciated that the relative proportions of carbon
      monoxide and carbon dioxide depend on the ratio of steam to carbon
      in the reaction zone, on the temperature of operation and on the
      concentration of oxides of carbon already present. Chemical
      reactions occurring in the reaction zone may be represented
      schematically as follows:<br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="041327880-00010000" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, if any oxygen is present in the reaction zone, the
      following reactions can occur:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="041327880-00020000" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Hence, if sufficient steam is available and carbon monoxide is
      removed from the reaction zone, carbon in the carbon-enriched
      solid tends to be consumed and converted into oxides of carbon.
      Further charring/coking of the carbon-enriched solid may also
      occur in the reaction zone. Advantageously, however, carbon
      monoxide is permitted to accumulate in the reactor by recycling to
      the reactor all combustion products after burning the first and
      second gaseous products, as in the process of the second
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the processes of the invention, gases produced
      in the reactor may be removed from the reactor and at least part
      of the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may be at least
      partially separated from hydrogen by conventional means. In this
      form, the separated carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (which may
      also contain some nitrogen) are typically combusted and the
      combustion products are returned to the interior of the reactor,
      typically the reaction zone.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the water vapour or steam for the reactions in the
      reaction zone is provided by the vapour phase from the pyrolysis
      reaction. However, depending on the water content of the
      carbon-containing material originally, or for other operational
      reasons, it may be necessary or desirable to utilise an external
      source of water or steam for use in step (b).<br>
      <br>
      Where the vapour phase from the pyrolysis zone supplies some or
      all of the water vapour for reactions in the reaction zone, the
      vapour phase from the pyrolysis reaction may be caused to flow
      through the pyrolysis zone and reactor zone in the same direction
      as the carbon-containing material passes through them, or it may
      flow countercurrent to them. Alternatively, as noted above, at
      least part of the vapour phase from the pyrolysis zone in the
      process of the third embodiment, or a part of a mixture of the
      vapour phase from the pyrolysis zone and the gaseous products
      produced in the reaction zone, may be removed from the reactor and
      burned, and the combustion products may then be supplied to the
      reaction zone either co-current or countercurrent to the direction
      of movement of the carbon-containing material. More typically, the
      combustion products are supplied to the reaction zone so that they
      pass through the reaction zone in a direction opposite to the
      direction in which the carbon-containing material moves.<br>
      <br>
      The second elevated temperature is typically a temperature in the
      range of about 200[deg.] and upwards. The temperature is, however,
      usually to the lower end of this range, typically about 315[deg.]
      C. to about 480[deg.] C., for reasons of energy conservation and
      to lower the strength of the ash produced from the
      carbon-containing material by the processes of the invention. High
      ash strengths can lead to difficulties with ash removal from the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Since at least reaction (1) and forward reaction (3) above are
      endothermic, an external source of heating must be provided to the
      reaction zone in order to maintain the reaction. Except when the
      process of the invention is first started up, the heat necessary
      to sustain step (b) in the processes of the second and third
      embodiments is provided by burning a part of the water gas
      generated in step (b) and/or a part of the gaseous product
      generated in the pyrolysis step. More typically, substantially all
      of the gaseous product generated in the pyrolysis step is passed
      to the reaction zone for step (b), and hence the Gaseous product
      containing hydrogen and oxides of carbon generated by step (b) is
      mixed with gaseous products obtained during the pyrolysis step. It
      will be appreciated, however, that low molecular weight organic
      substances generated during the pyrolysis step may undergo further
      reactions under the conditions of the water gas reaction in step
      (b).<br>
      <br>
      In the process of the first embodiment typically about 30% by
      volume of the gaseous materials generated in the pyrolysis zone is
      burnt to provide the heat necessary to maintain the elevated
      temperature in the pyrolysis zone. Similarly, in the in the
      processes of the second and third embodiments typically about 30%
      by volume of the gaseous materials generated in steps (a) and (b)
      is burnt to provide the heat necessary to sustain the reactions in
      step (b). However, it will be appreciated that in all cases the
      quantity of gaseous product required to be combusted for these
      purposes will depend on the carbon content of the
      carbon-containing material used, its water content and other
      components present.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it will be seen that typically approximately
      70% by volume of the gaseous product generated in the processes of
      the invention is available for removal from the reactor and
      constitutes a useful fuel. For example, the gaseous products
      removed from the reactor may be burnt in a high pressure boiler so
      as to raise steam for the generation of electricity, or for any
      other conventional purpose.<br>
      <br>
      The portion of the gaseous product which is burnt to maintain the
      temperature(s) in the reactor may be combusted in air, and the
      resulting heat applied externally to the reactor. More usually,
      however, the combustion gases are returned to the interior of the
      reactor, though they may also be passed through a heating jacket
      external to the reactor before being directed to the interior of
      the reactor. In the processes of the second and third embodiments
      this may provide a further source of water vapour for reaction
      step (b). Where the combustion gases are returned to the reactor,
      in order to avoid build up of nitrogen in the process, it is more
      typical to utilise pure oxygen, rather than air, for the
      combustion step. Advantageously, where the gaseous product removed
      from the process of the invention is combusted for the purpose of
      generating electricity, some of that electricity may be used for
      the electrolysis of water to generate oxygen for use in the
      combustion of the gaseous product(s) of the process. In one form
      of the process of the third embodiment, a further portion of the
      first and/or second gaseous product is combusted to provide the
      heat necessary to sustain the first elevated temperature for the
      pyrolysis step, step (a).<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the processes of the invention, flue gases may be
      supplied to the pyrolysis zone or the reaction zone, or both, for
      remediation. The flue gas may derive, for example, from combustion
      of a fossil fuel such as coal, coke, fuel oil or natural gas in a
      boiler. Especially when the fossil fuel is coal, coke or fuel oil,
      the flue gas typically contains carbon-containing particulates,
      which can be removed by passage of the flue gas through a process
      in accordance with the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In the process of the first embodiment, the combustible gaseous
      product is burnt to generate heat and combustion products.
      Similarly, in the process of the second embodiment the part of the
      second combustible gaseous product which is not burnt to provide
      the heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the pyrolysis
      zone and/or the reaction zone is burnt to generate heat and
      combustion products. The heat generated from these steps may be
      recovered and utilised in any desired manner, but typically it is
      utilised to raise steam for electricity generation. The combustion
      products are returned to the pyrolysis zone in these embodiments
      of the invention. The combustible gaseous products may be burnt in
      air, whereupon a bleed of vapour from the system will be necessary
      to avoid buildup of nitrogen. However, more typically the gaseous
      fuel is burnt using pure oxygen. In that case, no buildup of gases
      occurs in the system, and no gaseous effluent is produced.<br>
      <br>
      When flue gas is supplied to the process of the second embodiment,
      similarly, a bleed of gases will be required to prevent buildup of
      nitrogen. Typically this will occur by removal of a part of the
      combustion product produced in step (e), which, apart from water
      vapour and possibly nitrogen, contains carbon dioxide which may be
      recovered for commercial use by standard methods.<br>
      <br>
      Buildup of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the system during
      continuous operation of the process of the first or second
      embodiments, and in continuous operation of the process of the
      third embodiment when carbon oxides arc returned to the interior
      of the reactor, if there is no bleed of gases from the system,
      tends to be inhibited by reaction (3) represented above, which is
      driven to the left by a tendency of carbon monoxide to accumulate,
      and to the right by a tendency of carbon dioxide to accumulate.
      Thus, under steady continuous operation conditions the carbon
      monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations reach steady levels
      (given a constant rate of feeding carbon in the carbon-containing
      material) and substantially all of the carbon which enters the
      reactor leaves it as elemental carbon (soot) which is removed from
      the reactor with ash from the carbon-containing material. It will
      be appreciated that under these conditions the carbon-containing
      material must contain at least hydrogen (in chemically bound form)
      in addition to carbon, and the energy recovered from the process
      derives substantially from the hydrogen which is present in the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that once the process of the invention has
      been initiated, it may be operated so as to be essentially
      self-sustaining by feeding to the reactor continuously or
      batch-wise additional carbon-containing material and periodically
      removing from the reactor ash or other inert materials. Carbon may
      also be removed from the reactor with the ash in some embodiments
      of the invention. If necessary, the carbon content of the
      carbon-containing material may be adjusted by blending different
      materials of different carbon contents so as to maintain a
      substantially constant supply of carbon to the reactor. Typically,
      the carbon content of the carbon-containing material is at least
      about 6% by weight, based on the total weight of the carbon
      containing material, and the moisture content is typically not
      more than about 94% by weight on the same basis, in order for the
      process of the invention to be self-sustaining.<br>
      <br>
      When the combustible gaseous product produced by the process of
      the invention is burnt to raise steam (and especially when it is
      burnt in oxygen rather than air), the combustion gases may be
      recycled to the reactor in the pyrolysis zone and/or the reaction
      zone. This results in an essentially closed gas circulation system
      from which essentially no gaseous effluent is produced.<br>
      <br>
      At start up, an external source of heat is required in order to
      elevate the pyrolysis zone to the elevated temperature of the
      pyrolysis reaction, and to elevate the reaction zone, when
      present, to the second elevated temperature. Such an external
      source of heat may be any convenient source, but is typically a
      combustible gas or oil.<br>
      <br>
      A reactor vessel for use with a process of the present invention
      may conveniently be a twin-bell reactor of the type typically used
      in blast furnaces. This type of reactor includes two chambers, one
      above the other, the upper of which is a hopper for holding a
      quantity of carbon-containing material, and the other chamber is a
      reactor chamber. The hopper is separated from the reactor by a
      relatively narrow neck which is capable of being closed by a
      bell-shaped valve. Similarly, the hopper is closeable at its upper
      end by a similar bell-shaped valve. In operation, the hopper
      compartment is charged with the lower bell valve in the closed
      position and the upper one in the open position, whereafter the
      upper bell is closed and the lower one opened so as to cause the
      hopper contents to discharge into the reactor. The lower bell is
      then closed while the reactions proceed. In this way, charging of
      the reactor may be completed without substantial interruption to
      the reactions taking place and without the admission of unlimited
      quantities of air. The hopper vessel may be purged of air before
      it is discharged into the reactor, if so desired. Typically,
      purging of air is achieved using steam or carbon dioxide, more
      usually steam. The reactor vessel may conveniently be provided
      with a suitable bottom valve for removal of ash periodically.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated, however, that other reactor designs may be
      employed in the processes of the present invention. Alternative
      reactor designs for carrying out processes in accordance with the
      invention will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in
      the art, given the teaching herein.<br>
      <br>
      Conveniently, any unconverted organic materials present in the ash
      discharged from the reactor may be separated by discharging the
      ash into water, whereby organic-containing materials tend to float
      and may be skimmed off and returned to the reactor. Typically, at
      least a part of the ash removed from the reactor is returned to
      the pyrolysis zone for mixing with the carbon-containing material,
      to increase the porosity of the solid materials in die pyrolysis
      zone and/or the reaction zone.<br>

      <b>Best Method and Other Methods for Carrying Out the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a system for recovery of
      energy from carbon-containing materials utilising a process in
      accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention.
      Referring to FIG. 1, the system includes reactor 100 which is
      charged with carbon-containing materials 105 in an upper part of
      the reactor. Below carbon-containing materials 105 is pyrolysis
      zone 110 in which carbon-containing materials 105 are converted to
      carbon-enriched materials. Beneath pyrolysis zone 110 is reaction
      zone 120 in which the carbon-enriched materials react with water
      vapour to produce hydrogen and oxides of carbon. Zone 130 is an
      ash zone, from which ash may be removed into ash receiver 135. Gas
      offtake 133 is provided to reactor 100, for transferring gases
      from reactor 100 to boiler 140 for recovery of heat contained in
      the gases, and thence to gas cooler 150 via air/oxygen preheater
      145. Gas cooler 150 is connected to gas storage vessel(s) 160,
      which is equipped with water off-take 165. The gas outlet of
      preheater 145 is also connected to burners 170, 171.<br>
      <br>
      In use, reactor 100 is charged with carbon-containing materials
      105 near its top which pass through pyrolysis zone 110 and
      reaction zone 120 into ash zone 130 prior to removal from the
      reactor 100 into ash receptacle 135. That is, as ash is removed
      from reactor 100, successive charges of carbon-containing material
      105 move down reactor 100 through zones 110, 120 and 130. Gaseous
      products 115 of pyrolysis move downwards through reactor 100 into
      reaction zone 120 where carbon present in carbon-enriched material
      produced in pyrolysis zone 110 reacts with water vapour generated
      in that zone or introduced into it, to produce a gaseous product
      125 enriched in hydrogen and oxides of carbon which passes out of
      reactor 100 through gas collection port 133. Waste heat present in
      gaseous product 125 is recovered in boiler 140 from which the
      gaseous stream passes into preheater 145, gas cooler ISO and then
      into gas storage vessel 160. In preheater 145, oxygen or air are
      preheated before being fed to burners 170, 171. A portion of gas
      exiting preheater 145 is passed to burners 170, 171 where the gas
      is combusted and the generated heat and combustion products are
      directed to pyrolysis zone 110 and reaction zone 120 of reactor
      100 so as to sustain the desired temperatures in those zones. In
      gas cooler 150, water and other condensables 155 are removed from
      the gaseous stream exiting preheater 145. Organic condensables may
      be separated from water in stream 155 and returned to reactor 100.
      Gas from gas storage vessel 160 typically predominantly contains
      carbon monoxide, hydrogen and gaseous organics, and may be removed
      from storage vessel(s) 160 for combustion and energy, recovery.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a system for recovery of
      energy from carbon-containing materials utilising a process in
      accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention.
      The system illustrated in FIG. 2 includes all of the components of
      the system illustrated in FIG. 1 and additionally includes which
      pressure boiler 180 connected to gas storage vessel(s) 160 and
      provided with preheated air or oxygen 146 from preheater 145.
      Exhaust line 185 from high pressure boiler is connected to reactor
      100 and is equipped with valve 188, and is also connected via line
      187 to gas cooler 190. Line 187 is equipped with valve 189. Gas
      cooler 190 is connected to carbon dioxide storage 195.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the system illustrated in FIG. 2 is operated in the same
      way as the system illustrated in FIG. 1, as described above,
      except that gas stored in gas storage vessel(s) is not removed for
      combustion but is sent to high pressure boiler 180 for combustion.
      Exhaust from boiler 180 typically contains predominantly carbon
      dioxide and water vapour and is normally returned via line 185 to
      reactor 100. That is, normally valve 188 is open and valve 189 is
      closed. If it is desired to remove carbon dioxide from the system,
      valve 188 may be closed and valve 189 opened, to direct exhaust
      from boiler 180 to as cooler 190 and thence to carbon dioxide
      storage 195.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a diagram of a suitable reactor for carrying out a
      process in accordance with the invention. As seen in FIG. 3,
      reactor 200 includes hopper 210 and reaction chamber 220 below
      hopper 210. Hopper 210 and reaction chamber 220 are separated by
      neck region 215 which is closeable by first bell valve 240. Second
      bell valve 230 permits the upper end of hopper 210 to be closed to
      the atmosphere. Above second bell valve 230 is charging port 250
      for charging solid materials into hopper 210. Hopper 210 is
      equipped with steam inlet 212 and steam outlet 216, which are
      fitted with isolation valves 213, 217 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction chamber 220 is surrounded in its upper portion by firebox
      285 equipped with vents 288 for admission of combustion gases from
      firebox 285 into reaction chamber 220. Reaction chamber 220 is
      also equipped with ash removal valve 275, gas offtake manifold 293
      and gas supply manifold 290 which is connected via gas return 295
      to an upper portion of reaction chamber 220.<br>
      <br>
      During continuous operation of reactor 200, first bell valve 240
      is normally in the closed position and second hell valve 230 is
      moved to the open position for charging carbon-containing material
      245 into hopper 210 through charging port 250. When this charging
      step has been completed, second bell valve 230 is moved to the
      closed position and steam is passed through hopper 210 from steam
      inlet 212 to steam outlet 216 by opening valves 213, 216, for a
      time sufficient to purge substantially all of the air from hopper
      210. Valves 213, 216 are then closed and first bell valve 240 is
      opened to permit carbon-containing material 245 to fall into
      reaction chamber 220. Materials in reaction chamber 220 occupy a
      pyrolysis zone 250 above reaction zone 260 and ash zone 270. In
      pyrolysis zone 250 coking or charring of carbon-containing
      material 245 occurs at the elevated temperature maintained in
      pyrolysis zone 250 owing to heating of reaction chamber 220 from
      firebox 285. As additional carbon-containing material 245 is
      charged into reaction chamber 220 and ash is removed from ash zone
      270, material is pyrolysis zone 250 progresses through reactor
      into reaction zone 260. In reaction zone 260, carbon-enriched
      material from carbon-containing material 245 reacts with steam
      generated in pyrolysis zone 250 or present in gases introduced
      into reaction chamber 220 (for example from firebox 285 via vents
      288 or through gas return 295) and produces hydrogen and mixed
      oxides of carbon. These gases are removed into gas off take
      manifold 293. Some gases in gas off-take manifold 293 are returned
      to firebox 285 (connection not shown) or returned to gas supply
      manifold 290 and thence via gas return 295 to reaction chamber
      220. However, the majority of gases are taken off for combustion
      and recovery of useful energy therefrom. With further charges of
      carbon-containing material into reaction chamber 220 and
      progressive removal of ash 270 via ash removal valve 275, material
      in reaction zone 260 eventually reaches ash zone 270 and is
      ultimately removed from reactor 200.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a schematic representation of an alternative system for
      recovery of energy from carbon-containing materials utilising a
      process in accordance with the third embodiment of the present
      invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the system includes reactor 300
      which is charged with carbon-containing materials 305 in an tipper
      part of reactor 300. Below carbon-containing materials 305 is
      pyrolysis zone 310 in which carbon-containing materials 305 are
      converted to carbon-enriched materials. Beneath pyrolysis zone 310
      is reaction zone 320 in which the carbon-enriched materials react
      with water vapour to produce hydrogen and oxides of carbon. Zone
      330 is an ash zone, from which ash may be removed into ash
      receiver 335.<br>
      <br>
      Gas offtake 333 is provided to reactor 300, for removing gases
      from reactor 300. Pipe 338 connects gas offtake 333 to gas
      scrubber system 340 in which reactor gases may be separated from
      condensables. Gas scrubber system 340 is equipped with
      condensables offtake 345 and pipe 346 which connects gas scrubber
      system 340 to gas separation system 350 and conveys gases from gas
      scrubber system 340 to gas separation system 350.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the heat content of gas removed from reactor 300 by
      gas offtake 333 may be utilised before the gases reach gas
      scrubber system 340. For example, gases in pipe 338 may be passed
      though a heat exchanger (not shown) for recovery of useful heat
      energy, or the gases may be used to heat the pyrolysis zone and/or
      reactor zone of another reactor similar to reactor 300 (also not
      shown) being operated at the same time as reactor 300 for recovery
      of energy from other carbon-containing materials.<br>
      <br>
      Gas separation system 350 is typically a gas decant system but may
      include any suitable means for separating hydrogen, at least
      partially, from other gases present, predominantly oxides of
      carbon, and nitrogen. Thus, gas separation system 350 is connected
      to two gas storage units 351, 352 to permit gases separated in
      separation unit 350 to be passed to, and stored in, storage units
      351 and 352 for hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-depleted gases
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Gas storage unit 352 is connected to furnace 360. A supply of air
      and/or oxygen is also connected to furnace 360 (not shown).
      Exhaust from furnace 360 is connected via line 365 to heater
      jacket 370 which is provided to reactor 300. Line 365 is also
      equipped with valve 368, an outlet of which is connected to
      exhaust 369, which is open to the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Gases leave heater jacket 370 and are led to the interior of
      reactor 300 via pipes 375, 375a. Pipes 375, 375a may be equipped
      with an exhaust vent to atmosphere (exhaust vent not shown) which
      is normally closed by means of a valve but which may be opened if
      necessary to release pressure or divert combustion gases exiting
      furnace 360 away from reactor 300 if desired.<br>
      <br>
      Reactor 300 is equipped internally with a plurality (typically 4)
      of downcorners 385 (two shown in FIG. 6) which extend from above
      pyrolysis zone 310 to below reaction zone 320, and with a
      plurality (typically 8) of risers 386 (two shown in FIG. 6) which
      extend only part of the depth of reactor 300 and typically end in
      or above reaction zone 320. Risers 386 are connected at their
      upper end via manifold 380 to gas offtake 333. Alternatively;
      pipes similar to 375, 375a may lead from heater jacket 370 into
      ash zone 330 of reactor directly, instead of into zone 305 as
      shown. In that case (which is not shown in FIG. 6) downcorners 385
      are omitted.<br>
      <br>
      Gas storage unit 351 is connected to boiler 390 which is equipped
      with exhaust vent 398, and steam line 396 which leads to
      electricity generation system 395.<br>
      <br>
      In use, reactor 300 is charged with carbon-containing materials
      305 near its top, which pass through pyrolysis zone 310 and
      reaction zone 320 into ash zone 330 prior to removal from the
      reactor 300 into ash receptacle 335. That is, as ash is removed
      from reactor 300, successive charges of carbon-containing material
      305 move down reactor 300 through zones 310, 320 and 330.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon-containing materials 305 are pyrolysed predominantly in
      pyrolysis zone 310 with the generation of carbon-enriched solids
      and gaseous pyrolysis products. Also introduced into reactor 300
      are combustion gases produced in furnace 360 and passed into
      reactor 300 via heater jacket 370 and pipes 375, 375a. These
      combustion gases mix in zone 305 with gaseous pyrolysis products
      produced in pyrolysis zone 310 and the mixture passes through
      downcorners 386 and up through reaction zone 320 before entering
      risers 386 and leaving reactor 300 via manifold 380 and gas
      offtake 333. In reaction zone 320, water vapour generated
      predominantly in pyrolysis zone 310, and carbon dioxide, react
      with carbon-enriched material in reaction zone 320 to produce
      gaseous products enriched in hydrogen and carbon monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      From gas offtake 333, the mixed gases pass via pipe 338 to gas
      scrubber system 340. Gas scrubber system 340 may comprise any
      suitable means for separating gases from condensable substances,
      such as oils volatilised from carbon-containing materials 305 in
      pyrolysis zone 310. For example, gas scrubber system 340 may
      comprise a water scrubber for separating gases from less volatile
      substances, equipped with a decanter for separating oils from
      water. Reactor gases separated in gas scrubber system 340 are
      transferred via pipe 346 to gas separation system 350, in which
      hydrogen is at least partially separated from other gaseous
      products.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, two gaseous streams exit gas separation system 350. A first
      stream which is relatively hydrogen-rich, passes to storage unit
      351 and the seemed stream passes to storage unit 352 prior to
      being passed to furnace 360 where it is burned in air or oxygen.
      The combustion product gases are conducted through line 365 to
      heater jacket 370 of reactor 300, for heating pyrolysis zone 310
      and/or reaction zone 320 of reactor 300, and hence via pipes 375,
      375a to the interior of reactor 300 as described above.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, valve 368 may be partially opened or completely opened
      temporarily to divert combustion gases 365 partially or completely
      to exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      The gases in gas storage unit 351 are utilised as combustible fuel
      for recovery of energy, by generating electricity. Thus, gas from
      gas storage unit 351 is burned in boiler 390 to raise steam which
      is passed via steam line 396 to electricity generation system 395.
      Electricity generation system 395 typically includes a turbine and
      generator of conventional design.<br>
      <br>
      At startup of the system, if no or insufficient gas is stored in
      gas storage unit 352, an alternative combustion fuel is supplied
      to furnace 360. This alternative fuel may be fuel oil, natural gas
      or similar, or may conveniently include oils removed from gas
      scrubber system 340 via condensable offtake 345 during a previous
      operation of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Since the processes of the first and second embodiments of the
      invention may be operated as essentially a closed system, or at
      least one in which the quantity of gaseous effluent is
      substantially decreased compared to processes which rely on total
      combustion of organic materials in waste, they are processes with
      little or no adverse impact on the environment. Although a process
      in accordance with the third embodiment of the invention may
      release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, it provides a process
      whereby useful energy can be recovered from waste materials with a
      net reduction in the volume and other problems associated with
      disposal of the waste. However, as noted above, the process of the
      third embodiment may be operated essentially as a closed system
      with regard to oxides of carbon, so that any carbon introduced
      into the reactor in the waste material or other carbon-containing
      material, leaves the system not as carbon dioxide, but as
      elemental carbon. Other major byproducts of the process are water
      and ash, which may be utilised as a soil substitute or soil
      conditioner. The other major by-product of the process, namely
      water, is in increasingly short supply in many parts of the world,
      and the process of the invention provides a new source of water
      which may be used, for instance, for irrigation or in domestic
      water supply (after appropriate treatment).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following is a description of laboratory scale trials of a
      process in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <b><br>
        Apparatus</b><br>
      <br>
      The reactor was constructed as in FIG. 4 with schedule 40 pipe and
      8 mm plate. In FIG. 4. FIG. 4A is a vertical cross-sectional view
      of die reactor, FIG. 4B is a plan view of the reactor, and FIG. 4C
      is a diagrammatic representation of the relative position of gas
      offtake points from the reactor. Legs, bracing and footings were
      constructed from 3*3*0.25-inch (75*75*6.4 mm) angle section. All
      flanges and blanks were ANSI 300 lb (2070 kPa) fittings. The lid
      to the reactor, a 24'' (600 mm) flange &amp; blank (ANSI-300 lb
      (2070 kPa)) was fitted with pressure relief valve set at 100 psi
      (689 kPa) and pressure gauge. It was also fitted with a 2.5'' (64
      mm) flanged stub and ball valve to allow access of a steel,
      graduated dipstick.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in FIGS. 4 and 5, the reactor consists of a firebox 400
      surrounding the upper part of the reactor body 450 which consists
      of an annular space 410 defined in part by the firebox 400 and by
      central downcorner 420. Firebox 400 opens into the reactor body
      450 through openings 405, just above the top of downcorner 420.
      The overall height of the reactor, not including its legs, is 3.9
      m. Downcorner 420 has a diameter of 0.6 m and annular space 410
      has a thickness of 0.3 m. Firebox 400 has a height of 2.0 m and an
      outside diameter of 1.2 m, the upper end of firebox 400 being 3.15
      m above the lower end of downcorner 420. Downcorner has length 3.0
      m and opens at its lower end just above a 0.4 m deep tapered end
      of reactor body 450. At a height of 1.5 m above its lower end,
      reactor body 450 is equipped with gas outlets 430.<br>
      <br>
      Four gas ring burners were installed at 90-degree rotation
      intervals at the 0.25 m elevation from the bottom of the firebox
      and with the tip of the flame impinging on the heating surface of
      reactor body 450. Four more gas ring burners were placed at 45
      degree rotation from the first set and again 90 degrees rotation
      between the burners at the 1.25 m elevation. Each burner ring was
      individually equipped with an isolation valve. 0.5'' (12 mm)
      sockets at 4 locations served as inlets for compressed air.<br>
      <br>
      The complete outside surface of the apparatus was insulated with
      asbestos cement fibre and coated with phenolic resin. The internal
      surface of the external walls of the firebox was coated with
      vermiculite refractory paste.<br>
      <br>
      This design results in a 12'' (300 mm) thick annular space to be
      charged with waste and heated by the flame on one side and hot
      exhaust and volatile gases on the other.<br>
      <br>
      The combustion gases pass from the firebox 400 into the reaction
      chamber through 6'' (150 mm) holes 405 and mix with volatile gases
      generated by heating carbon-containing material in annular space
      410, and the gases pass down the downcorner 420. These gases then
      exit the downcorner 420 and migrate back up through carbonaceous
      residue in the lower part of annular space 410, to exit to a
      compressor 460 by way of 4*6'' (150 mm) outlets as illustrated
      diagramatically in FIG. 4C, and a manifold fitted with a rupture
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      From the compressor 460, the gas/vapour passes through a
      water-cooled heat exchanger 470 and into one of two parallel piped
      storage vessels 1, 2, as illustrated schematically in FIG. 5. The
      storage vessel design includes a steam trap, fitted with a "goose
      neck" water draw. Further it is fitted with 100-psi (689 kPa)
      pressure gauge, pressure relief valve, gas purge and product
      effluent valves. The effluent valves are joined together by way of
      a manifold and then connected to a second compressor 480 by way of
      a pipe section containing a rupture disc. The second compressor
      480 is then connected to the burner feed manifold. Air compressor
      490 supplies air for combustion to firebox 400.<br>
      <br>
      A bottled LPG manifold 3 set up as the initial heat source is also
      connected to the burner feed manifold.<br>

      between the firebox and the central down comer. On entrance to
      this space the waste is in the coking (pyrolysis) stage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stage I-The Coking Stage</b><br>
      <br>
      The coking stage of the process takes place in the top 2 m of the
      reactor where complex organic compounds are broken down by heating
      them to temperatures above 400[deg.] F. (205[deg.] C.) to produce
      carbon or char, low molecular weight organics (which volatilise),
      water (which is converted to steam) and silica and inorganic ash.
      All except the carbon, silica and inorganic ash exit the reaction
      in the gas phase. The residual solid is coke or char.<br>
      <br>
      The gas and vapours pass down through the centre co-axial pipe
      (the path of least resistance) to exit and migrate back up through
      the coke residue where they take part in the Stage II reactions in
      which water vapour is converted to water gas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stage II-Water Gas Production</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      WATER GAS (or Blue gas) is produced when steam is blown through an
      incandescent bed of Carbon.<br>
      <br>
      The gas production reactions are primarily:<br>
      <br>
      C+H2O=CO+H2<br>
      C+2H2O=CO2+2H2<br>
      <br>
      These reactions occur when the water from the waste (steam) is
      passed back through the residual coke or char in the bottom 1-m of
      the reactor. Both of these reactions are endothermic. Therefore,
      the temperature of the bed of carbon through which the steam is
      blown would he lowered quickly to a point where no reaction would
      occur, if no heat were added to the system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Operation</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Initial Charge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. The system was constructed and assembled as in FIGS. 4 and 5.<br>
      2. The gas extraction and feed lines to the system were
      hydraulically tested.<br>
      3. The reactor was filled with coconut shells (0.6 m&lt;3&gt; )
      and the reactor was sealed.<br>
      4. The system was purged with steam.<br>
      5. The cooling water system was started and valves in the gas
      extraction line to tank 1 were opened.<br>
      6. The LPG gas flow and air compressors were started and the gas
      was ignited.<br>
      7. When the reactor pressure had risen to 60-psi the exhaust
      compressor was started with feed to storage tank 1.<br>
      8. When the reactor pressure fell away gas to the burners was
      stopped.<br>
      9. The dipstick ball valve was opened and the system shut down.<br>
      10. The reactor was dipped. Steps 3 and 5-9 (but not step 4) were
      repeated if the bed depth was below 2 m from the top close valve.<br>
      11. If the bed depth was above 2-m, ash was removed to this level
      by opening the bottom hatch.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods-Testing Procedures</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. Three consecutive charges of 0.4-m&lt;3 &gt; of each of the
      following were sequentially added to the reactor.<br>
      Municipal Garbage<br>
      Rubber tyres<br>
      Wet Bagasse<br>
      Saw Dust<br>
      Oil Sludge<br>
      2. The reactor was filled with the respective charge (0.4
      m&lt;3&gt; ) and the reactor was scaled.<br>
      3. The cooling water system was started and the valves in the gas
      extraction line to tank 1 were opened.<br>
      4. The gas flow was started from the previous gas storage tank and
      the air compressors and the gas was ignited. If no as was
      available the LPG gas valve was opened.<br>
      5. When the reactor pressure reached 60 psi (about 415 kPa), the
      exhaust compressor was opened with feed to the current storage
      tank.<br>
      6. When the reactor pressure fell away the gas to the burners was
      stopped, the dipstick ball valve was opened and the system shut
      down.<br>
      7. The reactor was dipped.<br>
      8. Steps 1-7 were repeated for the next charge.<br>

      The above results indicate that the destruction of rubber tyres
      does not sustain gas production. This is to be expected given the
      carbon content and lack of water. It could be expected that if it
      were mixed with a high water waste it would effect a very good
      yield of water gas.<br>
      <br>
      Given the results of the tyre destruction it was decided to
      continue tyre destruction to assess the gas production. It was
      found that a further 5 charges of tyres was possible before the
      produced gas was exhausted and the system required the supplement
      of LPG.<br>
      <br>
      The above results indicate that there is excess gas production
      from the destruction of most wastes, compared to the quantity of
      gas which is required for the destruction of the waste. In
      particular municipal garbage could be effectively disposed in this
      manner.<br>
