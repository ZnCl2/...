      <p><i>Marseille</i>, 13 September. <i>From the special
          correspondent of “Matin</i>”. </p>
      <p>Currently residing in our town an Italian Engineer has made an
        astounding discovery and that has resolved the problem of
        holding, absolutely immobile, a body in space. </p>
      <p>Professor Louis Rota --- that is his name --- has invented an
        apparatus which triumphs over the law of gravitation and is able
        to hold immobile in the air at a height of five hundred, six
        hundred, indeed 1000 metres, a considerable weight. </p>
      <p>It is possible to move this apparatus at a prodigious velocity
        in any direction and it may be stopped at any point all that, it
        is understood, without a mechanical motor of any sort, simply by
        using Hertzian waves. </p>
      <p>The principle of this invention rests on the special
        partitioning of electrostatic and magnetic forces enabling
        forces of attraction and repulsion sufficient to maintain the
        apparatus suspended , immobile at a variable height of 400 to
        1000 metres for many hours, forty or more. If the wind speed is
        less than 14 Km/second, the apparatus remains at the same point.
        In the case that the wind is stronger, the apparatus can rise
        higher above the wind and remain immobile. </p>
      <p>Experiments have already been made which have already given
        results. The other has been made at Marseille with an apparatus
        in the form of a cigar 4 metres long and 75 cm diameter weighing
        95 kilos. It can lift 45 Kilos and remain 24 hours in the air.
        It moved 200 Kilometres from its point of departure, and could
        go from Marseille to Paris (653 kilometres in a direct line) in
        3 hours and Paris to Turin (585 Kilometres) in two and a quarter
        hours. </p>

      <p>In a previous note I have indicated that metals enclose a
        latent energy which can, with the aid of certain natural forces,
        be awakened and utilized. </p>
      <p>I make it known furthermore, that the attraction of the earth
        is due to the action of a certain natural force which it has
        been possible equally to control and utilize. </p>
      <p>This is the force that keeps in equilibrium the molecules of
        different bodies. Its action along with that of many other
        natural forces assures their cohesion. </p>
      <p>If therefore a metallic mass is treated in a suitable manner
        with the aid of the natural force which we will call “attraction
        of the earth”, it is possible to neutralize the above mentioned
        action which the metallic mass experiences, in such a manner
        that the mass rests in equilibrium in the air. If one applies to
        said mass a force greater than the attraction of the earth in
        the opposite direction, the mass will rise in the air. If by
        means of a special apparatus one diminishes the intensity of
        said force, the mass will descend more or less rapidly. </p>
      <p>Such are the principles which allow the realization of a flying
        device insensible to the action of the earth and also presents
        certain number of other advantages. </p>
      <p>The apparatus is composed essentially of a closed metallic
        capsule containing a motor and passengers. The capsule can have
        any convenient shape, according to the use for which it is
        required. The form does not have to be aerodynamic, this is of
        no importance. This capsule is neutral, that is to say the
        metallic parts of it are not subject to particular treatment. It
        rests on the ground by means of four wheels and has on the lower
        part a type of multi-metallic platform carrying four feet which
        can enter into the ground. The platform is made of metallic
        strips, specially treated. The capsule is equipped, at its lower
        part with a treated multi-metallic block B, which has
        connections to the pilot’s controls which can be made or broken
        as required. Similarly in the upper part of the capsule is
        placed another block B’, which has a different composition to
        the other, but is treated with the same energies. It is
        connected to the pilot’s controls which can be made or broken as
        required. The conjugate action of the platform connected to
        earth and the block B in contact with the capsule cause the
        apparatus to lift-off . This operation is assisted by rolling a
        few metres along the ground. It is slow or rapid depending on
        the choice of the pilot. </p>
      <p>When the apparatus has risen some metres the platform is pulled
        up against the capsule, the contact with the block B is cut and
        remade to block B’. From this moment the apparatus rises
        vertically rapidly or not depending on the pilot balancing the
        action of block B against block B’ because the action of B’
        makes the apparatus rise while that of B brakes the descent as
        well as the speed of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>The capsule can rise or fall, but it still requires a means of
        producing forward motion. This is done by a motor. A petrol
        engine and airscrew as in an ordinary aircraft can be used. In
        this case the aircraft will be weightless but the risk of fire
        is the same as in ordinary aircraft. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless the energy liberated by blocks B and B’ create
        about the apparatus a zone in which the air is rarefied, such
        that the apparatus will not have to act against air resistance.
        It will be equally insensitive to wind or storms so that the
        petrol engine used can be of very much reduced power. </p>
      <p>It is equally possible to utilize a special motor, which is
        without combustion, and does not use known energy. Its principle
        is extremely simple and is applied in the establishment of the
        apparatus which at the Station (at Mt St. Aignan) serves to
        control the currents. </p>
      <p>If in a cylinder of copper treated in a special way and
        enclosing another cylinder of zinc, treated in a special way and
        mounted on the same axis, the latter cylinder will be caused to
        revolve more or less rapidly depending on the depth of
        penetration of one cylinder within the other. The rotation
        movement furthermore will serve to assure the movement of the
        apparatus by means of ……….. [this part is missing from the
        originals text] </p>
      <p>The treatment of the metallic pieces of the motor is renewed in
        proportion to the travel of the apparatus, the speed could be as
        much as 1000Km per hour. </p>

      <p>In principle, the invention has for its object an apparatus in
        which the electric and magnetic forces are distributed under
        conditions that respond to electrical and magnetic forces of the
        atmosphere and the earth and the effect of these reactions
        (repulsions) maintains the unit suspended in the atmosphere or
        ensure the apparatus falls very slowly. </p>
      <p>In the construction of the apparatus, active or active part is
        performed through metal conductors good of electricity such as
        silver, copper, iron soft, and so on. while the other pieces are
        made of wood, aluminum or other lightweight materials. </p>
      <p>Drawings in the annex, gave the apparatus cylindrical shape,
        but it might give any other suitable shape with the purpose of
        the apparatus. </p>
      <p>On this drawing, Fig. 1 shows a elevation of the device with
        parties cutting and Fig. 2 VUW shows a plan of the aircraft cut
        by XX in Fig. 1. </p>
      <p>The body of the apparatus consists of a vertical closed
        cylinder with two funds 1, with bells&nbsp; overhead, each of
        which holds a central rod 2. </p>
      <p>The cylinder, at his height, is divided into three sections 3,
        4, 5, isolated from one another by insulating rings 6, 7, tip to
        follow the ends of Part 4, Parts 3 and 5 being similar and
        arranged symmetrically around the other of Part 4. </p>
      <p>The cylinder is constituted by amounts 8, variable number
        following the magnitude of the device, which support envelopes
        metallic circles 9, 10, 11 constituted by thin sheet metal
        disks. These discs are represented in 12, 13, 14. </p>
      <p>Concentrically in parts 3 and 5 of the central cylinder and
        discs 12 and 14, are metallic envelopes 15, 16 in thin sheets of
        metal maintained by reinforcements 17, 18 linked by 19 to
        central tie rods 2. Led armatures 17, 18 ties and 19 are led by

        are powered by a current source of electricity 20, battery or
        other generators inside the central part 4 of the central
        cylinder. The current could also come by electrical waves on a
        wire. </p>
      <p>The frames 17 and 18 and central pole 2 are external magnetic
        masses 21 forming electro-magnets. </p>
      <p>In operation, the disc 13 will be the seat of a positive field
        and discs 12 and 14 will be the seat of a negative field. </p>
