      <p><i>A Real Cure for Chernobyl?</i> </p>
      <p>Ukrainian mathematician and scientist Anatoly Kinderevich has
        developed a practical way to render nuclear wastes less harmful.
        In a specially constructed chamber, hazardous radionuclides are
        transmuted into less harmful elements. The method could not only
        make Chernobyl safer, but also lead to many other new
        technologies. The scientists and engineers under Kinderevich’s
        leadership have demonstrated successfully controlled accelerated
        decay of strontium, cesium, and Chernobyl samples. </p>
      <p>To date, in various laboratories throughout the world, there
        have been at least ten successful experiments demonstrating
        controlled accelerated decay of radioactive isotopes. All have
        involved high-energy bombardment of nuclei and are prohibitively
        expensive. Kinderevich’s approach could be the first
        economically feasible one. </p>
      <p><i>Field Essence of Nuclear Physics</i> (2005, 340 pp.) is
        rigorously mathematic and completely integrates Kozyrev’s
        time-space flows of structurization and destructurization with
        models of the Coulomb barrier, thereby providing a new
        understanding of relativity and resolving the particle/quantum
        question elegantly. The Kinderevich Field Theory also explains
        gravity clearly and succinctly in relation to electromagnetics.
        The book has recently been translated into English by Randall
        Roffe and Vyacheslav Varetsky, a physicist at the Center of
        Radiation Medicine of the Ukraine Academy of Medical Sciences. <i>Fundamentals









          of Field Physics</i> (2000) and <i>Experimental Gravitonics

        excitation signal is selected according to the frequency of
        structurization or the frequency of destructurization of the
        ferromagnetic material. The process can be monitored and

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates generally to the field of
        applied physics, and deals with the acceleration of processes of
        activity decrease and deactivation of radioactive materials of
        high and low activity levels. More particularly, the present
        invention relates to the treatment of radioactive material such
        as waste from nuclear power plants. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Worldwide development of nuclear power engineering has
        created a problem that is progressively turning into a global
        ecological issue. Namely, this problem relates to the
        accumulation, processing, and storing of radioactive waste
        materials. The United States, France, and Russia process the
        nuclear waste that has accumulated over time. Such processing is
        partial in that only five or six isotopes are returned into the
        new fuel cycle, while other isotopes are no longer suitable for
        utilization. </p>
      <p>[0003] There are approximately 50 actinides accumulated in
        every nuclear reactor at the end of each operating period, and
        20 of the actinides are long-living isotopes that remain highly
        radiotoxic despite long periods of aging. Such nuclear waste is
        typically stored in special containers buried deep below the
        surface of the earth; nevertheless, this storage method can be
        the source of ecological problems and the subject of controversy
        and concern. Existing processing technologies for radioactive
        waste are very expensive, laborious, not environmentally safe,
        and are time consuming. </p>
      <p>[0004] Consequently, there exists a need for new techniques of
        acceleration of the processes of activity decrease and
        deactivation of radioactive material (hereinafter referred to as
        "treatment" of radioactive material). </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0005] The method of activity decrease and deactivation of
        radioactive materials uses a system that includes an apparatus
        for treatment of radioactive material configured to function as
        a large hollow capacitor having a ferromagnetic material in lieu
        of a dielectric material. The system includes a power source,
        such as a signal generator that supplies a suitable AC voltage
        of adjustable frequency to the apparatus. A container with
        radioactive material is placed into the cavity of the apparatus,
        an appropriate frequency is selected for the signal generator,
        and the AC voltage at the selected frequency is applied to the
        apparatus until activity of the radioactive material is
        decreased to the permissible level or until complete
        deactivation has occurred. These processes are monitored with
        alpha, beta, and gamma meters. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] A more complete understanding of the present invention
        may be derived by referring to the detailed description and
        claims when considered in conjunction with the following
        Figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to similar
        elements throughout the Figures. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0011] It should be appreciated that the particular
        implementations shown and described herein are illustrative of
        the invention and its best mode and are not intended to
        otherwise limit the scope of the invention in any way. Indeed,
        for the sake of brevity, conventional aspects of the systems
        (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not
        be described in detail herein. Also, dimensions of components of
        the apparatus of radioactive material treatment, which differ in
        each specific case of application, are not provided. </p>
      <p>[0012] The term "radioactive material" as used herein comprises
        all wastes contaminated with radioactive substances in the
        quantities exceeding the established standards and rules. Solid
        wastes are considered radioactive if specific medical
        exploitation dose at the distance of 1 centimeter from the given
        waste exceeds 0.84 milliroentgen hour per kilogram or specific
        activity exceeds 2.times.10.sup.-6 and 1.times.10.sup.-8 Ci/kg
        (7.times.10.sup.4 and 3.7.times.10.sup.2 Bq/kg), respectively,
        for beta- and alpha-active and transuranium elements. All
        radioactive isotopes, nuclear wastes can be conventionally
        subdivided into highly active, when specific activity amounts to
        10.sup.15-10.sup.14 Bq/kg, medium active, 10.sup.13-10.sup.9
        Bq/kg, low active, 10.sup.8 Bq/kg. </p>
      <p>[0013] FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a system 100 for
        the treatment of radioactive material. System 100 includes at
        least the following components: a treatment apparatus 102
        configured as a hollow capacitor of complicated shape which
        holds a container (capsule) 103 for holding radioactive
        material; an excitation signal generator 104 connected to the
        treatment apparatus 102 with a high frequency cable 105; one or
        more alpha-, beta-, and gamma-activity sensors 106 located in
        the container; and a grounded shielding device 107. The dashed
        line in FIG. 1 indicates that the activity sensor 106 may, but
        need not, be connected to the generator 104 for purposes of
        feedback control. </p>
      <p>[0014] The treatment apparatus 102 is generally configured as a
        special capacitor having an external shell electrode and an
        inner electrode. In lieu of a conventional dielectric material,
        the treatment apparatus 102 utilizes a ferromagnetic material
        located between the two electrodes. The treatment apparatus 102
        includes a cavity formed therein; the cavity receives the
        container (capsule) with radioactive material. The container is
        positioned inside of the cavity during treatment of the
        material. </p>
      <p>[0015] The adjustable generator 104 is connected to the
        electrodes of the capacitor 102, and is used for supplying AC
        voltage of suitable frequency, at which the so-called flows of
        structurization or destructurization are excited in the
        ferromagnetic and focused inside of the apparatus. These flows
        cause deceleration or acceleration of radioactive decay and
        spontaneous radioactive decay in the container. </p>
      <p>[0016] Meters 106, which can be off-the-shelf commercially
        available instruments, are used to measure the intensity of
        alpha-, beta-, and gamma-radiation of the radioactive materials
        in the container. The readings of these detectors are used for
        monitoring of the technological process. </p>
      <p>[0017] FIGS. 2 and 3 are views of sections of an apparatus 200
        for treating radioactive material. FIG. 2 is a longitudinal
        sectional view of apparatus 200, as viewed from line 2-2 in FIG.
        3 (line 2-2 represents a line that intersects the longitudinal
        axis of apparatus 200), and FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of
        apparatus 200, as viewed from line 3-3 in FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a
        cross sectional view of a portion of the apparatus, which shows
        the direction of the excited flows (of structurization or
        destructurization) focusing. </p>
      <p>[0018] Apparatus 200 generally includes an outer shell
        electrode 202, an inner electrode 204, a plurality of
        ferromagnetic prisms 206, a first inner end electrode 208, a
        first outer end electrode 210, a second inner end electrode 212,
        a second outer end electrode 214, a first ferromagnetic end
        element 216, and a second ferromagnetic end element 218. </p>
      <p>[0019] Outer shell electrode 202 may be cylindrical in shape.
        Other shell shapes may be utilized in alternate embodiments,
        e.g., polyhedron, spherical, or the like, as long as the shape
        facilitates proper focusing of the space-time flows. Outer shell
        electrode 202 is formed from an electrically conductive material
        such as metal. Although the preferred practical embodiment
        employs an outer electrode formed from stainless steel, other
        materials such as copper, zinc, or a suitable alloy can be
        utilized. The inner surface of electrode 202 defines the
        interior of electrode 202. The size of outer shell electrode 202
        may vary to accommodate the particular application. </p>
      <p>[0020] The ferromagnetic prisms 206 are positioned within the
        interior of outer shell electrode 202 and around the inner
        surface of outer shell electrode 202, as shown in FIG. 3. The
        prisms 206 are held in place in any suitable manner. For
        example, they can be glued to the inner electrode 204 such that
        electrical contact is maintained between the prisms 206 and the
        electrodes. In accordance with one practical embodiment, each
        ferromagnetic prism 206 has a triangular cross section (see FIG.
        3). The triangular cross section includes an acute angle that
        forms an apex that points toward the interior of the apparatus.
        In this embodiment, each prism-shaped element 206 is identical
        in size, shape, and composition. The shape of the ferromagnetic
        prisms 206 facilitates the combination of the vectors of
        space-time flows generated by the prisms 206. The shape ensures
        that the resulting flows are directed toward the center of the
        cavity within the treatment apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0021] In the example embodiment, the cylindrical shell
        electrode 202 and each of the ferromagnetic prisms 206 are of
        the same length. As shown in FIG. 3, each of the ferromagnetic
        prisms 206 is positioned within the interior of the outer
        electrode 202 such that its apex points toward the longitudinal
        center of treatment apparatus 200. In other words, all of the
        triangles defined by the cross sections of the prisms point
        radially inward. The number of ferromagnetic prisms 206, and
        their shape, size, and composition, may vary depending upon the
        particular application. Practical embodiments include at least
        three prism elements. In the illustrated example, apparatus 200
        includes twelve prism-shaped elements 206 positioned around the
        inner surface of outer shell electrode 202 such that adjacent
        prisms contact each other at their respective bases. </p>
      <p>[0022] The prism-shaped elements 206 should be formed from a
        ferromagnetic material. One suitable material is identified as
        material catalog number 250 VNRP according to the Ukraine
        National Nomenclature. 250 BHP.PI. is nickel-zinc ferromagnetic.
        It has the following technological characteristics: (1) specific
        magnetization saturation: .sigma..sub.i=50-80 A*m.sup.2/kg; (2)
        coefficient of shrinkage: in the limits of 1.14-1.18; (3)
        initial magnetic permeability: .mu..sub.H=180-400; maximal
        allowable operation temperature: not less than 120.degree. C.
        The material is generally characterized as a high frequency
        (10-100 MHz) ferromagnetic material. In this regard,
        ferromagnetic materials of low and super-high frequency are not
        desirable in this application. </p>
      <p>[0023] The inner electrode 204 is formed from an electrically
        conductive material, such as metal. Although the preferred
        practical embodiment employs an inner electrode formed from
        stainless steel, other materials such as copper, zinc, an alloy,
        or any current-conducting material can be utilized. The inner
        electrode 204 is located within the interior of the shell
        electrode 202, and is coupled to the ferromagnetic prisms 206
        such that the prism-shaped elements 206 are not exposed to the
        interior. In this regard, the ferromagnetic material is located
        between the inner surface of the shell electrode 202 and the
        inner electrode 204. The inner electrode 204 is configured such
        that it does not contact the outer shell electrode 202. In the
        practical embodiment, the inner electrode 204 may be realized as
        a plurality of flat plates that are joined together at points
        between the prisms 206 and at the apexes of the prisms 206.
        Alternatively, the inner electrode 204 may be formed as a
        unitary component. </p>
      <p>[0024] The inner electrode 204 is held in place in any suitable
        manner, for example, by gluing or welding it to the prism shaped
        elements 206. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the inner electrode 204
        defines a cavity 220 within the interior of the treatment
        apparatus 200. The cavity 220 is shaped to accommodate the
        container 222 in which the radioactive material is placed. The
        container 222 is formed as a cylindrical vessel in which
        radioactive material is sealed. In a practical embodiment, the
        container 222 is preferably formed of lead because lead screens
        alpha, beta, and gamma radiation while allowing the space-time
        flows to pass. Although not shown, the container 222 rests on
        dielectric or insulating plates or mounts to ensure that the
        container 222 is electrically isolated from the inner electrode
        204 during processing of the radioactive material. </p>
      <p>[0025] The first inner end electrode 208 is formed from an
        electrically conductive material. The first inner end electrode
        208 is connected to one end of the inner electrode 204 to
        establish electrical continuity. In the example embodiment, the
        first inner end electrode 208 is a conical shell electrode that
        contacts the inner electrode 204 at the inwardly facing points.
        In this regard, the first inner end electrode 208 is physically
        attached to the inner electrode at these points. In practice,
        these two electrodes can be connected together (by welding,
        soldering, etc.). </p>
      <p>[0026] The exact dimensions and configuration of first inner
        end electrode 208 may vary from one system to another.
        Generally, the dimensions of the first inner end electrode 208
        are proportional to the dimensions of the Egyptian pyramids. </p>
      <p>[0027] First ferromagnetic end element 216 is mounted in the
        first inner end electrode 208 as shown in FIG. 2. The end
        element 216 may be welded, bonded, or otherwise secured to the
        first inner end electrode 208. The end element 216 is preferably
        formed from the same ferromagnetic material used for the
        prism-shaped elements 206. In this example, the end element 216
        is cone-shaped, which allows it to mate with conical shell
        electrode 208. Generally, the dimensions of the first
        ferromagnetic end element 216 are proportional to the dimensions
        of the Egyptian pyramids. The height of the first ferromagnetic
        end element 216 may be greater than the height of the first
        inner end electrode 208, as depicted in FIG. 2 and FIG. 5. This
        feature facilitates the focusing properties of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0028] The first outer end electrode 210 is mounted to the
        outer surface of the first ferromagnetic end element 216 such
        that electrode 210 does not contact the first inner end
        electrode 208. The first outer end electrode 210 may be glued or
        otherwise secured to the outer surface of the end element 216.
        The first outer end electrode 210 is formed from an electrically
        conductive material. As schematically shown in FIG. 2, the first
        outer end electrode 210 is electrically connected to the outer
        shell electrode 202 and to the second outer end electrode 214.
        This electrical connection may be established using wire,
        cabling, or any suitable electrical conductor. </p>
      <p>[0029] The exact dimensions and configuration of first outer
        end electrode 210 may vary from one system to another. In
        accordance with one practical embodiment, the first outer end
        electrode is a circular plate. The diameter of the first outer
        end electrode 210 may be less than the base diameter of the
        first ferromagnetic end element 216, as depicted in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>[0030] The second inner end electrode 212 is also formed from
        an electrically conductive material. The second inner end
        electrode 212 is connected to the end of the inner electrode 204
        (opposite the first inner end electrode) to establish electrical
        continuity. Thus, the first inner end electrode 208, the second
        inner end electrode 212, and the inner electrode 204 cooperate
        to form one electrode component. In the example embodiment, the
        second inner end electrode 212 is a truncated conical shell
        electrode that contacts the inner electrode 204 at its inwardly
        facing points. In this regard, the second inner end electrode
        212 can be physically attached to the inner electrode 204 at
        these points, in the same manner as described above for the
        first inner end electrode 208. In this example, the truncated
        tip forms an opening in the second inner end electrode 212. As
        shown in FIG. 2, this opening is positioned within the interior
        of the outer shell electrode 202. The exact dimensions and
        configuration of second inner end electrode 212 may vary from
        one system to another. </p>
      <p>[0031] Second ferromagnetic end element 218 is mounted in the
        second inner end electrode 212 as shown in FIG. 2. The end
        element 218 can be glued or otherwise secured to the second
        inner end electrode 212. The ferromagnetic end element 218
        should be formed from the same ferromagnetic material used for
        the prism-shaped elements 206. In this example, the end element
        218 is shaped like a truncated cone, which allows it to mate
        with second inner end electrode 212. The height of the second
        ferromagnetic end element 218 may be greater than the height of
        the second inner end electrode 212, as depicted in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>[0032] As shown in FIG. 2, the second ferromagnetic end element
        218 has a conduit or passageway formed therein along its central
        axis. In the example embodiment, this conduit is a cylindrical
        hole having a diameter that is large enough to allow for passage
        of the container 222. </p>
      <p>[0033] The second outer end electrode 214 is mounted to the
        outer surface of the second ferromagnetic end element 218 such
        that electrode 214 does not contact the second inner end
        electrode 212. The second outer end electrode 214 is formed from
        an electrically conductive material. As schematically shown in
        FIG. 2, the second outer end electrode 214 is electrically
        connected to the outer shell electrode 202 and to the first
        outer end electrode 210. This electrical connection may be
        established using wire, cabling, or any suitable electrical
        conductor. Thus, the first outer end electrode 210, the second
        outer end electrode 214, and the outer shell electrode 202
        cooperate to form one outer electrode component. </p>
      <p>[0034] As shown in FIG. 2, the second outer end electrode 214
        has a hole formed therein. This hole is sized to accommodate
        canister 222. The hole is positioned for alignment with the
        conduit formed in the second ferromagnetic end element 218.
        Thus, the opening formed by the truncated tip of the second
        inner end electrode 212, the conduit in the second end element
        218, and the hole in the second outer end electrode 214 form a
        passageway for the radioactive material, which may be enclosed
        within the container 222. </p>
      <p>[0035] The exact dimensions and configuration of the second
        outer end electrode 214 may vary from one system to another. In
        accordance with one practical embodiment, the second outer end
        electrode 214 is a ring-shaped plate. The outer diameter of the
        second outer end electrode 214 may be less than the base
        diameter of the second ferromagnetic end element 218, as
        depicted in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>[0036] The generator of the excitation signal 104 is shown in
        FIG. 1; it is connected to the second outer end electrode 214,
        to the second inner end electrode 212, as shown in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p><b>Theory of Operation</b> </p>
      <p>[0037] The basis of the proposed method is constituted by the
        phenomenon of excitation of flows of structurization,
        .DELTA..tau..sub.l, and destructurization, .DELTA..tau..sub.2,
        in substance. Its physical substantiation is based upon the
        frequencies of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the
        phases of dispersion (J. W. Emsley, J. Feeney, and L. H.
        Sutcliffe, HIGH RESOLUTION NUCLEAR MAGNETIC SPECTROSCOPY, in two
        volumes, New York (1966)). Dispersion phase at NMR is a state of
        transition from the frequency of structurization to the
        frequency of destructurization or vice versa. In the chart
        showing energy absorption in NMR, crossing of the abscissa will
        be present without failure. This phenomenon characterizes
        dispersion. </p>
      <p>[0038] It is established that when exposed to electromagnetic
        oscillations of specific frequency f.sub.i, the substance,
        absorbing the energy of these oscillations, emits the flows of
        structurization, .DELTA..tau..sub.1. At this, chemical shift
        takes place; and the substance somewhat decreases its sizes
        (isomerism). At the frequency of oscillations f.sub.2, the
        substance emits the flows of destructurization,
        .DELTA..tau..sub.2. At this, chemical shift takes place; and the
        substance somewhat increases its sizes (isomerism). </p>
      <p>[0039] The frequency of structurization f.sub.1, is defined as
        such a frequency of electromagnetic oscillations that
        ferromagnetic material, when exposed to it, as a result of
        nuclear magnetic resonance, emits the flows of space-time
        .DELTA..tau..sub.1 that cause the phenomenon of structurization
        and dilation of any physical process. The frequency of
        destructurization f.sub.2 is defined as such a frequency of
        electromagnetic oscillations that ferromagnetic material, when
        exposed to it, as a result of nuclear magnetic resonance, emits
        the flows of space-time .DELTA..tau..sub.2 that cause the
        phenomenon of destructurization and acceleration of any physical
        process (A. B. , . , . , ., 2000r. (A. V. Kinderevich, L. I.
        Kicha, FIELD THEORY. ELEMENTS OF NUMBERS THEORY, Kyiv 2000)--pp.
        405-408). The reaction of the space-time flows effect is
        measured by N. A. Kozyrev detector, which is considered in the
        works: H. A.// . AH. APM. CCCP, 1997r. (Kozyrev N. A.,
        ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS BY THE WAY OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF
        TIME, Academy of Sciences of Armenian SSR (1977)); H. A., B.
        B.// , 1980r. (Kozyrev N. A., Nasonov V. V., PROBLEMS OF
        UNIVERSE STUDIES (1980)); M. M., . A., M. .//CCCP, 1990r., c.314
        (Lavrentyev M. M., Yeganova I. A., Lutset M. K., Doklady
        Akademyy Nauk USSR, (1990), p. 314). </p>
      <p>[0040] In the monograph A. B. , . , . , ., 2000r. (A. V.
        Kinderevich, L. I. Kicha, FIELD THEORY. ELEMENTS OF NUMBERS
        THEORY, Kyiv (2000)), it is shown that any substance affects the
        flows .DELTA..tau..sub.2 emitted by some mass very
        insignificantly; and it is essentially transparent for them.
        However, insignificant fraction of these flows deflects at
        specified angle when passing from a less dense substance to a
        denser one. This could result in appearance of some resemblance
        of static lenses of .DELTA..tau..sub.2 focusing, which have real
        and imaginary focuses, and, consequently, in local thickening of
        the space-time flows and their rarefication, which is related to
        the Hubble number, H, changes in this local region, acquiring
        the magnitude H.sub.1. The normal intensity of the physical
        processes is determined by the Hubble constant: 1 H = 2.8
        .times. 10 - 18 1 c . </p>
      <p>[0041] If the flows density increase takes place, then in this
        local region H.sub.1&gt;H, if the flows rarefication takes
        place, then H.sub.1&lt;H. Relation 2 H 1 H </p>
      <p>[0042] is an attribute of the local region: at 3 H 1 H &gt; 1 </p>
      <p>[0043] destructurization takes place, at 4 H 1 H &lt; 1 </p>
      <p>[0044] structurization takes place. It is substantiated
        theoretically that the larger the flow .DELTA..tau..sub.2, the
        smaller will be structurization at the given point of the Earth
        surface. </p>
      <p>[0045] This is explained by the fact that the values
        .DELTA..tau..sub.2 and 5 H 1 H </p>
      <p>[0046] are linked by the relation 6 t 2 = 0.5 H 1 H M 4 R E 2 ,
      </p>
      <p>[0047] where M=const, R.sub.E is the radius of Earth. From
        here, it is seen that when the value 7 H 1 H &gt; 1 </p>
      <p>[0048] increases at given point of "Earth-Universe"
        destructurization will increase and vice versa at 8 H 1 H &lt;
        1. </p>
      <p>[0049] It is shown that the change of the magnitude of the
        activity, A, of radioactive materials at the initial specific
        activity A.sub.0=(10.sup.8.div.10.sup.15) Bq/kg equals to: 9 A =
        A 0 - H H 1 t , ( 1 ) </p>
      <p>[0050] where .lambda. is the decay constant, t is time. </p>
      <p>[0051] It could be easily noted that at the specific magnitudes
        of the value 10 H 1 H , </p>
      <p>[0052] the given exponential function decreases faster as
        compared to the known function for the activity assessment:
        A=A.sub.0e.sup.-.lambda.t. </p>
      <p>[0053] As an example, the following calculations are for the
        radioactive isotope Cs-137, where the radioactivity of the
        freshly unloaded fuel, A.sub.0, is equal to 10.sup.15 Bq/kg. </p>
      <p>[0054] The half-life for Cs-137 (T.sub.1/2) is 30.2
        years=9.5.times.10.sup.8 seconds. Respectively, 11 = 0.693 T 1 /
        2 = 7.3 .times. 10 - 10 . </p>
      <p>[0055] Let 12 H H 1 = 10 6 , </p>
      <p>[0056] that is, H.sub.1&lt;&lt;H, then according to expression
        (1),
        A=10.sup.12.times.e.sup.-7.3.times.10.sup..sup.-10.sup..times.10.sup..sup-
.6.sup.t.









        For time t=10 days=8.6.times.10.sup.5 seconds, 13 A = 10 12 e
        629 . </p>
      <p>[0057] That is, a significant decrease of the radioisotope
        activity magnitude will take place. </p>
      <p>[0058] If we accept that e.sup.25=6.times.10.sup.10, then we
        obtain 14 A 10 12 6 .times. 10 10 1.6 .times. 10 - 3 Bq / k g .
      </p>
      <p>[0059] Such decrease of the activity will occur during 9.4
        hours since 15 t = 25 7.3 .times. 10 - 4 = 3.4 .times. 10 4 </p>
      <p>[0060] seconds. Consequently, the decrease of the Hubble number
        H.sub.1 in some local region will cause the decrease of activity
        and, respectively, deactivation of radioactive material. </p>
      <p>[0061] Consequently, to decrease the activity of radioactive
        material, it should be placed into the local region where
        structurization takes place at given flow density
        .DELTA..tau..sub.1, excited in ferromagnetic material at the
        frequency of electromagnetic oscillations f.sub.1. </p>
      <p>[0062] It is substantiated theoretically that in order to
        accelerate deactivation of radioactive material with unexcited
        nuclei with A.sub.0=10.sup.2 Bq/kg and lower, the intensity of
        the fission reaction should be increased. It means that the
        radioactive material should be placed in the local region with
        16 H 1 H &gt; 1. </p>
      <p>[0063] It is shown that at neutron multiplication under the
        conditions of 17 H 1 H </p>
      <p>[0064] and flow .DELTA..tau..sub.2 growth, when the specific
        density of neutrons flux reaches 10.sup.20 cm/s, under

        .times. 10 13 Ci , </p>
      <p>[0065] where .rho. is probability, N is the number of atoms, v
        is the average number of neutrons at decay of one atom v=2.5, K
        is the stage of decay, .DELTA..tau..sub..rho.2 is the flow from
        nuclear structurization, spontaneous chain reaction could occur.
        This should be taken into consideration when determining the
        amount of radioactive material to be subjected to deactivation
        lest the critical mass be formed. </p>
      <p>[0066] It is shown that the activity change in this case equals
        to 19 A = A 0 ' H 1 H t . </p>
      <p>[0067] Here 20 A 0 ' = A 0 H 1 H </p>
      <p>[0068] is increase of the activity in the intensification
        apparatus due to the spontaneous fission of nuclei. Let 21 H 1 H
        = 10 7 , </p>
      <p>[0069] then
        A=A'.sub.0e.sup.-.lambda..times.10.sup..sup.7.sup..times.t. As
        an example, the following calculations are for the unexcited
        nuclei activity decrease for Cs-137 isotope. </p>
      <p>A.sub.0=10 Bq/kg; </p>

      <p>[0071] For the time t=10

      <p>[0072] Meanwhile, even at e.sup.20, the activity will already
        be A=0.9 Bq/kg. </p>
      <p>[0073] Consequently, in this case, in order to decrease
        activity, accelerate deactivation of radioactive material, it
        should be placed into the local region where destructurization
        takes place at given flow density .DELTA..tau..sub.2 excited in
        ferromagnetic material at the frequency of electromagnetic
        oscillations of f.sub.2. </p>
      <p>[0074] The lenses of the space-time flows focusing are known
        shaped as pyramid, cone, prism described in the monograph A. B.
        , . , . , ., 2000r. (A. V. Kinderevich, L. I. Kicha, FIELD
        THEORY. ELEMENTS OF NUMBERS THEORY, Kyiv (2000)). We could not
        find the most close as to their technical essence apparatuses. </p>
      <p>[0075] The proposed apparatus for radioactive material
        treatment 102 (see FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and 4) serves for changing of
        intensity of physical processes in the local region 220. The
        elements of the apparatus shaped as prisms 206 as well as cones
        216 and 218 formed of ferromagnetic are surrounded by the
        electrodes 202, 204, 208, 210, 212, and 214. These elements
        create and focus the flows of space-time, which facilitate
        acceleration or deceleration of physical processes in the local
        region. The energy of the external electromagnetic field is
        absorbed in the elements of the apparatus 102; in this process,
        spins of ferromagnetic are oriented so that it emits powerful
        flows of structurization, .DELTA..tau..sub.1, or
        destructurization, .DELTA..tau..sub.2. Diagram of the flows
        .DELTA..tau..sub.1 summation is presented in FIG. 4. The
        specified flows in the local region of the apparatus 102 change
        the magnitude of the Hubble number and in this way facilitate
        intensification of the process of radioactive decay of the
        radioactive material enclosed in the container 222. </p>
      <p><b>Processing Time Sequence at Embodiment of the Method
          Together with the Apparatus for its Realization</b> </p>
      <p>[0076] The container 222 with highly active radioactive waste
        is loaded into the inner cavity of the apparatus 102 through the
        cylindrical hole in the second end element 218; and then the
        adjustable generator of electromagnetic oscillations 104 is
        turned on. The frequency is set to the frequency of
        structurization, f.sub.1, at which decrease of intensity of
        alpha, beta, and gamma radiation begins as monitored by the
        instruments 106 located directly in the container 222. When the
        threshold magnitude of the activity is reached, the generator
        104 is turned off, and the container 222 with radioactive waste
        is removed from the inner cavity of the apparatus 102. </p>
      <p>[0077] In the case of treatment of nuclear power plants fuel
        elements, which have passed the stage of activity decrease, they
        are removed from the container 222 and fragmented or ground into
        smaller pieces. This provides for the possibility of selecting
        of the amount of radioactive material, which excludes occurrence
        of chain reaction when treated at the frequency f.sub.2. </p>
      <p>[0078] After the specified procedure, the container 222 with
        low active wastes enclosed in it is loaded into the inner cavity
        of the apparatus 102 for the second time. The adjustable
        generator of electromagnetic oscillations 104 is turned on; the
        frequency of destructurization, f.sub.2, is selected, at which
        activity of the radioactive material somewhat increases, but
        then irreversible decrease of intensity of alpha, beta, and
        gamma radiation begins, which is monitored by the instruments
        106 located directly in the container 222. When the activity
        value reaches the magnitude of the environment background, the
        generator 104 is turned off, and the container 222 with
        deactivated radioactive wastes is removed from the inner cavity
        of the apparatus 102 for usage in other ecologically safe
        technological processes. </p>
