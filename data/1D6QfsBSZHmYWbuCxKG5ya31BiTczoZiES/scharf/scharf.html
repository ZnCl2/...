      The discovery of perpetual motion, the transmutation of metals and
      the annihilation of gravitation are mysteries which have baffled
      the minds of men ever since, and probably long before, the dawn of
      civilization.<br>
      <br>
      Until the beginning of the twentieth century whenever these
      fascinating subjects wore broached, the scientist could only
      answer, and rightly, too, "Impossible," for he had neither
      theoretical data nor experimental evidence to indicate that such
      things could be.<br>
      <br>
      With the advent of radium, however, a long step was was taken
      looking toward the ultimate realization of these little-understood
      phenomena, for by its wonderful manifestations of radiant energy
      it has given us an insight into the actuality of what we term
      perpetual motion, projecting as it does its corpuscles carrying
      electric charges and capable of doing work without losing any of
      its original weight and without cessation; likewise it offers an
      analogous condition to that of transforming the baser metals into
      those of precious worth, since it is now known with certainty that
      radium changes into helium.<br>
      <br>
      These are not mere glittering generalities, but cold, hard facts,
      obtained by rigid experiment by such observers as Becquerel, the
      Curies and Lord Ramsey.<br>
      <br>
      But gravitation! Is this attractive force which draws bodies upon
      or near the surface of the earth to forever remain without the
      pale of man's analysis? Radium offers no solution for the
      mysterious attraction, although Newton did solve its laws.<br>
      <br>
      When asked what gravitation is it is easy to say that it is the
      force which causes every particle of matter in the universe to
      attract every other particle. But just what this force may be is
      another and more serious question and as difficult to answer as
      "What is electricity?"<br>
      <br>
      In either case the laws governing their actions are quite well
      known, and since all kinds of energy, such as light, heat and
      mechanical motion, may be changed from one to another, it has been
      assumed that gravitation is merely another phase of electric or
      magnetic action, and according to the extraordinary experiments of
      Professor Scharf of Washington D. C., it would seem to verify the
      theory that there is a very close linking between these different
      forces.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Scharf's postulates seem to be based upon sound
      deductive and experimental reasoning in that he begins with the
      simplest fundamental tests in electricity, namely, electric
      attraction and repulsion. If two pieces of paper or other bodies
      are equally charged with the same kind of electricity, say of the
      positive sign, they will instantly repel each other, regardless of
      gravitational force.<br>
      <br>
      This can be easily tried by heating a couple of strips of
      newspaper, to expel the moisture, and then in a dry room rub them
      briskly with the finger tips, when they will fly apart. But this
      is not all that occurs; for wherever a charge of positive
      electricity is generated there will be in the immediate
      neighborhood an equal charge of negative electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In Professor Scharf's description of his experiments in
      electrically elevating the body against the contending force of
      gravity he does not say how or by what means this negative charge
      is absorbed or conducted away whilst the earth and its
      complementary subject are positively charged; but with a
      fundamental principle of such gigantic import as the one he is
      wrestling with it is but natural that he should desire more time
      to verify his deductions.<br>
      <br>
      That the earth is charged with electricity there can be no doubt,
      though it is not always charged to the positive sign. This is the
      reason that telegraphers must search sometimes for what is called
      a good ground; but there are places where the earth is constantly
      positive and in such a place would the anti-gravitation test best
      succeed. Again such a condition might be produced artificially.<br>
      <br>
      The writer has often noted, when working with X-ray coils of high
      potential, say of eighty or one hundred thousand volts, that if he
      accidentally touched on of the terminals a peculiar lifting
      sensation quite like that described by Professor Scharf always
      resulted.<br>
      <br>
      This may or may not have been due to the repelling force exerted
      between his own body and the earth being charged with positive
      electricity; but it is a significant fact, nevertheless.<br>
      <br>
      According to the laws of electrostatics, which state that electric
      charges of like signs repel each other and electric charges of
      opposite signs attract each other, it is reasonable to believe
      that if the earth and the subject were both negatively electrified
      the same result of repulsion would be manifested.<br>
      <br>
      Under these conditions it may not be very far from the mark if we
      assume that Professor Scharf has devised ways and means for
      charging the human body to a degree of electrification equally
      with that of the earth. That it requires a certain potential, that
      is pressure, of positive electricity, there can be no doubt; but
      there is no difficulty in producing a potential of any voltage up
      to a million.<br>
      <br>
      One of the simplest methods for obtaining those high potentials is
      by means of a frictional machine such as physicians use in giving
      electric treatment. It comprises one or more glass disks two or
      three feet in diameter set on an axis and arranged so that they
      may be revolved. On one side of the glass disk a cushion made of
      silk or leather presses firmly against its surface; this generates
      the electricity, and on the opposite side are some metallic points
      attached to a ball of metal called the prime conductor, which
      gathers in the positive electricity.<br>
      <br>
      If a subject is is now placed on a glass plate to insulate him
      from the earth he may be charged with electricity to his fullest
      capacity and then if the earth is similarly electrified, or if, as
      Professor Scharf asserts, gravitation is a phase of electricity,
      the subject must be repelled from its surface. Any object,
      theoretically, even if it were a battleship or a skyscraper, must
      be repelled from its surface. Any object, theoretically, even if
      it were a battleship or a skyscraper, must be repelled if it and
      an equal mass of the earth were similarly charged.<br>
      <br>
      One cannot say absolutely that gravitation is of an electrical
      nature; but yet we know how easy it is to convert electricity into
      magnetic lines of force by merely causing a current to flow
      through a coil of wire, and conversely it is just as easy to
      transform magnetism into an electric current by passing wire
      through a magnetic field; we know that the earth acts like a huge
      magnet, and as it revolves in space around its own axis at the
      rate of more than a thousand miles an hour it is reasonable that
      high potential charges of electricity are set up in and on its
      surface and that this is what causes the apple to fall to the
      ground and which we speak of as gravitation.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever may be said of the working of these theoretical
      considerations, it is good to speculate upon them, not only for
      their scientific value, but for the worldwide good they would
      bring humanity if put to commercial uses.<br>
      <br>
      Negative gravity would be the greatest scientific discovery ever
      made.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      If you see the Flatiron Building rising in the air some evening
      and calmly sailing off toward Westchester, like Santos-Dumont's
      flying machine; or if you see Bunker Hill Monument floating like a
      bird on the wing up among the clouds; or, better still, if you
      happen to see the Capitol at Washington go past on its way through
      the air from the Potomac to New England, you may be sure that
      Professor E. L. Scharf, of 931 F street Northwest, Washington, has
      put his theory of levitation into working order.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Scharf, formerly of the faculty of the Catholic
      University of America, now a teacher of languages, has discovered
      how to break the law of gravitation. He thinks that he will soon
      be able to solve the problem of the flying machine, of lifting
      great weights and causing buildings weighing thousands of tons to
      sail off into space like feathers by reversing the attraction of
      gravitation.<br>
      <br>
      The bald statement of such a discovery sounds like a chimerical
      phantom, another fool's gold, the vagary of a visionary recluse.
      Admitted. But a talk with Professor Scharf removes all such
      impressions.<br>
      <br>
      The man who thinks he has the clew to the control of a force so
      wonderful that it will, if developed, revolutionize the scientific
      and commercial worlds, is a big, solid man, modest, practical,
      jolly, prosaic, expectant and tolerant of ridicule — in fact, the
      very opposite type from that one would look for in the projector
      of so startling a claim.<br>
      <br>
      There is nothing of the Cagliostro or Archimedes in his style.
      This is probably the reason he has succeeded, even with no more
      than tentative results from his experimentation, in interesting
      both statesmen and, more to the point, New York capitalists in his
      scheme.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Scharf is confident of the correctness of his
      conclusions, and explains that his process is based on well-known
      scientific facts, and is merely a logical development of a logical
      theory.<br>

        <b>PROF. E. L. SCHARF</b><br>

      The earth being charged with positive electricity, proves that if
      a man could charge himself with the same sort of electricity he
      would be repelled from the earth's surface. "Like repels like,"
      and opposites attract each other. It is a rule that is as old as
      the hills.<br>
      <br>
      You will remember the elementary experiment with the two cork
      balls suspended with silk cords. You rub one with resin inducing a
      positive charge, the other with glass, charging it negatively.
      Then you approximate the balls, and they fly together. Now you rub
      with glass the ball you had rubbed with resin, and on
      approximating them you find that they spring apart from each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      What does this prove? Both the automatic repellance of similarly
      charged electrical bodies and the fact that it is possible to
      change the electrical charge of a given body.<br>
      <br>
      By charging my body with the same positive force that the earth
      contains I have actually reduced the weight of my body seven
      pounds, and only stopped the experiment there because I began to
      feel a fainting sensation about the heart that made me think
      perhaps there might be danger in the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      I had insulated a pair of the finest scales by placing them upon
      glass.<br>
      <br>
      Close to the scales I placed my electrical appliance, the
      construction of which I will, of course, not divulge, beyond
      saying that it employs wires which run from beneath the surface of
      the earth, connect with my body, and back to the earth again.<br>
      <br>
      Stepping on the platform of the delicately adjusted weighing
      machine, I noted with the greatest care the succeeding
      registration.<br>
      <br>
      I was growing lighter! One, two, three pounds was gone from my
      normal weight of a moment before. Prudence or timorousness
      dictated a halt, but the exhilaration of hope, the impelling
      desire to put my discovery to a positive test, bade me continue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Losing His Weight.</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="scharf4.png" height="592"
          width="500"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The sensitive register showed a continual diminution of my weight.
      Four — five — six — yes, even seven pounds lighter than when I
      first took the record. Accompanying this loss of weight were
      strange sensations, such as never in all my life had I
      experienced.<br>
      <br>
      A sense as of casting off physical moorings crept over me.
      Lightness gradually pervaded my body, and as I turned on the
      current I felt as if I were actually rising; yes, almost flying.<br>
      <br>
      It was a peculiar feeling about my heart which decided me to
      suspend the experiments, until I can test my plan on dummies and
      the lower animals, to make sure there is no attendant danger, or,
      if there is such danger, to obviate it.<br>
      <br>
      For years the idea of such a force opposed to gravity had buzzed
      in my brain. My attention was first called to it while I was
      connected with the Catholic University.<br>
      <br>
      The reading of the modern and classic Hindoo and Persian works
      made me take notice of the claim, seemingly substantiated, that
      seers of these two races were able by prostrating themselves upon
      the ground, and by other mystic rites which probably had nothing
      to do with the natural phenomena, to raise their bodies into the
      air.<br>
      <br>
      The ascending of our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus, into the
      heavens with a physical body convinced me that it was done by
      natural laws of which He must have been the master. The highest
      proof of the Master's divinity was His ability to control laws
      that to humanity were a sealed book. That he rose into the air
      proves to me that He, as master of the universe, understood the
      secret of negative gravity.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that all the levitation claimed by the Eastern doctors
      was and is preceded by prostration upon the ground reveals the
      secret of the phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electric Phenomena.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I naturally inferred that something in the earth itself was the
      power which, properly controlled, was strong enough to
      successfully oppose the attraction of earth for physical objects.
      As a scientist I knew that electricity was the underlying
      principle of many physical manifestations, and that the earth was
      charged with the positive element of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as I stepped from the scales after my experiment of
      charging my body with positive force and reducing my weight seven
      pounds, the energy employed in the experiment departed to the
      earth, and a moment after, stepping upon the scales, I found that
      my weight was normal again.<br>
      <br>
      I firmly believe that within fifty years the force which for want
      of a better name has been called levitation will be so thoroughly
      understood and its uses and control so well demonstrated that it
      will occupy a position in the list of great public utilities such
      as the electric telegraph, the telephone, the wireless telegraph
      and the electric railway hold to-day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Expects Ridicule.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The storms of doubt, the shafts of ridicule, and the jeers of the
      unthinking will prove as idle in combating the development of this
      new force — or rather an application of that force — as did
      opposition, satire and doubts in the first half of the last
      century toward crushing a great discovery.<br>
      <br>
      One has only to consult the official records of the proceedings in
      Congress to bear out this assertion. It was before you were born,
      to be sure, but within the memory of your father, that a modest
      appropriation of $25,000 was asked from Congress to cover the
      expense of constructing an electrical telegraph line between
      Washington and Baltimore.<br>
      <br>
      This line was intended to demonstrate the practicability of the
      invention of Samuel F. B. Morse. What happened? Why, learned
      statesmen in both houses of Congress thundered invectives against
      such willful waste of the public moneys upon a chimera.<br>
      <br>
      Morse was dubbed an eccentric dabbler in hopeless experiments, and
      so widespread was the ignorance as to natural phenomena that the
      members of the great legislative body really regarded his as
      insane.<br>
      <br>
      Every inventor, discoverer, or experimenter, who is in danger of
      being deterred in his chosen work by abuse from those in
      authority, ridicule from the cynical, doubt or apathy on the part
      of the public, should refresh himself and take new heart by
      reading up on the vicissitudes of Morse and his telegraph.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fund for Experiments.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We do things differently nowadays. Private capital and
      governmental aid is not lacking in any matter concerned with the
      onward march of science. This has truly been called the golden age
      for inventors, developers, and even dreamers.<br>
      <br>
      Hundreds of thousands of dollars are obtained with ease for the
      construction of dirigible balloons, so-called flying machines,
      submarine boats of various types, wireless telegraph stations at
      sea and on land, new explosives, and new armament, while within
      the memory of men now active in Washington life, Prof. Morse was
      compelled humbly to supplicate for a paltry $25,000, that he might
      give to the world one of its greatest discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      My experience in obtaining the promise of financial backing for my
      further experiments is a verification of this statement.<br>
      <br>
      Enjoying a life-long and close friendship with the late Senator
      Hanna, I had no difficulty in securing proper letters of
      introduction to New York capitalists. I laid my scheme before men
      who are pre-eminently devoted to the practical, and have no time
      for the consideration of visionary dreams, with an abiding fear, I
      confess that my proposition would be considered to come within
      this category.<br>
      <br>
      I was surprised and delighted at the ready response. "Why,
      certainly," I was told, "we are willing to put up a few thousands
      merely for experiments. We understand that you are not yet able to
      promise certain results — if you were your demand would be for
      millions instead of thousands, and you would be in a position to
      demand them." With this assurance I returned to Washington and
      resumed teaching, having postponed further experiments until after
      the coming campaign, in which I expect to take an active part.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EVERY MAN HIS OWN AIRSHIP</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With the establishment of control over the law of gravitation,
      flying machines would cease to be a need of the world, for then
      all that would be necessary to enable one to fly would be for a
      man to charge himself with positive electricity to an extent which
      would make him lighter than air, and he would rise from the
      surface of the earth like a balloon.<br>
      <br>
      A small gasolene or other motor operating a swift propeller, and a
      rudder, and motion in any direction would be accomplished.<br>
      <br>
      In order to descend, it would be necessary to carry on the upward
      flight a storage battery containing a supply of the negative
      current, and by turning this on himself the mid-air traveler would
      negate the positive charge and slowly descend to earth.<br>
      <br>
      With such a plan, however, the storage battery would become
      all-essential, and what would happen if the soarer should lose
      both his battery and his propeller, thus being obliged to remain
      suspended in the upper aerial strata for want of a ladder on which
      to descend, is a phase of the matter which it is unpleasant to
      dwell.<br>
      <br>
      This idea suggests another one — that of the safe, humane and
      speedy disposition of criminals under capital sentence. All that
      would be necessary would be to send the condemned man aloft
      without motor or storage cylinder, charging him heavily with the
      "Scharf current," and he would simply fly off into space and
      become a minute speck of star dust, or perhaps form the nebula for
      a new planet.<br>
      <br>
      Here naturally occurs an eerie suggestion—that of the possibility
      of forcing this current into unwilling subjects, and thus
      compelling them to take unexpected flights to Mars or elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Why could not any one who knew how to control this mystic field
      send a charge into his dearest enemy, while the latter was devoid
      of propeller or anti-charge, and thus send him spinning off into
      the unknown?<br>
      <br>
      Should this cherished ambition be realized there will be some
      lively moving days and giant kaleidoscopic effects for the
      inhabitants of this mundane sphere in the future. The Washington
      monument, that massive and beloved shaft which towers above all
      other obelisks in the world, may become a tourist, and go the
      rounds of American cities, historic battlefields, expositions, and
      patriotic celebrations, with greater ease than has the Liberty
      bell been transported from its revered domicile in the Quaker
      city.<br>
      <br>
      More than that — it could be towed behind any sea-going tug to our
      world-scattered provinces, by imbuing it with sufficient force to
      make it float on the water.<br>
      <br>
      Who knows but that when Aladdin rubbed his magic lamp and summoned
      the genii to do his bidding, the huge black employed in producing
      such marvelous results the "Scharf force."<br>
      <br>
      The Washington professor holds as within the area of probability,
      when his experiments shall have been completed, that massive
      blocks of granite, giant pieces of mechanism, heavily laden trains
      and lofty buildings will be as easily elevated and shifted about
      as pawns on a chessboard!<br>
      <br>
      If ponderous freight trains of a hundred cars may be lightened
      with as much ease as he was on the scales, then the problem of
      transportation will have been reduced to a minimum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Moving Extraordinary.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another possibility which presents itself is of the moving order,
      and truly as fascinating as the Arabian Nights Tales. Swiftly
      growing New York, with its ever changing centers of activity, may
      become the arena of genuine elevated traffic and of real rapid
      transit before another century dawns.<br>
      <br>
      Fancy Greater New York reaching to Poughkeepsie on the north and
      to Montauk Point on the east. Imagine the rush hour on "moving
      day," May 1, 1999. A vast army of workers, imbued with the "Scharf
      current," and with the "negating cylinders" as closely guarded as
      the present New Yorker clutches his transfer slip, will be
      self-propelled "down-town" to Harlem, or across town from the
      present sandy stretches of Long Island. Above the city's hum they
      will meet, moving, like themselves, the Flatiron Building, old
      Trinity Church, two score giant skyscrapers and a bridge or two
      from the East or North Rivers, similarly possessed of the
      anti-gravitation impulse, and the never-ending desire to get "up
      town" to new and more suitable locations.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>Revolutionizes War.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      War methods will be revolutionized, if some pacific arbitration
      tribunal, like that at The Hague, shall not have put an end to the
      strife between nations.<br>
      <br>
      Submarine boats charged with the elevating current will steal
      under immense battleships and silently charging them with the
      deadly fluid, send them into space in the twinkling of an eye.<br>
      <br>
      Then swift and terrible indeed will be the destruction wrought by
      contending hosts in battle. Vast armies of invaders will, when
      properly equipped with the elevating current and propulsionary
      apparatus, rise above the obstacles of transportation, ignore the
      forts and destroyers of their foe, turn on the "juice," and move
      with awful swiftness toward and over the enemy's strongholds.<br>
      <br>
      Then will come a clash in midair. It will be as easy for the
      gunners to train the heaviest pieces of field artillery upon the
      opposing force as it now is for the street gamin to aim his
      popgun. After the carnage victors and vanquished will alike
      descend with the aid of the negating current and settle down to a
      truce on the plains or in the valleys beneath.<br>
