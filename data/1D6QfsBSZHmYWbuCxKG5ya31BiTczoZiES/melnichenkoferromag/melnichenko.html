      <br>
      Dear Sirs,<br>
      <br>
      I am glad to say some more news from Russia about free energy
      research.<br>
      <br>
      Inventor Andrew A. Melnichenko made some devices powered by small
      primary source like 1.5 VDC battery and demonstrated that
      resonance effect is the way to free power output. He connected a
      17W fan motor to his electronic system and it is working! Another
      load is 60W and it is working also! In his opinion, the system
      like his resonance circuit powered by small battery DC can be
      power source for home (KWatts) also! The battery is necessary to
      make alternating voltage output for resonance circuit. It is
      possible to close the loop and to make self-charging battery mode.<br>
      <br>
      In resonance, as you must know from college textbook, source is
      not the source of current, but it is source of voltage only. It
      doesn't require current from source and it doesn't require power
      expense from source...<br>
      <br>
      This article is different from the other since it made some
      references on Tesla's work. Yes, it is the same as Tesla's
      resonance transformer but in this version inventor didn't raise
      the output to million Volts like Tesla made.<br>
      <br>
      I hope that somebody is interested to make joint research with
      Andrew Melnitchenko. He need partners like most inventors. If
      you'll have some progress in this deal, please, let me know.
      Perhaps, together we can open a door to the future.<br>

      The invention relates to means of generating electrical energy. A
      method for generating electrical energy is based on converting
      energy during the magnetization and demagnetization of a core, and
      drawing off additional energy using an additional detachable
      secondary winding. The additional energy in the invention can be
      obtained during demagnetization of a core which has been
      premagnetized using a coil. A device (and variants thereof)
      comprises magnetization coils and cores, the number and position
      of which may differ in different embodiments of the device. The
      technical result is the possibility of obtaining an additional
      amount of electrical energy without additionally expending
      electrical energy on the working of the device.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The method of generating electricity due to the separation of the
      magnetic field of a ferromagnet from the magnetization coil
      consists in creating and transforming magnetic fields that are not
      inductively connected to the magnetization coil (s). The formation
      of these magnetic fields is achieved due to the special design and
      the very topology of the magnetic field of the device, when only a
      part of the magnetic flux and magnetic energy of the core (s) of
      the ferromagnet are coupled with the magnetization coil. The
      second stage is the conversion of all the energy of the magnetic
      field and the magnetization coil and the core of a ferromagnet
      during demagnetization (in the reverse direction) into
      electricity. Generation and is achieved by converting all the
      magnetic energy of the core into electricity. During
      demagnetization, the magnetic energy of the core from a
      ferromagnet that is not associated with the magnetization coil is
      converted into additional electrical energy that does not involve
      the cost of magnetization. The simplest version of the topology of
      the device that implements this method of generation is a current,
      a coil of a wire, a circuit, or a magnetization coil located just
      next to the volume, the core of a ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetization coil located, for example, opposite the end of
      the core of a ferromagnet. At the same time, a significant or even
      a large part of the magnetic field energy of the core of a
      ferromagnet is in no way connected inductively with the
      magnetization coil, but is closed around the core, bypassing the
      magnetization coil. The magnetic field energy is proportional to
      the square of the magnetic field induction and therefore almost
      all magnetic energy is closed in the nearest zone of space around
      the core. The magnetic field is closed around the entire core and
      the shape of the magnetic field depends on the shape of the core
      of the ferromagnet, which can be used to build devices.<br>
      <br>
      In traditional conventional electrical engineering, the
      magnetizing winding always covers all or almost all of the
      magnetic field of the core. Dividing the magnetic field of the
      core from the magnetization coil, we get the magnetic field of the
      ferromagnet, which does not affect the establishment of current in
      the magnetization coil. The principle of separation of the
      magnetic field of the volume, the core of a ferromagnet from the
      magnetization coil itself is achieved by a special device topology
      and is the main feature of the invention. The method of generation
      is achieved due to the fact that the distance from the
      magnetization wires to the surface of the core of the ferromagnet
      is large enough and sufficient to form a significant short circuit
      of the magnetic flux of the ferromagnet, not covering the coils
      with current and forming an inductive coupling with the
      magnetization coil. In the device, the magnetization coil is not
      worn on the core itself, but as if it is attached to the side, for
      example, at the end face at a certain distance from it.<br>
      <br>
      The magnitude of this distance depends on the diameter of the coil
      and the thickness of the core and is determined by the desired
      magnitude of the magnetic coupling. The simplest version of the
      device and the topology of the system is just a piece, the volume
      of the ferromagnet located next to the wire with current. This
      forms a significant part of the magnetic field is not covering the
      wire and is not associated with a wire inductive coupling. The
      cores may be located around the wire, but must be separated by
      gaps for the partial or strong separation of their magnetic fields
      from each other. If a wire with a current forms a coil, the
      circuit, then the cores can be inside the circuit (but away from
      the wire itself), both outside the contour plane and nearby, as
      well as generally outside the circuit, a coil with current.<br>
      <br>
      In another case (variant), the magnetization coil has several (or
      many times) larger diameter, cross-section than the cross-section
      of the core and partially or almost completely comes to the core
      along the plane. This is a kind of remote magnetization of the
      volume of a ferromagnet and it allows you to get the magnetic
      field of the volume of a ferromagnet already in no way connected
      inductively (magnetically) to the magnetization coil. It is
      important that the device can be used only one core, and the
      magnetization coil itself without a core.<br>
      <br>
      The work of the current source (the cost of electricity) during
      magnetization is always equal to the magnetic energy in the
      magnetization coil plus the loss. The work of the current source,
      the electric power expended on magnetization, is always equal
      (without taking into account losses) of that and only the magnetic
      energy of the volume of the ferromagnet, which is magnetically
      inductively connected to the magnetization coil. But all the
      energy of the magnetic field of a ferromagnet will always be much
      more than the part of the magnetic field energy of the ferromagnet
      that is inductively connected to the coil. As a result, the full
      energy of the magnetic field of a ferromagnet will be greater than
      the cost of its remote (at a distance) magnetization. And the cost
      of electricity for magnetization will always be equal only to the
      energy of the magnetic field that is inductively connected to the
      magnetization coil itself. But then the total energy of the
      magnetic field of the core of a ferromagnet will always be greater
      than the portion of the energy of the core field associated with
      the magnetization coil. The part is always smaller than the whole.<br>
      <br>
      This allows you to get the energy of the magnetic field of the
      core of a ferromagnet more than the cost of electricity itself for
      magnetization in the magnetization coil. The cost of electricity
      for magnetization is always equal only and only to the magnetic
      energy that is directly connected inductively to the magnetization
      coil by magnetic flux linking and direct inductive coupling. But
      with the magnetization coil inductively (due to the topology of
      devices and fields) only a small part of the magnetic field energy
      of the volume from the ferromagnet is connected, and the total
      energy of the magnetic core will always be greater than the
      magnetic field energy of the ferromagnet associated with the
      magnetization coil. But in order to demagnetize (on the reverse
      course), all the energy of the magnetic field of a ferromagnet
      volume needs to be converted into electric energy, a special
      removable secondary additional winding is needed. This removable
      secondary winding is not involved (the current is blocked by
      diodes or controlled by a rectifier) during magnetization and
      works only during the demagnetization phase.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a reverse pulse converter, the secondary winding
      operates only in the current off (or fall) phase by the transistor
      or thyristor in the primary magnetizing coil.<br>
      <br>
      The reverse mode allows you to get rid of the reaction of the
      current in the secondary winding during magnetization, but does
      not interfere with the conversion of magnetic energy of the
      ferromagnet during demagnetization. It should be noted that the
      energy in a ferromagnet is stored in the form of a magnetic
      elastic interaction energy of the domains, and this quantity also
      depends on the initial induction and the external constant
      magnetic field. When the core is magnetized by permanent magnets
      (or currents), it is possible to work on a cycle not of
      magnetization, but already demagnetization of the core to zero or
      of the remagnetization of the core in general in the opposite
      direction. But the principle of the reverse stroke remains here,
      this is the accumulation of magnetic elastic energy in a
      ferromagnet and then the return of the magnetic induction to the
      primary state. The core magnetized by permanent magnets can be
      demagnetized by the magnetic field of the current and even
      reversal in the opposite direction to the magnetic field of the
      magnets. This allows you to significantly increase the maximum
      amplitude of the magnetic induction in the core of a ferromagnet,
      almost twice (maximum) than just on the magnetization cycle from
      zero induction.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the presence of a demagnetizing field of permanent magnets
      makes it possible to reduce the time of decay of magnetic
      induction to zero when the magnetization current is turned off and
      to reduce the residual induction in the core. The magnets can be
      located both sequentially at the ends of the core, and parallel to
      it.<br>
      <br>
      The very form of the cores of a ferromagnet is also very
      important. This may be a simple straight-shaped core or have end
      tabs to reduce the demagnetizing factor and create a specific
      shape W magnetic field around the core. For example, a core of
      ferrite can be in the form of a dumbbell to form a specific
      topology of the magnetic field and reduce the demagnetization of
      the end parts. The shape of the dumbbell and the end protrusions
      can be like that of a solid core (or whole sheets of charge) and
      can also be in the form of separate end patches reprimanded the
      butt. This composing core of a ferromagnet consists already of
      three parts in the form of a central core and two side cores in
      the form of overlays on the ends. It can also use a conventional
      serial or special core made from ferrite in the form of a dumbbell
      or in any similar or similar form (and in the same projection).
      The laminated core is made in the form of a pack of transformer or
      electrical sheets (steel for dynamo machines) of steel of straight
      or special shape, or consist of several packs of steel. In this
      case, the direction of the magnetic stray fields of the laminated
      core along and across the direction of the charge will vary
      considerably, and this must be taken into account when designing
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest magnetic scattering will be along the plane of the
      charge sheets, and not across, sheets, which is associated with
      eddy currents in the steel sheets. End plates are located across
      the end and allow you to direct the magnetic fields of the
      scattering of the core sideways from the end of the core and
      reduce the magnetic coupling with the turns of magnetization. The
      end plate essentially as a magnetic shunt turns the magnetic
      fluxes of the core to the sides.<br>
      <br>
      The devices operate on the principle of creation, accumulation of
      magnetic energy and its transformation during demagnetization and
      shutdown of the current. Demagnetizing currents as in a normal
      transformer with magnetization do not occur as they are blocked by
      diodes or controlled rectifier from transistors or thyristors.
      This is the so-called backstop mode. The current in the secondary
      winding is only in the phase of the shutdown and fall of the
      current in the magnetizing coil.<br>
      <br>
      The principle of reversal can be implemented in a pulse conversion
      with the opening of the magnetizing current in the primary coil
      circuit using a transistor, relay, brush collector or lockable
      thyristor. As well as any other type of keys such as vacuum tubes,
      gas discharges and other methods. The device can simply be powered
      by a pulsating voltage and current from any external special power
      source. Voltage and current can be variable, but with a constant
      component or any other form of rise and fall of the current. With
      an alternating current of any form, there are also phases of
      current growth and phases of current decay, which can be used to
      implement the principle of reverse stroke. Conversion converters
      in the pulse converter technology can be of different schemes, for
      example, booster, chopper or inverting converters, and any other
      scheme. You can use any options for the scheme to implement the
      method and device generation. The magnetizing coil and secondary
      windings can operate independently (for different loads) or work
      in parallel on a common capacitive (capacitor) voltage adder.<br>
      <br>
      And they can work together and consistently for one common load.
      In this case, in the demagnetizing phase and in the fall of the
      magnetization current, the magnetization coil itself and the
      detachable secondary winding on the core are simply connected in
      series to the common load. In this case, their EMF and voltage and
      magnetic energy are added together in total, transforming into
      electricity in the total load. Sequential connection allows you to
      use together the coils and windings with different voltages and
      EMF for one load. The accumulator of the capacitors in this case
      is not needed.<br>
      <br>
      The principle of separation of the magnetic field and ferromagnet
      is realized through a special topology of the device. Separation
      of the magnetic field of a ferromagnet from a current arises
      simply if the volume of the ferromagnet is near the wire with a
      current or near the coil windings both inside the current loop and
      from the outside. In this part of the significant energy of the
      magnetic field of the core, the volume of the ferromagnet closes
      without covering the current and without inductive coupling with
      the magnetizing current. This part of the energy of the magnetic
      field of the system that the current source does not see when
      magnetized and the current source does not waste electric energy
      on this magnetic field energy of the ferromagnet. But this
      component of the magnetic field of a ferromagnet (not related to
      magnetizing currents) can be converted in the reverse course with
      the help of an additional winding into additional electric power.
      In this case, the volume of a ferromagnet can simply be near the
      current, either as a direct wire, for example, or in the form of a
      coil. A ferromagnet can be located inside a large circuit (or
      coils with current) whose diameter is several or many times larger
      than the cross section of the core and its length.<br>
      <br>
      A ferromagnet can be located outside the contour or turns of the
      coil, but near it, for example. The magnetization coil can be flat
      as in the form of a coil with a current. The length of the
      magnetization coil can be much less than the length of the core
      itself and the core can partially or completely go inside the
      volume of the coil or in its plane. In this case, the
      magnetization still extends to the entire core of the ferromagnet
      due to the magnetic interaction of the domains. The magnetization
      coil can be as flat as a coil, and this reduces the amount of
      magnetic energy itself and the cost of magnetization. Magnetic
      energy depends not only on the magnitude of the square of the
      magnetic field, but also on the volume of the magnetic field
      itself. And this determines the cost of electricity for
      magnetization. For magnetization, the local (in space) strong
      magnetic field in the region of a part of the core of a
      ferromagnet is often enough. This allows significantly (at times)
      to reduce the cost of electricity for magnetization and to have a
      fairly strong magnetic induction in a ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetization applies to the entire volume of the ferromagnet.
      The length of the coil may be significantly less than the length
      of the core (s) of the ferromagnet. The magnetization coil can be
      either integral or composed of separate sections spaced apart for
      more uniform magnetization of the core. The magnetization coil can
      work for two or three cores (and more) at once. The optimal design
      option is to use several cores, as this gives more magnetic energy
      to ferromagnets. For example, one magnetization coil operates on
      two cores and its plane is located between or near the ends of the
      cores separated by an air gap. Such a core can be represented as
      first a solid one core, but then, as it were, sawed in half and
      spread apart over a certain gap between the ends. The dimensions
      of the cross section or the diameter of the magnetization coil can
      be several times and many times larger than the dimensions of the
      cross section or the diameter of the core (s) itself.<br>
      <br>
      This allows you to increase the magnetic field of the
      magnetization coil for a distance along the length of the cores
      and reduce the magnetic coupling of this magnetization coil with
      the magnetic field of the cores themselves. The magnetization coil
      at the same time as it covers the gap between the cores, which
      also reduces the magnetic coupling with them. The ends of the
      cores also mutually magnetize each other a little through the gap
      to enhance induction. But the main role in the magnetization of
      the cores of a ferromagnet is played by the magnetic field of the
      magnetization current in the coil along the cores.<br>
      <br>
      The device may be of three cores, of a ferromagnet also separated
      by large gaps for strong separation of their magnetic fields. In
      this case, the magnetization coil is also better to do several or
      many times larger than the cross section, the dimensions of the
      sides of the cores themselves. The magnetizing coil can cover only
      one central core by volume or partially or completely go along the
      planes on two lateral cores. The length of the magnetization coil
      can be much less than the length of the central core with a
      relatively large enlarged diameter to reduce the magnetic coupling
      with the core field. To reduce the magnetic coupling and the cost
      of magnetization, the central core can have several times smaller
      cross-sectional area than the side cores and have a relatively
      small length. The cross-sectional area (and the cross-sectional
      shape itself) of the central core may be almost the same or
      specifically several times smaller than the cross-sectional area
      of the side cores. At the same time, the central core is used as
      an auxiliary core to increase mutual magnetization through the
      gaps.<br>
      <br>
      All this allows to reduce the cost of magnetization (and the size
      of the coil) and increase the magnetic flux is not associated with
      the coil. The useful energy of the magnetic field is removed from
      all three cores from a ferromagnet during demagnetization. The
      device of the three cores is one of the most simple and
      technologically advanced device. As already described, the
      magnetization coil (devices with cores outside the magnetization
      coil) may have (as an option) and a small internal (central) kind
      of auxiliary core of a ferromagnet, but this is not a
      prerequisite. It is used to generate all three cores. The device
      can be integrally composed of any number of magnetization coils
      (coil sections) and any number of ferromagnetic cores of various
      shapes and cross sections to reduce the cost of magnetization and
      increase the magnetic energy of the fields of the ferromagnet
      outside the magnetization coils.<br>
      <br>
      The device can work and generally only with one core of a
      ferromagnet. Any solid single core can be represented as an
      integral sum of consecutive cores with small, small gaps. An
      important difference from the magnetization options with a special
      inductor core in the magnetization coil is that the additional
      energy is removed from all the cores of the system. And the
      simplest version of the device can be only on one core of a
      ferromagnet and with one coil of magnetization. The core is
      partially or completely inserted into the magnetization coil or
      almost adjacent to its plane. The magnetization coil itself can be
      a single uniform density of turns or heterogeneous, or even
      consist of several separate sections separated, separated by a
      certain distance. This allows you to create a more uniform
      induction along the core due to its stronger local magnetization
      of its end parts and an increase in the total longitudinal uniform
      magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      Sections (two) can be shifted closer to the ends of the core to
      reduce the magnetic coupling with the core field. This is due to
      the fact that the magnetic equator of the core will always have
      the maximum magnetic flux linkage. This is better than the
      location of a single magnetization coil near the middle of the
      core, since it reduces the magnetic coupling and the cost of
      magnetization with a stronger local magnetization of the end parts
      of the core. To reduce the magnetic coupling with the core, it is
      also used to increase (by a factor) the diameter or sides of the
      cross section of the magnetization coil round, rectangular, etc.,
      of any shape. To reduce the demagnetizing factor, one whole core
      can be replaced with a bundle of separate parallel cores in the
      form of rods or plates, but separated by gaps from a dielectric to
      reduce mutual demagnetization. Such a core can be considered as
      many separate cores or as a single type core of individual parts
      in the form of a bundle or bundle. Each such core of the bundle
      may have its own separate removable winding to convert the entire
      magnetic field of the core.<br>
      <br>
      The windings are all combined in parallel and in series for a
      common load or drive. A pack can work as one single composable
      core. With the same total effective area, the magnetization and
      magnetic induction of such a core of cores or plates will be
      greater. This is due to the fact that cores that are more
      elongated in relation to width have a much lower demagnetization
      coefficient. This original technical solution is practically not
      used in conventional electrical engineering, but is useful for
      increasing the magnetization of unclosed cores. It is also
      important what form of cross section at the core, with the same
      cross-sectional area, the round core will always have a
      significantly greater demagnetization coefficient than the core of
      a rectangular elongated or elongated round section or almost flat
      in cross section. This section shape can be used to construct a
      device to reduce the demagnetizing factor. In this case, the
      magnetization coil should also be rectangular elongated in the
      desired cross section and have a sufficient distance from the
      surface of the core in order to form a magnetic leakage flux
      inside the coil.<br>
      <br>
      This elongated rectangular shape of the cross section must also
      take into account that the magnetic leakage flux basically closes
      along the more elongated side of a rectangular cross section. This
      factor should be taken into account when choosing the direction of
      the charge in the laminated core of steel plates. In this
      direction, the parameters of the size of the magnetization coil
      are made. This shape of the section allows you to make the device
      more compact in packing into modules than just coils of rounded
      section. The elongated rectangular or rounded shape (without sharp
      corners) of the core and the magnetization coil increases the
      consumption of the wire, but this section shape is more
      comfortable and more efficient with the same working section area.
      To reduce the demagnetizing factor, the laminated core of steel
      plates may have an increased thickness of insulating gaskets from
      the dielectric between the plates or sheets of steel or the core
      itself has periodically spaced gaps from the dielectric that break
      the core into separate parallel packs.<br>
      <br>
      These are all variants of the design, where the core is located
      either near the magnetization coil or even inside the
      magnetization coil. This topology can be integrally combined into
      a closed torus-type magnetic system or a rectangular chain (with
      gaps) of many coils and cores. In this integral design, the
      magnetic fields of the coils partially overlap and sum up,
      reinforcing each other, and the cores mutually magnetize each
      other through the gaps. The device may contain one common
      magnetization coil and any large number of small, micro-cores
      (with windings) or cores in the form of ferromagnetic particles
      and arranged both sequentially and parallel to each other. Each
      such core has its removable winding.<br>
      <br>
      The degree of magnetic interaction and magnetic coupling between
      them can be different, but all distances between the cores should
      be chosen, so that significant stray magnetic fields closed only
      around cores in the near zone of space would always form. These
      all magnetic fields of dispersion and this magnetic energy are
      inductively in no way connected with the magnetization coil. The
      magnetizing current is supplied only to one common external
      magnetization coil, but the magnetic energy is already removed
      during demagnetization from the magnetization coil and from all
      cores, microcores or ferromagnetic particles (in a dielectric)
      located inside the magnetization coil. At the same time, all the
      magnetic energy of all internal (relative to the coil) magnetic
      fields of dispersion of all cores, microcores or ferromagnetic
      particles is converted into additional electric power. All
      windings of all cores (particles) from a ferromagnet are already
      combined in groups in parallel and (or) in series for a common or
      different load or for a common electric energy storage in the form
      of a battery or capacitor bank.<br>
      <br>
      Such a magnetic system can be either direct (open magnetically at
      the ends) in the form of a solenoid-type coil (with cores) or in
      the form of a more complex closed magnetic system such as a torus
      or a rectangular magnetic circuit to close the common magnetic
      field inside the system. This allows you to make a partial
      magnetic insulation of the external environment.<br>
      <br>
      But the cores can be located just near or around a straight wire
      (wires) or a coil with a current tangential to the magnetic field
      of the current. The magnetic field of direct or almost direct
      current, coil, and others forms concentric magnetic induction
      lines closed around the wire with current. This version of the
      topology also allows you to use a large number of cores, a large
      total magnetic flux and the total energy of the magnetic field
      with a single coil, circuit, magnetization coil. Each core also
      has its own removable winding, which is needed to convert all the
      magnetic energy of the core, including that which is inductively
      not connected to the magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      A ferromagnet can also be in the form of a torus that covers the
      current, but this torus must be divided by large gaps into
      separate segments for a partial separation of their magnetic
      fields. It can be said that these are simply several or many cores
      located tangentially to the magnetic field of the current. Such
      cores are magnetized tangentially by the current field and also
      mutually slightly magnetize each other through large gaps, forming
      a magnetic circuit. Such magnetic circuits from the segments seem
      to cover the wire and current. But because of the large gaps, the
      magnetic fields of the cores are closed mainly right around them
      in the near zone, and does not form a magnetic circuit. At the
      same time, the magnetic fields of the segments that are no longer
      inductively coupled to the current or turns of the coil arise.
      This kind of almost closed magnetic circuit is obtained, but it
      can be in the form of a torus or a rectangular shape of segments
      with gaps and consist of any number of ferromagnetic segments.
      Each such separate torus segment from a ferromagnet must have its
      own detachable secondary winding (section) to convert the entire
      magnetic field of the ferromagnet segment.<br>
      <br>
      The magnitude of the gaps between the segments of the magnetic
      circuit is chosen such that a significant separation of the
      magnetic fields of the segments (and their energy) is obtained
      than the formation of the total magnetic flux. This allows you to
      receive significant magnetic energy of the segments and convert it
      into additional electricity. On one straight wire with a current
      or on the turns of a coil, such magnetic circuits in the form of a
      torus or rectangular shape and of any shape can be much strung
      together. The cores, and more specifically the volumes from the
      ferromagnet, can be simply located near the current, the loop or
      with the coil, both outside the current loop and outside the plane
      of the loop or outside the volume of the magnetization coil. The
      core is located either outside the plane of the current loop, but
      next to it, or displaced in any direction relative to the axis of
      the loop. The core (s) can be located and generally only outside
      the magnetization coil at its ends or even stand sideways, as it
      were, but the magnetization is not very efficient. If the coil has
      a diameter or cross-sectional size (the cross-sectional shape can
      be any) several times larger than the cross-section of a short
      relative to the core, then the core can be located anywhere inside
      the coil and centrally or closer to the periphery.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fields of the core are partially closed right inside
      the circuit and without inductive coupling with it. The
      magnetization of a ferromagnet is the most effective, but the
      device must have a coil of magnetization of a large diameter
      section. The main thing is that a significant part of the magnetic
      field energy of the core (s) is closed inside the coil, but
      without inductive coupling with the coils of this coil themselves.
      Physically, this is also the same as the closure of a magnetic
      field outside the plane of the magnetization coil. But at the same
      time maximum magnetization is achieved due to the location of the
      ferromagnetic core in the magnetization circuit. A decrease in the
      magnetic coupling of the coil with the core field occurs due to an
      increase in the diameter of the coil or simply due to the
      displacement of the core itself slightly relative to the plane of
      the magnetization coil. The distance from the core to the wires of
      the magnetization coil and the very direction of the magnetic
      induction lines of the coil and the magnetic flux of the core are
      also important here.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to clearly understand that it is not the formal
      presence of the flux linkage that is important, but the real
      effective magnetization and efficient magnetic flux linkage. The
      presence of some, for example, a separate coil (or several)
      magnetization coils on the core itself (with full flux linkage)
      does not mean that the costs of magnetization are associated with
      the entire core field of a ferromagnet. When trying to bypass my
      patent for an invention, the fact that the arrangement of several
      turns (for example, with hundreds of other turns of the coil) of
      the magnetization coil formally violates the formula that there is
      a magnetic field not inductively connected to the magnetization
      coil. The situation is also complicated by the presence of some
      kind of counter-included turns and sections, and the contribution
      to the magnetization and the cost of electricity for the
      magnetization already from each turn need to be taken into
      account. In this case, separate spaced turns of the magnetization
      coil can in principle be coupled with the entire magnetic field of
      the core, but this is not associated with effective magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      It is not the formal flux linkage of individual turns and core
      fields that is important, but the effective magnetization itself
      and the effective magnetic flux linking of fields and turns. The
      magnetic flux linkage of individual turns of the magnetization
      coil with the core field of a ferromagnet may be, but this may not
      have anything to do with the actual effective magnetization of
      this core or the contribution to the magnetization effect is
      simply small and insignificant. Any partial flux linking of some
      part of the turns of the magnetization coil and the magnetic field
      of the cores from a ferromagnet is possible, but it is always
      necessary to take into account only the effective (and not formal)
      magnetization and flux linkage of the fields, as well as the
      associated costs of electricity for the magnetization itself.<br>
      <br>
      The ferromagnet itself is formed by the quantum currents of the
      magnetic moments of the electrons (spins) and has no inductive
      impedance resistance. In this case, the ferromagnet is an
      independent carrier of the magnetic field energy. For the
      magnetization of a ferromagnet and the formation of its magnetic
      energy, it is not the current and voltage that are needed as in a
      coil of wire, for example, but only an external initiating
      magnetic field of an external current in the wires. For
      generation, it is only necessary to partially inductively separate
      the ferromagnetic own magnetic field from the magnetization coil
      itself. This is a kind of remote magnetization at a certain
      distance from the wires of the magnetization coil. This method and
      method of generation allows to obtain additional energy of the
      magnetic field of the ferromagnet volume without the cost of
      electricity of the current source. And when demagnetizing (on the
      reverse), this additional and all the energy of the magnetic field
      of the ferromagnetic volume can be easily converted into electric
      energy using a special removable secondary winding, which is
      located on the core itself and covers the entire magnetic field of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the method of generation lies in the magnetization
      of a ferromagnet, the formation of magnetic field energy outside
      the magnetization coil and then the conversion of the entire
      magnetic field energy of the ferromagnet (during demagnetization)
      through a special additional removable secondary winding on the
      core itself. The secondary winding works only on the reverse
      course during the demagnetization phase. Reverse mode allows you
      to effectively receive and convert the magnetic energy of the core
      without the effect of demagnetization as in conventional
      transformers. The devices (and the method itself) work in the
      phase of accumulation of magnetic energy of the ferromagnet and in
      the phase of its conversion. In the demagnetization phase, the
      magnetization winding and the secondary coil can be connected
      together in series or in parallel for one common load or to work
      for different loads or for one through a common voltage adder from
      capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      The device of the simplest type for implementing this method is a
      magnetization coil simply located near the end of a simple
      straight core of a ferromagnet in the form of a rod or bar. The
      magnetization coil may have a cross section that is smaller,
      equal, close, or larger than the cross section of the core itself
      (or one of its sections). The magnetization coil can be several
      and many times larger in diameter and cross-section than the core
      section itself and partly along the plane go to the end portion of
      the core or be at a distance from the plane of the core end face.
      Larger coils of magnetization produce a stronger magnetic field at
      the same distance from the section plane than coils of smaller
      diameter or cross section. For stronger magnetization, two coils
      can be placed on both sides of the core opposite each end for
      magnetization on both sides at once. Another simplest version of
      the device is a closed core with a large air gap, in which the
      magnetization coil is located.<br>
      <br>
      In this device, one magnetization coil in the gap already
      magnetizes two ends of a closed core in the form of a rectangular
      or rounded magnetic circuit. The gap is specially made large and
      the magnetic field of the core is closed mainly not through the
      gap, but through the air around the entire core, as in a straight
      core in the form of a rod. One magnetizing coil magnetizes two
      ends of one almost closed core at once. It can be a rectangular
      magnetic circuit or in the form of a torus, simple or branched.
      The magnetic circuit can be solid or consist of individual
      segments of a ferromagnet. Segments of the magnetic circuit can be
      further separated by small air gaps for partial separation of the
      magnetic fields of these segments. This allows you to increase the
      total magnetic flux of all cores with the same cross-sectional
      area of the segments. A magnetic circuit may have two or more
      magnetization coils between segments for a larger total magnetic
      flux in the device. But the simplest version of the device is one
      core (straight or almost closed) and one magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      In a device with a straight core, it is better to make two
      magnetization coils for magnetizing the core from two ends at
      once. These two coils can be represented simply and as two
      spatially separated sections of a single magnetization coil. In
      the case of a closed or, more precisely, an almost closed core
      with a gap, one magnetization coil, which acts on two ends of the
      core, is sufficient. This is a kind of closed (semi-closed)
      version of the design of the device and the magnetic system and
      its analogue is a straight rod with a magnetization coil at the
      end of the core. These are the simplest versions of devices, with
      only one core. In these devices, the magnetic field of the core of
      a ferromagnet is closed as if to the side, away from the
      magnetization coil itself. But the magnetization coil of
      especially large diameter, which is several or many times larger
      than the cross section of the core, may even partially (on its
      plane) land on the end portion of the core (s) for stronger
      magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      The core can be located completely inside the magnetization coil
      whose diameter is several or many times larger than the cross
      section of the core and approximately (plus or minus) is
      comparable to the length of the core of the ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      The core of a ferromagnet of a certain length can be located
      directly inside the magnetization coil, the diameter of which is
      several times, many times larger than the cross section of the
      core. At the same time, the distance from the wires of the
      magnetization coil to the surface of the core is sufficient for
      complete closure of a large part of the magnetic field energy of
      the ferromagnet inside the magnetization coil without flux linkage
      and without inductive coupling with the magnetization coil. In
      principle, the magnetic field of the core can be closed either to
      the side (side) of the magnetization coil or directly inside the
      magnetization coil. For this, the core itself should not be long,
      and the magnetization coil should be comparable in diameter to
      approximately the length of this ferromagnetic core. The magnitude
      of the magnetic coupling of the coil-core can be widely varied
      technically in the desired limit due to the different size of the
      cross section, the diameter of the magnetization coil, as well as
      the length and thickness of the cross section of the core of the
      ferromagnet. The diameter of the magnetization coil or its cross
      section (rectangular, for example) must be several or many times
      larger than the cross section of the core itself.<br>
      <br>
      And the length of the core should not significantly exceed the
      diameter or cross section of the magnetization coil. It is better
      to use shorter cores. The core can be located either in the center
      (preferably) or arbitrarily in a large-diameter magnetization
      coil. The distance from the wires of the magnetization coil to the
      surface of the core must be sufficient for there to be a space for
      closing a significant part of the magnetic field energy of the
      core inside the magnetization coil and without inductive coupling
      to the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field and the magnetic energy of the cores is closed
      in a large area inside the magnetization coil itself. To convert
      all the magnetic energy of the core into electrical energy, there
      is a special removable secondary winding on it that only works on
      the reverse course during demagnetization. This secondary winding
      can be connected in parallel or in series to a common load
      together with a magnetizing coil or work on a separate load. Many
      such large-diameter coils with cores (arranged in series and
      mutually magnetizing each other through gaps) can form a common
      total, integral system. The magnetic chain can be in the form of a
      straight or closed magnetic circuit, including a branched magnetic
      circuit. In this case, the individual magnetization coils can be
      represented as separate sections of a common magnetization coil. A
      device of this type is a magnetization coil (integral or in the
      form of separate sections) and a type-setting core in the form of
      successive cores through the gaps.<br>
      <br>
      The size of the gaps can be different for different devices, from
      small gaps to cases where the cores interact weakly through large
      gaps. Such a total core can be represented as a kind of common
      dial core, but also as a set of generally separate cores arranged
      in series through the gaps.<br>
      <br>
      To reduce the demagnetizing factor, the core itself can be made
      from a ferromagnet not solid, but stacked in the form of a bundle
      of parallel rods of circular or rectangular cross-section or flat
      plates separated by non-magnetic spacers from a dielectric. Such
      narrower rods or plates are easier to magnetize and have a lower
      demagnetization factor. This gives a stronger induction of
      magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      In laminated cores made from transformer or electrical steel
      plates, it is possible to significantly increase the insulation
      between the plates by means of gaskets made of plastic, cardboard,
      etc. The thickness of the dielectric plates can be comparable with
      and even exceed the thickness of the plates or steel sheets
      themselves. <br>
      <br>
      This dramatically reduces the demagnetizing factor and increases
      the induction of the magnetic field at the same length and
      thickness of the entire dial core of a ferromagnet. In principle,
      a device may simply have not a monolithic core (solid), but a
      series of individual cores arranged in parallel and separated by
      gaps from a dielectric to reduce mutual demagnetization. Such a
      core can be represented as a kind of a typesetting core in the
      form of a bundle of rods or plates, but also as a set of simply
      parallelly arranged separate cores in the form of rods or plates.
      In addition, each core in a bundle may have its own removable
      secondary winding.<br>
      <br>
      The core can also be composed in the form of successive segments
      separated by air gaps (from a dielectric) for the effect of
      partial separation of their magnetic fields. Around each core is
      also formed its own magnetic field due to gaps. The total magnetic
      flux of such a typesetting core of the segments may be
      significantly larger than that of a solid core of such a
      cross-sectional area. These are devices with a large number of
      cores. The magnetization coil may be surrounded by the cores of a
      ferromagnet on all sides, or it may be inserted into a window as a
      whole or a type-setting, simple or branched magnetic circuit. This
      may be a rectangular magnetic circuit, in the window of which a
      magnetizing coil (without a core) is simply inserted. Two opposite
      magnetic fluxes are formed in the core, and more in the branched
      magnetic circuit. A flat-shaped magnetization coil (short and
      wide) can be completely filled both outside and inside with
      ferromagnetic cores, but so there would be a place for
      short-circuiting the magnetic fields of the cores that do not
      cover (or partially cover) the magnetization coil wires.<br>
      <br>
      Any device of any complex shape can be easily technically
      represented as an integral sum of individual cores and one or more
      magnetization coils. Any topology of the magnetic circuit can be
      assembled from individual magnetization coils from cores of
      different shapes, whole or team in the form of segments. The cores
      can be joined as segments with large gaps for the separation of
      magnetic fields or with minimal gaps to obtain just the desired
      shape of the core. The shape of the section of the magnetization
      coil can be of various shapes, steep, rectangular or rounded. The
      magnetization coil can be flat, short, cylindrical or in the form
      of separate spaced sections. To improve the efficiency of
      magnetization, you can use two magnetization coils located on both
      sides of the ends of one core. In this case, the core of a
      ferromagnet is magnetized at once from both sides and the magnetic
      fields of the coils are added, which increases the efficiency and
      uniformity of magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      One magnetization coil may be located between two cores of a
      ferromagnet, located in the region of the gap between the cores.
      In this case, one coil magnetizes two cores at once. The
      magnetization coil can partially go along the plane on the ends of
      the cores, provided that the diameter, section of the coil is many
      times larger than the section of the core itself. But the simplest
      version of the device is a device with only one core of a
      ferromagnet. But variants of devices are possible with any large
      number of cores. Any device with a large number of cores and
      sections of the magnetization coil can be simply represented as a
      total integrated design of individual elements with one core. A
      large-diameter magnetization coil can partially go (along the
      plane of the ends of the coil) to the ends or to some parts of the
      cores themselves. Various smooth variations of the magnetic
      coupling are possible, and any ratios of the coil length and the
      length of the core (s) of a ferromagnet are possible.<br>
      <br>
      This applies to different devices and with any number of cores.
      The magnetic coupling of individual cores and the magnetization
      coil in general can be different in one device with a large number
      of cores. The magnetic effect of the coil field on the cores along
      the axis (from the plane) of the coil increases with increasing
      its diameter and this can be used in devices for more effective
      remote magnetization at a distance. This allows a better
      magnetization of the cores with less magnetic feedback with the
      magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      The device may consist, for example, of a magnetization coil of
      relatively large diameter or cross section (and rectangular, for
      example) and three cores. In this case, the magnetization coil
      (large diameter) can cover only the central core along the plane
      of the end parts, or partially enter the side cores or only the
      gaps or partially and the two side two cores themselves. There may
      be various smooth variations of the topology of the mutual
      arrangement and magnetic coupling, but they are not of fundamental
      importance. The magnetization coil can be as long as it is smaller
      than the central core, or to be approximately equal to it (taking
      into account gaps) or to be greater than the length of the central
      core. The magnetization coil can go edges (along the ends of the
      planes) on the side cores to varying degrees in different
      variations of the mutual inductive magnetic coupling. Due to this,
      the magnetic coupling with the core is regulated. The shape of the
      cores can be usual in the form of rods of rectangular or rounded
      cross-section or in the form of plates of a ferromagnet (ferrite,
      etc.).<br>
      <br>
      But special-shaped cores can be used. For example, cores in the
      form of a skeleton form (or shaped like a bobbin for threads) have
      a rectangular or rounded cross section, such as those used for
      inductance chokes made from ferrite. This special form of ferrite
      is also called a dumbbell. The shape of the ferrite dumbbell is
      similar in shape to Babin for cable or wires. The shape of the
      cross section of the parts may be round or rectangular. To
      increase the magnetization of the core may have separate toothed
      side projections on the ends. The magnetic field of the end parts
      is always very concentrated on these protrusions, ledges and teeth
      of the ends. The presence of lateral projections (at the end) of
      the core of a ferromagnet significantly changes the topology of
      the magnetic field, since the magnetic fluxes are concentrated on
      different projections. The side projections of a ferromagnet seem
      to concentrate and direct the magnetic fluxes laterally from the
      ends of the core, which reduces the length of the induction power
      lines and improves the closure of the magnetic energy in the near
      zone of the core.<br>
      <br>
      The side projections can be made at a solid core or made in the
      form of separate transverse lining on the end parts. The
      special-shaped cores with lateral protrusions in particular make
      it possible to sharply reduce the total magnetic coupling with the
      magnetization coil at the same distances, gaps and sizes. In
      profile, such a core is H-shaped. Lateral protrusions also
      significantly reduce the demagnetizing factor for a ferromagnetic
      core with the same longitudinal length of the core. The device can
      be in the form of a ferrite core in the form of a framework for
      threads and a magnetization coil, the diameter of which is several
      times larger than the cross section of the core and comparable to
      the length of the core itself. The magnetic energy of the core is
      largely, mostly, enclosed within such a magnetization coil, and no
      electric power is generated from its formation. And on the very
      core there is a special removable secondary winding for converting
      all the energy of the magnetic field of the core from a
      ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      This is one of the two basic principles of magnetic field
      separation topology. The magnetic field can be closed outside the
      coil plane (side) or partially or completely right in the coil
      plane itself due to the size of the magnetization coil itself,
      which is several times or many times larger than the cross section
      of the core itself. It is important to take into account the
      length of the core of the ferromagnet. A shorter core closes the
      magnetic field in the near zone of space better than a longer
      core. The typesetting core of successively located many short
      cores (through large gaps) allows one to significantly reduce the
      cross section width and the diameter of the magnetization coil. In
      this type of core with gaps around each short core, its own stray
      magnetic field is formed, which is closed in the near zone of
      space. This typesetting core can significantly reduce the size of
      the diameter, section of the magnetization coil. The device
      represents a magnetization coil and a core (solid or inlaid)
      inside it with a secondary winding.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter or cross section of the magnetization coil is several
      or many times larger than the cross section of the core itself.
      This is necessary for the closure of the energy of the magnetic
      field of the core inside the magnetization coil. When the load is
      demagnetized, the magnetization coil and the secondary winding are
      connected. Each core of the core should have its own secondary
      winding section, which covers the entire stray magnetic field of
      each core.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetization coil can be simply inserted into the air gap of
      a closed (almost closed) magnetic circuit, and then one
      magnetization coil is already working immediately on the two ends
      of the core. A magnetic circuit with a gap can be rectangular or
      in the form of a torus, and also be simple or branched, including
      the bulk of three, four or more branches. A simple magnetic
      circuit should have a gap for the location of the magnetization
      coil, the cross section of which is comparable to that of the ends
      of the magnetic circuit. Biasing the two ends at once magnetizes
      the entire core in the form of a torus or in the form of a
      rectangular magnetic circuit. In fact, it is almost a closed core
      and one magnetization coil, which works directly on the two ends
      of this core. The magnetic circuit of the device can be simple or
      branched of three (from the central and two side branches), four
      or five branches. Most of the magnetic field of such a core in the
      form of a magnetic circuit with a gap is not connected inductively
      with the magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic circuit can be in the form of many segments with
      large gaps to separate the magnetic fields of the cores, and
      instead of the magnetization coil just a straight wire (or coil
      turns) in the window of the magnetic circuit in the form of such a
      diagonal core (as in current transformers). The magnetic circuit
      can be rectangular or in the form of a torus or rounded. A
      magnetizing coil in such a device can be made in the form of a
      straight wire (or coils of a large coil) in the center of the
      window of such a magnetic circuit or in the form of separate
      sections located along different sectors. A significant part of
      the magnetic field energy of the segments of this magnetic circuit
      due to the large gaps is closed only around each segment and is
      not connected with the wires and turns of the coil (coil sections)
      of magnetization. The magnetic stray fields of individual segments
      are closed both in the outer regions of space around the magnetic
      circuit, and in the window of this composing magnetic circuit, if
      the window of the magnetic circuit is sufficiently large. The
      window of the magnetic circuit can be specifically increased to
      increase the scattering of the magnetic field and the number of
      segments.<br>
      <br>
      To increase the generation efficiency, it is also advantageous to
      use branched magnetic circuits (with three, four, five branches)
      from the segments, since with one and the same magnetization coil
      it is possible to magnetize several times more magnetic branches
      and segments from a ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      Each such segment of the magnetic circuit must have its own
      section of a secondary removable coil to convert all the energy of
      the magnetic field of the magnetization coil. The magnetizing
      current is fed to the direct wire in the magnetic circuit window
      or in the section of the magnetization coil, and when
      demagnetized, the magnetic energy of the stray fields of all the
      segments of the cores is converted into additional electrical
      energy through the secondary windings. This is a relatively closed
      type of magnetic circuit and magnetic system. But unlike all
      conventional magnetic circuits in classical electrical
      engineering, here specially created magnetic fields of scattering
      around each core (segment), which are not connected inductively
      with turns of magnetization and do not form a common magnetic
      field. This is a kind of magnetic field multiplication effect due
      to gaps and its special separation from the magnetizing current.
      The cores in such a partially closed magnetic system mutually
      magnetize each other a little through the gaps, but the magnitude
      of this interaction may be different depending on the size of
      these gaps.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field of the magnetizing current, the magnetic field
      strength of the current in the coil and as a local field and a
      magnetic field along the contour (the law of total current) also
      have a great effect on the magnetization of the segments. In
      devices of this type, many cores can be used at once, and mutual
      magnetization through gaps significantly reduces the demagnetizing
      factor for cores from a ferromagnet. But fundamentally in the
      physics of the process and in the principle of generation, there
      are no differences from the simplest device with a single core.<br>
      <br>
      Devices can operate in the mode of a pulse flyback converter when
      the current in the primary circuit is interrupted by a transistor
      locked by a thyristor or another key such as a brush collector or
      a lamp. It is possible to work simply from an external special
      source of pulsating current and voltage. It will be a kind of
      DC-DC booster converter with a much more than 100% efficiency
      converter. Such devices can be used to boost charge recharging of
      batteries or capacitor banks in uninterrupted or autonomous power
      systems. The magnetizing coil and the secondary winding are turned
      on when charging in the mode and according to the booster
      converter circuit and work to charge the batteries or the
      capacitor. With the accumulation of magnetic field energy from a
      DC source, only the magnetization coil operates, and when
      demagnetized in series with the magnetization coil (and DC
      source), the secondary winding is turned on and energy goes to the
      second DC drive.<br>
      <br>
      The transformation of the entire energy of the magnetic field of a
      ferromagnet by the secondary winding induces additional electric
      power, which also enters the second constant-voltage drive. In
      this case, one battery or capacitor (ionistor or other) is
      discharged, and the other is charged, but the second one is
      charged for more energy than the first one is discharged. The
      total energy of the two batteries increases, which allows you to
      create uninterrupted DC power sources and without any external
      recharging. In such devices, a DC-DC converter with an efficiency
      greater than 100% can recharge batteries or capacitors without an
      external voltage source. This allows you to create fully
      autonomous DC power sources for powering any electronics, home
      appliances, communication and navigation equipment, toys, etc.
      electronics and technology.<br>
      <br>
      Energy conversion by the booster of the pulse converter allows you
      to dramatically increase the power factor when working on charging
      a capacitor battery or battery to overcome the voltage already
      created on the battery or capacitor. In this case, the primary
      voltage source, the magnetization coil and the secondary winding
      (when the key is opened) are switched on in series to charge the
      secondary capacitor or battery. This allows you to recharge the
      second DC source (batteries, capacitors) with more energy than the
      first one is discharged. In sum, such a system of DC voltage
      accumulators is never discharged and can even increase the
      accumulated charge. Independent or parallel operation of coils and
      windings for different loads or accumulators is possible according
      to different switching schemes.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetizing coil and the secondary winding can work both
      sequentially for a common load according to a voltage boosting
      (booster) converter circuit and in parallel for different loads or
      for a common special capacitive voltage adder from capacitors. In
      a capacitive capacitor voltage adder, the individual capacitors
      are charged independently and in parallel, and then switched on
      and discharged together in series to the common load. The
      additional energy is generated by the secondary winding due to the
      conversion of the entire magnetic field of the core of their
      ferromagnet into additional electric power.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to work directly from the AC or pulsed AC
      (rectangular from the inverter) or sinusoidal voltage, including
      the power frequency. During the current rise phase (and
      magnetization), only the magnetization coil operates, and during
      the current falloff phase and demagnetization, the secondary
      winding also operates, which is connected in series with the
      primary winding for a common load. Thus, switching the windings
      into the desired phases, you can immediately get a direct
      amplification of AC power of any, including power frequency. Such
      AC amplifiers can be used to self-excite an oscillating LC circuit
      and cut off current consumption from the network or simply
      directly amplify the power of a common network or the power of an
      alternator for autonomous power. The transformation of energy
      through the secondary winding provides additional energy to the
      circuit during the fall, decrease of the current and allows to
      obtain continuous oscillations of alternating current even under
      load.<br>
      <br>
      During the current growth phase, only the magnetization coil is
      connected to the circuit, and during the current decay phase, the
      current drops in series with it and the secondary winding is
      turned on to generate additional reactive electricity of
      alternating current. This allows amplifying both pulsating current
      and alternating current of any form of voltage, including power
      frequency, sinusoidal alternating current, both single-phase
      current and three-phase current (three devices per each phase). An
      alternating current amplifier device can work directly directly on
      an alternating current and on a pulsating current of only one
      polarity, but even then two devices will be needed (pull-pull) for
      each phase of the alternating current. For a three-phase circuit
      will need to have six devices. A device for amplifying an
      alternating current can also operate with a pulsating voltage and
      current and be switched on according to an excitation circuit of
      an alternating current circuit like a three-point oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      The concept of demagnetization and magnetization is conditional,
      since the energy in a ferromagnet is stored in the form of
      magnetic elastic energy of the domains of a ferromagnet. When the
      core is magnetized by permanent magnets, it is possible to work
      both on the magnetization cycle and on the magnetic reversal of
      magnetic induction in the opposite direction. Reversal of the core
      in the opposite direction doubles the almost full amplitude of the
      magnetic induction, which increases the useful EMF and power of
      the device. The magnetization of the core by permanent magnets
      sharply increases the magnetic total interaction of the domains of
      the ferromagnet with the field of magnetization of the current in
      both weak and strong magnetic fields. The use of magnetization
      reversal of the core magnetized by permanent magnets also allows
      you to dramatically increase the amplitude of the magnetic
      induction when working to increase the EMF and the total power of
      the device. A core with permanent magnets by the external magnetic
      field of the current can be magnetized, demagnetized to zero, or
      in general reversal can be reversed to increase the amplitude of
      the voltage.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to understand that there is an important
      effective magnetization and formally even the presence of several
      (and even more) turns of the magnetization coil on the core of a
      ferromagnet (in order to circumvent a patent, for example) do not
      change the essence of the magnetic process and the work of
      magnetization. It is only important that the overall work on the
      magnetization is determined by the balance of the ampere turns of
      the magnetization coil and the topology of the device.<br>
      <br>
      Devices begin with the simplest options on one core, when the
      magnetization coil is adjacent to one end of the core or the coil
      of a larger diameter (section) partially comes to an end on the
      coil plane. The simplest option is one magnetizing coil, just
      adjacent to the end of one straight core (simple or special
      shape). The second option is already two coils from two sides,
      from two ends of the core and which work in a pair for mutual
      amplification, and the core is magnetized from both sides at once.
      This option can be viewed simply as two different two sections of
      one common magnetization spaced apart, but which work together on
      one core. The magnetization coils can either abut the ends of the
      core or partially enter them along the plane, but the coil must be
      significantly or several times larger than the cross section of
      the core itself. The core should not tightly adjoin the wires of
      the coil of magnetization of a large diameter, which is desirable,
      but not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      And it is better when the core is closer to the axis (and parallel
      to it) of the magnetization coil. To reduce the magnetic coupling
      of the coil and the core, use either a different distance from the
      coil to the core or an increase in the diameter itself; the
      section of the magnetization coil is several times larger than the
      section of the core. The distance from the wires of the coil to
      the core is chosen so that a significant magnetic field of the
      core would be formed not connected with the magnetization coil.
      Any smooth transitions of mutual arrangement and magnetic coupling
      between the coil and the core (s) of a ferromagnet are possible.
      The number of separate parallel or successive cores (through the
      gaps) in the coil can be any, two, three, four or more. The degree
      of magnetic coupling of the coil (or its individual sections) with
      individual cores of the chain can be different and smoothly vary
      within different limits. The magnetization coil may be shorter
      than the core itself (whole or from segments), be approximately
      equal to the length or have a length greater than the length of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetizing coil can completely or only partially cover
      individual cores or part of a chain of cores separated by gaps.
      The magnetization coil can go along the ends of the planes (and in
      length) and cover only one or a part of consecutive cores
      separated by gaps.<br>
      <br>
      The device can be in the form of a single magnetization coil,
      which is located between the cores in the region of the gap
      between them and works simultaneously on two cores. The coil
      relative to the diameter (several times larger in cross section
      than the cores themselves) may partially cover the ends of the
      cores along the plane. The coil does not abut tightly to the cores
      (preferably), and the core is located closer to the middle of the
      magnetization coil. The location of the coil in the region of the
      gaps sharply reduces the magnetic coupling with the cores and this
      applies to devices of any number of elements. For example, the
      magnetization coil is located between the ends (or covering the
      air gap) with two simple straight cores or cores of a special
      T-shaped or E-shaped form (to reduce the demagnetizing factor).
      The cores can be any special for more efficient magnetization and
      reduction of the demagnetizing factor. There can be two
      magnetization coils between two U-shaped cores or in the gap area,
      and between two E-shaped cores and three magnetizing coils.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">E-shaped cores that can be part
        of a branched magnetic circuit.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      The core itself can be either solid or composed of several
      segments separated by gaps. To increase the magnetic scattering,
      the core itself may have a non-uniform cross section and, for
      example, have a broadening of the cross-sectional area in the
      central part of the core. The cross-sectional area of the end
      parts adjacent to the magnetization coils may be several times
      smaller than the cross-sectional area of the central part of the
      core. In this case, the magnetic effect on the coils is reduced,
      and the magnetic energy of the core increases. This broadening of
      the cross-sectional area of the core in the central part can be
      both smooth and with rectangular ledges that perform the function
      of additional scattering. This special shape of the core (to
      increase magnetic scattering) is a unique part of the invention
      and is applicable to almost all other device variants, especially
      to increase the efficiency of work. In conventional electrical
      engineering, such core forms are not needed and are not applied in
      principle. Cores of a special form are a special part of the
      invention, as this applies to almost all variants of devices.<br>
      <br>
      Also to special forms of cores can be attributed to the cores of
      the segments, separated by gaps for the partial separation of the
      magnetic fields of the core. Cores with lateral protrusions (and
      lining creating protrusions) also belong to the cores of a special
      shape and are applicable to different versions of devices. The
      cores can be from ferrite or laminated from sheets of transformer,
      electrical steel or from any other ferromagnet. Another option is
      one magnetizing coil (from one or several sections) which is
      inserted into a large gap of the magnetic circuit and works
      directly to magnetize the two ends of the ferromagnetic core. The
      size of the cross section or the diameter of the coil can be
      approximately equal, smaller or several times larger than the
      cross section of the very end of the core. The magnetization coil
      either adjoins the ends of the core at a certain distance or
      partially covers both end parts (along the plane) of the core,
      provided that the magnetization coil is several times wider than
      the core itself.<br>
      <br>
      One magnetization coil works directly to magnetize two ends of one
      core of a ferromagnet. This type of magnetic system can also
      consist of any number of cores and magnetization coils between
      them or in the region of gaps between the cores. The magnetic
      system can be open or closed along the contour with an annular or
      rectangular magnetic circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The core itself may have a non-uniform cross section and have a
      wider cross-sectional area in the magnetic equator region, and the
      ends should have a smaller cross-sectional area. This reduces the
      magnetic interaction with the coils, but significantly increases
      the effective effective cross-sectional area of the core and the
      magnetic scattering itself. The core may also have a wider central
      part, and the cross-sectional area of the end parts is several
      times smaller than the central part. The core can be either solid
      or composed of separate segments separated by gaps (for partial
      separation of magnetic fields) to obtain a large magnetic flux.
      The secondary detachable winding is located closer to the magnetic
      equator of the core, to the line between the magnetic poles and
      around which the magnetic flux of the core closes. For the core of
      the segments you need to have removable windings (or sections of
      the common winding) already on each segment separately for
      conversion and all the intrinsic magnetic fields of each core.<br>
      <br>
      This applies in general to all dial cores from individual segments
      (with gaps) in all variants of devices.<br>
      <br>
      Another type of magnetic system is when the cores are located
      directly inside the magnetization coil itself with respect to the
      large diameter of the magnetization coil, and the separation of
      the magnetic field occurs due to the closure of a large part of
      the magnetic field energy right inside the magnetization coil.
      This is achieved due to the fact that the diameter or cross
      section of the coil (rectangular section for example) is several
      or many times larger than the cross section of the core, and the
      length and width of the core has a certain ratio to the width of
      the section of the magnetization coil itself. The simplest version
      of the device is a device with one simple straight core made of
      ferrite, steel or any other ferromagnet. The core can be rounded
      or rectangular or of special shape with lateral protrusions on the
      end parts. The core can be solid or inlaid (with or without gaps)
      and in general any special form to increase the efficiency of
      magnetic scattering and magnetization. The core can also be in the
      form of parallel arranged packs of separate narrower cores
      separated by nonmagnetic gaps from a dielectric or air.<br>
      <br>
      The core can also be dialed in the form of sequentially disposed
      cores separated by gaps for partial separation of the magnetic
      fields of the cores. Each such core must have its own removable
      winding or a separate section of the common secondary winding to
      convert all the magnetic energy of each core.<br>
      <br>
      The core is made up in the form of a bundle of parallel cores can
      have its own separate removable windings on each rod. Different
      devices can be combined into a partially closed common magnetic
      circuit (with gaps) for small mutual magnetization and
      collaboration. The device can be, for example, in the form of a
      magnetic closed circuit in the form of a torus or in the form of a
      rectangular magnetic circuit (with gaps) from a variety of
      individual segments. The magnetization coil can be in the form of
      a generally direct wire (or coil wires) in the window of this
      magnetic circuit or in the form of separate coil sections spaced
      apart by sectors of this magnetic circuit. Most of the intrinsic
      magnetic fields of the segments (due to large gaps) from the
      ferromagnet of this magnetic circuit are in no way connected
      inductively to the coil (or wires) of the magnetization. This
      intrinsic magnetic energy of the cores is not included in the cost
      of magnetization, but it can be converted into electricity using
      secondary detachable windings on each segment.<br>
      <br>
      It is such a kind of flyback converter, but with a more complex
      magnetic field topology.<br>
      <br>
      Inside the magnetization coil there can be several such composing
      stacks of cores. A separate type of device is a magnetization
      coil, inside which there are many small or micro cores or
      particles of a ferromagnet separated by a dielectric. The core can
      be in the form of a kind of magnetic dielectric, in which small
      cores or microcores or generally microparticles from a ferromagnet
      are located (or embedded in a dielectric) inside one common
      magnetization coil. The degree of mutual magnetic action of such
      microcores can be any, as well as the gaps between them. But the
      gaps (dielectric) between the cores and the particles of a
      ferromagnet should be large enough to ensure the possibility of
      closing all the internal stray fields. Around each core or
      particle of a ferromagnet forms its own magnetic field in the
      nearest space zone. This internal magnetic field of cores and
      particles from a ferromagnet is in no way inductively connected to
      a common magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      And the formation of this internal magnetic energy of the
      microcores does not waste energy in the external magnetization
      coil. But it can be transformed into additional useful electric
      power in the demagnetization phase through secondary windings. The
      magnetizing current is supplied only to the external large coil,
      and the magnetic energy is removed already from it and from each
      individual core or ferromagnetic particle. To do this, each
      particle or micro core of a ferromagnet must have its own
      secondary removable winding (or secondary winding section) that
      covers the entire magnetic field of each core. When demagnetized
      into magnetic energy, the entire magnetic energy of all the cores
      or particles is converted from a ferromagnet. This internal
      magnetic energy of all the cores can many times, many dozens and
      even hundreds of times greater than the energy that was spent on
      magnetization in the common large coil of magnetization. The
      device should work on the return stroke and generate additional
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The device can be of different shapes of magnetization coils and
      different shapes of micro cores or particles of a ferromagnet.
      Cores and chains can be shunted by magnetic shunts through the
      gaps for more effective mutual amplification of the magnetization
      and field closures. The cores can be either special U-shaped or
      U-shaped around the magnetization coil, both inside and outside
      the coil at any angles to the plane of the coil and in any
      quantity. Such cores are shaped like cores with lateral
      projections. The special shape improves the magnetic field closure
      and increases the effective length and magnetization of the cores,
      since the longer core is magnetized better. Any forms of cores and
      variants of the location of the cores relative to the
      magnetization coil or the direct portion of the wire (s) with
      current are possible.<br>
      <br>
      Devices of different topology of the magnetic field and the shape
      of the cores (and their number) are united by the fact that when
      magnetized in space, the magnetic energy of the field of the
      ferromagnet is not connected inductively with the magnetization
      coil. But the magnetization coil spends and only as much energy on
      the magnetization as it is inductively connected with the
      magnetization coil itself. And this means that the energy of the
      magnetic field of a ferromagnet not connected with the
      magnetization coil is already formed for nothing, without any
      additional costs of electricity. But it can easily be technically
      transformed into additional electricity (beyond costs) when
      demagnetized with the help of a special additional secondary
      removable winding on the core itself. The secondary winding covers
      and converts the entire energy of the magnetic field of the core
      into additional electrical energy in excess of the cost of
      magnetization. The device can have only one core, but also have
      several cores, tens, hundreds and more for micro cores and
      microparticles from a ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      But the very principle of generation is the same in the physics of
      the process and in the technique of converting the energy of the
      magnetic field. The devices differ only in the form, topology of
      the entire common magnetic system and magnetic fields, as well as
      the number of elements themselves, the magnetization coils and the
      cores themselves from a ferromagnet. The shape of the cores and
      the material of the ferromagnet may be different or be the same in
      different devices. The cores may be of special shape for magnetic
      scattering and magnetization or of ordinary geometric shapes. In
      these devices there is no special magnetizing core with dense
      winding, and additional energy can be removed from all cores of
      the magnetic system.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic system of any shape and degree of complexity can be
      represented as an integral sum of individual elements from coils
      and cores. The total amount of individual coils can be represented
      simply as separate sections of a common magnetization coil, and
      the cores as a kind of common composing core of individual
      segments. At the same time, individual elements and coils and
      cores mutually additionally magnetize each other to varying
      degrees, and the magnitude of this interaction depends on the gaps
      between the cores. A decrease in the magnetic coupling of the
      coils and cores is achieved either by a certain distance from the
      ends of the core or by increasing the dimensions of the cross
      section of the magnetization coils themselves relative to the
      width of the cross section and the length of the core. This gives
      the greatest magnetization efficiency, but requires an increased
      coil size. This also increases the air (vacuum) component of the
      magnetic energy of the current itself, which is not associated
      with a ferromagnet, does not participate in magnetization, but
      loads the magnetization coil.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that the magnetic interaction of the cores itself
      may not be significant, and the magnetization occurs almost
      exclusively from the magnetic field of the current in the wires of
      the magnetization coil. Chains in the form of a chain of shorter
      cores (separated by gaps) are located either axially coaxially in
      the coil or simply inside a relatively large magnetization coil,
      but so that a significant portion of the core fields do not
      encompass the wires of the magnetization coil. This, in principle,
      does not differ from the version with one core, but shorter cores
      make it possible to reduce the size of the diameter or
      cross-section (maybe a rectangular and other cross-sectional shape
      of any coil) of the magnetization coil. Also, the magnetic effect
      of the cores themselves (two, three or more) through the gaps
      allows to reduce the demagnetizing factor for short cores and
      increase their induction. And the principle of separation of
      magnetic fields allows for a greater magnetic flux and magnetic
      energy from a single volume and mass of the core of a ferromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      Short cores can store more magnetic elastic energy than longer
      cores. Therefore, such type-setting cores in the form of
      successively located in a chain through the gaps of short cores
      can store more magnetic energy. But the presence of large gaps
      between the cores requires an increase in ampere turns in the
      magnetization coil to overcome the magnetic resistance. The
      simplest version of the device is just one core (of a certain
      length) located approximately coaxially or simply inside a much
      larger cross section of a wide magnetization coil. The core may
      partly enter the coil plane with the end part or not even enter
      the plane of the large magnetization coil itself, but the magnetic
      field of the coil will almost also affect the core due to its
      size. The magnetization coil can be short, almost flat (in the
      form of a coil in shape) and much shorter in height than a
      ferromagnetic core. The device may have many cores located on all
      sides around the coil and around just a straight or bent wire,
      wires of the magnetization coil and which form multiple magnetic
      circuits (with gaps) as if strung on currents.<br>
      <br>
      This allows the use of all the magnetic field surrounding the
      magnetizing currents (and the direct current, the current of the
      coil and the magnetization coil), which is closed around them from
      all sides.<br>
      <br>
      The core can also be divided into many parallel separate narrower
      cores separated by gaps to reduce the demagnetizing factor and
      increase the magnetic scattering. Each core can have its own
      removable secondary winding.<br>
      <br>
      The method and device generation can be used to generate
      electricity in small devices to power the equipment and
      instruments and for the industrial production of electricity at
      any power. For high-power devices, you can use either reverse mode
      on a constant pulse or pulsating current on high-power lockable
      thyristors or generation directly on alternating current. Devices
      can be used to recharge batteries, batteries or capacitors and
      create uninterrupted power sources. For this purpose, the use of a
      voltage boosting voltage is optimal. booster type conversion as a
      series connection of the battery, the magnetization coil and the
      secondary winding (in reverse) to charge another battery or a
      block of capacitors. Conversion by so-called. the booster circuit
      goes on reverse, and when magnetized, only the magnetization coil
      is connected to the current source. There are various options for
      the circuits of technology and switching windings.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field energy of ferromagnetics (not connected with
      the magnetization coil) through the secondary winding is converted
      into additional energy, which is used to charge another battery or
      capacitor. This allows you to recharge batteries and capacitors
      with increased current, voltage and charge and create a completely
      autonomous energy sources that do not require an external source
      of charging. Such converters can work when parallel winding on
      different batteries or through a common capacitive voltage adder
      (capacitor) for a total load in the end. Schemes of inclusion and
      transformation may be different. When charging capacitors and
      batteries, you can also switch capacitors as they are charged to
      more fully charge and reduce the peak distortion of the pulsed
      mode. In this case, the first capacitor should not smooth out the
      peak of the pulse very much and for this its capacity should not
      be too large, and as one capacitor charges, it switches off and
      another higher capacity switches on.<br>
      <br>
      Such a capacitive drive already consists of several (two or three
      or more) capacitor accumulation stages, which are switched as they
      are charged in order to fully convert the falling current pulse
      into a charge of the drive. This allows you to use and convert
      into the capacitor almost all the accumulated magnetic energy. The
      capacitor of the first stage can have a non-zero certain initial
      charge to increase the equivalent resistance (and reduce, limit
      the first current pulse) and the effect of smoothing the pulse
      mode of the device. This increases the power factor of the
      capacitive capacitor rectifier drive and allows you to save the
      speed of the decay edges of magnetic induction and efficiency in a
      pulsed mode of operation.<br>

      The invention relates to reverse transformers configured on
      several ferromagnetic cores divided by an air gap. A magnetizing
      winding is configured on only one or a part of the cores, forming
      a magnetizing inductor. When a current is supplied to the
      magnetizing winding, the ferromagnetic core of the inductor is
      magnetized, as are the neighbouring cores via the air gap. The air
      gap is selected so that a significant part of the magnetic field
      of the cores is closed across the air, forming a secondary
      magnetic leakage field. Part of the magnetic field of all the
      cores is closed across the magnetic circuit via the air gap,
      forming a common magnetic circuit and a common magnetic flux. The
      magnetic leakage field of the cores is closed outside the inductor
      and does not play a part in the magnetic interaction of said
      components, nor does it form a common magnetic flux linkage with
      the magnetizing winding of the inductor. Thus, it does not affect
      the establishment of a current in the inductor winding because it
      does not generate emf against the current during magnetization.
      The windings of the secondary cores encompass the entire magnetic
      field thereof and serve merely to convert all the secondary
      magnetic leakage fluxes into electrical energy during
      demagnetization. This results in a more complete conversion of all
      the magnetic energy in the structure into electrical energy.<br>

      Comment: Leonaldo Bezerra -- The secret is: - Magnetic fields of
      equal poles confronted and lagged by 90 degrees. These coils that
      generate the fields are the primary windings and stay on the
      secondary windings. The secondary windings are closer to the core.
      The lag can be made by a capacitor in series with one of the coils
      or another electronic device, as well as some turns wound in the
      winding itself in the opposite direction.﻿ <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the effect of electricity generation on
      the basis of Faraday's electromagnetic induction. It allows
      through the use of ferromagnetic materials and a special magnetic
      field topology in the system to receive the excess energy of the
      magnetic field and convert it into usable electricity in unlimited
      amounts. Since 1831 a. Michael Faraday discovered the law of
      electromagnetic induction, no significant additions have been made
      to it. In particular, all the magnetic fields of magnetic circuits
      considered rigidly connected with wires like a simply connected
      system. For example, in the simplest case, the magnetization of
      ferromagnetic thought that everything is linked to the current
      magnetic circuit, winding magnetization. However, in the simplest
      case, a magnetic circuit consisting of two or three ferromagnetic
      volumes separated by nonmagnetic gap may occur magnetic fields do
      not form a flux coil magnetization is closed loop with current.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theory of operation of electrical current
      source (electricity) to create a magnetic field is determined by
      the energy of the magnetic field through the coils of the
      magnetizing coil, plus the loss in the wires and hardware. The
      work of the current source is determined by the formula:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually the work of the current source, the
      cost of electricity to create a magnetic field in the magnetic
      circuit is equal to the energy of the magnetic field through the
      coil with current. Thus, the energy of the magnetic field system,
      which is shorted out the turns of the magnetizing coil does not
      affect the setting of current in the coil and does not require for
      their formation cost of electricity from the power source,
      battery, generator, and so forth. For example, if we magnetize the
      iron (ferromagnetic) bar and next arrange another by separating it
      with a small air gap, the second bar magnet and magnetized, but
      apart from the total magnetic field arises around the bars of the
      second bar their magnetic field only closed around him and does
      not participate in the magnetic interaction between the two
      ferromagnetic volume. This magnetic field I called secondary. This
      field has no connection with the inductive coil magnetization in
      the first iron bar, and most importantly does not require on their
      education no electricity from the magnetization power supply. The
      secondary magnetic field has a certain energy which can be
      converted into useful energy. To do this, when demagnetization
      (turned off, decreases the current in the coil on the ground rod)
      on the second ferromagnetic volume (rod, bar) is removable special
      winding, which is connected to the load only when the
      demagnetization (not involved in the magnetization). Thus, all of
      the energy of the secondary magnetic field can be transformed into
      a series of additional useful energy.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of iron (ferromagnetic) rods in the
      magnetic circuit can be infinite, under certain conditions. In
      some ferromagnetic means magnetic interactions can be extended to
      infinity. For example, domains turn in magnetodielectrics,
      fluctuations elektromagnitikov powders of ferromagnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such systems, most of the energy of the
      magnetic field of the magnetic circuit has no direct connection
      with the inductive magnetizing source. There is a huge amount of
      magnetic circuits, where you can get a secondary magnetic field,
      magnetizing coil is closed. This secondary magnetic energy can be
      used to generate electricity. Dozens of devices for the generation
      of electricity on the pulse and alternating current, including
      directly sinusoidal current at power frequency: 50: 60Hz. It is
      sufficient to conventional transformer iron wires and power
      electronics components.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outdoor physical effect of energy generation, I
      as the author called Transgeneratsiey electricity. Effect
      brilliantly confirmed in a simple experiment, and has been
      thoroughly studied in the research on different types of
      ferromagnetic materials and magnetic circuits.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is the international patenting of
      inventions based on this effect in many countries. Patented a
      method of power generation and a number of devices based on this
      method.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the point of view of theoretical physics
      the effect of generation is possible due to the special nature of
      quantum ferromagentikov. The magnetic field is formed by the
      electron spin - magnetic moments of electrons. Unlike conventional
      electron currents in the wires back absolutely not responsive to
      the so-called zero inductive impedance (resistance). When
      magnetized to it only needs to exert a magnetic field, not the
      electric power in the coils with electric current. In magnetic
      systems with a secondary magnetic field arises (generated by) the
      additional energy of the magnetic field, which can be easily
      converted into additional useful energy in its purest form.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In systems with a secondary magnetic field,
      there is also a secondary electric field together form a vector
      Poynting energy flow directed into the ferromagnetic volume from
      the surrounding physical continuum, rather than from the
      magnetization coil wires.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transgeneratsiya electricity can generate clean
      electricity from ferromagnets in unlimited quantities. Ferromagnet
      plays the role of the quantum of the electromagnetic pump pumping
      energy from the physical continuum and converts it due to the
      Faraday effect in electricity.<br>

      windings with a transistor operating in the audio range, and the
      other may contain a half wave rectified AC source. Anyone else
      find this interesting?<br>
      <br>
      The loose fitting of the inner and outer windings allows for some
      motional movement of the inner winding with iron core with respect
      to the outer winding(s). At first glance this smacks of something
      like a yfree or McFrey NMR or NAR device with the 1/2 wave
      rectification of AC mains providing a variable B field for the
      core while the high audio frequency pulses the core at NMR or NAR
      rate.<br>
      <br>
      Am I wrongly interpreting this or is Melnichenko on to something
      more basic, as the frequencies don't seem right for NAR?<br>
      <br>
      Is this just a loosely coupled switchmode driven core with
      captured flyback? In other videos he stresses the loose coupling
      or large magnetic gap.<br>
      <br>
      Any additional info on why this guy has around 100 videos all
      trying to communicate some basic idea would be helpful.<br>

      He has both scope probes connected and traces seem to be overlaid.
      One of the pulses is very sharp, the other has a large area under
      the decay portion.<br>

      Comments welcome and any info helpful but stay on topic please.<br>

      Looks like he published his basic circuit in a Russian magazine
      some time back. It seems to be a basic switchmode circuit where he
      absorbs the primary flyback with a lamp and may be lighting the
      lamp on the secondary with either the coupled flyback pulse or the
      forward pulse. No dots on the circuit so can't tell.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe nothing new here except for the extremely loose coupling and
      large core gap (open ended)<br>
      <br>
      He is putting in a very narrow pulse from the rectified 240V
      mains. Part of his method is the offsetting of the inner core,
      which he believes helps in some way.<br>
      <br>
      At least his ampere measurement is well filtered, but I have not
      been able to find any rough input power measurements...<br>
      <br>
      I'm going to try a sim of this circuit with a loosely coupled
      transformer.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ion, This is your sim of Melnichenko's circuit with the addition
      of input and output power calcs.&nbsp; The efficiency is quite
      high at 52.719/53.063 = .994.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some of Melnichenco's posts on his website that are
      translated into English. <br>
      <br>
      After reading some of these and pondering a bit on what he is
      saying, I would speculate that he is moving the bloch wall in the
      iron core using two tightly coupled windings that are offset from
      one another in regards to their electromagnetic center
      lines.&nbsp; One winding would be a primary that is first
      conducting and then turned off and then the other winding or
      secondary would conduct via the collapsing field from the
      primary.&nbsp; The centerline or bloch walls for these two
      windings are offset from each other and therefore would
      theoretically produce a moving wall.&nbsp; An additional secondary
      placed outside this arrangement would/could be induced with the
      moving wall plus normal transformer induction. If this is the
      case, then the sim Ion posted above would have one winding with
      the polarity reversed.<br>
      <br>
      Edit:&nbsp; The winding polarities shown in the original schematic
      are correct.<br>

      Andrei Melnichenko seems to attracting attention of many
      researchers. I would like to say a few words about him.<br>
      <br>
      Melnichenko is a legendary person; he can be compared in many ways
      to Hector from EVGRAY.<br>
      He was one of the first people who talk about FE in late 1990 on
      Russian state TV and demonstrate RV-like setup with one phase
      motor.<br>
      The setup was running a fan from little 9v battery for several
      hours. I think he was the first from whom I heard about FE.<br>
      According to rumors he is former military engineer and he was
      threatened by KGB for attracting public attention for military
      technology.<br>
      He got different patents how to achieve OU, but as usual never
      give enough info to reproduce and never showed anything really OU
      publicly.<br>
      Even it was almost 20 years ago nobody replicated his devices and
      his claims continue to disturb minds of FE researchers including
      me.<br>
      There is an ”urban legend” that in 1995 Melnichenko was showing a
      device which was lighting 60W bulb from small 9v battery.<br>
      The device was using a coil with strange construction, it looks
      like a dumbbell and contained metallic shield.<br>
      In that days people on forums were thinking that this is same kind
      of shield or shorted turn and were comparing it to Tesla patent
      433702.<br>
      It was also told that Melnichenko spend significant time to
      adjusting/selecting this shield or gap in it.&nbsp; There are two
      drawings (see att. 1.jpg and 2.jpg) associated with this story.<br>
      <br>

          height="298"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Many people spent considerable time and effort trying replicate
      Melnichenko's devices without success.<br>
