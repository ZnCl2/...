      " ...In revelation we find 144,000 people being sealed in their
      fore heads, for the very purpose of delivering the world from the
      great tribulation, after the 'kings of the earth, the rich men and
      all others had gotten the nations into such difficulty that many
      were killing themselves, and were crying out for the mountains and
      rocks to fall on them. Immediately after the sealing a great
      multitude was seen saying salvation to our God, what could have
      rought such a change? The mission of this book is to prepare these
      people who will correct the wrong mental image and to teach the
      laws of the creation and formation of living things from the
      school of the Magi,the secret of creation through the salts. They
      will convert destruction into the lands of paradise... "<br>

          Life</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Charles Edward Tingley</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Succeeding the experiments of Loeb and prior to those of Burke
      were those announced by Dr Charles Littlefield, but since the
      claims of the latter were so exceedingly broad and the methods
      employed so very loose the scientific world paid very little
      attention to them. Nevertheless, a widespread interest has been
      created in the man and his work by the popular press, for the
      subject is one which appeals no less strongly to the lay than to
      the technically trained mind. For this reason a critical review of
      his experiments may not be ill-timed.<br>
      <br>
      What lends a glamor to the researches of this biologist is the
      fact that he cherishes the illusion of having actually produced
      not only the simple organic cell, but also a much higher and more
      complex form of life. The method by which he has generated
      supposed life is a sterile soil he does not seek to conceal, but
      instead gives a clear and connected account of it as well as of
      the theory upon which it rests, and though one may well find fault
      with the first, certainly no objection can be raised to the
      second.<br>
      <br>
      The following instructions and description of the operation have
      been given by Dr Littlefield by which the microorganisms are
      supposed to be produced. The supplies are of the simplest kind and
      can be obtained in any drug store. These comprise a large but
      shallow glass vessel, having a capacity of one quart, several
      smaller glass dishes, a bell jar sufficiently large to include
      these receptacles, and finally, a good high-power microscope. The
      chemicals used are sodium chloride, or common table salt, alcohol,
      ammonia, and distilled water. In the larger vessels 2 ounces of
      the salt is dissolved in 6 ounces of the water, and when this is
      done 6 ounces of 90 % pure alcohol is added.<br>
      <br>
      A portion of the solution thus formed is poured out of the larger
      into the smaller dishes, when 2 ounces of official aqua ammonia is
      stirred in with a clean glass rod, and the bell jar is then placed
      over them. A chemical reaction is set up and in the course of a
      few minutes bubbles of hydrogen will begin to form on the surface
      of the&nbsp; fluid, and a closer observation will show these
      little spheres to be gyrating with high velocity. In the course of
      half an hour the bubbles will cease to form; the liquid is then
      ready for the crucial test. With the microscope at hand and
      previously focused so that a globule of the unstable solution may
      be quickly observed, a very small portion is transferred from the
      dish to the glass slide, where the latter is adjusted on the stage
      and a magnified view is had. On examination detached particles of
      matter are seen moving through the medium from the center to the
      circumference with extreme rapidity, and continued investigation
      indicates other changes the liquid is undergoing. Crystals begin
      to appear, and those first formed are the characteristic
      transparent cubes of sodium chloride, and hence these are
      incapable of further development. After these, other crystals
      follow, and some assume a hexagonal form on the surface of the
      saturated solution, and it is from these latter minute six-sided
      bodies that the growth of the elementary organisms is said to take
      place.<br>
      <br>
      The point is now reached, according to Dr Littlefield, where the
      intangible force we know as life joins the lifeless matter, as
      current electricity energizes a coil of wire, and a microscopic
      organism possessing what Herbert Spencer defines as the
      "coordination of actions" begins its existence, which consists of
      a series of definite and successive changes, both in structure and
      composition, which takes place within itself and without
      destroying its identity.<br>
      <br>
      The growth of this supposed rudimentary vital element next follows
      in sequence, and as it is metamorphosed from the hexagonal crystal
      into a free, smooth, disk-shaped cell, we are informed that it
      bears a close resemblance to a red blood corpuscle. The cellular
      disk now gradually expands in a direction at right angles to its
      surfaces and an ovoid form results from which pseudopodia or
      temporary extensions protrude similar to the amoeba, and which in
      the latter are designed to take in food, for locomotion, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In commenting on his achievements, the doctor says: "I have
      carefully watched the development of a large number of these cells
      or germs, and they do not vary in the least detail as to their
      growth from the above description, showing unmistakable design and
      the actuality of life's processes. Moreover, mineral substances do
      not change except by accretions from without, and then not always
      in regular form and order. From the result of my experiments I am
      forced to conclude that there are two factors responsible for the
      manifestation known as life; one is a force or influence due to
      certain vibrations of the ether, and the other is a certain
      combination of atoms so arranged as to be capable of responding to
      these impressed vibrations. As an illustration, they act somewhat
      as the rods and cones of the optic nerve in the retina of the eye,
      which are so constituted that they may receive and focus certain
      vibrations of the luminiferous ether, giving us the phenomena of
      light and the sensations of sight. So there are combinations in
      nature so constituted and arranged in their atomic structure as to
      arrest the vibrations which act as electromagnetic manifestations
      of a higher order than those of light, and these give us the
      phenomena of physical life, and the physical basis of this
      compound is salt, ammonia, and water in the presence of hydrogen,
      easily obtainable from alcohol, which is made up largely of this
      gas." Dr Littlefield goes much further, and carries his huge
      claims to the startling extent of affirming that he has produced a
      full-fledged insect which, though invisible to the naked eye,
      under the microscope became an entomological object the like of
      which has never been seen before. "It resembled an elongated
      house-fly" (to quote the doctor again) "having two antennae
      protruding from its head, while from its body grew six attenuated
      legs, the two nearest its head being of the comparative form and
      length of a grasshopper, while its transparent wings were covered
      with light-colored hair. This new insect is the outcome of
      thousands of experiments, and it has no counterpart in the
      textbooks dealing with that branch of zoology."<br>
      <br>
      It is a far cry from a simple protoplasmic cell to that of a
      highly organized insect such as that described, in fact almost as
      far as it is from lifeless crystals to living matter. Oppositely,
      the higher critics will have none of it, basing their conclusions
      on practically the same grounds that Prof. Tindall took in
      relation to Dr C. Henry Bastian's experiments nearly 35 years ago.
      This scientist, it would seem, was eminently qualified to
      investigate the origin of life, for he was recognized as an
      authority on biology and the pathology of the nervous system, and
      he was a strong advocate of the doctrine of spontaneous generation
      of life. In one of his many papers he pointed out the results he
      had obtained in creating life artificially, and he declared that
      "observation and experiment unmistakably testified that living
      matter is constantly being formed de novo and in accordance with
      the same laws and tendencies which determine all the more simple
      chemical combinations." Prof. Tyndall took up the matter and
      carefully tested Dr Bastian's experiments, but took precautions,
      which the latter had neglected, to prevent the ingress of life
      during the process of sealing the vessels, and though he varied
      the experiment in many ways no germs of life manifested
      themselves, so Tyndall felt impelled to thus testify: "I affirm
      that no shred of trustworthy evidence exists to prove that life in
      our day has ever appeared independent of antecedent life."<br>
      <br>
      The moral of Tyndall's statement is obvious; the value of Dr
      Littlefield's or any one else's experiments in the artificial
      generation of life lies absolutely and solely on excluding every
      trace of pre-existing contamination which must otherwise surely
      follow during the progress of the tests. Carelessness in this
      respect has led biologists, even those who believe in the
      hypothesis of abiogenesis, to cry down every attempt made looking
      toward the artificial production of life. At various times
      Spencer, Huxley, Darwin, adn Pasteur were firmly convinced that
      they had found the secret of life, but repeated experiments
      wherein antecedent life was more rigorously excluded than before
      proved their efforts futile.<br>
      <br>
      Evidently error of a similar nature has crept into the tests of Dr
      Littlefield, and this is not said without due consideration, for
      the present writer has performed the experiment as above written,
      not one but many times, and in every instance the result was not
      successful beyond mere crystallization of the chlorides.<br>
      <br>
      It is true that more recent reports state that the development
      took place under sealed glasses thoroughly sterilized before
      beginning and sealed from the air when placed on the shelf, but it
      is obvious that there was every chance for pre-existing life to
      slip in, and so what would otherwise have been regarded as a
      wonderful achievement in science has not been taken very seriously
      by men skilled in either chemistry or biology.<br>
