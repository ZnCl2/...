              Freshwater from Atmospheric Humidity</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> Systems and methods are disclosed for
          extracting freshwater from atmospheric humidity in extremely
          hot and humid climates and supplying freshwater to a small
          group of people, a building, a farm, or forestation area. The
          freshwater is treated to provide drinking water by
          disinfecting to eliminate microorganisms and filtration to
          remove suspended particulates from air, erosion or corrosion
          products, and disinfected waste. Compact units provide
          drinking water for individuals, passengers in cars, vans,
          trucks, or recreational boats, or crewmembers on a seagoing
          cargo ship whether from atmospheric humidity or from
          moisture-laden gases. Furthermore, systems are disclosed for
          the ample supply of freshwater with minimal treatment for
          small- to large-sized buildings in a manner that alleviates
          the heat load on buildings. Collection of freshwater from hot
          humid ambient air is also provided for other uses, such as
          irrigation and farm animal drinking. Various methods are used
          for condensation of water vapor suspended in the air as
          alternative to conventional refrigeration cycles using CFC
          refrigerants. Devices are disclosed using naturally occurring
          brackish cold water, circulation of cooling water cooled by
          thermoelectric cooling or thermoacoustic refrigeration as well
          as evaporative cooling and transpiration cooling. Water
          produced by the systems may flow under gravitational forces
          entirely or with the assistance of boasting pumps. </p>

              WATER FROM AIR USING A DESICCANT</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The present invention provides a method
          and apparatus for extracting liquid water from moist air using
          minimal energy input. The method can be considered as four
          phases: (1) adsorbing water from air into a desiccant, (2)
          isolating the water-laden desiccant from the air source, (3)
          desorbing water as vapor from the desiccant into a chamber,
          and (4) isolating the desiccant from the chamber, and
          compressing the vapor in the chamber to form liquid
          condensate. The liquid condensate can be removed for use.
          Careful design of the dead volumes and pressure balances can
          minimize the energy required. The dried air can be exchanged
          for fresh moist air and the process repeated. An apparatus
          comprises a first chamber in fluid communication with a
          desiccant, and having ports to intake moist air and exhaust
          dried air. The apparatus also comprises a second chamber in
          fluid communication with the desiccant. The second chamber
          allows variable internal pressure, and has a port for removal
          of liquid condensate. Each chamber can be configured to be
          isolated or in communication with the desiccant. The first
          chamber can be configured to be isolated or in communication
          with a course of moist air. Various arrangements of valves,
          pistons, and chambers are described. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A process of separating water from
          ambient air involves a liquid desiccant to first withdraw
          water from air and treatment of the liquid desiccant to

        <p><b>METHOD OF EXTRACTING WATER FROM AIR AND A DEVICE FOR
            CARRYING OUT SAID METHOD</b> </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The method involves the following: a
          stream (1) of air is cooled in an artificial cooling section
          (3), before and after which heat transfer is effected between
          "n" air stream stages (21... 2n) in such a way that heat is
          transferred from the first stage (21) to the "nth", from the
          second stage to the "(n-1)th" and further from the (2n/2)th
          stage to the (2(n/2+1)). When the dew point is reached in the
          stages (21... 2n), condensation of the water vapour occurs.
          The patentable device comprises a duct (4) for the air stream
          in which are disposed a cooling element (5) of the
          refrigerating machine, a heat exchanger (6) and a blower (7).
          The heat exchanger (6) comprises a plurality of sections each
          of which contains heat-transfer elements (81... 8n) disposed
          to both sides of the cooling element (5). The first element
          (8n/2) is connected by the heat flow to the nth, the second
          similarly to the (n-1)th, and further the (8n/2) to the
          (8(n/2+1)). <br>

        <p><b>PROCESS OF WINNING OF WATER FROM AIR ( AIR DRYING ) AND
            GEAR FOR ITS REALIZATION</b> </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> Cooling processes. SUBSTANCE: stream of
          humid air formed by one fan as minimum is cooled in first heat
          exchanger by intermediate heat transfer agent and in cooling
          element of refrigerating machine to temperature below dew
          point with subsequent removal of condensed water. Then stream
          of air is heated in second heat exchanger by intermediate heat
          transfer agent and in element of refrigerating machine meant
          for heat removal. In this case flow rates of intermediate heat
          transfer agent and humid air can be controlled simultaneously
          or sequentially depending on climatic parameters of
          atmospheric air. Direction of humid air is periodically
          changed with cooling of humid air below temperature of water
          freezing guiding it first into element of refrigerating
          machine intended for heat removal and later into cooling
          element. Condensed water is purified, filtered and
          mineralized. EFFECT: increased output of water thanks to

        <p><b>DEVICE FOR PRODUCING FRESH WATER FROM AIR</b> </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> FIELD: hydraulic engineering. SUBSTANCE:
          device can be used for producing fresh water preferably in sea
          coastal areas. Device has pipeline 1 lowered into deep layers
          of water basin or sea with cold water, and vessel 3
          communicating with pipeline by means of pump 5. Vessel is
          located above level of surrounding water on stationary base.
          Vessel is isolated from air, is filled with running cooling
          water, and at one side it communicates with pump which is
          connected with pipeline, and at other side it communicates
          with outlet pipe 6 having its end located below pump which
          ensures running of cooling water as through syphon from pump
          to outlet pipe and into surrounding water basin without
          consuming any outside energy. Located within vessel is air
          pipeline. All walls 7 of air pipeline function as
          heat-conducting partitions made of heat-conducting and
          water-unwettable material. Passage 8 of air pipeline
          communicates with surrounding atmospheric air through inlet
          hole 9 and outlet hole 10. Inlet hole is located above outlet
          hole. Vessel 3 acts as cooling zone, and passage 8 of air
          pipeline acts as zone of condensation. Flow of water from deep
          layers is effected via pipeline as through communicating
          vessel due to hydrostatic forces from side of surrounding
          water. Flow of air in air pipeline is effected due to its
          cooling and increasing density at contact with walls of air
          pipeline. Condensate of water vapor settling on cold
          water-unwettable walls of air pipeline is collected in vessel
          11 which is intended for fresh water. Aforesaid embodiment of
          device allows for its location on stationary support above
          level of surrounding water for example on shore or on floating
          pontoon. It requires no protection from waves. Aforesaid
          design allows for manufacture of large-size devices of high
          productive capacity. Operation of device is simplified.
          EFFECT: higher efficiency. </p>

        <p><b>FORCE FEED SYSTEM FOR DRAIN WATER FROM AIR-CONDITIONER</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Abstract </b>--- PURPOSE: To discharge drain water, even
          if a clearance between a ceiling and a floor slab is narrow or
          even if a distance between an air-conditioner and a pipe shaft
          is long, by forcibly feeding the drain water from the
          air-conditioner, using a pump. CONSTITUTION: When the amount
          of drain water reaches the level of an electrode (d) in a
          drain tank 16, a pump 17 is automatically started by output
          from a waterlevel sensor 24 and the drain water is forcibly
          fed to a flexible tube 20 through a solenoid valve 18 and a
          check valve 19. Therefore, the drain water fed to the flexible
          tube 20 is sent from a flange part 33 on a connection pipe 31
          to a drain outlet 39, flows together with dirty water,
          miscellaneous discharge water, rainwater or other drain water
          through a flowing-down passage 38, and is effectively
          discharged. </p>

          Aug., 1967, No.35178/67. Heading B1B. [Also in Divisions F3
          and F4] Potable water is obtained from sea water (or other
          non-potable water) in reservoir 20 by passing a stream of
          atmospheric air over briaded-cotton wick plates 22, which are
          saturated with the sea water, so that the air takes up
          water-vapour, drawing the moistened air by if an 25 in section
          17 where the air is cooled by coils 32, 33 and water-vapour
          condenses. The condensate .(i.e. potable water) is withdrawn
          from section 17 through pipe 41 by pump 42, and is received in
          tank 44. Partially unsaturated atmospheric air enters the
          apparatus through inlet 19 and is heated in section 15 before
          it passes over wick plates 22. The air may be heated by the
          sun, in which case baffle plates 30 are painted black. As
          shown, the apparatus will float in the sea at level 39; and
          rudder 45 adjusts its position so that inlet 19 is constantly
          facing the wind. Air is discharged from the apparatus through
          outlet 46. Coils 32, 33 may be cooled by feed water which then
          passes through pipe 36 to reservoir 20. A land-based apparatus
          is described wherein the air to be heated flows up an annular
          passage, the external wall of which has annular fins to absorb
          solar heat. </p>
