        BASIC STATEMENTS ON THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS AS IT
        RELATES TO THE FISCHER CYCLE ENGINE.<br>
        <br>
        A. IS THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS BEING VIOLATED?<br>
        <br>
        1. The findings of Joule and others led Rudolf Clausius, a
        German physicist, to state in 1850 that: "In any process, energy
        can be changed from one form to another (including heat and
        work), but it is never created or destroyed." This is the First
        Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is
        stated in different ways by various authors. For the purpose of
        this report, the following statement by Rudolf Clausius is
        selected: "It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided
        by external agency, to convey heat from a body at one
        temperature to another body at a higher temperature." The Second
        Law of Thermodynamics is not capable of specific proof, but is
        axiomatic. It follows from the Second Law that no heat engine
        can convert an equal or greater useful power energy from a
        lesser heat energy source.<br>
        <br>
        2. All Perpetual Motion Machines violate the Second Law of
        Thermodynamics, and they also, do not produce useful power or
        work. Thermodynamic Academicians describe the Carnot Cycle
        Engine (Sadi Carnot in 1824) as the "Ideal Engine." The Carnot
        Cycle Engine is primarily based on the defunct and extinct
        Caloric Theory of Heat. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli describe the
        Caloric Theory of Heat as follows: "That heat was matter and an
        imponderable fluid, which readily flowed from a body of high
        temperature to one of lower temperature." The downfall of the
        Caloric Theory of Heat was initiated by Sir Benjamin Thompson,
        Count Rumford in 1798. Unlike the Perpetual Motion Machines, the
        Carnot Cycle Engine does not violate the Second Law of
        Thermodynamics. But, a tangible mechanical Carnot Cycle Engine
        is very much like all Perpetual Motion Machines, since they both
        produce no useful power or work. The reciprocating steam
        locomotive engine and the Fischer Cycle Engine are neither
        Perpetual Motion Machines nor Carnot Cycle Engines, because they
        both do not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and they
        both produce useful power and work.<br>
        <br>
        3. The U.S. Patent Office's Primary Examiner, Mr. Allen M.
        Ostrager initially rejected the Australian Patent Application
        for the Fischer Cycle Engine because he thought, "...it violated
        the Second Law of Thermodynamics." Dr. Martin G. Horner, Ph.D.
        (OXFORD) (Chemistry &amp; Patent Law), Patent Attorney, and the
        author of the original Australian Fischer Cycle Engine Patents,
        was able to demonstrate, from his personal observations and
        experiences, to the satisfaction of the U.S. Patent Office that
        the Fischer Cycle Engine did produce useful work, and that it
        did not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Since that
        first and only rejection, the U.S. Office of Patents and
        Trademarks has registered five U.S. Patents pertaining to the
        Fischer Cycle Engine research and development.<br>
        <br>
        B. THE STEAM ENGINE VS. THE FISCHER CYCLE ENGINE.<br>
        <br>
        1. The reciprocating steam engine is an external heat source and
        an external vaporization engine. Its steam vapor is produced in
        an external steam boiler, and the boiler's steam vapor pressure
        is directly applied to the top surface of the reciprocating
        steam engine's drive piston to produce power and work.<br>
        <br>
        2. The Fischer Cycle Engine is an external heat source and an
        internal vaporization engine. Its steam vapor is produced inside
        the engine's cylinder after the high pressurized and high
        temperature water, in the liquid state, is directly applied to
        the top of the engine's drive piston. Before the liquid water is
        injected into the cylinder (similar to injection of fuel into a
        diesel engine), the water is first pressurized to a pressure
        (i.e., 3,100 psig), which is higher than the vapor pressure
        (i.e., 3,075 psig) of the water at an operating temperature of
        700°F within its liquid-to-gas heat exchanger. The pressurized
        heated liquid water contained within the heat exchanger is
        directly applied to the top surface of the piston at the top of
        the piston's stroke in the engine's cylinder. The 3,100 psig
        liquid water pressure initially applies a hydraulic force to the
        top surface of the piston to produce work, which is analogous to
        the reciprocating steam locomotive engine, except that the
        boiler pressure of a steam locomotive is only about 125 to 250
        psig.<br>
        <br>
        3. After a steam engine boiler's steam pressure moves the piston
        throughout the piston's stroke, the steam is then discharged at
        the bottom of the piston's stroke as 100 percent steam vapor.
        This steam vapor is then transferred to a steam condenser, where
        the steam vapor is transformed into liquid water, to be recycled
        to the steam boiler. During this liquefying process, all of the
        steam's Latent Heat of Vaporization (70% to 80% of the initial
        fuel's heat energy) is wastefully discharged into the
        atmosphere.<br>
        <br>
        4. In contrast, only about ten percent (10%) of the liquid water
        mass vaporizes into steam throughout the piston stoke.
        Therefore, nearly all of the liquid water mass that is injected
        into the Fischer Cycle Engine’s cylinder is discharged as
        liquid, to be recycled. This liquid water is returned to the
        water make-up pump, and is repressurized and reheated to the
        operating pressure and temperature for another cycle. The
        Fischer Cycle Engine is significant because it doesn't require
        licensed steam engineers nor costly and hazardous steam boilers
        nor wastefully release essential volumes of fresh water and heat
        energy into the atmosphere, as do the steam engines' large
        cooling towers. &nbsp;<br>

      <p>... In Boston, although Dennis [ Lee ] got the red carpet
        treatment from New England’s most powerful electric executive,
        we experienced a media blackout and other fun.&nbsp; I tied into
        talent and money with Mr. Professor and others in my hometown of
        Ventura, and we moved there in the summer of 1987.&nbsp; In late
        1987, Dennis found the program that worked, and the rocket ship
        that he built in Seattle was taking off once more.&nbsp; We were
        building a prototype of Mr. Mentor’s hydraulic heat engine, to
        try developing a free energy machine.&nbsp; On New Year’s Day,
        1988, we became involved with another<b> hydraulic heat engine,
          invented by Victor Fischer.</b>&nbsp; Unlike Mr. Mentor’s
        idea, Fischer had already built and run his hydraulic heat
        engines, in Australia, spending millions of dollars in
        development.&nbsp; Fischer’s and Mr. Mentor’s hydraulic heat
        engines were similar in concept, and Fischer’s had already been
        built, so we abandoned Mr. Mentor’s idea to try building one of
        Fischer’s engines on a scale small enough to power a home.&nbsp;
        It is incredible that both hydraulic heat engines came to Dennis
        a few months apart. </p>
      <p>When Mr. Mentor invented his engine at a stoplight, he was not
        trying to make a free energy machine or defeat the second law of
        thermodynamics.&nbsp; He was just designing the best engine for
        powering a car.&nbsp; Fischer, however, was taking on Carnot
        head on.&nbsp; About the only “inside” information I have about
        Fischer’s engine was hearing him talk about it for about five
        minutes, soon after he came aboard in Ventura.&nbsp; He said
        that in Carnot’s seminal work, he assumed an ideal gas in his
        ideal heat engine.&nbsp; Carnot then extrapolated his logic with
        his ideal gas heat engine to cover all heat engines, and Fischer
        said that that was where Carnot made his fatal error, and that
        liquid heat engines were ignored ever since.&nbsp; It harkens
        back to the notion that Carnot’s theory may have owed the steam
        engine more than the steam engine owed thermodynamics.&nbsp;
        Fischer’s hydraulic heat engine challenged Carnot’s assumption,
        and also the classical interpretation of the second law of
        thermodynamics.&nbsp; Fischer thought, like Mr. Mentor did, that
        a hydraulic heat engine, combined with Dennis’ LamCo-style
        panels, might have a chance at making free energy.&nbsp; It was
        not something that Dennis dreamed up.&nbsp; Fischer and Mr.
        Mentor are technical and scientific heavyweights, not
        fast-talking promoters.&nbsp; Fischer helped write
        thermodynamics textbooks, and he said that thermodynamics
        textbooks are, in large measure, expedient rubbish.&nbsp; What
        Fischer said sounded a lot like describing the expedient fairy
        tales that students are given by microbiology textbooks
        regarding Pasteur and the spontaneous generation theory.&nbsp;
        The data from Fischer’s first prototype had it coming closer to
        Carnot’s ideal than any other heat engine ever had. </p>
      <p>The main issue was that in Fischer’s engine, only a percent or
        two of the working fluid ever became a gas, so far less entropy
        was created in the process, which made the efficiency rise
        dramatically.&nbsp; With both Fischer’s and Mr. Mentor’s
        engines, they do not need cooled condensers, which was what
        Watt’s engine was all about.&nbsp; That is a formidable
        mindbender for physicists and engineers to ponder.&nbsp; No more
        bodies of water would need to be heated up to cool down working
        fluids, as well as many subtle advantages.&nbsp; It is a radical
        new direction in heat engine technology, which could spell the
        end of the many environmentally destructive methods of today’s
        heat engines. </p>
      <p>Even if hydraulic heat engines could not provide free energy,
        it would be the first new heat engine cycle in a century, and
        could possibly sweep aside nearly all the others.&nbsp; Even
        without free energy, its potential is countless billions of
        dollars, and a great reduction in environmental harm. </p>
      <p>Two days after Dennis publicly announced that Fischer had come
        aboard, and we were going to try making a free energy machine
        with his engine, we were raided.&nbsp; Below are some images
        from the raid... </p>
      <p>When Dennis got out of prison in the mid-1990s, he went right
        back at trying to make a free energy machine using hydraulic
        heat engines, and was involved again with Fischer in the late
        1990s.&nbsp; I could only stand back in awe, as I watched Dennis
        twice take his prison clothing off and immediately go for it
        again. ... </p>

      <p>Hello Eric, Here is my first post on the topic in. Sorry about
        repeating all the text but I will comment where appropriate.....
        Now on with heat engines. Let's look at the physics again of the
        steam turbines used in electricity production. They use water as
        the working fluid. Water gets heated up, boiled into steam, then
        heated beyond the boiling point (called superheating in
        thermodynamics) to 2,000 F. Then the superheated steam is forced
        through turbines, producing electricity. Then the steam is
        cooled down by running it through heat exchangers that are in
        contact with a body of water, the steam condenses back into
        liquid, then it is piped back to the boiler to begin the process
        again. As we saw on our stove-top demonstration, a whole lot of
        energy goes into making the water boil. In fact the energy that
        goes into breaking the hydrogen bonds and allowing the water to
        lift off as steam is the equivalent to about 970 F. (I'm quoting
        from memory. That may be a few degrees off, but not many.) of
        water temperature increase. Today's most modern turbines achieve
        2,300 F. boiler temperatures, and lets give our hypothetical
        turbine here the benefit of the doubt, and say it gets that hot.
        When I looked into it, the specific heat of steam was about 45%
        of liquid water. Specific heat is a measure of the degrees of
        temperature a substance will increase versus how much heat it
        absorbs. Heat and temperature are not the same thing. Heat is a
        grand total measurement of energy, temperature is a measure of
        one aspect of heat. If something is at a certain temperature,
        you have to know how much of it there is, and what its specific
        heat to find out how much heat it contains. Temperature is one
        third of the equation. So when you heat up water from 60 F,
        let's say (the temperature of our ubiquitous body of water),and
        we heat it up to 2,300 F., how much heat energy did it absorb?
        Let's calculate it. The specific heat of water is 1.0, and the
        specific heat of steam in 0.45, and 970 effective degrees go
        into getting the water beyond the boiling point. (And again,
        these are rough numbers, but I believe they are materially
        correct, correct enough to make my point.) The energy to get to
        a boil is 152 units of heat (212-60). The energy of boiling the
        water from 212 F. is 970 units. The energy of getting the steam
        up to 2,300 F. is 940 units ((2300-212) x 0.45) So the units of
        energy to get the 2,300 F. steam is 2062 units, and 970 of them,
        or 47% of them, are spent on getting the water to boil and turn
        to steam. In a steam turbine process there is no condensation of
        the water in the turbine, the steam is condensed after the
        turbine. So if the energy that went into the boiling the water
        was still in the steam when it left the (prime mover) turbine,
        that energy could not be used by the prime mover. And the fact
        that the steam had not condensed in the turbine means that the
        latent heat of vaporization could not be used. So with a steam
        turbine at those temperatures, it would be impossible to get
        more than a 53% thermal efficiency, because you are throwing
        away the latent heat of vaporization in getting the water to
        turn to steam. The Carnot formula says that a thermal efficiency
        of those temperatures could yield an efficiency of 81%, but
        because our working fluid is water, we could never get beyond
        53%. That is a real world limitation introduced by our choice of
        water as our working fluid, the most commonly used working fluid
        next to air. And in reality we get about 35% efficiency, which
        means that almost three quarters of our thermal inefficiency is
        due to the fact that we are boiling water to use as our working
        fluid, and if you deduct the 47% from the 81%, it is saying that
        about 100% of our inefficiency is due to the latent heat of
        water. Dear experts: this is a CPA writing this stuff, and I may
        be making a mistake or two in this presentation. I solicit any
        correcting information or theories to this presentation. A part
        of me resents that I am the one doing this stuff. Vastly more
        qualified people could do this far more justice than I can, but
        they are silent for one reason or another, fear by no means the
        least of them. Here is where we start looking more closely.... </p>
      <p>And now here comes the Fischer cycle, which might end up
        upending Carnot, thermodynamics and the rest. Victor Fischer is
        a brilliant man who worked in a number of fields, including
        cybernetics, which partly a study of the human brain. He
        developed some extremely sophisticated computer programs, and in
        his spare time he decided to try solving a problem with it. And
        here we will do a limited review of thermodynamic cycles. </p>
      <p>The Rankine cycle of boiling water, sending it through a
        turbine, condensing it, and sending it back to the boiler, is a
        classic cycle, and variations of it are used in making
        electricity, powering ships, and other applications. The Otto
        cycle is what powers your auto, pun intended. It is run by the
        explosion and exhaustion of hot gases. The Stirling cycle heats
        and compresses gases. Jet engines work off of other cycles,
        intaking, combusting, and exhausting gases. That is by no means
        an exhaustive list of all the thermodynamic cycles that have
        ever been invented, but those comprise the major ones, and you
        will find what they all have in common is a gas powering the
        prime mover. Carnot's famous ideal engine was supposed to be
        independent of what the working fluid was. When Carnot was
        writing his paper, though, the only kind of engines he had seen
        were steam engines. And he began his theoretical ideal engine
        working with an ideal gas. An ideal gas is merely a gas that is
        sufficiently raised in temperature above its boiling point to
        have the atoms or molecules all act like an "ideal" gas, which
        means that the molecules bounce off of each other, do not cling
        together and begin to form a liquid, and other properties. In
        Carnot's seminal work he uses his ideal gas as the working fluid
        for his ideal engine, then he uses mathematical logic to
        extrapolate that logic to all other working fluids. I have seen
        the math on that one, and I certainly couldn't see the flaw, as
        if I could. </p>
      <p>So Victor Fischer set out deliberately to see if he could find
        a new thermodynamic cycle. He built a program to do the analysis
        of all the known thermodynamic cycles, and began loading data
        from all of them. So the story goes, it didn't take very long
        before a new cycle suggested itself from the data analysis: a
        hydraulic heat engine. What is a hydraulic heat engine? you ask.
        It is an engine that uses a liquid to drive its prime mover. If
        you look at those other cycles, a gas drives them all. OK, so
        how does a Fischer (named after his grandfather) cycle work?
        Here is the bare bones description. In the ones I have seen
        built, water was the working fluid, but doesn't have to be. In
        this cycle, the water goes into a boiler and gets heated. But
        instead of being able to expand and become steam when it boils,
        this boiler contains the water under pressure, so you have hot
        water under extreme pressure. The critical temperature of water
        is a little over 700 F., which means that if water gets heated
        to that temperature, there is no force known to man to keep it
        in its liquid state, it will turn to gas. So the Fischer cycle
        couldn't get a temperature above 700 F. In fact this is a prime
        mover in volcanoes in my opinion. So the water is in this highly
        pressurized (up to 3,000 psi) environment, at a high temperature
        (assume 700 F, here), and it goes down a pipe, to enter a
        cylinder where it makes contact with a piston head. Then the
        intake valve is shut and you have 700 F., 3,000 psi water all
        alone in a cylinder, pressing against a piston head. The piston
        head is the prime mover of this cycle. The piston head naturally
        gives backward under the tremendous pressure exerted by the
        water. As the piston moves back, now there is more room in the
        cylinder, and not all the water can remain liquid, some of it is
        forced to vaporize, and as the piston is moving back, the
        expanding space will by definition lower the pressure in the
        cylinder. So you have 700 F. water at 3,000 psi being given the
        opportunity to vaporize, and here is where it gets interesting.
        If you study water at all, you find it to be a remarkable
        substance. It has a boiling point far above substances with a
        similar molecular weight, and the reason is the hydrogen
        bonding. Hydrogen bonding (in the case of water) is where the
        hydrogen atom of a water molecule will also be attracted to the
        oxygen atom of a neighboring water molecule, linking the two
        molecules. This hydrogen bonding is what makes water the
        miraculous substance that it is. In this situation in the
        Fischer cycle, these water molecules at 700 F. and 3,000 psi
        behave unusually, according to Fischer's theories (which appear
        to be supported by the data). When the head of the piston moves
        back, some of the water has to vaporize. But it apparently
        doesn't vaporize into monomolecular water vapor, but the water
        forms huge metamolecules, bonded at the hydrogen bonds. This is
        critical to understanding the thermal efficiencies attainable
        with the Fischer cycle. As the piston continues its travel down
        the cylinder, there is work being performed, as the energy in
        the water gets transferred to the piston and the mechanisms it
        is attached to. The pressure keeps going down, and so does the
        temperature. The temperature is going down for two main reasons.
        One is that the work is being performed, taking energy from the
        water, the other is as the water vaporizes, that latent heat of
        vaporization effect kicks in, cooling off the water. When the
        piston reaches the end of its stroke, what is left in the
        cylinder is one atmosphere pressure water (about 14 psi), which
        falls out a hole in the bottom of the cylinder, which goes
        straight back into the boiler. This cycle does not need a cooled
        condenser. Okay! Now it is important to note that _any_ pressure
        relief results in water flashing to steam. So we have a vessel
        containing superheated water under great pressure at 700
        degrees. If we now let some flow to the piston chamber, is there
        not pressure relief occuring in the heating vessel? To avoid
        this, there must be either water going in at the same pressure
        (under force note) or the volume of the heating vessel must be
        reduced by exactly the amount of the water removed (once again
        with considerable force applied). I presume from the writer's
        failure to mention this that this is a simple undertaking and
        requires no expenditure of energy!! Anyone see a problem here?
        What maintains that pressure as the water flows through to the
        piston chamber? Presumably we don't want the water flashing to
        steam in the pipe conveying it. Perhaps this explains why steam
        is usually used. You see, in allowing steam to flow to the
        piston under pressure, more steam is formed in the heating
        chamber to maintain the pressure. Nothing else needs to be
        altered (boiler volume, water inflow etc.). Now I can see
        physicists, engineers, and thermodynamicists jumping up at this
        point, yelling, "That's impossible!" </p>
      <p>A number of Fischer cycle engines have been built and run, I
        have seen them myself in action, and they don't need external
        condensers. The implications of what I have just stated are
        awesome. If this was true, you could just about sweep aside
        every other thermodynamic cycle, it would put them all to shame.
        Not only are there all sorts of practical aspects of an engine
        like this that make it vastly superior to every other steam
        engine ever made (No lake nearby to cool the working fluid, much
        lower working temperatures, making much easier fabrication and
        operation of the engines, etc.), there are some crucial
        thermodynamic aspects that I don't fully understand, but I will
        make a stab at presenting it. The science of thermodynamics
        today is more than heat engines and heat pumps, it is the
        science of the flow of energy, in all energy systems. It still
        has to do with temperatures and motion though. There is a
        concept that has been presented, but not given its scientific
        name yet. It is the concept known as entropy. When Carnot
        observed the hot always went to cold and wrote about it, that is
        considered the first Western conceptualization of the entropy
        concept. This observation became the Second Law of
        Thermodynamics. Entropy is another term for disorder. The Law
        states that for any closed system, disorder always increases and
        never decreases. It is also related to temperatures finding
        equilibrium, hot going to cold and the two bodies staying at the
        same temperature, like the soup in your kitchen. We now have to
        start imagining the atoms and molecules of the substances that
        are banging around in heat engine and heat pump processes. Let's
        start with a block of ice, or a grain of salt. When substances
        are solid, particularly when they in their pure form (all of the
        same element or molecule), like a grain of salt or an ice cube,
        the atoms or molecules will arrange themselves in a very orderly
        fashion. That is because of the geometry of the atoms or
        molecules themselves. Salt is a compound of sodium and chloride,
        one atom of each. If you got a grain of salt under a powerful
        electron microscope, you might see something like the diagram
        below, taken from one of my cave man paintings. I won't win any
        graphics arts contests. And now to what I see as a problem in
        definitions. Entropy. The arrow of time. The inevitable march
        from hot to cold. The march from order to disorder?? Let's have
        a think about that. I would consider that an ice crystal
        displays considerably more order than water, and it is colder.
        Agree? What about a salt (NaCl is the author's example mentioned
        elsewhere). Is there more order in the molten state or the
        frozen state? </p>
      <p>It is clear from statements in the next piece I shall comment
        on that the author is confused and knows it but can't see where
        the problem is. I suggest it is in the definition of order and
        disorder. In this piece (above), the author states that "Entropy
        is another term for disorder. The Law states that for any closed
        system, disorder always increases and never decreases". But in
        the next piece, the author contradicts this completely and
        claims that entropy increases as the system is heated. </p>
      <p>More shortly, Malcolm </p>
      <p>Hello Eric, Continuing..... What I hope comes across from that
        image is the sense of orderliness the salt grain has. The atoms
        are aligning up with each other according to the electrical
        charges of their atoms. In salt, the sodium atom basically gives
        the atom of its outermost electron shell (A very long class that
        I won't get into here.) and allows the chlorine atom to fill its
        outermost shell. The sodium atom then takes on a positive charge
        because it has one less negatively charged electron in it,
        making it have one more positively charged proton than it has
        electrons. The chlorine atom now has an extra electron, and
        therefore takes on a negative charge. The two atoms are
        attracted to each other, but the sodium atom is also attracted
        to the chlorine atom of the neighboring salt molecule, so there
        is an alignment of the molecules so the positive/negative
        attractions get fulfilled. And that is how the geometry of the
        molecules gets set. So salt in its solid state has a very
        orderly arrangement of its molecules. That arrangement is called
        a lattice. And that lattice is uniform through and through the
        salt grain, and that is why if you look at a grain of salt under
        a magnifying glass, you will find it to have a very definite
        geometric shape, which is the big version of what the lattice
        looks like. All crystals have their shapes based on how the
        molecules are aligning along their electric charges and atomic
        geometry. Here we have a statement that a crystal of salt is
        more orderly than its heated molten counterpart. Fair enough.
        Ice is the same way. But a water molecule isn't shaped as &gt;
        simply as a salt molecule. Snowflakes are six-sided, which also
        reflects that microscopic geometry of how the molecules align
        along their hydrogen bonds. The two hydrogen atoms bond to the
        oxygen atom at the ends, and a water molecule is shaped kind of
        like a triangle. And here is a close-up of the hydrogen-bonding,
        and the hydrogen atoms are attracted to the oxygen atoms of
        neighboring molecules. I have drawn the water lattice (ice) with
        space between the molecules due to the way the geometry lines up
        between the molecules. My drawing is an exaggeration of the way
        it really is with ice. Ice, we know is less dense than liquid
        water, which is why it floats. And the reason is literally given
        in my diagram, as the lattices create space between them as the
        hydrogen bonds dictate how the molecules align. When you melt
        ice, or salt (At a very high temperature, don't try that at
        home!), what is happening is that the increased temperature also
        increases the molecular vibration, and eventually the vibration
        becomes so great that some of the hydrogen bonds break. The
        lattice partially fractures, and the crystal shape collapses. A
        liquid is a jumble of partially broken lattices. I am making a
        guess here, trying to remember my chemistry classes of twenty
        years ago, but I think in liquid water at room temperature, at
        least three-quarters of the hydrogen bonds are intact. Only some
        of them have collapsed. The crystalline state is a very orderly
        one, the liquid state is only slightly less orderly. But in the
        gaseous state, the molecules are no longer bonded to each other
        at all, but flying around in a vast space, colliding with each
        other once in awhile. This takes us back to that concept known
        as entropy. And what is it? Disorder. And as the lattice of the
        ice crystal gives way to the partial lattices (as it gets warm
        enough to melt), entropy is increased. What is called the latent
        heat of the phase change can be thought of as an increase in
        entropy. In fact it can be seen as a pure increase in entropy.
        So we now have an increase in entropy when things are heated??
        It is clear that the writer's expressed uncertainty lies with
        definitions of order and disorder and equating both those things
        to entropy and with temperature. We cannot have it both ways.
        Now here is where I start getting a little uncertain about &gt;
        what I am writing about. It seems that when temperature
        increases, the temperature increase is what is called a useful
        increase in available energy (to run a heat engine, etc.), and
        the increase in the disorder of the molecules is known as
        entropy, and is energy that went to molecular vibration and
        disorder, and is considered an unrecoverable waste of useful
        energy, but it is unavoidable. So when the water in the pot in
        the kitchen boils, all of that energy going into boiling is
        increasing the entropy of the water. And that seems to make
        sense, as the entropy is called unrecoverable energy, dissipated
        to disorder. That is patently false. The writer is claiming that
        we cannot recover the heat from heated water in effect. Well I
        certainly can. If I put a pot into a sink of heated water, I can
        heat my pot and cool the water. I can then lift the heated pot
        from the water. I have indeed extracted some of that energy. And
        as I showed in the steam turbine, the energy that went into
        turning the water into steam is the main unrecoverable portion
        of the energy that went into the boiler, as the water is still
        in its gaseous state when it comes out of the turbine. If the
        turbine exhausted liquid water, then you might be able to say
        that the latent heat of vaporization (entropy) was recovered.
        Let's now go back to the cylinder in the Fischer engine, as the
        piston is getting driven down by the expanding water. When the
        expanding water is forced to vaporize, Fischer has theorized
        that the water is not vaporizing into monomolecular steam, but
        the hydrogen bonds are staying largely intact, and the steam is
        in the form of huge metamolecules, bonded at the hydrogen bonds.
        Fisher named this phenomena Fischer Steam. So the piston keeps
        traveling backward, and Fischer steam gets created, and work is
        being performed. That is fair enough, but none of this overcomes
        the problems of maintaining pressure in the heating vessel. If
        you think of the metamolecules in your mind's eye, you can see
        that they are much more orderly than monomolecular steam, which
        means there is less entropy being created, which also means that
        more of the energy being expended is going to work, and less to
        entropy. I think my comments above have shown the obvious
        confusion in these statements. Fischer says that only about 1%
        of the water that goes into that cylinder vaporized in that
        piston cycle. So more of the energy contained in that hot,
        pressurized water gets converted to work, and less gets wasted
        in creating entropy. That is why it doesn't need a cooled
        condenser to take the entropy away: it didn't create much in the
        first place. There, I think I did it some justice, though I'm
        sure Fischer or others could have explained it much better, and
        I think I tripped over myself somewhere in there, but not a
        major blunder, I hope. </p>
      <p>So you can maybe now better see how the Fischer engine will
        have a much higher thermal efficiency than a conventional steam
        turbine. How much better? I'm not sure, though I saw some of
        Fischer's numbers. I believe Fischer has stated a thermal
        efficiency of one third better than the best steam engines of
        today. But also remember that his engine has a maximum
        temperature of 700 F. if water is used as the working fluid, and
        the best turbines operate at 2,300 F. I know the first crude
        prototype built by Fischer achieved a thermal efficiency of 28%,
        or was it 30%? I can't remember exactly. At a 700 F. boiler
        temperature and exhausting to a 70 F. "condenser," the Carnot
        numbers are 54% maximum, of which 28% is 51%. Over half the
        Carnot ideal with the first prototype, closer than trillions of
        dollars of gas engine design and manufacturing got. Not bad. The
        latest patent I know of by Fischer (He has patented his engine
        internationally, so the U.S. government can't steal/suppress it,
        of course invoking national security as a rationale, another
        time-honored way to bury technology that threatens the corporate
        status quo.) is U.S. patent number 4,747,271. I have heard
        Fischer state that he thought his engine wedded to Dennis' heat
        pump had a chance at making free electricity. But wait, doesn't
        the Second Law of Thermodynamics say that is impossible? I heard
        Fischer talking about that once. He went back to Carnot laying
        awake at night, in his barracks, thinking about his ideal
        engine. Again, Carnot assumed an ideal gas for his heat engine,
        then extrapolated that logic to all working fluids. And because
        stem engines were all he knew, he could be forgiven for not
        foreseeing liquid heat engines. I believe Fischer said that
        extrapolation to all working fluids is in error. I agree. BUT,
        nowhere in this piece can any claim be made that more energy can
        be extracted than was put in to heating the water in the first
        place. &gt; Boy, I sure don't know. I am not about to take on
        the &gt; Second Law of Thermodynamics, not me. Maybe someday
        Fischer can tell the world his theories in front of the
        blackboard. I am skeptical free energy can be made with Dennis'
        heat pump and the Fischer heat engine. I am not saying it can't
        be done, I'm saying that my understanding of thermodynamics
        doesn't tell me how it can be done. The Fischer heat engine and
        The Alternative are both very likely quantum leaps in the heat
        engine and heat pump technology, together worth trillions of
        dollars in the world marketplace, and should be replacing
        everything out there, but I will reserve my judgment whether
        free electricity is possible with them working in tandem. I have
        seen other giant minds agree with Fischer on these issues, I
        just haven't had the benefit of them educating me. From my study
        of science and its history, stranger things have happened than a
        two hundred year-old "Law" getting overturned. So I won't laugh
        at Fischer, and so shouldn't anybody that calls themselves
        scientifically-minded. If you are truly scientifically-minded,
        the next step might be investigating this further. Do I think a
        Dennis Lee heat pump and a Fischer cycle engine are going to be
        the energy technologies of the 21st century? No. Do I think that
        because I don't think they are viable? No. They are both quantum
        leaps beyond what is on today's market in heat engines and heat
        pumps, of that I have no doubt. But if Dennis and our project
        can survive the forces of suppression that are being directed at
        him and so many others, it will open the door for many other
        suppressed technologies, some of which are hard to believe. A
        casual review of suppressed free energy brings up name after
        name, like T. Henry Moray, an American who had an undisputed
        free energy device, one tested many times by scientists from
        around the world, disassembled, tested miles from any power
        source, etc. President Franklin Roosevelt even ordered the Rural
        Electrification Administration to work with Moray, and then came
        the Big Boy energy intrigues, people began getting shot at,
        Moray even had gunfights in his laboratory with agents of the
        dark ones, and eventually a hammer-swinging agent destroyed his
        prototype, and Moray is one of a long line of pioneers that have
        met similar fates. Heat engines and heat pumps are primitive
        today, and if the forces of darkness are ever removed from their
        coveted seats of power, humanity will enjoy technologies that we
        can barely imagine today. Nothing Moray ever produced has come
        to light as meeting claims of free energy, or even energy
        extraction e.g. from the Schumann cavity. I am currently
        examining (with a friend) quantifying possible extractible
        energy from the cavity, but our methods are totally different to
        anything attributed to Moray and moreover, at this stage we have
        no idea how large a collector might have to be to extract, say,
        1kW on a continuous basis. As this is the subject of ongoing
        research I will say no more, but you can be sure that nothing we
        do will violate known and tested laws of physics. The rest of
        this post is irrelevant to the discussion. Malcolm </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a reciprocating external
        combustion engine, i.e., an engine of the type having a cylinder
        or cylinders whose reciprocating motion provides a source of
        power and wherein the heat powering the engine is generated
        externally of the cylinder. In particular, the invention
        provides a novel operating cycle. </p>
      <p>Many attempts have been made to produce an engine which
        combines high thermal efficiency in terms of converting applied
        heat energy into useful work, with acceptable power to weight
        and power to volume ratios for the engine. The internal
        combustion engine has a good power to weight ratio but a
        relatively low thermal efficiency. The diesel engine has the
        best thermal efficiency (up to around 40 percent).
        Thermodynamically more efficient engines based on the Carnot,
        Stirling and Ericsson cycles have been built but these have not
        in general been commercial successes, largely on account of the
        problem of providing a small and efficient heat exchanger
        enabling the working gas to become quickly and efficiently
        heated by the external heat source. </p>
      <p>The steam engine is a well known form of external combustion
        engine but its power to weight ratio is generally low, owing to
        its requiring a separate steam boiler and condenser. The steam
        engine generally uses dried steam or other dry vapor as the
        working fluid. Moreover, the efficiency of the steam engine is
        restricted by the limitations of the Rankine cycle. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a reciprocating external
        combustion engine wherein energy is supplied to a working end
        space of the engine by means of a heat transfer medium which
        comprises. </p>
      <p>The external combustion engine of this invention includes a
        cylinder which may comprise a single doubleacting cylinder
        having a piston therein defining on one side of the piston
        (usually the rod-end side) a compressor end space and on the
        other side of the piston a working end space. However, this
        would not preclude the use of mechanical equivalents to this
        arrangement, for example the use of two cylinders coupled to a
        common shaft, one of the cylinders providing by its piston the
        compressor end space and the other cylinder providing with its
        separate piston the working end space. </p>
      <p>The engine may also comprise a pair of opposed pistons
        reciprocatable within a common cylinder, such that the working
        end space is defined by the two piston crowns and the cylinder
        walls. </p>
      <p>Various inlet and outlet valves of conventional construction
        are provided as necessary, and may be in the form of check
        valves or may be driven by means of a cam operated by the
        engine. However, this would not preclude the absence of valves,
        for example the piston may be arranged to open and close outlet
        ports as in a two-stroke engine. </p>
      <p>An injector is also provided for injecting a preheated liquid
        heat-transfer medium into the working space. The purpose of the
        injected liquid medium is to enable heat transfer from a heat
        exchanger to the working end space, and so to increase the
        pressure of vapour in the working space. </p>
      <p>During operation of the engine the working end space will
        contain a certain residual amount of heat-transfer medium vapor
        and usually some liquid medium. Heat-transfer medium will
        vaporize at least partially in the working space under the
        engine working conditions after injection. </p>
      <p>To avoid confusion the following terms as used herein will be
        clarified. The heat-transfer medium may be present in its
        liquid, or vapor state. The term wet vapor is used to mean that
        the injected liquid is present in both its liquid state (e.g. as
        droplets) and in its vapor state simultaneously. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the liquid medium is heated by means of a
        fuel-burner in a compact heat exchanger, for example a coil of
        narrow bore tubing, to a high pressure and high temperature
        (i.e. to a high internal energy). Since such narrow bore tubing
        can withstand great pressures, it is usually possible to heat
        the liquid up to its critical point. </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger preferably comprises a burner for heating
        the liquid medium. Preferably, a compressor is provided for
        feeding combustion gas, usually air, to the burner. However a
        compressor is not essential. </p>
      <p>The compressor may be provided by a compressor end space of the
        cylinder. However, a separate rotary or reciprocating compressor
        might be provided, such as a vane or turbine compressor. For
        special applications where the rate of heat transfer is to be
        high, it may be preferred to heat the medium to a temperature
        and pressure above its critical point. The hot pressurized
        liquid is then injected into the working space. Internal energy
        of the heat-transfer medium is rapidly transferred on injection
        from the hot liquid droplets to the working space as liquid
        vaporizes, thereby increasing the pressure. The vapor in the
        working end space of the cylinder expands (usually
        polytropically, i.e., non-adiabatically) to drive the piston and
        do work. </p>
      <p>The heat-transfer medium is a vaporizable liquid, such as
        water, some of which flashes to vapor following injection into
        the working end space. Thus, heat transfer between the hot
        injected water vapor and the vapor in the working space is very
        rapid. Therefore, it may be seen that the injected liquid is
        merely acting as a heat transfer fluid which enables the vapor
        in the working space to convert internal energy to mechanical
        work. It is desirable that the heat-transfer medium has a high
        thermal conductivity in order to maximize heat transfer in the
        heat exchanger. The medium is preferably selected from water,
        oil or mixtures thereof. Mixing may occur internally or
        externally of the working space. It is possible that the working
        space may contain vaporizable heat-transfer medium, which may be
        caused to vaporize by injection of heated liquid medium (which
        itself need not be vaporizable). In order to assist lubrication
        of the engine, the water may be used as a mixture with an oil
        e.g. as an emulsion, dispersion or a solution of water and a
        water-soluble oil. </p>
      <p>During operation a residual amount of vapor from vaporization
        of the heat-transfer medium and usually some liquid, will always
        be present in the working space. The retention of some residual
        liquid medium in the working end space after exhaust is
        desirable for reasons which will appear more clearly later,
        since it reduces the pressures achieved during the compression
        stroke. Thus, it may be desirable to construct the cylinder
        and/or piston such that some liquid medium is retained in the
        working space after exhaust. Generally this may be achieved by
        providing appropriate recesses in the piston or cylinder. </p>
      <p>The pressure in the working space at bottom dead center (BDC)
        will generally be greater than atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and
        it will generally be preferred to depressurize the exhausted
        medium to substantially 1 bar pressure. The pressure at top dead
        center (TDC) is determined by the compression ratio. The
        compression ratio employed may vary widely depending on the
        particular application of the engine. Thus in some applications
        a compression ratio as low as 1.5:1 or perhaps lower may be
        employed. In other applications the compression ratio may be as
        high as 20:1. The engine preferably has a bore:stroke ratio from
        0.5:1 to 1:3. </p>
      <p>The present invention is to be distinguished from a steam
        engine in that the heat-transfer medium is maintained in its
        liquid form and not allowed to vaporize until it is introduced
        into the working space. This is in sharp contrast to a steam
        engine, wherein even if a flash boiler is used, the water is
        always introduced into the cylinder in the form of steam. In
        fact, since it is necessary to superheat the steam to remove
        water droplets in a conventional steam engine, it is not
        possible to directly flash liquid water into the cylinder of a
        steam engine since this would give rise to water droplets in the
        cylinder. However, in the engine according to the present
        invention, it is preferred that the majority of the water be
        present in the working space as liquid droplets, since this
        reduces the amount of recondensation to recover latent heat of
        vaporization which need occur. </p>
      <p>Since the majority of the water is injected and exhausted in
        the liquid state, there is substantially no entropy increase due
        to vaporization. In the Rankine cycle this vaporization
        represents a theoretical limit on the efficiency of a steam
        engine since work must be performed to recondense the exhausted
        steam to liquid water. Such complete vaporization is unnecessary
        in the present invention so that almost all the internal energy
        lost by the injected liquid water may be converted into useful
        work. The majority of the heat-transfer medium does not usually
        change its state. Thus, the theoretical efficiency of the cycle
        of the present invention is greater than the efficiency of the
        Rankine steam cycle. </p>
      <p>It is necessary that the heated heat-transfer medium be
        maintained in the liquid state prior to injection. Although this
        may be achieved by using appropriate sensors to ensure that the
        temperature at a given pressure never exceeds the liquid boiling
        point, it has been found that if an orifice of suitable size is
        connected to the heat exchanger in which the liquid medium is
        heated and a flow of liquid medium is maintained through the
        heat exchanger, then the application of heat to the liquid
        medium does not cause the liquid to boil. Thus, by correct
        choice of orifice size, complex temperature and pressure sensing
        devices may be avoided. So long as the orifice provides a
        pressure drop, the pressure in the heat exchanger will at all
        times be such that, as the temperature is increased, the
        pressure of the water in the heat exchanger will also increase
        and thereby be always below the boiling point. The orifice
        normally forms part of the injection means through which the
        liquid medium is injected. </p>
      <p>The rate of working of the engine may be controlled by any of
        several means. It may be controlled by varying the amount of
        heat transfer medium injected into the cylinder, for example, by
        using a variable displacement pump. The rate of working of the
        engine may be controlled by controlling the amount of heat
        supplied by the burner, for example by controlling the fuel
        supply to the burner (for a constant liquid volume injection
        rate). </p>
      <p>Usually, the heat-transfer medium is recovered after it has
        been exhausted from the working space. The exhausted medium will
        still be somewhat heated and may be recycled again to the heat
        exchanger so that its internal energy is not lost. In this way,
        the medium acts merely as a heat transfer fluid and is not
        substantially used up. </p>
      <p>Water is a preferred heat transfer medium. Means may be
        provided for recovering water produced by combustion in the
        burner. Thus, it may be possible to avoid any need for make-up
        water since this will be provided by water from combustion in
        the burner. </p>
      <p>The gas fed to the burner is capable of taking part in the
        combustion process which occurs in the burner. The gas may be a
        gas capable of supporting combustion, such as oxygen, air or
        other oxygen-containing gas, or nitrous oxide. Alternatively,
        the gas may itself be a combustible gas chosen from all known
        combustible gases, such as gaseous hydrocarbons, carbon
        monoxide, or hydrogen. </p>
      <p>The fuel burnt in the burner itself may be chosen from known
        combustible fuels such as gasolines, fuel oils, liquefied or
        gaseous hydrocarbons, alcohols, wood, coal or coke. </p>
      <p>It is in general preferred to use various heat recovery means.
        Thus, the whole engine may be enclosed in a heat insulating
        enclosure and be provided with heat exchangers to pick up stray
        heat and transfer it, for example, to preheat the fuel for the
        burner. It is also preferred to recover the heat remaining in
        the burner flue gases and this may be achieved by passing the
        flue gases through a spray chamber in which a stream of liquid
        (generally the same liquid medium as that injected into the
        engine) is sprayed through the flue gases. It is preferred that
        the liquid medium be sprayed through the flue gases to heat the
        liquid medium close to its boiling point prior to being passed
        to the heat exchanger. Moreover, when water is employed, the use
        of a water spray chamber or a condenser is advantageous in that
        water from the burner may be condensed out of the flue gases so
        that it is not necessary to provide make-up water to the engine.
        Usually exhausted heat-transfer medium includes a proportion of
        vapor. This vapor may be separated from liquid medium in a trap
        and fed with combustion gas to the burner, thereby preheating
        the combustion gas and condensing more of the vapor. </p>
      <p>The construction of an engine according to the present
        invention is considerably simplified in certain respects in
        comparison with known engines, such as internal combustion
        engines. Thus, the temperatures encountered in the working space
        are generally reduced, so that the problems of sealing around
        the pistons are simplified. It will be appreciated that power
        may be provided in the engine of the present invention at lower
        temperatures than, for example, an internal combustion engine.
        Moreover, the internal combustion engine is less thermally
        efficient in that means must be provided to cool the cylinders
        and prevent seizing up. </p>
      <p>Moreover, since the temperatures encountered in the engine are
        relatively low, for example up to 250.degree. C., it is not
        usually necessary to construct the cylinder of metal. Plastics
        such as polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), fiber-reinforced resins,
        and other plastics used in engineering, are particularly
        advantageous due to their cheapness and ease of use. Other heat
        insulating materials such as wood, concrete, glass or ceramics
        may also be used. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the hot liquid is injected into one
        end of the working end space and the outlet is at the other end
        of the piston stroke. The use of low heat conductivity materials
        allows the one end of the cylinder to be hot while the outlet
        region is relatively cool. </p>
      <p>Power is usually taken from the engine by means of a piston rod
        attached to the reciprocating piston. The free end of the piston
        rod may be connected to an eccentric shaft on a rotary flywheel
        or by using a crankshaft so as to convert the reciprocating
        motion into a rotary motion. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has been described in relation to an
        engine having a single cylinder, it will be appreciated that
        multicylinder engines of two or more cylinders will generally be
        preferred in practice. Each engine will usually only require a
        single heat exchanger and spray chamber. </p>
      <p>The invention also relates to a method of operating a
        reciprocating external combustion engine, and to a kit of parts
        for converting an engine (e.g. an internal combustion engine
        such as a diesel engine) to an engine according to the present
        invention. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>In carrying out the invention in one form thereof, as shown in
        FIG. 1, the external combustion engine comprises a cylinder
        having piston 6 defining a compressor end space C and a working
        end space P, a heating coil H of a heat exchanger for heating
        liquid water under pressure by means of a burner B, an optional
        preheater PH for preheating fuel for the burner by means of
        burner flue heat, a spray device S for cooling and washing flue
        gas from the burner, pump X for feeding water under pressure to
        the heating coil, a trap T for recovering and separating vapor
        and liquid water from the exhaust from the working space, and a
        gas dryer D for recovering liquid water from the combustion gas
        supplied to the burner. </p>
      <p>The external combustion engine works in the following manner.
        Air A at atmospheric temperature and pressure is inducted into
        compressor end space C of the cylinder 5 by moving piston 6 to
        the right (as viewed in FIG. 1) and thereby opening inlet check
        valve 4. The outlet from the compressor end space C is closed by
        means of check valve 2. When the piston 6 has reached the
        extreme right of its travel (top dead center--TDC), inlet valve
        4 closes. Continued movement of the reciprocating piston back
        towards the left causes the air to become compressed. </p>
      <p>Compression is continued to provide a sufficient pressure of
        air in space C for operating the burner B. As the piston
        approaches BDC, outlet valve 3 opens to exhaust wet vapor from
        working space P. Check valve 2 is also opened to admit
        compressed and slightly heated air to the trap T. </p>
      <p>Shortly after BDC valves 2 and 3 are closed and as the piston
        moves toward TDC again, the residual saturated dry water vapor
        in the working space P is compressed. </p>
      <p>Around top dead center, hot pressurized liquid water is
        injected through valve 1 and associated injector 51 causing a
        rapid increase in pressure within the cylinder (along line bc in
        FIG. 6) due to heating of water vapor already in the working
        space and due to vaporization of some of the injected water. The
        piston then moves back towards bottom dead center, the working
        space becoming depressurized and cooled in the process. The
        expansion of the vapor in the cylinder is represented by the
        line cd in FIG. 6. Around bottom dead center wet vapor is
        expelled from the cylinder and passes via valve 3 and
        cylindrical baffle 10 to the trap T. In the trap T, the liquid
        water at substantially atmospheric pressure is recovered and
        recycled to the heating coil H wherein it is pressurized and
        heated. Make-up water W may be fed to trap T as required. </p>
      <p>The dry saturated vapor in trap T is mixed with compressed air
        from compressor space C, thereby preheating the combustion air
        which is then passed to the burner B. </p>
      <p>An optional dryer D is interposed between the trap T and the
        burner and liquid condensate is returned along line 7 to the
        trap. </p>
      <p>The preheater PH preheats fuel F which then passes to the
        burner along line 8. Any water thereby condensed from the flue
        gases is recycled via line 9 to the pump. </p>
      <p>Depending on the compression ratio and the rate of working at
        the time, the temperature of the injected water may be above or
        equal to the temperature of the working space just prior to
        injection. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 emphasizes the fact that the water itself acts
        principally as a heat transfer fluid which is recycled after
        use. The only water lost from the system is that carried out in
        the cooled flue gases from the spray chamber S. </p>
      <p>The cycle will now be described in more detail. </p>
      <p>Heated water at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of below
        100.degree. C. is fed from trap T (and possibly from the spray
        chamber S and preheater PH) to the pressure pump X whence it is
        delivered at a high pressure to the heating coil H. The water in
        the heating coil H is heated to a temperature of around
        300.degree. C. and a pressure of around 86 bar. In principle,
        the water may be heated to any temperature above or below its
        critical temperature and pressure (220.9 bar and 374.degree.
        C.), however, the pressure will always be such that at any
        temperature it will maintain the water in its liquid state. </p>
      <p>The working space P contains residual water from the previous
        stroke, as liquid and vapor. As the piston moves towards TDC,
        the dry saturated vapor is compressed to around 22 bar and (for
        a 16:1 compression ratio) to a temperature of around 217.degree.
        C. at top dead center. Some vaporization of the residual water
        may occur during compression depending on the piston velocity.
        This minimizes superheating of the compressed vapor, thereby
        maintaining the vapor in the dry saturated state. </p>
      <p>At TDC, hot pressurized water at around 86 bar and 300.degree.
        C. is injected into the working end space P via injector 51 and
        some liquid water immediately flashes to become vapor, thereby
        atomizing the remaining injected liquid water and rapidly
        increasing the pressure in the space P. Water injection is
        continued for around 5 to 25% of the whole stroke. The pressure
        reached depends on the amount and temperature of the liquid
        water injected and on how much of that vaporizes. </p>
      <p>The rapid rise in pressure causes the piston 6 to move towards
        BDC again. Around 35.degree. before BDC the exhaust valve 3
        opens to exhaust water liquid and water vapor from the space P.
        The exhaust is passed to the trap T where the liquid water is
        recovered and then returned to the heating coil H. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been described using a piston
        compressor in either the same or a different cylinder from the
        working end space, it will be appreciated that if required any
        other type of compressor may be used, for example a rotary
        compressor or fan. </p>
      <p>This embodiment allows a particularly simple cylinder
        construction, such as the one shown in FIG. 3. The relatively
        low temperatures encountered allow the use of engineering
        plastics materials in the construction of the cylinder, and
        indeed such materials have important low heat conductivity
        advantages. </p>
      <p>The cylinder shown in FIG. 3 comprises a uniflow cylinder body
        52 having a row of circumferentially arranged ports 53 which
        constitute the outlet from the working end space P of the
        cylinder. A cylinder head 54 having the water injector 51
        mounted therein is attached to one end of the body 52 and an end
        plate 55 having therein an inlet 56 and outlet 57 (and
        respective check valves) is provided for the compressor end
        space at the other end of the cylinder. A piston 58 and piston
        rod 59 is provided within the cylinder. The ports 53 are
        arranged to be uncovered by the piston 58 as the piston
        approaches the end of its expansion stroke. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the end of the cylinder adjacent
        the injector 51 is at a relatively high temperature, whereas the
        end of the cylinder adjacent the outlet ports 53 is at a
        relatively low temperature. The use of plastics materials having
        a low thermal conductivity allows this advantageous temperature
        differential to be maintained. Thus, were heat to be allowed to
        be conducted towards the outlet ports 53, the temperature of the
        exhaust would be raised, thereby resulting in loss of thermal
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>The cylinder schematically represented in FIG. 3 includes a
        circumferential recess 59a in the cylinder wall for retaining
        liquid medium in the working space after exhaust. </p>
      <p>In addition, as shown in FIG. 3, at least two seals 59b are
        mounted in circumferential recesses in the cylinder wall. The
        piston of this invention need not fit closely against the
        cylinder wall, since communication between the working end space
        and the compressor end space can be blocked by the seals 59b, as
        illustrated by the dotted line view of piston 58 in FIG. 3 which
        shows the piston at the end of its compression stroke. Having
        the piston slightly spaced from the cylinder wall provides an
        advantage in that any scale deposited on the cylinder wall from
        the water will not interfere with the operation of the engine
        until a substantial amount has accumulated, and maintenance is
        thereby reduced. </p>
      <p>When a multicylinder engine is used, individual cam-operated
        injector valves may be provided on each cylinder. Alternatively,
        a distributor may be provided to periodically distribute hot
        pressurized water to the appropriate cylinder. The injectors may
        deliver a constant volume of water at a variable temperature.
        However, injectors delivering a variable volume of water at
        constant temperature might also be used--particularly when a
        more rapid change in working rate is required. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows the construction of the heat exchanger, which
        combines the heating coil H and the burner B. The heat exchanger
        comprises inner and outer coaxial sleeves 60 and 61,
        respectively, defining a double path for flue gas from the
        burner. Insulation 64 is provided around the outside of the heat
        exchanger. A fuel inlet jet is provided for burning fuel F in
        air A admitted via an air inlet. Water W passes through a
        heating coil H which comprises an inner coil 62 and outer coil
        63 in the direction indicated by the arrows such that water
        exits from inner coil 62 at a position close to the highest
        temperature of the burner. The hot pressurized water is then fed
        along pipe 50 prior to injection into the working space P. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows a spray device for cooling and washing the flue
        gases from the burner B and thus recovering some of the heat and
        some water produced by the combustion. It comprises a spray
        chamber 17 having therein a funnel 18 onto which water is
        sprayed by spray 41 through the stream of hot flue gases. The
        flue gases are inducted via inlet 19 and arranged to flow
        tangentially around the chamber before exiting through the exit
        20 as cooled flue gas. The flue gases thus pass through the
        spray and then through a curtain of water falling from the
        inside aperture of the funnel 18. Preferably the flue gases are
        cooled to below 100.degree. C. so as to recover the latent heat
        of vaporization of water from the burner. Water at substantially
        100.degree. exits through the outlet 21 before being fed by pump
        X into the heat exchanger. Cold feed water W is introduced into
        the chamber via a ballcock 40 for maintaining a constant level
        of water in the bottom of the spray chamber. A recycle pump R
        and associated ducting 22 is provided for recycling the water
        through the spray to bring it up to its boiling point. However,
        in practice, if it is desired to cool the flue gases below
        100.degree. C., it may be necessary to withdraw water through
        the outlet 21 at a substantially lower temperature, e.g.
        50.degree. C. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows the idealized thermodynamic operation of the
        engine of FIG. 1. FIG. 7 shows for comparison the operation of a
        conventional two-stroke internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Without wishing to be in any way limited to any specific
        theory, it is believed that the operation of the engine may be
        represented as follows. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows PV and TS diagrams. The majority of the injected
        water remains in the liquid phase as droplets. </p>
      <p>At all times there is a residual volume of dry saturated vapor
        in the working space. To a first approximation, the residual
        vapor may be regarded as a gaseous working fluid which takes up
        and gives out heat during each operating cycle, thereby doing
        work. The working space will also contain residual liquid water.
      </p>
      <p>Water vapor in the working space P is compressed during the
        compression stroke along line ab. The compression is not
        isoentropic due to vaporization of residual water in the
        cylinder. </p>
      <p>The vaporization of residual liquid water in the working space
        during compression results in a reduction of entropy of the
        vapor. If there were no residual liquid water in the working
        space, adiabatic compression of the water vapor would cause the
        line ab in the TS diagram to be vertical, i.e., the water vapor
        would be superheated. However, in the presence of liquid water
        any tendency for the water vapor to become superheated is
        counteracted by vaporization of some of the liquid. Thus, the
        line ab follows the dry saturated vapor line on the entropy dome
        (shown in dotted lines) for water. </p>
      <p>At constant volume hot pressurized liquid water is injected at
        point b at a higher temperature than the compressed dry
        saturated vapor in the working space, and a portion of the water
        vaporizes so that the pressure increases along bc from P.sub.b
        to P.sub.c. The temperature T of the dry saturated vapor also
        increases, while the entropy of the vapor decreases to c. </p>
      <p>As the piston descends the wet water vapor expands along
        cd--however, due to the presence of hot liquid water droplets,
        the expansion is not adiabatic but polytropic due to heat
        transfer from the liquid water so that the curve cd on the PV
        diagram is flattened. The expansion also produces a fall in T
        and a small increase in entropy S. </p>
      <p>On exhaust from the working space the pressure and temperature
        in the working space falls along da. </p>
      <p>The figure a', b', c, d in the TS diagram represents the cycle
        undergone by the liquid water. Thus, the liquid water is heated
        in the heating coil along a'b' and injected into the working
        space at b'. The temperature of the liquid water then falls
        along b'c after injection and thereafter the liquid and vapor
        are in equilibrium. </p>
      <p>Typical operating conditions are as follows. The pressure
        P.sub.a at a is 1.2 bar and the temperature T.sub.a is 378K
        (105.degree. C.). At a compression ratio of 16:1 the pressure
        P.sub.b and temperature T.sub.b at b rise to around 22 bar and
        290K (217.degree. C.). Liquid water at 573K (300.degree. C.) and
        86 bar is then injected into the working space at b and a
        portion becomes vapor, the rest remaining as liquid. This causes
        an increase in pressure along bc (typically P.sub.c =30 bar) and
        an increase in temperature due to injection of the warmer water
        (T.sub.c =507K (234.degree. C.)). The reduction in entropy along
        bc of the water vapor originally in the cylinder arises from
        injection of water in the liquid state. As the piston moves back
        towards BDC, the water vapor expands along cd to a pressure
        P.sub.c of about 2 bar and a theoretical temperature T.sub.d of
        about 393K (120.degree. C.). The water vapor and liquid water
        are then exhausted from the working space along da causing a
        decrease in temperature and pressure, and an increase in the
        entropy of vapor in the working space. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows PV and TS diagrams for the known two-stroke cycle
        internal combustion engine for comparison. Air is inducted at a
        and compressed adiabatically and isoentropically along ab. The
        temperature at b is greater and the slope of ab steeper than for
        the cycle of the present invention. The presence of liquid water
        in the working space in the cycle of the present invention
        flattens ab since energy is needed to vaporize liquid water
        during compression. </p>
      <p>In the two-stroke cycle internal combustion engine fuel is then
        burned in the cylinder, increasing the pressure, temperature and
        entropy along bc. In the cycle of the present invention the
        pressure increases slightly due to some liquid water flashing to
        vapor, and the temperature of water vapor in the working space
        increases. However, whereas in the two-stroke cycle there is an
        increase in entropy along bc, in the cycle of the present
        invention there is a decrease in entropy of the water vapor in
        the working space due to the addition of liquid water on
        injection. </p>
      <p>Thereafter adiabatic isoentropic expansion occurs along cd,
        heated liquid water in the working space in the cycle of the
        present invention giving up heat and thereby causing a
        flattening of the PV curve in comparison to the curve for the
        two-stroke cycle. </p>
      <p>The high thermal efficiency of the cycle of the present
        invention resides in the fact that, whereas in the two-stroke
        cycle internal combustion engine the gas exhausted from the
        cylinder is at a high temperature and pressure, in the present
        invention only liquid water and a small amount of vapor is
        exhausted. Thus, liquid water is injected into and exhausted
        from the working space. </p>
      <p>Most of the injected water after injection remains in the
        liquid state (ignoring the small amount of water which flashes
        to vapor) and so there is no significant entropy increase due to
        vaporization, and the internal energy lost by the injected water
        is converted almost completely into useful work. Moreover there
        is no need to scavenge the cylinder at the end of the cycle, in
        the present invention so that heat of the vapor is not lost. The
        presence of the residual liquid water droplets on the walls of
        the working space ensures that it contains the required residual
        water vapor ready for recommencement of the cycle. The line ae
        represents the opening of the exhaust valve before the end of
        the stroke. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 illustrate a practical form of the invention,
        which is similar in principle to the embodiment shown
        schematically in FIG. 1 except that no spray chamber is used and
        a rotary air blower feeds a mixture of air and dry saturated
        vapor to the burner. </p>
      <p>The engine comprises four cylinders arranged in a 90.degree.
        V-configuration. Water is pumped from a closed storage trap 100
        (corresponding to trap T in FIG. 1) by a high pressure pump 101
        along a pipe 102 to a two-stage counter flow heat exchanger 103
        of a construction as shown in FIG. 4. A pressure relief valve
        104 is provided between pipe 103 and trap 100. Air and hot
        exhaust water vapor from trap 100 are directed to the heat
        exchanger 103 along duct 105 by a rotary air blower 106. The air
        flow is controlled by valve 107. Fuel (e.g. propane gas) is
        introduced from tank 127 through preheater 128 into the air flow
        through fuel valve 108. Flue gases leave the heat exchanger via
        flue 109. </p>
      <p>Each piston 110 runs in a respective cylinder 111 and is
        connected to a crosshead 112 by a piston rod 113. The cross head
        is connected to a crankshaft 114 by a further rod 115. Each
        cylinder has a cylinder head 116 provided with an injector 117
        which includes a poppet valve operated by a cam on a camshaft
        118 by means of a rocker arm 119. Each cylinder also has an
        exhaust port 120 onto common exhaust manifold 121 which returns
        wet exhaust vapor to the trap 100. A flywheel 124 is mounted on
        the crankshaft. A breather port 129 is provided. </p>
      <p>It has previously been pointed out that recesses may be
        provided in the cylinder or piston to retain liquid medium in
        the working space after exhaust. In FIG. 3 there has been shown
        a recess 59a in the cylinder for this purpose. The engine shown
        in FIG. 11 has recesses 130 provided in the piston head for this
        purpose. </p>
      <p>An engine having a 16:1 compression ratio, a 4" diameter piston
        and a 4" stroke and each cylinder delivers around 15 horsepower
        at a water injection temperature of around 300.degree. C. and a
        pressure of 86 bar. The inclination of the cylinders assists
        exhaust of liquid water by gravity. At 300.degree. C. typically
        about 5 grams of water would be injected per injection. The
        entire engine is contained with a heat-insulated enclosure. </p>
      <p>Hot liquid water leaves the heat exchanger along pipe 122 and
        is fed to the injector 117. A pressure control valve 123 is
        provided between pipe 122 and the tank. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 shows the water circulation circuit in more detail. A
        check valve 125 is provided downstream of the pump 101 to
        prevent flash-back of water vapor into the pump. A pressure
        control valve 126 is provided in parallel with the pressure
        relief valve 104 and may be used to control the rate of working
        of the engine. </p>
      <p>The external combustion engine shown is capable of very high
        thermal efficiency. Theoretically, cold fuel F, cold air A, and
        cold water W (if any) are inducted into the engine, and cold
        flue gas is vented. Therefore, almost all the heat given out by
        the burner may become converted into work. In practice, thermal
        efficiencies of the order of 50 to 80% appear to be attainable.
      </p>
      <p>While it is contemplated that this invention will be carried
        out by manufacturing new engines incorporating the features
        disclosed in this invention, it may also be carried out by
        converting some existing internal combustion engines to operate
        in accordance with the principles of this invention. For this
        purpose a kit may be supplied incorporating the necessary
        components for making such a conversion. Such a kit would
        include a heat exchanger, including a fuel-air burner, for
        heating water to the necessary temperature and pressure; an
        insulated cylinder and piston, the cylinder having an inlet for
        liquid water and an outlet for wet exhaust vapor; a compressor
        for supplying gas into a separating chamber and to the burner; a
        pump for transmitting liquid water from the cylinder to the heat
        exchanger, an injector for injecting liquid water under pressure
        from the heat exchanger into the cylinder, a metering device for
        controlling the amount of water injected into the cylinder, and
        a separating chamber for separating liquid water from dry
        saturated vapor. </p>
