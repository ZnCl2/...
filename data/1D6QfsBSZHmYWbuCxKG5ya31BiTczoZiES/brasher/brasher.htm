            Breakwater"</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A new type of breakwater consisting of nothing more than air
      bubbles recently was devices for quieting even the highest waves
      of the sea. It is the invention of Phillip Brasher, an American.
      One of the units is said to have been operated successfully at El
      Segundo, CA, to protect a concrete pier.<br>
      <br>
      The air breakwater consists of a perforated pipe that is laid
      along the sea bottom and connected with a land air-compressing
      station. In rough weather it is merely necessary to allow the
      compressed air to escape from the holes in the pipe, the air
      bubbles quickly rising to the surface. The wall of bubbles is said
      to break up the waves and retard their forward motion. When the
      water from a broken wave flows back to form a base for the next
      incoming wave, it finds no support and the next wave curls over
      and breaks.<br>
      <br>
      The repetition of this process is said to result in a smooth
      surface beyond the pipeline, no matter how rough the weather. A
      simple installation of the pipe system, the inventor says, is
      sufficient to provide a harbor of smooth water in exposed points
      around coasts that have caused trouble in the past. <br>

        <b>Method &amp; Apparatus For Collapsing Water Waves</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      My invention relates to an improved method of and apparatus for
      use in connection with water waves, being more particularly
      adapted for collapsing water waves to produce a relatively
      quiescent area of appreciable size in proximity to a ship, whereby
      planes can be launched from the ship without the use of a
      catapult, and may be picked up again without the necessity of the
      ship coming to rest.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically the present invention provides for collapsing
      water waves continuously from a ship which may be proceeding at 12
      or 15 knots or even at higher speeds, the quiescent area thus
      produced overlapping in extent to permit the launching of a plane
      from the moving ship without a catapult and to permit the plane t
      be picked up again without stopping the ship.<br>
      <br>
      My invention, it will be appreciated, is of great practicable
      worth in connection with combating submarines, in that any ship
      large enough to carry a plane, but which may be too small to carry
      a catapult, can be employed for reconnaissance purposes and for
      actual bombing of submarines, launching and picking up of the
      plane being feasible and practicable with the ship under way so
      that she may be maneuvered if desired.<br>
      <br>
      It will be seen from the description hereinafter given that the
      equipment necessary for the practice of my invention is simple,
      and takes up only a fraction of the space required for catapult
      launching apparatus. The plane can be launched and picked up with
      a crane. As a consequence the number of ships which may carry one
      or more planes is enormously increased as compared with existing
      practice.<br>
      <br>
      In the accompanying drawings I have shown an embodiment of my
      invention more or less diagrammatically:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 1 showing the invention in plan; and</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Figure 2 being an elevational view.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us232.jpg" width="583"
          height="785"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Referring to the drawing in detail: 2 designates a ship carrying
      an air compressor 4, to which an air hose 6 is adapted to be
      coupled. The air compressor is mounted at the forward part of the
      ship, and as the hose 6 is to be towed overboard, its length will
      depend upon the height and length of the ship. In practice it
      should be long enough to extend rearwardly of the ship about as
      shown in the drawing. This hose is flexible and open at its outer
      end 8.<br>
      <br>
      In practicing my invention the hose is thrown overboard and towed
      by the ship when a plane is to be launched or picked up. As above
      noted, launching and picking up are performed with the ship
      traveling at say 12 or 15 knots which will give it the desired
      steerage way and maneuverability. The open end 8 of the hose 6 is
      to be submerged to a depth of 75 to 100 feet. For this reason and
      in order that the open end of the hose may be maintained at the
      desired distance from the ships' hull, and will not simply trail
      beside the ship, I equip the hose with a paravane 10.<br>
      <br>
      When an elastic fluid such as air is discharged by the compressor
      through the submerged outer end of the hose 6, air and water will
      be forced to the surface to provide in effect an upwardly moving
      wall or damp against which approaching waves will dash and be
      collapsed. Back of this fluid breakwater or dam, that is, between
      it and the ship, there will be a quiescent area 12 of substantial
      proportions into which a plane may be launched from the ship
      simply by lowering the same overboard and from which a plane may
      be picked up. This quiescent area will be maintained even on
      intermittent operation of the compressor for two or three minutes
      after the compressor is shut off.<br>
      <br>
      Inasmuch as the quiescent area persists some two or three minutes
      after the compressor is shut off, it will be apparent that with a
      ship proceeding at say the equivalent of 5 miles per hour I can
      produce a quiescent area one-half to three-quarters of a mile long
      and of substantial width. The width of the quiescent area will
      depend, of course, upon the distance between the outer end of the
      hose 6 and the ship.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated, furthermore, that not only will the
      provision of such a quiescent area enable a plane to be launched
      from the ship without a catapult and to be picked up, but the ship
      itself will be in this area so as to provide a steady gun platform
      for both horizontal and antiaircraft fire should demands require
      it.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that for illustrative purposes I have shown
      but a single hose 6. Several may be employed if desired from the
      same or from opposed sides of the ship.<br>
      <br>
      It will be seen that the equipment necessary for the practice of
      my invention is simple and inexpensive, requires by very small
      space on shipboard, and that no expensive controlling mechanism is
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      I wish it to be understood that any dimensions above mentioned as
      to length of hose, depth of submergence, size of hose, etc., are
      illustrative and not for purposes of limitation, and that the same
      may be changed within the purview of my invention. <br>

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A hydraulic or water-jet breakwater is formed by- forcing water
      through a series of nozzles mounted on a pipe which is installed
      perpendicular to the direction of the incident waves. The jets
      create a surface current which results in breaking of the incident
      wave. Apparently, this effect is primarily responsible for
      attenuation of the incident wave. An earlier development, the
      pneumatic breakwater, operates on a similar principle with a
      horizontal surface current induced by rising air bubbles...<br>

      This invention relates to wave control and particularly to simple
      and economical means for eliminating or substantially reducing
      waves, as on a lake, ocean, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      Waves in large bodies of water (and sometimes in small ones) cause
      no end of trouble. They make swimming difficult and often lead to
      a dangerous undertow. Waves often seriously damage shore
      installations such as piers and boat houses, and frequently erode
      the shoreline. Small boats can find the going difficult. Wave
      conditions can mean the difference between success and failure of
      a military landing operation. Loading and unloading of small boats
      at piers can be dilficult or impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an
      improved apparatus and method for eliminating or greatly reducing
      the magnitude of waves.<br>
      <br>
      More particularly, it is an object of this invention to provide
      such an apparatus and method which eliminate the usual massive and
      expensive breakwaters.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of this invention is to provide a mobile
      wavebreaker for reducing wave magnitude in a localized area.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus and
      method for causing waves to tumble over into the preceding troughs
      whereby greatly to reduce the magnitude of the waves.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, it is an object of this invention to provide an
      apparatus and method for discharging water below the level of
      troughs between waves in opposition to the movement of the waves,
      whereby to cause the Waves to tumble over and diminish greatly in
      magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      I have observed that water at different temperatures acts as if it
      has different viscosities and resists mixing, a stream of water at
      one temperature discharged into a body of water at a different
      temperature tends to remain as a coherent stream without mixing
      with the body of water.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a more specific object of this invention is to provide
      an apparatus and method for discharging water at one temperature
      into wave water in opposition to the waves to cause the waves to
      topple over.<br>
      <br>
      Other and further objects and advantages of the present invention
      will be apparent upon consideration of the following description
      when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

      Referring now in greater particularity to the drawings, there will
      be seen a large body of water 10, such as an ocean or large lake,
      and having a bottom 12 and a shore 14 which is to be protected.
      The body of water It) has waves 16 on the surface thereof. The
      waves may vary in height and spacing according to various factors,
      including the size of the body of water, the location of the part
      of the body of water under consideration, and conditions of
      climate and weather. The waves progress toward the shore, to the
      right in FIG. 2 and generally up and to the right in FIG. '1.<br>
      <br>
      The wave breaking apparatus according to this invention includes a
      motor-pump unit 18 supplied with power from a suitable source.
      This unit is shown as mounted on a pier 20 having supporting posts
      22 and extending from the shore out into the water. The posts 22
      are shown as having spiked or sharpened lower ends for facile
      installations of the pieras for an installation that is to be
      installed quickly. Alternatively (and preferably), the motor-pump
      unit 18 could be sealed and disposed on the bottom 12, or it could
      be floated on the surface by suitable float means for temporary
      installations, such as for military landings. The motor pump unit
      18 is provided with an intake pipe 24 having a screened inlet 26.
      The inlet 26 is in the water, and for best results is disposed
      near the bottom 12 thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The motor-pump unit 18 is provided with a discharge pipe 28
      running out from the shore and having one or more transverse jet
      pipes 39. The jet pipes 30 as oriented substantially parallel to
      the wave crests (perpendicular to the direction of Wave movement).
      In general, this is substantially parallel to the shore. The jet
      pipes are supported horizontally by stakes 32 driven into the
      bottom 12 and are disposed below the wave troughs a distance
      spending on wave conditions. Of course, for portable installations
      such as military landings, the jet pipes could be supported by
      floats. Alternatively, the pipes could be made of suitable
      lightweight material with integral air chambers, if necessary.
      Ropes or cables from such floating pipes preferably would be tied
      to anchors resting on the bottom to minimize bubbling up and down
      of the pipes.<br>
      <br>
      The jet pipes 30 are closed at the ends as at 34 and are provided
      with openings which preferably may take the form of longitudinal
      (horizontal) slots 36. Hence, water from the motor-pump unit 18
      issues from the slots 36 as streams, ribbons or jets as indicated
      by the arrows 38. These jets are generally horizontal, being
      disposed from about 10 above to about 10 below horizontal. The
      jets are generally in opposition to the direction of wave
      movement, but may be in diagonal opposition. The water jets act as
      a sort of underwater breakwater, slowing down the undersides of
      the waves and upsetting the natural forces in the waves to cause
      the tops or crests thereof to tumble over into the preceding
      troughs as indicated by the arrow 40.<br>
      <br>
      It is difficult to state generalities as to sizes and positions
      since these are so dependent on wave conditions and the area to be
      protected. However, it may be stated that the jet pipes must be
      disposed below the surface of the water at the bottoms of the
      troughs, but close enough to the trough bottoms to be within the
      zone of wave action. As one specific example a jet pipe disposed
      three inches below the trough bottoms reduces 18 inch waves on the
      jet or offshore side of the jet pipe to eight inches on the back
      or onshore side. Small, wind driven Waves were completely
      eliminated. A second jet pipe may be used (as illustrated) further
      to reduce the height of the waves. Larger slots and/or a larger
      pump may be provided for greater reduction of wave height.
      Obviously, installation should be below .the draft of small boats,
      with suitable spacing apart to accommodate larger vessels.<br>
      <br>
      The piping system heretofore shown and described is excellent for
      reducing waves in fairly large areas. If it is desired to reduce
      wave height in only a local area, as for unloading and loading
      small boats at a pier, then most of the piping could be
      eliminated. In fact, the motor-pump unit could be used alone,
      submerged to the proper depth, and this would make for ready
      portability.<br>
      <br>
      Elimination or substantial elimination of waves in accordance wtih
      the foregoing greatly improves swimming and boating, and protects
      shore installations and shores themselves. Furthermore, undertow
      is eliminated. Installation is simple and inexpensive. Operation
      also is inexpensive, and is necessary only when waves tend to
      exceed a predetermined size, or when wave control is otherwise
      desired.<br>

      ABSTRACT A simplified air burst wave breaker for the protection
      against wave action of Marina installations and the like. The air
      burst unit comprises a duct in the form of two vertical U portions
      arranged with their openings toward each other, having a common
      leg and in which at least the bottom free leg is longer than the

      portion open at the bottom an air inlet connection in the upper
      bend thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Marina installations and other floating structures are subject to
      severe wave damage resulting from storm winds of unusual velocity.
      Stationary solid breakwaters are expensive, and not expedient for
      use in lakes in which the water level may very considerably due to
      the effect of rainfall on the one hand and irrigation usage on the
      other hand. It is desirable to provide a breakwater which can be
      submerged to a depth of noninterference with boating but which is
      effective to break up waves at the surface of the water. A
      desirable wavebreaker which is effective for the purpose, which is
      relatively inexpensive, which can be submerged to avoid
      interference with boating and fishing and which can be operated
      economically is the air bubble type of installation.<br>
      <br>
      The concept of the air bubble wavebreaker is old in the art. For
      example, the utilization of small air bubbles passing upward
      through a body of waterto break and diminish waves is disclosed in
      Brasher U.S. Pat. No. 843,926 issued on Feb. I2, 1907. In
      addition, Brasher U.S. Pat. No. 1,593,863 issued July'27, 1926
      discloses that the intermittent release of bubbles can effectively
      serve to break up waves with more efficient expenditure of
      compressed air. The use of airrelease devices which alternately
      fill with water and air to abruptly release the air to form large
      bubbles or burps is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,068,655 to Murray
      et al. issued Dec. 18, 1962. The present invention concerns a much
      simplified air burst generator and air bubble screen apparatus for
      wave breaking having particular advantages in the protection of
      economicallylimited installations such as lake marinas and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      The airburst generator or burper of the present invention is
      simple and rugged and has the advantage that commercially
      available plastic materials such as polyethelene, polyvinal,
      chloride chlorinated polyvinal chloride, butadiene-styrene, rubber
      styrene and the like pipe and fittings are readily applicable to
      their fabrication. A plurality of the burpers are strung in a
      level submerged position across the lake to provide the
      wavebreaker barrier. The burpers are connected to a compressed air
      line from which air is metered into each of the burpers at a
      selectedrate which is easily controllable by adjustment of the air
      pressure. The units are intended to be submerged to an appreciable
      depth such as thirty feet for example for avoidance of contact
      with surface objects and to obtain enhancement of the wave
      breaking effect of the air bursts due to their expansion to double
      the size of the originally emitted bubbles by the time the air
      bursts break the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the device is simple and automatic. Compressed
      air introduced at the top of the U adjacent to the inlet stem
      forces water equally, substantially, out of the inlet stem and the
      common leg of the U sections until air starts to pass into the
      outlet stem. The weight of the water in the outlet stem is
      immediately reduced so that water rushes into the inlet stem with
      increasing velocity resulting in the stored air being violently
      ejected in a sudden gush out of the top of the outlet stem. Air
      again starts to accumulate at the metered rate to repeat the
      process. The air pressure fed to the burpers exceeds the
      hydrostatic pressure existing at the depth at which the units are
      submerged. The frequency of discharge is controlled by regulating
      the air pressure in the connecting manifold which in turn controls
      the period at which the burpers discharge.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to secure the burpers and associated apparatus at
      a depth which avoids interference with passing boats and fishing
      tackle. Where the nature of the lake body admits, a depth such as
      30 feet is considered desirable.<br>
      <br>
      The burper of the present invention comprises. a molded or
      fabricated duct in the form of two integrally connected oppositely
      directed U sections having a common leg and having at least the
      lower free leg of a length at least slightly in excess of the
      common leg. One free leg which is open upward is termed the outlet
      stem and the other free leg which is open downward is termed the
      inlet stern. In other words the functional position of the unit is
      such that it is supported so that the U section which is open
      downwardly includes the inlet stem and the U section which is open
      upward includes the outlet stem. An air inlet fixture is attached
      to and communicates with the top bend of the downwardly open U
      section. The U sections may be joined in any selected orientation
      ranging from lying in a common plane to form a lazy S to that
      orientation in which the inlet and outlet stems are adjacent each
      other, i.e., side by side similar to bugle shape. The latter
      configuration admits of a more compact construction and increased
      strengthbecause the inlet and outlet stems can be attached to each
      other by any binding means such as cement, encircling bands or one
      or :more through fasteners such as bolts.<br>
      <br>
      In anchored operating position, the burper unit is intended to be
      supported by buoyant and weighting means so that the inlet and
      outlet stems are verticalor substantially vertical. Some variation
      from the vertical is permissible as long as the inlet stems
      extends below the bottom band of the upwardly open U section. Air
      introduced into the air inlet duct displaces water to an equal
      extent, substantially, from the inlet stem and the common leg of
      the U sections until air commences to enter the bottom of the
      outlet stem. At this stage in the cycle, the weight of the water
      inthe outlet stem is reduced below the pressure of the water in
      the inlet stem with the result that the imbalance :in pressure
      increases at a rapid rate and water rushes into the inlet stem to
      till the entire device and in so doing, abruptly expells the air
      previously accumulated in a sudden gush out of the top of the
      outlet stem. Immediately thereafter, air again starts to
      accumulate in the duct to repeat the pro cess. The pressure of the
      air fed to the plurality of burpers forming the breakwater chain
      is selected to exceed the hydrostatic pressure of the water at the
      selected level of submersion of the burpers. The frequency of
      discharge of the air bubbles may be selectively controlled by
      regulating the rate of introduction of air into the units.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will

      Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, the wavebreaker 9 of the
      present invention is adapted to be attached to the shore at least
      at the air compresser end for installation across the lake or
      other body of water to provide a wave breaker barrier between the
      main body of water 11 and the water 13 situate about the Marina
      and small boat mooring zone 15. A source of compressed air 19 and
      a pressure reducer 20 is supported on the shore and is connected
      to the burpers by a compressed air line manifold 21. In permanent
      installations it may be desired to bury the shore portion of .the
      compressed air line for protection against physical damage.<br>
      <br>
      The manner of supporting the burper chain in submerged position is
      shown in FIG. 2. The floor of the lake 9 under the selected wave
      breaker barrier is indicated by reference numeral 23. The burper
      chain is provided with means for buoyancy such as by a hollow air
      manifold 31 or buoys 60 and is prevented from rising by a
      plurality of anchors and tie lines 27. It is generally preferred
      to maintain the burper chain on a horizontal level line in order
      that the compressed air in the air feeder line operates against
      equal static water pressure at all of the burpers 29 to achieve
      approximately the same frequency of burping at all the burpers.
      The burpers 29 are shown diagrammatically in FIG. 2. The manifold
      line 31 in this version is a hollow plastic tube which provides
      the functions of buoyancy, air delivery, and position fixation.<br>
      <br>
      When the burper-chain is prepared at the time of submersion or
      fabrication, the depth of the lake bottom 23 is sounded to provide
      the measurement for the length of anchor lines 27. The depth is
      not critical but when prises an inverted U tube U connected by a
      common leg 49 to an upright U tube U The inlet leg 41 of U must be
      longer than common leg 49. This configuration may be termed a lazy
      S. The length of inlet leg 41 is chosen of a length to prevent air
      escape when legs 49 and 41 are filled with air from inlet until
      the bottom level of the air reaches the level of the bend between
      legs 49 and 43. At this point the weight of the water in leg 43
      plus the static water pressure at the top of stem 43 becomes less
      than the static pressure at the bottom of stem 41 less the weight
      of the water in stem 41. The difference in pressures increases
      rapidly as air enters leg 43 resulting in water rapidly filling
      the burper resulting in the sudden discharge of the stored air as
      a large bubble or air burst at the upper end of leg 43. The air
      burst enlarges as it enters lower water pressures as it ascends to
      the top.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows an alternative configuration of the burper of the
      present invention. In this embodiment U and U are in substantially
      opposition, forming a loop of bugle shape. An advantage of this
      shape lies in its compactness and adaptability to be threaded at
      the bend of U, by the air manifold for both buoyancy and
      compressed air feed.<br>
      <br>
      The burpers of both embodiments may be provided with means 51 for
      afiixing anchor lines 27 to a bottom portion and buoy fastening
      means 53 when additional buoyancy or buoy markers are desired. Air
      manifold 31 in the embodiment of FIG. 4 is provided with a short
      stub tube of selected internal diameter which may be cemented in
      apertures in manifold 31 or other types of air supply and the
      bottom of the bend of inverted U In cases where the air manifold,
      i.e., the line of burpers, calculated pressure at each burper to
      obtain substantially equal air admission.<br>
      <br>
      The burper of FIG. 3 may also be provided with buoyant support
      byeither resting on an air manifold inserted under the bend of
      inverted U, as shown or by buoys. If buoys are used, the airline
      connected to air inlet fixture 55 may be of any size suitable for
      the correct delivery of air without regard for adequate buoyancy.<br>
      <br>
      In any case it is desired that the direction of buoyancy pull and
      anchor pull be on a common vertical line to maintain the burper in
      correct vertical attitude. The burpers can also be maintained in a
      sufficiently vertical attitude if the manifold line is affixed to
      the burpers and is maintained in the correct radial direction by
      fixtures attached thereto and to anchor lines.<br>

      <br>
      This invention relates to the calming of waters in harbors and in
      other areas requiring protection of installations or equipment
      subject to the destructive and otherwise disturbing actions of
      waves created by winds or tides or both. It has heretofore been
      suggested that such calming of waters may be brought about by the
      creation of a wall or screen of air bubbles through the release of
      air bubbles under suitable pressure at a suitable distance below
      the surface of the water. In accordance with the present invention
      this principle is applied through the use of apparatus which may
      be produced and installed economically, may be operated at a
      minimum expense, and may be readily transported from one position
      to another to meet the requirements of a particular situation.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention is adaptable to a wide variety of uses, it has
      been developed for particularly advantageous use in connection
      with the dredging of channels or the like in harbors and
      unprotected waters which are subject to wave motions of such
      magnitude as to interfere seriously with the proper performance of
      the dredging operations. It has been found that in such operations
      any substantial wave movements directed against the
      dredgingequipment interfere seriously with the conduct of the work
      and greatly reduce the efficiency of the operation. Methods and
      means have long been sought for the economical and efficient
      elimination of the difiiculties resulting from wave movements in
      the performance of such dredging operations. One factor which has
      complicated the problem is the necessity of providing means for
      this purpose which may be readily shifted from one position to
      another as the dredging operations progress over a large area of a
      harbor or the like. Similar situations are encountered in other
      cases in which it is necessary to calm the waters in a number of
      different areas of an expanse of water. It is frequently
      desirable, for example, to calm the surface in widely scattered
      areas of a body of water to enable the safe and smooth landing of
      aircraft, such as hydroplanes, in the vicinity of a vessel which
      may be shifted from one station to another. Other situations in
      which the mobility of a unit or system for calming waters is of
      importance will occur to those familiar with the problems
      involved.<br>
      <br>
      One difiiculty in connection with the problem to which the present
      invention is directed is the need for the provision of wave
      calming means which is capable of economical operation and is at
      the same time of such construction so as to be readily rendered
      effective for its intended purpose and is also readily rendered
      easily transportable from one position to another.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention the various problems
      indicated have been solved by the provision of a unit capable of
      producing an efiicient and effective air bubble screen for the
      calming of waters over a large area, the unit being equipped with
      a simple means for floating it at will so that it may readily be
      transported from one position to another and may then be readily
      submerged and caused to rest upon the bottom of a harbor or the
      like so as to be effective for its intended purpose. Moreover, the
      construction as a whole must be such that it will not interfere
      with the free movement of ships through the harbor, in the course
      of prolonged dredging operations for example.<br>
      <br>
      A feature of the invention is the provision of a long,<br>
      <br>
      relatively lightweight, but durable pipeline which may be used
      effectively as a means for alternately floating and sinking the
      devices required for producing the desired air screen. This
      pipeline, which may be of any required length, say to 1000 feet or
      more, must be of sufficiently sturdy construction to withstand
      wave action and tidal currents when floating at the surface of the
      water. The pipeline, when the apparatus is in its operative
      position, is adapted to rest upon the bottom of the harbor and the
      apparatus carried by the pipeline for the production of the air
      screen must not project upwardly from the latter to such an extent
      as to interfere with the free passage of ships of the character
      the harbor is designed to receive. It will be appreciated that the
      bottom of the harbor upon which the pipeline rests is of irregular
      contour, in elevation, and that the pipeline must be capable of
      conforming with these irregularities or of spanning depressions or
      cavities in the surface upon which it rests without subject ing
      the pipe to undue strains.<br>
      <br>
      When the pipeline is submerged it is filled with water and when it
      is to be shifted it is filled with air from a cornpressor unit.
      This air which displaces the water must be supplied under a
      pressure somewhat greater than the hydrostatic pressure of the
      water to be dislodged and to expedite operations should be
      substantially greater. The capacity of the pipeline must be
      suflicient to provide the necessary buoyancy, when it is filled
      with air, to lift it, and the equipment which it carries, to the
      surface of the water so that at least the upper portion of the
      line is exposed above the water level to enable the equipment to
      be readily transported from one location to another. Toward this
      end the invention contemplates the provision of relatively
      lightweight structure on the pipeline for the production of the
      desired air screen and for retaining such means firmly in proper
      position. Moreover, the center of gravity of the pipeline and its
      equipment must be such that the air screen producing devices will
      extend upwardly as required for proper performance. As will be
      explained, the pipeline is formed in sections having ball joint
      connections so that the location of the center of gravity becomes
      important, otherwise one or more of the sections may turn about
      the ball joints at their ends and discharge the air downwardly
      rather than upwardly.<br>
      <br>
      A further feature of the invention is the provision of means in
      the overall combination which is adapted to bring about the
      discharge of air at appropriate periodic intervals at a plurality
      of points adjacent the bottom of the harbor or the like to produce
      the desired air screen over an effective area throughout the
      length of the pipeline. While such an air' screencould be produced
      by the continuous release of air throughout the length of the
      pipeline, this would require an excessive amount of air to be
      discharged, thus calling for excessively large com:- pressor units
      to supply the air and greatly increasing the expense of the
      operation. It has been found that the desired wave calming or
      reducing action may be brought about with the intermittent
      discharge of air, thus greatly reducing the total amount of air
      required, but the provision of means for producing such.
      intermittent. release of air has necessarily added to the overall
      weight of the equipment which must be floated to make possible the
      ready transportation of the equipment from one location to
      another. The present inventionhas solved all of these problems in
      an eflective and economical manner;<br>
      <br>
      Briefly, the present invention contemplates the use of a barge at
      the inlet endof the pipeline and a tugboat, or the like, at the
      opposite end of the line. The barge is equipped With air
      compressors and power means, such as diesel or gasoline engines,
      for driving the sameand suitable hose lines for supplying air
      under-the required pressure to the main floating and sinking
      pipeline discussed above and also to the devices for
      intermittently discharging air to produce the air screen. In some
      situations it is possible to eliminate the barge and place the
      compressors and the like on a fixed land structure which may
      permit movement of the equipment to different points as the
      location of the pipeline is shifted. The compressors must be
      capable of delivering air under sufficient pressure to overcome
      the loss of head in the supply lines and the hydrostatic head of
      the water at the bottom of the harbor and at an appropriate rate
      to expel the water from the main pipeline to float the same within
      a reasonable time interval and to supply air to produce the
      desired air screen when the system is in operation. It will be
      understood that air is required for these two purposes at
      different times so that the capacity of the compressors need be
      sufiicient only to serve one purpose at a time. The boat at the
      opposite end of the pipeline is provided with a hoist which,
      through a wire rope or cable having its free end connected with
      the adjacent end of the pipeline, is adapted to lift this to the
      surface when it is desired to change the location of the
      equipment. This end of the pipeline is normally open when the line
      is submerged, and it may remain open at all times 'if it is held
      on the boat after the water has been discharged from it and as it
      is towed from one location to another. However, the pipeline may
      be capped olf at its end remote from the compressor, after
      substantially all of the water has been blown out of it, and the
      equipment may then be towed in its floated condition with the boat
      at the far end simply assisting in maintaining the pipeline along
      a relatively straight path.<br>
      <br>
      The means for creating the desired bubble screen may comprise a
      plurality of so-called burpers which are open at their tops and
      bottoms to admit water but are provided with baffles or partitions
      to divide the interior into a plurality of ditferent zones. Air
      introduced into the bottom of the burper serves to expel the main
      body of water in it and then allows a sudden gush of air to pass
      upwardly and out at the top of the unit. Water is then permitted
      to reenter the unit and substantially fill the same under the
      hydrostatic pressure existing at .the depth to which the unit is
      submerged. Preferably a value is provided in the unit for
      temporarily preventing the discharge of air when the main chamber
      of the unit is refilled with water; The continued intrTaduction of
      air under pressure serves to repeat the operation, so that the
      unit automatically releases a quan- 'tity of air mixed with water
      at periodic intervals. The frequency of discharge of air may be
      controlled by regulating in various ways the rate at which the air
      is intro- .duced into the unit. 7<br>

      Turning now to the drawings, the mobile pneumatic breakwater of
      the present invention comprises a series of sections of pipe
      connected together by ball joint couplings to provide a breakwater
      of any desired length. In FIGS. 1 and 2 portions of three such
      pipe sections 10, 11 and 12 are shown. Each section may suitably
      he, say, 96 feet long and may be provided with air bubble
      releasing units at 8-foot intervals along its length. Any number
      of such pipe sections may be connected together to form a
      breakwater of desired length. The main portion of each pipe
      section may suitably have a diameter of about 18 inches, the pipe
      being formed of steel plate of suitable thickness, say inch, to
      enable the pipeline to withstand the distorting forces mentioned
      hereinbefore. The pipe should also be of sufiicient strength to
      prevent buckling or serious bending in the course of handling the
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      At each end of each pipe section there is provided one part of a
      ball joint coupling consisting of a ball and a bell. The ball
      portion of the coupling is indicated at 13 and it is provided with
      a collar 13a which is welded to the end of the section 10 of the
      pipe, for example. Pipe 11 (FIG. 3) carries the bell portion of
      the coupling shown at 1-4 which has a collar 14a welded to the end
      of pipe section 11. Obviously the location of the ball and bell
      portions of the coupling may be reversed if desired. Members 13
      and 14 have, respectively, a convex and a concave partial
      spherical surface arranged to ride upon each other with a
      substantially air-tight and water-tight fit provided by a rubber
      gasket. To enable assembly of the coupling and the retention of
      the parts in assembled relation there is provided a ring 15 having
      a partial spherical inner surface arranged to ride upon the outer
      surface of ball member 13. The ring 15 may be formed in two
      sections to facilitate assembly or it may be formed as a closed
      ring which is loosely applied to the pipe section 10 or to the
      member 13 before the latter is welded to the pipe section 10.
      Member 14 has a plurality of outwardly extending ears 14b around
      its periphery, adjacent pairs of such ears being "arranged to
      pivotally retain an eye bolt 16. Each of these bolts is arranged
      to have its shank swung into a recess 15a, one of which is
      provided in the periphery of ring 15 in longitudinal alignment
      with each of the bolts 16. A nut 17 provided on each bolt enables
      clamping of the ring 15 in appropriate relation to the end of the
      member 14 to provide a relatively close fit in relation to member
      13, but in a manner to permit relative sliding between the
      cooperating spherical surfaces of member 13 on the one hand, and
      member 14 and ring 15 on the other hand.<br>
      <br>
      The interior of each pipe section is partitioned oif to provide a
      passage or chamber 19 of suitable cross-sectional area for the
      delivery of air under pressure to the air bubble releasing units.
      For this purpose there may be provided a longitudinally extending
      partition 20 which is suitably welded into the plate structure
      forming the main pipeline to provide the indicated air passage 19.
      Vertical partitions 21 at each end of the passage serve to close
      ofl the latter from the main passage through the pipe section at a
      point adjacent each end of the latter. The passage 1? of one pipe
      section, such as 16 (FIG. 3), is connected to a corresponding
      passage in the pipe section 11 through an elbow member 22
      extending downwardly from the partition 20 and connected by a
      coupling 23 with a flexible hose line 24 which in turn is
      connected by a coupling 25 with a flexible hose line 26. The
      latter is connected by coupling 27 with an elbow member 28
      extending downwardly from the partition 26 in the pipe section 11.
      It will be understood that the flexible hose line 24, 26 permits
      the two pipe sections to be angled in any direction in relation to
      each other without disrupting the connection between their
      passages 19. Similar connections are provided between the passages
      19 in the successive pipe sections throughout the length of the
      main pipeline being employed.<br>
      <br>
      At spaced intervals along each pipe section, say at 8-foot
      intervals, there is provided a frame structure 29 (FIG. 4)
      suitably secured to and projecting transversely from the pipe
      section. This frame structure may be of angle iron construction
      and, as best shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, has horizontally disposed
      members arranged to provide a diamond configuration in plan, as
      shown in FIG. 1. Other members of the frame structure extend
      downwardly to provide transverse angle members arranged to rest
      upon the bottom of the harbor or the like when the apparatus is in
      operative position. At each end of the frame structure, as shown
      in FIG. 4, there is mounted an air bubble releasing unit 30. These
      are connected with the air passage 1? by means of pipes 31 and 32
      connected with a T-fitting 33 extending through the main pipe
      section into communication with the passage 19. At their opposite
      ends the pipes 31 and 32 are provided with T-fittings 34 having
      upwardly extending short pipes or nipples 35 entering the bottoms
      of the units 30. Short pipes 36 extend downwardly from the T
      connections 34 and are secured to the frame structure 29 by
      members 36:: having a plate-like base and an upwardly extending
      collar. The pipes 36 are preferably sealed off at their upper ends
      by a suitable block or disc so as to eliminate the accumulation of
      water therein. Various portions of the frame structure are welded
      together at points of contact to provide a rigidly and firmly
      connected structure. For a pipe section 96 feet long there may be
      provided twelve of such frame structures, with those adjacent the
      ends of the pipe section being disposed 4 feet inwardly from the
      ends.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, a suitable compressor or compressors and
      an air tank indicated schematically at 37 is mounted either on
      short or on a barge, as the case may be, at one end of the system.
      Preferably the air tank 37 is arranged to deliver air under a
      pressure of about 125 lbs. per sq. in. to a pipe 33 having a valve
      380 for either closing off or throttling down the delivery of air
      from the compressor. A valve 39 is also provided in the line 38
      for cutting off the delivery of air to the main flotation passage
      through the pipeline 1t 11, 12, etc. and to permit the release of
      air from the latter whenever it is desired to sink the pipeline.
      The end of pipe 38 is connected through a flexible hose line 39a
      of suitable length with the end of pipe section 10, the hose being
      connected with a fitting 4% at the center of a closure disc 41
      clamped to the end of the ball joint member 14. This disc may be
      secured in place by the bolts 16 previously described. A branch
      pipe 42, having a pressure reducing valve 43 therein, serves to
      deliver air to a flexible hose line 44 connected into the passage
      19 which, as explained, is connected with the air releasing units
      30. When the main pipeline is submerged to a depth of 40-50 feet,
      or somewhat more, the valve 43 may be adjusted to deliver air at
      30 lbs. per sq. in. to the air releasing units. The air compressor
      system should be capable of supplying air to the units at such
      pressure at an appropriate rate, which may be about 1500 cu. ft.
      per minute for a pipeline 500 feet long. This is adequate to
      create the desired air screen for calming the water under
      conditions normally encountered. The rate of release may, however,
      be either increased or decreased to provide the desired calming
      action for waves of different heights and lengths. In working in
      deeper harbors where the pipeline must be submerged to a greater
      extent than indicated above, the air delivered to the releasing
      units should be under a somewhat higher pressure. It must be under
      a pressure somewhat in excess of the hydrostatic pressure of the
      water at the depth to which the units are submerged.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of the units 30 and their mode of operation is
      illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 9-11, inclusive. Each unit comprises an
      outer shell 45 of frusto-conical configuration and formed
      preferably of polyethylene or a similar plastic which is
      relatively light in weight, resistant to corrosion and capable of
      withstanding the stresses to which it is subjected. In fact, the
      entire unit 36 is preferably formed of such a plastic. Centrally
      disposed within the shell 45 is a cup member 46 which is closed at
      its bottom. Within the member 46 is provided a tube 47 which is
      open at its bottom and serves to provide an annular passage
      between its external surface and the interior of cup member 46. At
      its upper end, the tube 47 has a laterally extending flange
      provided with screw thread formations cooperating with similar
      formations on the shell 30. Cup member 46 has a laterally
      extending flange 49 which is secured to the portion 48 of member
      47 in any suitable way. The flange 49 is formed at the outer
      end-of a skirt-like extension from the member 46 which provides a
      small chamber at the upper end of said member. Cup member 46 and
      tube member 47 may be united to form a sub-assembly before
      application to the shell 45. An axially extending flange 50
      carried by member 47 is screw threaded to receive the lower end of
      a screw threaded, dome shaped, discharge member 51. The latter may
      be provided with a series of perforations or a series of slots in
      its dome through which air may be discharged in the manner to be
      described, and through which water may enter the interior of the
      tube 47 and the cup 46 at times. The conical skirt toward the
      upper end of the cup 46 is provided with a series of openings 52
      around itscircumference to permit the passage of either air or
      water from within the shell 45 into the small chamber formed by
      the skirt at the upper end of the cup. Openings 53 through the
      upper portion of the vertical wall of the cup 46 likewise permit
      the passage of air into the space between the inner surface of the
      cup and the outer surface of the tube 47. A ring 54, however,
      having a laterally extending flange at its top is arranged to
      close off the ports 53 when the ring is raised into its uppermost
      position by the action of the water passing through the openings
      52 in the manner to be explained. This valve ring is lowered in
      the course of operation of the unit when the water is forced
      downwardly by the air.<br>
      <br>
      For mounting the unit 30 on the frame structure of FIG. 4 the
      shell 45 is provided with three outwardly extending ears 55. These
      ears are provided with openings arranged to receive bolts 57 by
      which the shell 45 may be secured to a spider-like bracket 56
      arranged to be carried by the pipe or nipple 35. The spider for
      this purpose is provided with a downwardly extending tube or cup
      58 mounted over or within the pipe 35. and welded or otherwise
      secured thereto. If desired,.the cup 58 may be mounted
      directlywithin and secured to the upper branch of the T-fitting
      34. Atits upper end the cup 58 is largely closed off bya disc 59
      arranged to receive an air metering element 60 preferably formed
      of bronze or a suitable plastic. The arrangement is such that
      meteringelements having openings of different diameter may be
      inserted within the discs 59 of the various air releasing units to
      thus control the rate of delivery of air into the several units
      30. This will enable proper adaptation of the system as a whole to
      deliver air into the various units at substantially the same rate
      regardless of the location of the units in relation to the
      compressor. Those units most remote from the compressor should
      have somewhat larger openings through the metering elements 60
      than the units which are closer to the source of air supply.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the foregoing system will now be briefly
      described. When the system is to be set up in a particular area of
      a harbor, the main pipeline and its connected parts, all
      susbtantially free of water, will be transported to the desired
      area by a number of boats and a barge which carries the compressor
      equipment and possibly the adjacent end of the pipeline. One of
      the boats may carry the opposite end of the pipeline and
      additional boats may be required to assist in towing the pipeline
      and maintaining it in a reasonably straight line. When the de-
      'sired location is reached the ends of the pipeline will be
      dropped from the barge and boat carrying the same and the main
      pipeline will then become filled with water and, as a result of
      this, sink to the bed of the harbor. A number of boats may be
      required along the length of the pipeline to maintain it in the
      desired substantially straight line as it is being submerged. The
      number of such boats required will depend upon the overall length
      of the pipeline which may vary from several hundred feet to about
      1,000 feet or more. p The direction in which the pipeline is
      extended and its distance from the dredging equipment, or any
      other equipment the operation of which is to be protected, will
      depend upon a variety of circumstances, chiefly the direction from
      which the waves are approaching the equipment. In all instances
      the pipeline should, of course, be so disposed that the equipment
      to be protected is on the lee side of the line. As applied to
      dredging operations, it the waves are approaching the dredging
      equipment from a direction at right angles to the channel to be
      dredged, the pipeline may suitably be disposed about 100 feet from
      such channel, whereas if the waves are approaching from a
      direction substantially parallel with the desired channel, the
      pipeline may be submerged at a distance of say 500 feet from the
      initial working position of the dredge. In the second situation
      the dredge in the course of its operation, may be advanced about
      400 feet toward the pipeline before it become necessary to float
      the pipeline and shift it to a new location. Where the waves are
      approaching the dredge at substantially right angles to the
      direction of the channel to be dredged, a pipeline 1000 feet in
      length may permit the dredge to advance from 600 to 800 feet
      before it is necessary to relocate the pipeline. The frequency
      with which the pipeline must be floated and relocated thus depends
      upon the foregoing considerations as well as the length of the
      pipeline and the character and amount of the material to be
      removed from the bottom of the harbor to create the desired
      channel, which determine the speed with which the removal may take
      place. Other factors will also enter into this phase of the
      operation, such as the nature of the wave motion to be calmed. The
      air screen produced in accordance with the invention is more
      effective on certain types of wave motion, involving a particular
      relationship between the height and length of thewaves, than other
      types. Also the extent to which the pneumatic breakwater will be
      effective in the regions adjacent its ends will vary with the
      character of the waves to be calmed.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that the hose lines 39a and 44 "will be of
      sufficient length, say 100 feet or more, so as to extend from the
      barge to the inlet 40 of the main passage in the pipeline and-t0
      the passage 19, respectively, when the pipeline rests on the bed
      of the harbor at a suitable distance from the barge. The valve 38a
      may be closed during this period so that no air is delivered from
      the compressor equipment to any part of the system. However, if
      desired, the valves 38a and 39 may be opened partially during the
      towing operation to prevent the entry of water into the passage 19
      through the metering elements 60 and also replenish the air which
      might leak through the ball joints.<br>
      <br>
      In lieu of retaining the far end of the pipeline on a tug or the
      like, as explained above, in transporting the system to the
      desired location, the end of the pipeline may simply be closed off
      by applying a closure plate or cap to the ball joint member 13 or
      14 at the far end of the line. If this were of the form of member
      14 the closure could be readily retained in the same manner as the
      disc 41 of FIG. 8. When so applied to the pipeline filled with air
      it will serve to maintain the water tightness of the main passage
      through the pipeline so that the latter will float the equipment
      as a Whole and permit it to be readily towed, with the barge at
      the forward end, to the desired location. One or more boats may,
      however, be required to maintain the pipeline along the desired
      path. When the desired loca tion is reached the far end of the
      pipeline may be hoisted from the water to remove the closure and
      thus permit the introduction of water as this end of the pipeline
      is lowered again. It is desirable in the course of this stage of
      the operation to attach a buoy to the pipeline, adjacent its end,
      so as to provide a marker for its location. The rope connecting
      the buoy to the pipeline should be slightly longer than the depth
      of the water in its area. At the opposite end of the pipeline the
      barge, which is firmly anchored, will provide an indication as to
      the approximate location of that end of the line.<br>
      <br>
      When it is desired to create the air screen for calming the waves
      approaching the equipment to be protected, the valve 38a will be
      opened while the valve 39 will remain closed. This will bring
      about delivery of air through the branch line 42, reducing valve
      43, and hose line 44 to the passage 19. The passage 19 may have
      become filled with water during the submersion operation through
      the access provided by the metering discs 60 of the various units
      30. The air delivered to the passage 19 will first serve to remove
      this water and then deliver air through the metering discs 60 into
      the interior of the shells 45. At this time the units will be
      substantially filled with water except for a small amount of air
      which may be entrapped at the tops of the chambers 61 and 62
      indicated in FIG. 9. At this time the ring 54 will have been
      lifted by the water into the position indicated in FIG. 9 so as to
      close 011 the openings 53, but the chamber 62 will be in
      communication with the main chamber 61 through the openings 52. As
      the air under pressure rises within the chamber 61 it will
      gradually accumulate at the top and force the water downwardly
      within the shell. As the water level within the shell is lowered
      the ring 54 will be' lowered and will eventually open up
      completely the passages 53. At this time the continued delivery of
      air will not only continue to lower the level of the water within
      the chamber 61 but also within the annular channel 63, as
      indicated in FIG. 10. Continued delivery of air serves to force
      the water level down to the point indicated in FIG. 11 which
      serves to open up the mouth of the chamber 64 within the tube 47.
      When this is achieved there will be a sudden rush of air under
      pressure from within the shell 45. This air will pass through the
      openings 52 and 53 and downwardly through the channel 63 and then
      upwardly through the chamber 64. In the latter it will mix with
      the water column still present therein and create an aerated mass
      of water which, because of its lower density than the surrounding
      water, will rise and be emitted upwardly through the openings in
      the cap 51 with a mushrooming efliect in the manner indicated in
      FIG. 9. In the course of expelling the air in this manner, the
      water will quickly rise within the chamber 61 to a level close to
      the top of the latter and in doing so will lift the valve ring 54
      into the position shown in FIG. 9, thus closing off the openings
      53. The device is now ready for a repet1- tion of the same
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that the devices 30 distributed along the
      length of the pipeline will all operate in the same manner each
      operating independently of the other so that they do not discharge
      the air simultaneously but all dischargea given amount of air at
      periodic intervals the duration of which is determined by the rate
      of discharge of air through the orifice disc 60. In the normal use
      of the equipment it is desirable to have such air discharge take
      place from each unit about every 3 to 7 seconds, depending upon
      the conditions being encountered. The air mixed with the water
      thus rising from the bottom of the harbor to the top serves to
      provide an air screen which has a remarkable calming action upon
      the waves at the surface of the water.<br>
      <br>
      As the mixture of air and water is periodically released from each
      of the units 39 throughout the length of the pipeline, the rising
      current of bubbles, forming in effect a curtain or screen, has a
      tendency to spread both longitudinally and transversely of the
      pipeline so that as the mixture of air and water reaches the
      surface of the body of water a relatively large area, having
      substantial length and width, is placed in a state of turbulence
      which has a remarkable effect upon the destructive or disturbing
      actions of the wave movements. Preferably the waves are largely
      reduced to a surf-like condition before they reach the dredge or
      other object to be protected.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the discharge of air from each unit may be varied
      to suit the requirements at any particular time by regulating the
      reducing valve 43 and simultaneously controlling the speed of the
      compressor to meet the demand. Also it is possible to vary the
      frequency of discharge, in the use of the equipment under
      different conditions, by changing the metering discs 60 to suit
      the requirements of a particular situation. The pressure of the
      air delivered to the passage 19 through the reducing valve should
      always be sufficiently greater than the hydrostatic pressure at
      the level of the lowermost air releasing unit in the series that
      air will be discharged into said unit, and in fact all of the
      units, at a desired rate. The extent to which the air pressure
      exceeds such hydrostatic pressure at each unit will determine the
      rate of fiow of the air through the orifice in the disc 60 of each
      unit and thus determine the time interval between successive
      discharges of air. In some instances in which long, relatively
      small diameter hose or pipelines are employed in this portion of
      the system, the reducing valve may be omitted or by-passed.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, the units 30 on the opposite sides of the main
      pipeline need not be disposed in pairs having their axes in the
      same plane transverse to the pipeline. Those on one side of the
      pipeline may be located intermediate those on the opposite side.
      For this purpose the frame construction 29 may be modified to
      enable the frame as a whole to be disposed at an angle of 45 to
      the axis of the pipeline or it may be so modified that each frame
      extends outwardly toward only one side of the pipeline, at right
      angles to the axis thereof, alternate frames extending in one
      direction and the others extending in the opposite direction from
      the pipeline. The T-fittings 33 in this event will be replaced by
      elbow fittings. The disposition of the units 30 on one side of the
      pipeline midway between those on the opposite side of the
      pipeline, in the direction of the axis of the latter, has certain
      advantages with respect to the character of the air screen formed.
      Whatever arrangement is employed it is important that the
      structure as a whole is balanced about the axis of the main
      pipeline and has its center of gravity below such axis. This is
      necessary to insure against tilting of the frame structure carried
      by a certain pipe section and turning of the pipe section as would
      be 10- readily permitted by the ball joint couplings between the
      same and the adjacent pipe sections.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 12-17, inclusive, there is shown a modified
      construction of the pipeline and its attachments for producing the
      air bubble screen in accordance with the invention. An important
      advantage of the modified construction is that it reduces the
      overall height of the apparatus which is submerged and thus
      enables use of the equipment in harbors having little more than
      the depth required for the maximum draft vessels which enter the
      harbor. The arrangement is such that the maximum vertical
      dimension of the equipment is no greater than the diameter of the
      ball joint couplings for the main pipeline sections.<br>
      <br>
      The modified system comprises a series of pipe sections two of
      which are shown at 65 and 66. These may suitably be each 96 feet
      in length. Successive sections are connected by substantially
      airtight and Watertight ball joints provided by members 67 and 68
      similar tomembers 13 and 14 of the first embodiment. These are
      assembled and held together in the same manner as ex plained in
      connection with the first embodiment. At suitable spacings, say 8
      feet, along the pipeline there are provided along each side
      thereof units 69 similar to the air releasing units 39 of the
      first embodiment. The units 69 are carried by pipes 7 i and 71
      extending horizontally from the main pipe sections at right angles
      to the axis thereof, as shown in FIG. 17. These pipes are welded
      to the main pipe section, such as 65, at points well below the
      horizontal plane extending through the axis of the main pipe
      section. They are braced and firmly retained on the main pipe
      section by means of brackets or plates 72, 73 and 74 which are
      welded to the main pipe section and to the pipes 70 and 71, the
      plates 72 and 74 being disposed vertically and the plates 73 being
      disposed hor-izontally. In this way a firm and rigid connection of
      the pipes 76 and 71 with the main pipe section is pro.- vided. At
      the outer end of each of the pipes 76 and 71 there is provided a
      T-fitting 75 the bottom of which is closed off by a screw cap or
      plug 76. The upwardly extending arm of the T-fitting is arranged
      to receive a sleeve 77 extending downwardly from a three-armed
      spider 78 which is suitably secured, as by welding, to the sleeve
      77. The latter may be firmly connected with the T-fitting 75 in
      any suitable way as by the provision of a small telescoping nipple
      or pipe section received within the sleeve 77 and also within the
      upper arm of the T- fitting. Any other suitable means for
      providing a firm and airtight connection of the parts may be
      employed. Each of the units 69 is provided with an outer shell
      similar to the shell 45 of FIG. 5 and. this, adjacent its lower
      end, is provided with three outwardly extending ears 79 arranged
      to cooperate with the arms of the spider 78 and adapted to be
      secured to the latter by screws 80. The upper end of sleeve 77 is
      closed by a ring or disc 81 carrying at its center a metering disc
      82. The latter has a discharge opening at its center which may be
      of different diameter for different units, thus enabling the
      delivery of air at substantially the same rate to all of the units
      along the length of the pipeline in spite of their varying
      distances from the source of compressed air.<br>
      <br>
      For delivering air to the pipes 70 and 71, and hence to the units
      69, there is provided a small pipeline '83 at each side of the
      main pipeline 6 5, 66, etc. The pipelines 83 are secured to the
      equipment at each of the pipes 70 or 71 throughout the length of
      the system by means of T-fittings 84 provided at these points in
      the pipelines 83. T-fittings 84 are in turn connected with the
      upper ends of the short, upwardly extending pipes 85
      projectingfrom the pipes 70 and 71. To permit angular movement of
      one main pipe section, such as 65, in relation to another, such as
      66, at the ball joint coupling, a flexible hose line 86 is
      provided to interconnect the adjacent ends of the successive
      sections of the small pipelines 83 carried by the main pipe
      sections. These hose lines 86 may be formed of flexible metal or
      of polyethylene. In fact, the pipelines 83 may also be formed of
      polyethylene, if desired, in order to reduce to a minimum the
      danger of clogging the air line through the accumulation of
      corrosion particles and the like therein resulting from the
      introduction of water through the metering discs when no air is
      being delivered through the air lines while the apparatus is
      submerged. However, if the pipelines 83 are formed of polyethylene
      it may be desirable to provide bracing members formed of angle
      irons or the like, between successive pipes 70 on one side and
      successive pipes 71 on the other to render greater rigidity to the
      structure. If the pipelines 83 are formed of metal on the other
      hand, they will provide adequate rigidity to the structure. Also,
      to eliminate corrosion problems, the pipes 70 and 71 may be
      replaced by polyethylene or other plastic tubing, and in this
      event metal frames may be provided to extend outwardly from the
      main pipeline sections to carry the plastic tubing and also the
      air releasing units.<br>
      <br>
      As explained in connection with the first described embodiment of
      the invention, the pipes 70 and 71, or the suggested substitute
      structure, may be arranged to extend outwardly from the main
      pipeline in such a way as to position the air releasing units on
      one side of the main pipeline intermediate those on the opposite
      side of the pipelinein the direction of the axis of the latter.
      This, in the illustrative example, will provide an air releasing
      unit every four feet along the length of the main pipeline. Good
      results may be obtained if the spacing of the units is increased
      to six feet.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 12, the system includes an air tank 87 connected
      with a compressor of suitable capacity to supply the air necessary
      for the flotation of the main pipeline 65, 66, etc. and for
      operation of the units 69. This equipment, as in the case of the
      first embodiment, is preferably carried by a barge located
      adjacent one end of the main pipeline. Air is delivered from the
      tank 87 through a line 88 to a valve 89 and from the latter to the
      center of the first main pipe section 65. The connection with the
      latter may be similar to that shown at 40 in FIG. 8. It will be
      understood that valve 89 is mounted on the barge and serves to
      control the delivery or cutting oil of the supply of air to the
      main pipeline. Between the valve 89 and the main pipeline there is
      provided a suitable length of flexible hose to connect line 83
      with the pipe section 65 when the latter is submerged to the bed
      of the harbor in a position in which its free end is spaced a
      suitable distance horizontally from the barge to avoid any
      interference with the latter. A branch line 90 from the line 88 is
      arranged to receive air from the tank 87 when a valve 91 is
      opened. In the line 90 there is preferably provided a pressure
      reducing valve 92 which enables reduction of the pressure of the
      air from that in the tank 87, say 125 lbs. per sq. in., to that
      desired for delivery through a T-fitting 93 and branch lines 94,
      95 to flexible hose lines connected with the near ends of the
      pipelines 83 carried by pipe section 65. The desired pressure for
      this purpose will vary, as explained in connection with the first
      embodiment, but should ordinarily be such as to maintain a
      pressure of about 30 lbs. per sq. in. at the most remote air
      release unit 69.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the modified system is substantially the same as
      explained for the first embodiment. By operation of the valve 89
      air may be admitted to the main pipeline 65, 66, etc. to expel the
      water therefrom and to raise it to the surface whenever it is
      desired to move the equipment from one location to another. When
      the main pipeline has been raised to the surface the far end may
      'be hoisted on to a boat and either retained there during
      transportation, or it may be capped in the manner explained in
      connection with the first embodiment and then returned to the
      Water, so that the pipeline will remain afloat as it is towed to a
      new location. A suitable num- '-ber of tug boats should be
      provided to maintain the pipeline in a substantially straight
      condition as it is being towed and to position it properly at .a
      new location. When it reaches the new location, the cap is removed
      from the far end of the main pipeline and the latter is permitted
      to fill with water and thus again submerge the equipment to the
      bed of the harbor. The hose connecting the compressor system with
      the main pipeline will at this time be disconnected from the
      source of air supply to permit the escape of air from the main
      pipeline, or a special valve may be provided for this purpose. It
      will be understood that during the sinking operation the valve 89
      will be closed so that no air is delivered beyond this valve. Now
      the system is ready for the creation of the desired pneumatic
      breakwater by opening the valve 91 to provide a continuous supply
      of air at the desired pressure to all of the units 69. The air so
      delivered will be periodically released by each of the units 69 at
      suitable intervals in the same manner as explained in connection
      with the first embodiment.<br>

      The present invention relates to improvements in the art of
      protecting harbors and other chosen areas from the damaging
      effects of waves, and more particularly to a highly improved
      method and apparatus for causing waves in a body of water to
      subside.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the huge amounts of energy that are transmitted by
      waves of any substantial size on bodies of water, the matter of
      providing adequate protection against wave damage, and the
      provision of safe, quietwater areas, have been problems with which
      men have struggled for hundreds of years. The amounts of energy
      that must be dissipated when waves on relatively large bodies of
      water are arrested often becomes almost unbelievably great, and a
      very substantial amount of literature exists concerning the forces
      produced by waves and the difficulties involved in building
      ordinary breakwater structures of suflicient mass and secure
      foundation to withstand these forces. One brief but interesting
      article on the subject, for example, may be found in the 1955
      edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, volume 4, at pages 68 to
      70, where it is pointed out that sections of ordinary stone, steel
      and concrete breakwaters weighing more than 1,000 tons have been
      known to have been moved by the forces of waves striking the
      sections. It is there also mentioned that the force exerted by
      waves against one masonry breakwater was calculated to have been
      two tons per square inch. It will thus be appreciate that the
      building and maintenance of ordinary, massive breakwater
      structures has been and remains an extremely expensive and time
      consuming undertaking even when the waves that are expected to
      strike the structures are not especially large.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the time and expense involved in the building of
      breakwater structures of the traditional type just referred to,
      they can seldom be resorted to when the need for protection
      against waves is only temporary, such as during certain military
      operations or during exploratory off-shore drilling operations,
      for example. Furthermore, breakwater structures of the traditional
      type, when used to protect shipping harbors and the like, must
      have one or more sizable openings therein through which ships and
      other surface-craft may pass. Such openings readily admit waves
      into the harbor area, and objectionable harbor conditions often
      arise as a result thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The present method and apparatus for causing waves in a body of
      water to subside involves a complete departure from traditional
      concepts, and it involves in part a utilization of the wave energy
      itself to cause the waves to subside.<br>
      <br>
      It is a known fact that, although waves created by wind and the
      like appear to involve progressive linear movement or flow of
      water in the direction of the movement of the waves, there is no
      such flow of any consequence. On the contrary, each wave is
      manifested by a local orbiting of the individual particles of
      water in substantially vertical planes. Each wave, at any
      particular moment, involves this local orbiting of Water particles
      not only adjacent the water surface but also well down below the
      portion of the wave that can be seen from the surface, the size of
      the individual orbits of the separate water particles
      progressively decreasing with depth. Each wave at any given
      moment, therefore, has a body defined by the area in which the
      water particles are in motion in their individual orbits. The
      body, in<br>
      <br>
      cross section and in deep water, is roughly V-shaped, with the
      uppermost portion of the V occupied by the visible portion of the
      wave and the remainder of the V occupied by the underwater portion
      thereof. This inherent nature of the bodies of Waves in water is
      well understood by those who have investigated the subject, and it
      is illustrated, for example, in the 1960 edition of Encyclopedia
      of Science and Technology, volume 14, page 433. Thus, it will be
      understood that as an advancing wave passes a given location, each
      particle of water adjacent to that location and within the
      V-shaped body of the wave beneath the visible portion thereof
      moves in its own generally vertically oriented, orbital or
      substantially closed path-each particle moving upwardly and
      forwardly and then downwardly, and finally rearwardly and upwardly
      in a curved path substantially back to its original location. The
      individual orbits of the separate water particles are believed by
      students of the subject to be substantially circular in shape in
      deep water and tend to become somewhat flattened or elliptical in
      shape in more shallow water. In any event, it will be understood
      that this orbital motion of the water particles is a manifestation
      of the Wave energy.<br>
      <br>
      The method and apparatus of the present invention, as will be more
      fully explained hereinafter, involves the discovery that the
      discharge of submerged streams of water against the under-water
      portion of a wave will distort many of the orbits of the Water
      particles therein and, as a result of this distortion, will create
      turbulence in the under-water portion of the wave that builds up
      in a chainlike reaction due to interference with still other
      orbits of water particles. This creates a state of turbulence in
      which the energy of the water particles, and thus the Wave energy,
      is dissipated in the turbulence and in the collisions of the
      millions of particles involved.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, one of the important objects of the present invention
      is to provide a method and apparatus by which the above described
      discovery may be utilized, the method being one for causing a wave
      in a body of water to subside by directing a submerged stream of
      water against the submerged or under-water portion of the wave to
      distort the normal pattern of orbital motion of the water
      particles therein and thereby produce turbulence in which the wave
      energy is dissipated. Still another important object of the
      present invention is to provide a method and apparatus by which
      waves are caused to be diverted from a given area and from their
      normal direction of movement, by directing submerged streams of
      water against the submerged or under-water portions of the waves
      in directions having directional components normal to the movement
      of the waves. Other objects and advantages of the invention are to
      provide improvements in the practice of the method and improved
      apparatus for carrying out the same.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the method and apparatus are numerous, for it
      will be seen that the method is relatively easy to put into
      practice and the apparatus is far less expensive to build and
      install than the massive breakwater structures that are commonly
      employed to provide wave protection. Furthermore, the present
      method and apparatus are ideally suited for use in causing Waves
      to subside in an open harbor mouth or the like, for the apparatus
      may be located :well below the surface of the water where it will
      not be damaged either by Waves or other forces, and there is no
      interference with shipping. The method and apparatus need not be
      confined to such use, however. On the contrary, the method and
      apparatus may be used wherever it may be desired to cause Waves to
      subside. In addition, because of the nature of the apparatus, it
      may be installed on a temporary basis where needed and
      subsequently taken up or moved to another location when and if
      that becomes desirable. There are many other advantages among
      which is the fact that, when the apparatus andmethod are employed
      for causing waves to subside in or at the open mouth of a harbor
      or canal or the like, the apparatus and method will tend to keep
      the mouth free of ice due to the circulation of water and
      turbulence involved.<br>

      Other objects and advantages of the method and apparatus will be
      understood from the following description of certain preferred
      forms thereof, taken with the accompanying drawings wherein, for

      Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to FIG. 1, the
      numerals 10 and 11 designate the ends of an ordinary masonry
      breakwater structure such as is commonly employed to define the
      open mouth of a harbor or other protected water area, the seaward
      sides of the breakwater structures being designated respectively
      by the numerals 12 and 13. It will be appreciated that FIGURE 1 is
      schematically presented and that the intervening space between the
      ends of the breakwater structures 10 and 11 provide an open
      passage through which shipping may ass.<br>
      <br>
      p The apparatus of the present invention is shown installed
      beneath the water in this open mouth of the harbor or the like for
      the purpose of causing waves to subside that ordinarily and
      otherwise would pass freely through the open mouth and into the
      harbor area. As illustrated the apparatus comprises a plurality of
      banks of motor driven propellers. The seawardmost bank is
      represented by the letter A, the intermediate bank is designated
      by the letter B and the innermost bank is designated by the letter
      C. For simplicity of illustration only three banks have been
      shown, but it will be understood that more banks may be employed
      and many more motor driven propellers may be used in each bank
      where the conditions expected to be encountered require the use of
      more apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus employed for mounting the individual motor driven
      propellers may in each case be identical. In<br>
      <br>
      the form illustrated each propeller 14 is fixed upon the outer end
      of the shaft 15 of an electric motor 16 of the submersible type,
      but it will be readily appreciated that other mechanism such as
      mechanical drive shafts and the like may be employed for mounting
      and driving the propellers. In the form shown each submersible
      electric motor 16 is mounted atop a base 17 of concrete or the
      like which rests or is anchored upon the bottom 18 of the harbor
      mouth. Bases of other structure, such as fabricated iron or steel,
      may of course be used. The uppermost end of each base 17 has fixed
      thereto a circular metal plate 19 having a plurality of bolt
      receiving openings adjacent its periphery. A second circular plate
      20' rests upon the plate 19 and it has a corresponding number of
      bolt receiving openings formed therein, the two plates being
      secured together by a plurality of nuts 21 and bolts 22, the
      latter of which extend through the bolt receiving openings of the
      two plates. The upper plate 20 has a pair of upstanding arcuate
      flanges 23 and 24 formed thereon which have a plurality of bolt
      receiving openings 25 provid d therein. These latter openings
      receive bolts 26 which extend through and are secured to a pair of
      downwardly extending flanges 27 and 28 formed on the under portion
      of the casing of the submersible motor 16. It will be appreciated
      that by changing the position of the flanges 27 and 28 with
      respect to the arcuate flanges 23 and 24, and by the utilization
      of different bolt holes 25, the angular disposition of the axis of
      the motor shaft :15 may be selectively varied with respect to the
      horizontal. Similarly, by removing the bolts 22 and nuts 21, the
      plate 20 may be rotated with respect to the plate 19, where upon
      the bolts 22 may be reinstalled, thereby providing selective
      adjustment of the angularity between the motor shaft 15 and the
      line of waves approaching the open mouth of the harbor between the
      ends of the breakwater structures 10 and 11. It will thus be
      understood that in the present embodiment of the invention each
      and every one of the motor driven propellers 14 may be selectively
      adjusted so that the direction of the submerged stream of water
      produced thereby when the propeller is rotated may be varied. In
      the particular adjusted positions illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3
      the angular disposition of the motor shafts with respect to the
      horizontal is substantially uniform but, as seen in FIG. 1, the
      adjustment of the angularity of the motor shafts with respect to
      the plane of the forward walls 12 and 13 of the breakwaters 10 and
      11 in the bank A diiTers from the corresponding adjustment in the
      banks B and C in that the axes of the pairs of propellers 14 at
      opposite ends of the bank are disposed in diverging directions
      :with respect to each other so that the submerged streams of water
      produced by these propellers will provide a spreading or fan-like
      pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The bases 17 for the motors and propellers in the banks A, B and C
      are shown in FIG. 2 to be of progressively increasing height so
      that the propellers and motors in the forward bank A are lower
      than those in the succeeding bank B, while the elevation of the
      motors and propellers in the bank C is higher than the
      corresponding elevation of the motors and propellers in bank B.
      Another preferred arrangement of the motors and propellers,
      however, is illustrated in FIG. 3 wherein the bases 17 of the
      motors and propellers in all three banks are of the same height,
      but the diameter of the propellers 14 in the bank A are larger
      than those in bank B and the propellers of bank B, similarly, are
      larger than those in the bank C.<br>
      <br>
      As schematically illustrated in FIG. 1, electric power lines 30
      extend from a suitable power source, not shown, to a reverse and
      speed control apparatus of any suitable construction mounted upon
      the upper surface of the breakwater 10. This reverse and speed
      control apparatus has been designated in FIG. 1 by the numeral 31,
      and inasmuch as its construction and arrangement may be of any
      well known kind, it has been here shown only in block form, its
      purpose being to provide individual speed control for each of the
      motors 16 in the several banks of motors and to provide selective
      reversing for any one of the motors. From the reverse and speed
      control mechanism 31 individual electric cable assemblies extend
      beneath the water to the individual motors 16 in each of the banks
      A, B and C. The submerged cable assemblies are shown schematically
      and those extending to the motors in bank A have been collectively
      designated by the numeral 32, those extending to the motors of
      bank B have been collectively designated by the numeral 33 and
      those extending to the motors of bank C have been collectively
      designated by the numeral 34. The reverse and speed control
      facility provided by the control assembly 31 is desirable in order
      that the speed and direction of the pro pellers 14 in the banks A,
      B and C may be selectively varied in order to meet various wave
      conditions that may be encountered. These variations may include
      such things as differences in the sizes of the waves approaching
      the open harbor mouth between the ends of the breakwater
      structures it} and 11 as well as dilferences in the direction from
      which the waves approach.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of illustration, three waves, designated by the
      numerals 35, 36 and 37, have been illustrated schematically in
      FIGS. 2 and 3, these waves being intended to be representative of
      waves that may approach and enter the open harbor mouth between
      the ends of the breakwater structures and 11. The submerged
      streams of water produced by the several motors and propellers in
      bank A are represented by the collection of arrows designated by
      the numeral 38 and the corresponding submerged streams of water
      produced by the several motors and propellers in banks B and C are
      respectively represented by the collection of arrows designated by
      the numerals 39 and 40. As will be observed in FIG. 2, the base or
      under- Water portion of a full size :wave 37 approaching the
      harbor mouth moves into position in which streams of water 38 are
      directed thereagainst. The orbital motions of representative water
      particles in the wave 37 are illustrated by the broken lines 37a,
      37b and 370 therein. As the wave 37 moves in the direction of the
      heavy arrow 41 shown in FIG. 2, the base or under-water portion of
      that wave comes into the path of the submerged water streams 38,
      and the force of the water streams 38 thereupon cause deflection
      of the normal orbital patterns of the water particles in the lower
      portion of the wave body. This deflection and displacement of the
      normal orbital patterns of the water particles causes many of the
      water particles to change course in the general direction of the
      brokenline arrow 37d, with the result that these latter particles
      collide with other particles and a state of turbulence is created
      in the lower portion of the body of the wave 37. This turbulence
      and the collision of the water particles one against another tends
      to build up, with the result that a substantial portion of the
      energy in the lower portion of the wave 37 is dissipated. This
      dissipation of a portion of the wave energy of the wave 37 causes
      the wave to subside partially so that it will then resemble in
      size the next preceding wave which is designated in FIG. 2 by the
      numeral 36. As the wave 37 continues to move it will reach the
      same position shown to be occupied in FIG. 2 by the wave 36 and
      :will then be subjected to the streams of water 39 produced by the
      propellers 14 of the bank of propellers B. This same effect upon
      the wave 37 is shown in FIG. 2 as being applied to wave 36 where
      representative orbital motions of water particles are designated
      by the numerals 36a, 36b and 360. The streams of water 39, which,
      like the streams 33, are directed diagonally upwardly, serve to
      displace or interfere with the orbital motions of the water
      particles in the wave 36, with the result that the same turbulence
      previously described is created in the base or lower portion of
      the wave 36 so that a further portion of the energy of the wave 36
      will be dissipated, it being understood of course that the wave 36
      has previously been subjected to the effect of the streams of
      water 38. Thus, the energy and size of the Wave 36 is reduced by
      the dissipation of energy and the turbulence created in its lower
      portion as that wave passes through the area of the submerged
      water streams 39 and moves on toward the position shown to be
      occupied by the wave 35 in FIG. 2. At the position occupied by the
      wave 35, the waves are further subjected to the force of the
      streams of water 40 produced by the propellers 14 of the bank of
      propellers C. Again, the force of the submerged streams of water
      displace and interfere with the orbital motions of the water
      particles in the lower portion of the :wave body, again resulting
      in turbulence which further dissipates the wave energy and results
      in further reduction of the wave size.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing description it will be understood that each
      wave, as it approaches and enters the open harbor mouth, will be
      subjected successively to the streams of water 38, 39 and 40 that
      are produced respectively by the banks of propellers A, B and C,
      with the result that each wave is progressively reduced in size
      and its wave energy is progressively dissipated by the random
      turbulence created in its lower portion by the streams of water
      38, 39 and 40. The result is that the waves are caused to subside
      and be either substantially completely eliminated or reduced in
      size to a level at which they will be unobjectionable and will
      create no damage within the herbor area. Additional banks of
      propellers and motors may of course be employed as conditions may
      require.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the wave subsiding action described above, the
      pairs of motors and propellers at the opposite ends of the bank A,
      particularly as seen in FIG. 1, serve the further function of
      tending to divert the approaching waves from the entrance to the
      harbor mouth. This is accomplished as a result of the fact that
      the end pairs of motors and propellers in the bank A have their
      axes disposed in diverging directions so that the sugmerged
      streams of water thereby create the fan-shaped pattern referred to
      above which tends to divert the oncoming waves from the mouth of
      the harbor entrance, thus tending to change the direction of the
      oncoming waves and cause them to strike the outer surfaces 12 and
      13 of the breakwater structures 10 and 11.<br>
      <br>
      The action of the banks of propellers and motors A, B and C in the
      form of the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 is substantially identical
      to that described above, the only difference being that the
      propellers and motors are all mounted at substantially the same
      depth and, as a result of the differences in sizes of the
      propellers in the several banks, the streams of water produced by
      the propellers of bank A are larger than those produced by the
      propellers of bank B, and the streams produced by the bank B are
      larger than those produced by the bank C. The motors 16 of the
      bank A may of course also be of greater capacity than those of
      bank B, and those of bank B may also be of greater capacity than
      those of bank C. This variation in the structure as shown in FIG.
      3 will be desirable in certain installations for the sake of
      economy, Furthermore, inasmuch as a greater amount of energy is
      embodied in the waves first treated by the streams of water
      produced by the propellers of bank A, it is desirable that these
      streams be of greater force and volume than the succeeding streams
      produced by the propellers of banks B and C.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that with both of the installations
      illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 all of the apparatus which resides in
      the water is disposed well beneath the surface thereof and below
      the paths of the submerged portions of the waves. As a result,
      none of the apparatus is subjected to a wave damage. Furthermore,
      all of the submerged apparatus is disposed sufficiently below the
      surface as to avoid any interference with ships and other surface
      crafts that may pass through the harbor opening. In addition,
      inasmuch as the streams of water produced by the propellers of
      banks A, B and C may desirably be directed diagonally upwardly as
      illustrated, dense and warm water will be constantly projected
      upwardly toward the surface. This circulation of water,<br>
      <br>
      together with the turbulence produced in the manner described
      above, will tend to keep the harbor mouth free of ice in winter
      weather.<br>
      <br>
      Another variation in the apparatus of the present invention is
      illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 wherein submerged water jet nozzles
      are substituted for the driven propellers described above. The
      nozzles 45, like the propellers 14, are arranged in banks which
      are designated by the letters A, B, and C, each bank being
      comprised of a plurality of nozzles to which water is supplied
      under pressure by a suitable conduit, the conduits for the banks
      A, B and C being respectively designated by the numerals 46, 47
      and '48. The conduits 46, 47 and 48 are joined by suitable
      intermediate conduits 49 and 50, the latter of which is connected
      to a supply conduit or pipe 51 which leads to a large volume water
      pump 52 driven, for example, by an electric motor 53. The pump, if
      desired, may be suitably mounted atop the breakwater structure 10,
      and the pump isprovided with an intake conduit 54 which extends
      downwardly from the pump into the water on the harbor-side of the
      breakwater structure).<br>
      <br>
      The supply conduits 46, 47 and 48 for the banks of nozzles A, B
      and C may be suitably mounted upon upstanding pillars orsupports
      55, 56 and 57 which rest upon the bottom 18 of the harbor
      entrance. Again, any suitable structure may be employed for
      supporting the supply conduits 46, 47 and 48, including structural
      steel elements and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Each Water. jet nozzle 45 is carried and supported by its supply
      conduit 46, 47 or 48 and is provided with a universal joint 58
      therein so that the discharge direction of the nozzles may be
      selectively varied. As in'the case of the motor driven propellers
      in FIG, 1, the discharge directions of the nozzles 45 of the banks
      A, B and C are substantially parallel with the discharge being
      directed diagonally upwardly toward the base portions of oncoming
      waves. The pairs of nozzles adjacent the ends of the bank A,
      however, are arranged in-diverging directions similar to the
      corresponding propellers of the bank A in FIG. 1 and for the same
      purpose of tending to divert oncoming waves from the harbor
      entrance.<br>
      <br>
      As best seen in FIG. 7, the bank B of nozzles is disposed at a
      higher elevation than those of bank A, and the bank of nozzles C
      is disposed at a higher elevation than those of the bank B. The
      several-nozzles of the banks A, B and C discharge diagonally
      upwardly directed streams of water in the same fashion and for the
      same purpose as the propellers previously described, it being
      understood of course that water is supplied to each of the nozzles
      by the operation of the pump 52. The streams of water produced by
      the nozzles 45 of the bank of nozzles A are designated by the
      numeral 59 in FIG. 7, while the streams of water produced by the
      nozzles of the banks B and C are respectively designated by the
      numerals 60 and 61. As in the case of the action of the streams
      previously described, the streams of water 59 are directed against
      the lower portions of oncoming waves with the result that the
      orbital motions of the water particles in the lower portions of
      the waves, represented by the broken circular arrows in FIG. 7,
      are displaced and disturbed, thereby creating turbulence in the
      lower portions of the wave which causes dissipation of a portion
      of the wave energy. This results in a partial reduction in the
      wave size. The same waves are thereafter subjected to the sub-
      'merged streams of water 60 produced by the jet nozzles 8 tion of
      the wave energy causes the wave to subside to the extent that the
      waves are eliminated or reduced in size and force sufiiciently to
      render them unobjectionable in the harbor area.<br>
      <br>
      With the form of the apparatus shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, it will be
      appreciated and understood that substan tially all of the
      submergedparts are disposed well below the path of the body
      portions of the oncoming waves with the result that the apparatus
      is not subjected to wave damage nor will the apparatus in any way
      interfere with shipping that may pass through the harbor opening.
      Furthermore, as previously pointed out, the upwardly directed
      discharge of water will tend to maintain the harbor mouth free of
      ice during winter months.<br>
      <br>
      It has previously been pointed out that the submerged motors 16
      adjacent to the opposite ends of the outermost bank A of motors in
      FIG. 1 and the submerged nozzles 45 adjacent to the opposite ends
      of the outermost bank A of nozzles in FIG. 6 are arranged so that
      the submerged streams of water .produced thereby are directed
      diagonally upwardly and outwardly in a fan-like pattern so as to
      tend to divert the oncoming waves from the area between the two
      breakwater structures 10 and 11. In this connection, the
      particular adjusted positions of the Wave diverting motors l6 and
      nozzles 45 shown respectively in FIGS. 1 and 6 is such as to
      produce submerged streams of water that are directed against the
      submerged bodies of the waves at an angle with respect to the
      direction of movement of the waves, the direction of oncoming
      waves being indicated by the arrows 62 in FIGS. 1 and 6. The
      submerged streams of wave reflecting water are thus discharged in
      directions having directional components that are normal to the
      direction of movement of the oncoming waves so that a substantial
      portion of the wave energy is diverted from its original direction
      and from the harbor mouth or the like represented by the space
      between the two breakwater structures. The diverted waves thus may
      break harmlessly against the forward walls 12 and 13 of the
      breakwater structures.<br>
      <br>
      A further modification of this wave diverting apparatus is
      illustrated in FIG. 8, wherein the principal functional elements
      of the apparatus are submerged outward ly or seawardly of the
      opening or space between two ordinary breakwater structures 63 and
      64 having forward or seaward walls respectively designated by the
      numerals 65 and 66. The apparatus comprises submerged water
      conduits 67, 68, 69 and 70 disposed in pairs in V-shaped
      configurations, the conduits 67 and 68 forming the legs of one
      V-shaped arrangement and the somewhat shorter conduits 69 and 70
      forming the legs of a smaller V- shaped arrangement within the
      first. The outer ends of the conduits are closed by caps 71 or the
      like, and each of the conduits is preferably mounted above the bed
      72 of the body of water upon the upper ends of a plurality of
      upwardly extending foundation elements 73 that rest upon the bed.
      The foundation elements may be of any suitable construction and,
      if desired, may be fabricated of structural steel as shown in FIG.
      9, the foundation elements supporting the inner conduits 69 and 70
      preferably being somewhat higher than those which support the
      outer conduits 67 and 68 so that the two inner conduits 69 and 70
      are raised with respect to the outer conduits. Each of the
      conduits 67, 68, 69 and 70 is provided with a plurality of water
      discharge nozzles 74, with each nozzle joined to its conduit
      through a universal joint 75 that permits adjustment of each
      nozzle and adjustment of the direction of the submerged stream of
      water discharged therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      Water is supplied under pressure to each of the con duits 67,68,
      69 and '70 by any suitable means. The apparatus for this purpose
      shown in FIG. 8 comprises a pump 76 which may rest on top of the
      breakwater structure 63 and which may bedriven by any suitable
      motor 77. Water is supplied to the pump through an intake conduit
      78 that communicates with the body of water on the harbor side of
      the breakwater structure 63. The high pressure discharge from the
      pump 76 is led to the respective conduits 67, 68, 69 and 70
      through intermediate conduits 79, 80, 81 and 82, each of which is
      provided with its own control valve V and each of which is
      preferably joined to its nozzle bearing conduit 67, 68, 69 or 70
      through a length of flexible conduit 83. The valves V provide
      means by which the velocity and discharge rate may be adjusted for
      the nozzles on the several nozzle bearing conduits 67, 68, 69 and
      7t and the flexible conduit lengths 83 permit the group of
      conduits 67, 68, 69 and 70 and their support foundations 73 to be
      moved physically to a certain extent so that the apex of the
      V-shaped configuration formed by the conduits may be moved in
      either direction, as indicated by the arrows 84. By virtue of this
      movement, the apex of the V- shaped configuration may preferably
      be adjusted so that it points toward the prevailing direction of
      oncoming waves.<br>
      <br>
      With the apparatus of FIG. 8 disposed in the position shown
      therein, it will be appreciated that each of the numerous
      submerged nozzles 74 will provide a diagonally upwardly directed
      stream of water, as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 9. The nozzles
      are preferably adjusted to the positions thereof illustrated in
      FIG. 8, with the result that the streams of water will be
      discharged obliquely upwardly from the nozzles and against the
      underwater portions of waves that approach in the direction of the
      arrow 85. Inasmuch as the discharge of each nozzle is directed at
      an angle with respect to the direction of movement of the waves,
      and inasmuch as the discharge from each nozzle has a directional
      component normal to the wave direction, the oncoming waves are
      progressively diverted from their original direction by the
      submerged streams of water to which they are successively
      subjected and are caused to crash harmlessly against the faces 65
      and 66 of the breakwater structures, thereby preventing entry of
      the waves between the breakwater structures and leaving a
      relatively calm area within the V-shaped configuration and within
      the area between the breakwater ends.<br>
      <br>
      As with the embodiments of the invention shown in FIGS. 1 to 7,
      the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 offers no obstruction
      to shipping, and is not readily subject to damage. Furthermore,
      like the embodiments first mentioned, the discharge from the
      plurality of nozzles 74 will tend to keep the adjacent area free
      of ice during winter months.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable adjustments may of course be made when necessary in the
      embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 in order
      efficiently to handle and adequately divert waves of different
      sizes and those which approach from directions other than that
      represented by the arrow 85. The operation and adjustment of the
      valves V provides suitable compensation for most normal variations
      in condition inasmuch as the valves V individually control the
      rates of discharge from the banks of nozzles on the conduits 67,
      68, 69 and 70. Furthermore, the direction of discharge of the
      individual nozzles may be separately adjusted by virtue of the
      universal joint 75 on each and, as indicated above, the flexible
      conduit sections 83 permit the entire assembly of the conduits 67,
      68, 69 and 70 to be shifted bodily so as to shift the position of
      the apex of the V-shaped arrangement of the conduits.<br>
      <br>
      While the arrangement of the conduits 67, 68, 69 and 70, with
      their submerged water discharge nozzles 74, have been illustrated
      in FIG. 8 and have been described in conjunction with their use
      for diverting waves from the space between adjacent ends of
      ordinary breakwater structures, it will be appreciated that the
      structure and method employed therein may be used for producing
      calm water areas at other desired locations. If, for example, it
      is desired to protect a given beach area, the conduits 67, 68, 69
      and 7 would be disposed oif the beach in an arrangement similar to
      that shown in FIG. 8 but with the pump 76 and the motor 77
      disposed on the beach itself or on a barge or the like. The number
      and length of the conduits and the number of discharge nozzles
      employed may of course be varied in any event to satisfy the
      conditions expected to be encountered,<br>
      <br>
      Still another embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 10 of
      the drawings, wherein the same principle as well as apparatus
      somewhat similar to that previously described are employed for the
      protection of a beach area in order to produce results similar to
      those provided by an ordinary permanent and massive jetty or
      groin. Such permanent jetties or groins comprise breakwater-like
      structures that are built outwardly from a beach, often at great
      expense, in order to protect the beach from the eroding effect of
      waves that diagonally approach the beach. In FIG. 10 the numeral
      designates such a beach and the arrow 91 indicates the direction
      of movement of waves diagonally approaching the same. Instead of
      providing an expensive jetty or groin, however, a submerged
      conduit 92, similar to the previously described conduits 67, 68,
      69 and 70, extends outwardly from the beach and, if desired, is
      supported on a plurality of foundation supports 73 like those
      described earlier herein. Like each of the conduits 67, 68, 69 and
      70, the conduit 92 is capped at its outer end and is provided
      along its length with a plurality of discharge nozzles 74 that are
      joined to the conduit by universal joints 75. Water under pressure
      is supplied to the conduit 92 by a pump 93 disposed on the beach
      and driven by any suitable motor 94, an intake conduit extending
      from the pump outwardly into the body of water. The pressure
      discharge from the pump 93 is fed through the submerged conduit 92
      and is discharged from the nozzles 74 thereof preferably
      diagonally upwardly, as illustrated in FIG. 9, and against the
      underwater portions of the approaching waves at an angle with
      respect to the direction of the wave approach. This dis charge of
      submerged streams of water against the under portions of the waves
      in a direction having a component normal to the Wave movement is
      represented by the direction of the nozzles in FIG. 10 and causes
      the waves to be progressively diverted from the direction of the
      arrow 91 to a direction that is substantially normal to the line
      of the beach, thereby producing a substantially cahn area in the
      water area designated by the numeral 95 and causing sand to be
      accumulated along the beach portion designated by the numeral 96.
      This progressive diversion of the waves from their original
      direction to a direction substantially normal ot the beach is
      accomplished entirely by the submerged streams of water discharged
      by the nozzles 74 of the conduit 92. The direction of the
      discharge from the nozzles may of course be adjusted from time to
      time by the use of the universal joints 75 so as to accommodate
      certain changes in conditions that may be encountered, and a
      variable speed motor 94 or a variable capacity pump 93 may be
      employed so as to vary the rate of discharge from the nozzles 74.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the structure illustrated in FIG. 10
      accomplishes the same result as an ordinary jetty or groin, but by
      an entirely different method and at far less initial cost. Because
      of the simplicity of the apparatus, it may be moved relatively
      easily from place to place where needed, and because the conduit
      and the nozzles are submerged well below the water surface they
      offer little or no obstruction to shipping or beach activities and
      they are not readily subject to damage. <br>
