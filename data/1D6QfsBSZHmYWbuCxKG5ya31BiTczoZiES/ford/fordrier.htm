      <p><b><i>The ambient air dryer circulates twenty times more air to
            dry clothes without using heat to save energy costs.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Las Vegas, NV</i> (PRnine - September 22, 2008) - An energy
        saving ambient air clothes dryer is one step closer to becoming
        a fixture consumers’ homes.&nbsp; Recently out of prototype
        testing, the ambient air dryer utilizes less energy than
        conventional natural gas and 220V electrical element clothes
        driers because it employs 110V and 12V power sources, and can be
        modified to run on solar power as well.&nbsp; Additionally, the
        ambient air dryer, which works by circulating 20 times more air,
        does not heat damage clothes or present fire hazard because it
        does not create a flame to heat air to dry clothes. </p>
      <p>“I am extremely excited about this product,” states Larry Ford,
        inventor of the ambient air dryer, “Everyone I’ve spoken with
        about this product thinks it’s a great idea and would love to
        have one in their homes.&nbsp; ” </p>
      <p>Instead of using heated air to dry clothes, the ambient air
        dryer utilizes a patented design to continually circulate twenty
        times more air through an 18 inch intake and exhaust system.
        Because of the amount of air the ambient air dryer circulates,
        it is able to dry clothes in the same amount of time as a
        conventional dryer, but without the fire hazard and heat
        damaging the clothes. </p>
      <p>The ambient air dryer can be easily moved inside or outside
        thanks to set of wheels, and is ideal for all types of
        households looking to save money on energy bills.&nbsp; Repair
        costs for the ambient air dryer are lower as it does not utilize
        as many specialized components as conventional dryers.&nbsp; For
        households wishing to go extra green, the ambient air dryer can
        be easily modified to run on solar power. </p>
      <p>Ford is currently looking for manufacturers to mass produce the
        ambient air dryer. </p>
      <p>“That is the last step in this process before the ambient
        clothes dryer can be delivered to consumers,” he states. </p>
      <p>More information about the ambient air dryer can be found by
        contacting Ford Invention Co. by phone at (702) 459-7747 or

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The ambient air clothes dryer is an
        automated device providing axial flow of unheated ambient air
        through the dryer drum. The dryer may include different drum
        drive systems, timer and/or humidity detector controls, and a
        configuration utilizing a separate, portable fan for temporary,
        removable installation with the dryer housing to provide airflow
        through the drum. The ambient air dryer greatly reduces energy
        requirements for drying laundry when compared to conventional
        heated air dryers, and is quite effective in warm and/or dry
        climates. The ambient air dryer is portable and may be used
        indoors or outdoors. The device may be configured to use
        twelve-volt power from a motor vehicle for use in camping. When
        used indoors, the device may be placed with a heat source (heat
        register, etc.) to draw warm air through the drum while
        humidifying the air as it passes through damp laundry in the
        drum. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to automated devices for drying
        clothing and laundry. More specifically, the ambient air clothes
        dryer is a clothes dryer devoid of any dedicated heating
        elements or systems for heating the air. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>The development of the automatic clothes dryer has been a great
        labor saving device for most households and, along with the
        automatic washing machine, has served to facilitate the
        commercial laundry industry as well. Automatic clothes dryers
        were initially developed when energy costs were relatively low,
        and accordingly make use of gas or electrical heat to accelerate
        the drying process. As a byproduct of the heat developed, the
        home or other structure is also heated, even though most of the
        heat is ducted to the exterior of the structure during dryer
        operation. Still, the residual heat output into the structure
        was not considered to be particularly undesirable, even in
        warmer conditions, as the energy costs required to operate air
        conditioning systems were much lower in the past. </p>
      <p>However, with ever-increasing energy costs, the cost of
        operation of such conventional dryers has climbed considerably
        over the years, and even more so when the energy required to
        dissipate their heat output is considered. While conventional
        hot air clothes dryers have their place in very damp and/or cool
        climates, the heat they develop is an undesirable side effect of
        the drying operation in many parts of the country during much of
        the year. The alternative of the conventional clothes line is
        not suitable for many households due to the frequency of damp
        weather in many areas and seasons, and the time and labor
        required to tediously pin up each garment or article to the line
        and remove them, perhaps several hours later, when they are dry.
      </p>
      <p>While some clothes dryers have been developed in the past that
        do not provide a source of heat during the drying operation,
        such dryers have not been found entirely satisfactory. Thus, an
        ambient air clothes dryer solving the aforementioned problems is
        desired. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The ambient air clothes dryer is an automated device including
        a motor-powered rotating drum having a fan providing axial
        airflow through the drum. No dedicated heating element is
        provided. Some embodiments include a fan motor and an additional
        motor to rotate the drum, while other embodiments utilize a belt
        or other drive from the fan output shaft to drive a jackshaft to
        rotate the drum, thereby saving weight, complexity, and energy.
        Yet another embodiment may be devoid of any fan or air
        circulation device, and may include only a motor to rotate the
        drum. This embodiment includes means for the removable and
        temporary installation of a conventional "box fan" therewith, to
        provide the air circulation required. Any or all of the
        embodiments may include a timer and/or humidity detector to
        provide for automatic shutoff of the fan and drum when the
        laundry is dry and/or a predetermined time has been reached. </p>
      <p>The portability of the device allows it to be used indoors or
        outdoors, as desired. The device may take advantage of ambient
        heating sources within the home or other structure if so
        desired, e.g., a heat register, radiator, Franklin stove, etc.,
        to provide some heating of the air, which then passes through
        the dryer drum. This also provides the beneficial effect of
        humidifying the air within the structure in colder weather. The
        device may be constructed to utilize twelve-volt power, if so
        desired, for use in camping when an automotive electrical system
        is available. </p>
      <p>These and other features of the present invention will become
        readily apparent upon further review of the following
        specification and drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention comprises various embodiments of an
        ambient air clothes or laundry dryer, in which unheated air at
        ambient temperature is blown through the dryer drum to dry
        clothing therein. While some slight amount of heat may be
        provided from the fan motor, the present ambient air dryer
        device does not include any form of dedicated, specific heating
        apparatus, as is found in conventional clothes dryers. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 of the drawings illustrates a first embodiment of the
        present dryer 10, in which a separate fan motor 12 and drum
        rotation motor 14 are employed. The dryer 10 includes a housing
        or shell 16 having a hollow dryer drum 18 therein. The drum 18
        rotates within the housing 16, and is supported by drum support
        wheels 20 or other mechanism installed internally within the
        housing 16. The dryer drum 18 has an impervious, generally
        cylindrical wall 22 having a diameter D. A screened airflow
        inlet end 24 is positioned adjacent the fan motor 12 with its
        fan 26 and fan drive shaft 28, with a screened airflow outlet
        end door 30 located opposite the inlet end 24 of the drum 18.
        The two screened ends 24 and 30 are preferably of a sufficiently
        fine mesh or gauge as to preclude the passage of small articles
        (e.g., loose change, buttons, etc.) therethrough, and have
        diameters closely approaching the diameter D of the dryer drum
        18. The screen of the outlet door 30 may have a mesh or gauge
        sufficiently fine to serve as a lint trap for the dryer. </p>
      <p>The fan drive motor 12 with its fan drive shaft 28 and
        circular, rotary fan 26 are concentrically disposed externally
        to the airflow inlet end 24 of the dryer drum 18, but within the
        housing 16. The fan 26 preferably has a diameter closely
        approaching the diameter D of the dryer drum 18 and the inlet
        and outlet ends 24 and 30 of the drum 18, in order to maximize
        airflow through the drum 18. A fan guard 32 is preferably
        installed across the air inlet opening of the dryer housing 16,
        with at least the blades of the fan 26 being captured between
        the guard 32 and the screened inlet opening 24 of the drum 18. </p>
      <p>The separate drum drive motor 14 of the embodiment 10 of FIG. 1
        drives an output shaft 34, which in turn causes the drum 18 to
        rotate when the drum drive motor 14 is in operation. A common
        switch may be used to simultaneously actuate and deactivate the
        fan motor 12 and drum drive motor 14, if so desired. In the case
        of the embodiment 10 of FIG. 1, the output shaft 34 has a drum
        belt pulley 36 at its distal end, with a drum drive belt 38
        extending around the pulley 36 and around a circumferential
        groove 40 in the dryer drum 18. </p>
      <p>The configuration of the ambient air clothes dryer 10, as well
        as the configurations of other embodiments disclosed herein,
        requires no heavy, stiff high voltage and/or high amperage
        electrical cable, as is universally required for the heating
        elements of conventional electric clothes dryers. Moreover, no
        gas line connection is required, as there is no use of a gas
        heater for the incoming air of the present dryer. Thus, the
        present dryer is relatively lightweight in comparison to
        conventional dryers with their heating systems, and requires no
        more power than is capable of being supplied by a conventional
        household electric cord. (In some embodiments, the motor(s) may
        be 12-volt DC, enabling them to be powered from a motor vehicle
        electrical system if so desired.) The light weight and simple
        power requirements of the present ambient air dryer allow it to
        be moved about readily to various locations as desired.
        Accordingly, external transport wheels 42 may be provided
        beneath one or both ends of the housing 16, with a pair of
        support legs 44 being shown beneath the opposite end of the
        housing 16 in the embodiment of FIG. 1. A handle 46 may be
        provided across one side of the housing shell 16, to facilitate
        lifting of that side for rolling the device 10 as desired by
        means of the wheels 42. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 provides a side elevation view of an alternative drum
        drive system, in which the fan drive is also used to rotate the
        drum. In FIG. 2, the fan motor 112 drives an output shaft 128 to
        which the fan 126 is connected, as in the corresponding
        components 12, 28, and 26 of the embodiment 10 of FIG. 1.
        However, the fan motor output shaft 128 may include a drive belt
        pulley 129 thereon, with a jackshaft drive belt 131 extending
        from the fan motor shaft pulley 129 to a driven pulley 133 on a
        radially offset jackshaft or drum drive shaft 134. The shaft 134
        includes a drum drive belt pulley 136 at its distal end, with a
        drum drive belt 138 extending around the pulley 136 and riding
        in a circumferential groove 140 around the dryer drum 118. It
        will be seen that the dryer drum 118 and drum drive belt 138 may
        be identical to the corresponding components 18 and 38
        illustrated in FIG. 1 and described further above. The
        distinction between the configuration of FIG. 1 and that of FIG.
        2 is the use of a shaft and belt system driven from the
        concentric fan motor to rotate the dryer drum in the embodiment
        of FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 provides a side elevation view of an embodiment similar
        to that of FIG. 2, differing in the means used to impart rotary
        motion directly to the drum. In FIG. 3, the fan motor 212 drives
        an output or fan drive shaft 228 and fan 226, with the shaft 228
        having a drive belt pulley 229 thereon, just as in the case of
        the equivalent components 112, 128, 126, and 129 of the
        embodiment of FIG. 2. The pulley 229, in turn, drives a
        jackshaft or drum drive shaft 234 by means of a jackshaft driven
        pulley 233 on one end of the shaft 234, just as in the
        embodiment of FIG. 2. However, rather than driving the drum 218
        by means of a belt extending around the drum, as shown in FIGS.
        1 and 2, the jackshaft or drum drive shaft 234 has a friction
        wheel 236 (rubber-coated, etc.) at its distal end which bears
        against a circumferential friction band 238 surrounding the
        dryer drum 218. Rotation of the friction wheel 236 imparts
        rotational motion to the dryer drum 218 by means of the friction
        between the wheel 236 and friction band 238 around the drum. It
        will be seen that such a drum drive system may also be
        incorporated in the embodiment of FIG. 1, with the drum drive
        shaft 34 having a friction wheel 236 at the distal end thereof
        in lieu of the pulley 36 shown, and the dryer 10 incorporating
        the drum 218 of FIG. 3 with its friction band 238. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 provides an illustration of an additional embodiment of
        the present ambient air dryer, in which a portable fan is used
        to supply the air through the dryer drum. The dryer 310 of FIG.
        4 includes a housing 316 which contains the drum 18 and drum
        drive mechanism comprising motor 14, drum drive shaft 34, shaft
        output pulley 36, and drum drive belt 38, just as in the
        embodiment illustrated fully in FIG. 1. However, rather than
        incorporating a fan integrally therewith, as in the embodiments
        of FIGS. 1 through 3, the housing 316 of the dryer 310 includes
        a fan receptacle 317 in the rear wall thereof, i.e., adjacent
        the screened air inlet end 24 of the drum. The fan receptacle
        317 is configured to fit a conventional portable fan F, commonly
        known as a "box fan," therein. The fan receptacle 317 may be
        configured to accept other types of fans, as desired. A suitable
        electrical outlet 319 may be provided on the housing 316,
        allowing the fan F to be plugged in for operation. Power to the
        outlet 319 may be provided through appropriate control circuitry
        on or in the dryer housing or cabinet 316, as desired, to
        provide control of the fan F from the ambient air dryer
        controls. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 provides a basic electrical schematic diagram of
        circuitry that may be incorporated with the present ambient air
        clothes dryer in its various embodiments. In FIG. 5, a
        conventional electrical power source 410, e.g., 115-volt ac
        power from the power grid, or perhaps 12-volt dc power from an
        automotive or other electrical source when the ambient air dryer
        is manufactured to accept such power, provides electrical power
        to the dryer through a master switch 412. The master switch
        provides power to the fan motor, e.g., motor 12 of FIG. 1, and
        the drum drive motor, e.g., motor 14 of FIG. 1, through a
        solenoid or other appropriate switch 414. The switch 414 may
        incorporate the electrical outlet 319 for incorporation in the
        portable fan embodiment of FIG. 3, if so desired. </p>
      <p>The solenoid switch 414 is not required in the simplest
        embodiments of the present ambient air dryer. However, the dryer
        in any of its embodiments may include a timer and/or humidity
        sensor 416, if so desired. These components are conventional in
        clothes and laundry dryers, and need not be described in detail
        herein. The timer may be incorporated in combination with a
        rotary on/off switch to serve the function of the master switch
        412, if so desired. In any event, the timer and/or humidity
        sensor 416 is normally closed when electrical power is applied
        for operation of the dryer, with the electrical contacts opening
        when a predetermined time is reached (for the timer) or when the
        air flow from the dryer reaches a predetermined low level of
        humidity (for the humidity sensor). If either of these
        conditions occurs, power to the solenoid switch 414 is
        interrupted, thereby interrupting power to the fan and drum
        drive motors 12 and 14 and shutting off the dryer. The opening
        of the solenoid switch 414 may also trigger the operation of a
        buzzer, bell, or other audible or visual signaling means to
        alert the user of the dryer that the drying operation is
        complete, much as in the case of conventional clothes dryers.
        Where the circuit of FIG. 5 is incorporated with the portable
        fan embodiment of FIG. 4, the switch 414 may control power to
        the outlet 319 to shut off power to the outlet 319, thereby
        shutting off the fan F plugged into the outlet 319. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present ambient air laundry and clothes
        dryer in its various embodiments provides a significant advance
        in efficiency for such machines, particularly in relatively warm
        and/or dry environments where the device may take advantage of
        the ambient air conditions. </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the present invention is not
        limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any
        and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims. </p>
