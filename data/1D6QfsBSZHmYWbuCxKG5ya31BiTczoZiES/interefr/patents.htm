        <p>The concept of solar cooling is appealing because the cooling
          load is in phase with the intensity of solar energy. Many
          system arrangements or cycles are employed to achieve solar
          cooling, such as Absorption, desiccant or Rankine-vapour
          compression systems. The technical feasibility of driving an
          absorption-cooling unit by a low-temperature heat source (such
          as solar energy using a simple flat-plate collector) for
          air-conditioning applications is investigated in this work. </p>
        <p>This study aims to design and construct a prototype for an
          intermittent absorption refrigeration system and to examine
          its implementation. The operating characteristics of the
          considered unit are extensively investigated. In order to
          accomplish this strategy, the prototype was integrated in a
          test rig designed for this purpose and equipped with the
          necessary measuring instruments to determine the required
          operating criteria of the unit. The energy added or extracted
          to or from the different unit components is calculated and the
          system performance is analysed. </p>
        <p>The C.O.P of the unit is found to be 19% which is 2% lower
          than the designed value, which could be regarded as an
          encouraging result for more studies in this field. Copyright ©

            taking account of the real operation of an adsorptive solar
            refrigerator using activated carbon-methanol pairs, as a
            function of the climatic conditions: ambient temperature and

            the refrigerator in two Moroccan climates: Rabat, temperate
            and humid, and Marrakech, dry and hot. The numerical
            simulation shows that the behaviour of the refrigerator is
            different from one climate to the other. In Rabat, which has
            a Mediterranean climate, the cold room temperature can be
            maintained at a value practically always less than 5°C;
            whereas in Marrakech, which has a pre-Saharan climate, an
            overheating problem can arise in the summer season and
            temperatures in the cold room can reach 17°C. Results also
            show that in both climates we are confronted with the
            problem of freezing because the cold room temperatures can
            be less than 0°C and reach -15°C in the winter.</font> </p>

        <p><font color="#000000">A study of the effects of various
            collector design parameters on the performance of a solar
            powered solid absorption refrigerator is presented. The
            refrigerator uses specially treated CaCl<sub>2</sub> as
            absorbent and NH<sub>3</sub> as refrigerant and operates
            intermittently in a diurnal cycle. The study is undertaken
            using version 4.0 of a simulation programme, COSSOR,
            developed from a transient analysis of the system. A large
            number of simulations was undertaken to test the performance
            of the refrigerator for various choices of the collector
            design parameters. The latter include the plate emissivity
            and material; absorbent pellet diameter, thermal
            conductivity and packing density; collector tube size,
            spacing and material; and number of glazing. The
            refrigerator performance indicators, namely total condensate
            yield, mass of ice produced, coefficient of performance and
            effective cooling, are presented for the range of values of
            the collector parameters of interest. Using a multiple
            linear regression technique, the performance indicators are
            correlated with the collector parameters by simple linear
            polynomial expressions. An objective function, suitable for
            selecting optimal values of the parameters, is defined,
            subject to specified constraints. Optimization was then
            carried out for the objective function. For the collector
            with steel tubes and steel plate, the refrigerator
            coefficient of performance obtained with optimal choices of
            tube size, spacing and plate emissivity is 0.073,
            representing an improvement of at least 30% with respect to
            the reference collector. A similar level of improvement was
            obtained for a collector with aluminium tubes and plate.</font>

        <p>An advanced active carbon fiber(salts) /NH<sub>3</sub> heat
          pumps and refrigerators with dual sources of energy
          (solar/gas, solar/electricity) are considered for providing
          space heating, cooling and sanitary hot water for buildings.
          The high temperature sources of the energy are solar and
          gas/electricity. The low temperature sources of energy are -
          the ground water, soil, and air. The new refrigerators and
          heat pumps generation includes combination of chemicals with
          an active carbon fiber to increase NH<sub>3</sub> sorption
          capacity. The general goal of this paper is to present the
          results of an investigation of a new environmentally friendly
          thermal machines. In these designes a physical adsorption and
          chemical reactions are used simultaneously for a heat and cold
          generation. A <b>solar refrigerator</b> and heat pump is made
          of a solar collector, absorbed natural gas vessel (ANG), and
          compact, portable heating/refrigeration system, which consists
          of two small adsorbers with heat pipe heat recovery system. </p>

          <b>Abstract --- </b>A review of the practically realized
          solid adsorption solar refrigeration cycles is presented. The
          cycles also have potentials for use as heat pumps. They have
          been classified according to the adsorbate utilized as: cycles
          with water as refrigerant, cycles using fluorocarbon as
          refrigerant, cycles using ammonia as refrigerant and cycles
          with alcohols as refrigerant. The performances of these
          refrigeration cycles, drawn from experiences worldwide, are
          also reported. The actual field testing experiences, together
          with the technical and economic constraints that affect
          popularization of the systems are reviewed, and their possible
          solutions are suggested.

        </center>
        <p><b><i>Small Power Systems</i></b> has developed a
          non-electric solar refrigerator-freezer. The refrigerator uses
          an aqua-ammonia absorption system similar to that used in
          propane refrigerators. The refrigerator consists of two
          separate units; the solar collector-generator and the
          refrigerator box. </p>
        <p>The collector-generator consists of a thermal solar collector
          and most of the refrigeration works. It measures about 5' x
          4'x 1' and weighs over 100 lbs. It needs to be mounted in a
          sunny location, the same as any solar collector. </p>
        <p>The refrigerator box is the refrigerator per se and can be
          placed wherever is convenient, presumably the kitchen. </p>
        <p>When the sun shines, the collector-generator produces ammonia
          refrigerant which is stored until night when the actual
          cooling takes place. To keep the refrigerator cold through the
          day and during cloudy weather, there is built-in storage
          sufficient for five days. There are no moving parts. </p>
        <p>In use, our solar refrigerator is little different from any
          other refrigerator. It even has automatic defrost. Currently,
          the drawbacks are slightly higher freezer temperatures and a
          greater temperature variation since there is only one cycle
          per day. </p>
        <p>We are currently building a very limited number of these
          refrigerators for customers who are willing to work with us on
          the design and put up with the idiosyncrasies of our current
          work. We do not currently have a date when we might have
          refrigerators in quantity. The interest in these refrigerators
          has exceeded our expectations and we are wondering on what
          scale to proceed. The cost is also an unknown, but roughly the
          cost of a Sunfrost not counting installation is an estimate. </p>
        <p>The current plan is to build units 30" wide and 48" and 70"
          tall. We are also prototyping a very small unit where the
          refrigerator box is under the solar collector so it is all one
          unit that is left outside. This is meant to be used for
          vaccines and to be as low cost and simple as possible. We do
          not plan to include a freezer except limited ice-making
          capacity, as this simplifies the design. This may be the first
          model to be generally available. </p>
        <p>Since there has been a lot of interest in North America which
          wasn't our original design area, we have been looking
          seriously at auxiliary cooling for prolonged cloudy spells. We
          are trying an external heat pipe for colder locations and
          thermoelectric cooling for warmer locations. These have the
          advantage of being relatively inexpensive and can be offered
          as add-ons instead of requiring extensive redesigning. Even
          though propane is a natural, it seems too difficult to
          implement at present. </p>
        <p>We are also considering two technologies which would add to
          the expense but make a better product. Even though Owens
          Corning has canceled their Aura vacuum panel insulation
          production, others are working on similar products. The
          advantage is better insulation and thinner walls, resulting in
          a smaller cabinet. The disadvantages are higher cost and no
          guarantees that the product will be able to hold its vacuum
          for extended time. Guarantees with most products are under 5
          years at present. </p>
        <p>The other technology we are considering is keeping the cold
          storage outside at the solar collector and using a pump to
          circulate the cold into the refrigerator. This would add
          significantly to the expense and require electricity, but
          would simplify installation and keep ammonia out of the living
          space. </p>
        <p>We feel that safety, particularly in transportation and
          installation is a significant issue that needs to be
          thoroughly looked into before we can offer these refrigerators
          to the general public, and this will take time. </p>
