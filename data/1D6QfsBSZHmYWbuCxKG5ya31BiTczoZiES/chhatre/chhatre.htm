          water available for the world’s poor by refining the tools and

      <br>
      In the arid Namib Desert on the west coast of Africa, one type of
      beetle has found a distinctive way of surviving. When the morning
      fog rolls in, the Stenocara gracilipes species, also known as the
      Namib Beetle, collects water droplets on its bumpy back, then lets
      the moisture roll down into its mouth, allowing it to drink in an
      area devoid of flowing water.<br>
      <br>
      What nature has developed, Shreerang Chhatre wants to refine, to
      help the world’s poor. Chhatre is an engineer and aspiring
      entrepreneur at MIT who works on fog harvesting, the deployment of
      devices that, like the beetle, attract water droplets and corral
      the runoff. This way, poor villagers could collect clean water
      near their homes, instead of spending hours carrying water from
      distant wells or streams. In pursuing the technical and financial
      sides of his project, Chhatre is simultaneously a doctoral
      candidate in chemical engineering at MIT; an MBA student at the
      MIT Sloan School of Management; and a fellow at MIT’s Legatum
      Center for Development and Entrepreneurship.<br>
      <br>
      Access to water is a pressing global issue: the World Health
      Organization and UNICEF estimate that nearly 900 million people
      worldwide live without safe drinking water. The burden of finding
      and transporting that water falls heavily on women and children.
      “As a middle-class person, I think it’s terrible that the poor
      have to spend hours a day walking just to obtain a basic
      necessity,” Chhatre says.<br>
      <br>
      A fog-harvesting device consists of a fence-like mesh panel, which
      attracts droplets, connected to receptacles into which water
      drips. Chhatre has co-authored published papers on the materials
      used in these devices, and believes he has improved their
      efficacy. “The technical component of my research is done,”
      Chhatre says. He is pursuing his work at MIT Sloan and the Legatum
      Center in order to develop a workable business plan for
      implementing fog-harvesting devices.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Beyond beetle juice</b><br>
      <br>
      Interest in fog harvesting dates to the 1990s, and increased when
      new research on Stenocara gracilipes made a splash in 2001. A few
      technologists saw potential in the concept for people. One
      Canadian charitable organization, FogQuest, has tested projects in
      Chile and Guatemala.<br>
      <br>
      Chhatre’s training as a chemical engineer has focused on the
      wettability of materials, their tendency to either absorb or repel
      liquids (think of a duck’s feathers, which repel water). A number
      of MIT faculty have made advances in this area, including Robert
      Cohen of the Department of Chemical Engineering; Gareth McKinley
      of the Department of Mechanical Engineering; and Michael Rubner of
      the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Chhatre, who
      also received his master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT
      in 2009, is co-author, with Cohen and McKinley among other
      researchers, of three published papers on the kinds of fabrics and
      coatings that affect wettability.<br>
      <br>
      One basic principle of a good fog-harvesting device is that it
      must have a combination of surfaces that attract and repel water.
      For instance, the shell of Stenocara gracilipes has bumps that
      attract water and troughs that repel it; this way, drops collects
      on the bumps, then run off through the troughs without being
      absorbed, so that the water reaches the beetle’s mouth.<br>
      <br>
      To build fog-harvesting devices that work on a human scale,
      Chhatre says, “The idea is to use the design principles we
      developed and extend them to this problem.”<br>
      <br>
      To build larger fog harvesters, researchers generally use mesh,
      rather than a solid surface like a beetle’s shell, because a
      completely impermeable object creates wind currents that will drag
      water droplets away from it. In this sense, the beetle’s
      physiology is an inspiration for human fog harvesting, not a
      template. “We tried to replicate what the beetle has, but found
      this kind of open permeable surface is better,” Chhatre says. “The
      beetle only needs to drink a few micro-liters of water. We want to
      capture as large a quantity as possible.”<br>
      <br>
      In some field tests, fog harvesters have captured one liter of
      water (roughly a quart) per one square meter of mesh, per day.
      Chhatre and his colleagues are conducting laboratory tests to
      improve the water collection ability of existing meshes.<br>
      <br>
      FogQuest workers say there is more to fog harvesting than
      technology, however. “You have to get the local community to
      participate from the beginning,” says Melissa Rosato, who served
      as project manager for a FogQuest program that has installed 36
      mesh nets in the mountaintop village of Tojquia, Guatemala, and
      supplies water for 150 people. “They’re the ones who are going to
      be managing and maintaining the equipment.” Because women usually
      collect water for households, Rosato adds, “If women are not
      involved, chances of a long-term sustainable project are slim.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Finding financing for fog harvesting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Whatever Chhatre’s success in the laboratory, he agrees it will
      not be easy to turn fog-harvesting technology into a viable
      enterprise. “My consumer has little monetary power,” he notes. As
      part of his Legatum fellowship and Sloan studies, Chhatre is
      analyzing which groups might use his potential product. Chhatre
      believes the technology could also work on the rural west coast of
      India, north of Mumbai, where he grew up.<br>
      <br>
      Another possibility is that environmentally aware communities,
      schools or businesses in developed countries might try fog
      harvesting to reduce the amount of energy needed to obtain water.
      “As the number of people and businesses in the world increases and
      rainfall stays the same, more people will be looking for
      alternatives,” says Robert Schemenauer, the executive director of
      FogQuest.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the importance of water-supply issues globally is one
      reason Chhatre was selected for his Legatum fellowship. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      “We welcomed Shreerang as a Legatum fellow because it is an
      important problem to solve,” notes Iqbal Z. Quadir, director of
      the Legatum Center. “About one-third of the planet’s water that is
      not saline happens to be in the air. Collecting water from thin
      air solves several problems, including transportation. If people
      do not spend time fetching water, they can be productively
      employed in other things which gives rise to an ability to pay.
      Thus, if this technology is sufficiently advanced and a meaningful
      amount of water can be captured, it could be commercially viable
      some day.”<br>
      <br>
      Quadir also feels that if Chhatre manages to sell a sufficient
      number of collection devices in the developed world, it could
      contribute to a reduction in price, making it more viable in poor
      countries. “The aviation industry in its infancy struggled with
      balloons, but eventually became a viable global industry,” Quadir
      adds. “Shreerang’s project addresses multiple problems at the same
      time and, after all, the water that fills our rivers and lakes
      comes from air.”<br>
      <br>
      That said, fog harvesting remains in its infancy, technologically
      and commercially, as Chhatre readily recognizes. “This is still a
      very open problem,” he says. “It’s a work in progress.”<br>

      early-morning fog.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Some beetles in the Namib Desert collect drinking water from
      fog-laden wind on their backs1. We show here that these large
      droplets form by virtue of the insect's bumpy surface, which
      consists of alternating hydrophobic, wax-coated and hydrophilic,
      non-waxy regions. The design of this fog-collecting structure can
      be reproduced cheaply on a commercial scale and may find
      application in water-trapping tent and building coverings, for
      example, or in water condensers and engines.<br>

      <br>
      NBD Nano is developing a novel state of the art hydrophobic
      coating to address the water energy nexus. By coating condenser
      tubes, similar to those in power plants and thermal desalination
      plants, NBD Nano is able to improve the condensation heat transfer
      up to 200% in pure steam environments.<br>
      <br>
      It is estimated that a 1% system level efficiency improvement in
      power plants can lead to $10,000,000 in additional revenues for a
      single power plant per year and can reduce CO2 emissions
      dramatically. Despite the advancements in improving condensation
      heat transfer, it has been a significant challenge for researchers
      to create long lasting coatings to meet the durability
      requirements in real world applications.<br>
      <br>
      NBD Nano has developed a coating that has demonstrated longer
      durability and performance than existing hydrophobic coatings due
      to stronger adhesion properties. The technology was first invented
      in Dr. Kwang Kim’s lab at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Dr.
      Kim is well regarded as one of the leading researchers in the
      field of dropwise condensation. <br>

      Water is one of Earth’s most precious resources. Unfortunately, we
      are living in a time where access to fresh water has become
      unreliable and disproportionate globally. The urgency for
      implementing innovative approaches to harvest clean water
      sustainably has become even more eminent.<br>
      <br>
      NBD Nano is developing a new generation of fog-nets to help
      provide relief for drought-affected areas both in the US and
      around the world. Fog harvesting has been used for centuries in
      places like South America, proving plenty of clean drinking water
      for remote villages. Unfortunately, the ripe conditions for fog
      harvesting that are present in South America are not prevalent in
      most places of the world. Conventional nets simply don’t work.<br>
      <br>
      By coating meshes with NBD Nano’s hydrophobic coating, NBD Nano is
      able to consistently increase the rate of fog harvesting in
      coastal areas. Recent data suggest the NBD Nano coating can
      improve capture rates by 5x in fog events. The company was
      recently awarded a grant from the US Department of Agriculture to
      set up pilot sites in coastal regions. NBD Nano’s
      commercialization efforts are to make this product available to
      the areas that need it most...<br>

        <b>LIQUID COLLECTING PERMEABLE STRUCTURES</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      A structure for collecting liquid droplets from an aerosol can
      have a structure and properties that are selected for efficient
      liquid collection. In particular, the strand radius and spacing of
      a mesh, and a material for coating the mesh, can be selected to
      provide efficient collection of water droplets from fog.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a liquid collecting
      permeable structures.<br>
      <div align="center"><br>
      </div>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] According to WHO statistics, less than 0.007% of all water
      on the earth is readily accessible for human consumption. About a
      billion people lack access to safe drinking water. More than 3.5
      million people die every year due to water-related diseases. Water
      insecurity is one of the leading causes for school dropouts,
      especially among girls, and more than 200 million working hours
      are spent (almost exclusively by women) daily for the collection
      of domestic water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The water crisis is worsened in arid parts of the world due
      to abuse of groundwater, water-intensive crop cultivation, rapid
      industrialization, and changing lifestyle. In some dry regions,
      the appearance of fog in the early morning is common. Fog is a
      completely untapped water resource. Fog harvesting provides an
      opportunity to "produce" water locally for rural communities,
      which will reduce the stress on groundwater. Consider a country
      like Chile, where a persistent advection fog is occurs due to the
      long and mountainous coastline. By one estimate, 10 billion m
      &lt;3 &gt;of fog water per year is available in Chile. Currently,
      water consumption in northern Chile is 391 million m &lt;3 &gt;per
      year, i.e., only 4% of the total water content in the fog. Water
      collection from fog harvesting thus has enormous potential to
      locally satisfy the need for a pure and dependable supply of water
      in arid locations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Highly efficient permeable structures for collection of
      liquid droplets or small particles are described. The surface
      wetting properties and topography of the material can guide the
      design of the permeable structures. For example, the fog
      harvesting ability of woven meshes can be increased greatly by
      judiciously choosing the physico-chemical properties of the mesh
      surfaces. A working model for the interaction of liquid with the
      permeable structures allows design of highly efficient liquid
      collecting structures for a variety of possible conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The permeable structures can be used for applications
      including fog harvesting; elimination of mist in engines and
      turbines; or elimination of small droplets or colloidal particles
      in the chemical process industries. These mist eliminators
      decrease pressure drops across unit operations, such as
      distillation columns, and therefore save energy required for
      pumping. Filters based on the permeable structures can selectively
      capture hazardous colloidal emissions based on size.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In one aspect, a device for collecting droplets of a liquid
      from an aerosol can include an aerosol-permeable structure
      including strands having a characteristic radius, and a
      characteristic spacing, a characteristic spacing ratio, wherein
      the outermost surface of the strands includes a material having a
      low contact angle hysteresis for the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In certain circumstances, the material and the
      characteristic spacing can be selected such that liquid droplets
      adhered to the structure will drain from the structure under
      gravity....<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0033] FIG. 1 is a series of microscope images of various
        permeable structures with different wire radii (R) and spacing
        ratio (D*).</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0034] FIGS. 2A-2C are a diagrams depicting fog flow
        through a woven mesh surface, and a contour plot of the fog
        harvesting efficiency. FIG. 2A is an illustration indicating the
        stream surfaces of fog laden wind and their divergence after
        passing through a woven mesh surface. FIG. 2B is an enlarged
        drawing focusing on the interaction between incoming fog
        droplets and a horizontal mesh element. FIG. 2C is a contour
        plot of the fog harvesting efficiency ([eta]) s a function of
        the ratio of radius of the fog droplets to the radius of the
        wire (R*=r fog/R) and the spacing ratio of the woven mesh
        (D*=(R+D)/R).</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0035] FIGS. 3A-3E represent two factors that reduce
        collection efficiency, and the surface modification design space
        that depicts the relative resistance to re-entrainment and
        drainage. Two factors that inhibit fog harvesting and reduce
        collection efficiency are ( FIG. 3A) re-entrainment of collected
        droplets in the wind and ( FIG. 3B) blockage of the mesh. FIG.
        3C shows a plot that identifies the range of droplet sizes where
        the forces of adhesion dominate the drag forces, and establishes
        a criterion for a threshold droplet size for re-entrainment.
        FIG. 3D shows a plot that represents a second constraint arises
        from comparing the weight of the droplet with the surface
        pinning force arising from contact angle hysteresis. The
        threshold size where gravity dominates hysteretic pinning can be
        decreased by minimizing CAH=cos [theta] rec-cos [theta] adv.
        FIG. 3E shows a graph depicting the design space constructed
        from two dimensionless parameters related to work of adhesion
        (abscissa) and contact angle hysteresis (ordinate) depicts the
        relative resistance to re-entrainment and drainage. Measured
        values for droplets of water (V ''10 [mu]L) deposited on several
        different coatings are shown in the plot. Wetting
        characteristics corresponding to a higher work of adhesion and
        lower contact angle hysteresis are ideal for the maximum fog
        collection efficiency.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0036] FIG. 4 is a contour map of the predicted aerodynamic
        capture efficiency of fog droplets of radius r fog using a mesh
        with a wire radius R and a spacing ratio D*, assuming a wind
        velocity of 2 m/s. The efficiency is expected to increase with
        decreasing R (increasing R*) and at an intermediate value of D*.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0046] A design framework can guide the design and selection of a
      liquid-collecting structure having enhanced efficiency for a given
      environmental or operating condition. Accordingly, engineered
      surfaces can have significantly higher liquid collection
      efficiency compared to current structures, such as Raschel meshes
      used in fog harvesting. The understanding provided by this
      framework can facilitate effective fog harvesting across many
      regions and conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The design framework is independent of any specific
      material used on the permeable structures. Therefore, mesh,
      spring, or other permeable structures could be manufactured using
      materials that have desirable bulk properties (such as strength,
      ease of working, weight, cost, durability, and others). The
      permeable structures can be conformally coated to achieve desired
      surface properties (e.g., texture and wetting properties). For
      example, a metallic mesh can be mechanically robust, both
      structurally and against environmental wear and tear. A metallic
      mesh can retain a complex 3-dimensional structure that can further
      enhance the efficiency of liquid collection. The design framework
      can be applied to generally to permeable motifs, including
      multiple mesh systems. The design framework provides a way to
      selectively filter droplets or particles based on size and/or
      velocity in an aerosol, cloud, or fog.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] An aerosol is a suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid
      particles in a gas. The particles are sufficiently small that they
      remain suspended rather than falling or settling out of the
      suspension. One typical example of an aerosol is a suspension of
      liquid particles in air. In a natural setting, an aerosol of water
      in air is typically referred to as fog (if close to the ground) or
      a cloud (if high above the ground).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Liquid aerosols typically include droplets having a size in
      the micrometer regime. For example, fog, mist, or colloidal
      particles of water in air typically have a size in the range of
      about 1 [mu]m to about 40 [mu]m. These particles/droplets are too
      small to settle down under gravity; they undergo Brownian motion
      and cannot be collected by gravity-based techniques. These
      droplets, however, have significantly higher density than the
      surrounding air mass. Therefore, when an aerosol flows around a
      solid object, the particles cannot follow the streamlines. They
      continue to travel along their initial trajectory and as a result,
      are intercepted by the solid object. Langmuir and Blodgett and
      many other researchers studied the efficacy of cylindrical objects
      in the capture of such small-sized particles. See, for example,
      Langmuir, I.; Blodgett, K. B. A mathematical investigation of
      water droplet trajectories US Air Force Tech. Rep. No. 5418: 1946;
      p 68; and McComber, P.; Touzot, G., Journal of Hydrometerology
      1981, 38, 1027-1036; each of which is incorporated by reference in
      its entirety. They concluded that the efficiency of fog harvesting
      ([eta]) increased as the radius of the cylindrical obstacle (R)
      decreased.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Aerosol-permeable structures (also referred to herein
      simply as "permeable structures") can be used to collect liquid
      droplets from the aerosol. An aerosol-permeable structure is a
      structure, having many small openings, pores, or channels through
      which the aerosol can pass. Preferably, the structure is
      sufficiently permeable to the aerosol that when the aerosol is
      part of a moving current, the aerosol passes primarily through the
      aerosol-permeable structure, rather than being primarily diverted
      around the structure (as would occur in the case of a solid
      structure). As the aerosol passes through the permeable structure,
      droplets impact the permeable structure and are retained there. As
      more droplets impact, the droplets coalesce. The coalesced
      droplets can then be collected (e.g., by flowing or dripping from
      the structure by gravity, or by mechanical agitation of the
      structure to dislodge the coalesced droplets).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Permeable structures suitable for liquid collection can be
      formed of any material possessing the necessary permeability to
      the aerosol. For example, the permeable structure can be a mesh,
      such as a woven mesh. A mesh includes many interlaced or
      interconnect strands. The strands can be filamentous, being much
      longer than they are wide. The strands can be generally
      cylindrical in shape. The strands can be of any material, for
      example, natural fibers, polymers, metals, or composite materials.
      The strands have an outermost surface, the properties of which can
      affect the efficiency of liquid collection (discussed below). The
      strands can be formed of a single first material, e.g., a metal,
      in which case the first material forms the outermost surface. In
      other cases, the strands can be coated with a second material
      (e.g., a strand composed of a metal and having a polymer coating
      on the metal). In this case, the second material forms the
      outermost surface of the strand, and the properties of the second
      material, rather than the first material, will influence the
      liquid-collecting properties of the permeable structure. In cases
      where the strands are coated, the coating can be applied prior to
      forming the mesh, or after the mesh is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The mesh can have a regular or irregular pattern of
      strands. In some cases, the strands of a mesh can have different
      radii; in other cases, the strands will all have the same radius.
      A regular pattern of strands involves a set of strands aligned in
      parallel with each other and repeating at regular intervals.
      Typically it also involves a second set of strands aligned in
      parallel with each other but set at an angle to the first set. In
      one simple example, the mesh can have a simple pattern with two
      sets of strands set at right angles, and repeating with the same
      interval in both directions.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A mesh, particularly a simple mesh, can be characterized
      according to the dimensions of the mesh and its component strands.
      Thus, a simple mesh can have strands having a characteristic
      radius. The strands can have a characteristic spacing between
      adjacent parallel strands. Typically the spacing will be the same
      along both the length and width, but this is not necessarily so.
      Thus, a mesh can have a first characteristic spacing in one
      direction, and a different second characteristic spacing in the
      other direction. The mesh can also have a characteristic spacing
      ratio, which relates the characteristic radius to the
      characteristic spacing, as explained further below. The spacing
      ratio describes the closeness of the mesh, in other words, across
      a large section of the mesh, how much surface area the strands
      cover.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A spacing ratio, D*, can be defined as follows: if R is the
      cross-sectional radius of a strand, and 2D is the spacing between
      adjacent strands, the spacing ratio is defined as D*=(R+D)/R. The
      closeness of the mesh can also be represented as a shading
      coefficient (SC), which is the fraction of projected area that is
      occluded by the solid mesh texture.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The permeable structure can be coated with a material
      chosen for its surface properties, for example, its wetting
      properties. Wetting properties include hydrophobicity,
      hydrophilicity, oleophobicity, oleophilicity, advancing contact
      angle, receding contact angle, static contact angle, contact angle
      hysteresis and other properties. Suitable coating materials
      include polymers (e.g., hydrophobic polymers). One such example is
      polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS), and blends of POSS
      with other polymers, such as polyacrylates and fluoropolymers, for
      example, Tecnoflon. Exemplary polyacrylates include poly(methyl
      methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), or poly(butyl
      methacrylate). Other materials can be added to the coating
      material to afford other properties, such as titania particles,
      (e.g., titania nanoparticles) which can exhibit photocatalytic
      self-cleaning properties. The coating material can also be chosen
      for its texture. In some cases, the material may be smooth; or it
      may have a degree of roughness. Roughness may be found at the
      nanometer scale, the micrometer scale, or larger scales. A second
      liquid (ex. Krytox oil) which is insoluble in water can be
      impregnated in the asperities of the texture.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) molecules have
      a rigid silsesquioxane cage surrounded by optionally substituted
      alkyl groups, e.g., fluoro-alkyl groups. A number of different
      molecules with different organic groups, such as
      1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl (fluorodecyl POSS) and
      1H,1H,2H,2H-tridecafluorooctyl (fluorooctyl POSS), have now been
      synthesized. Fluorinated POSS molecules contain a very high
      surface concentration of fluorine containing groups, including -CF
      2 and -CF 3 moieties. The high surface concentration and low
      surface mobility of these groups, as well as the relatively high
      ratio of -CF 3 groups with respect to the CF 2 groups results in
      one of the most hydrophobic and lowest surface energy materials
      available today. See, for example, Owen, M. J. &amp; Kobayashi, H.
      Surface active fluorosilicone polymers. Macromol. Symp. 82,
      115-123 (1994). Blends of a moderately hydrophilic polymer,
      poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and fluorodecyl POSS can be used
      in various weight ratios to create materials with different
      surface properties. Other polymers can be used in place of or in
      combination with other polymers. By varying the mass fraction of
      POSS blended with various polymers, the surface energy of the
      polymer-POSS blend can be systematically changed. See, for
      example, WO 2009/009185, which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Meshes, e.g., woven meshes, having cylindrical fibers are
      commercially available over a wide range of wire radii and
      spacings (as shown in FIG. 1). Woven meshes can be a suitable
      material for fog harvesting structures because of their relatively
      low cost (e.g., $5 to $10 per sq. ft.), wide availability, and
      mechanical robustness. Their regular geometric structure also
      facilitates quantitative study, modeling, and design of their fog
      harvesting properties. A comprehensive model to analyze the
      efficiency of water collection (ii) using woven meshes has been
      described (Rivera, J. D., Atmospheric Research 2011, 102, 335-342,
      which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). The
      efficiency [eta] can be represented in terms of two independent,
      dimensionless variables. The first is the spacing ratio, D*. The
      second, R* is the ratio of the radius of fog droplets (r fog) to
      the radius of the mesh wire (R), i.e., R*=r fog/R.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The overall collection efficiency is a product of i) the
      aerodynamic collection efficiency ([eta] a) and ii) the subsequent
      deposition efficiency ([eta] d) (Rivera, J. D., Atmospheric
      Research 2011, 102, 335-342, which is incorporated by reference in
      its entirety). Rivera argued that the aerodynamic collection
      efficiency accounts for the fraction of fog flow that is directed
      towards the solid portion of the mesh. The high Reynolds number
      (Re&gt;&gt;1) flow around the mesh ( FIG. 2A) is modeled as a
      linear combination of the flow around an impermeable rigid solid
      (i.e., D* =1), and an unobstructed uniform flow. FIG. 2B is an
      enlarged view, in which droplets that are closer to the central
      axis are trapped on the cylindrical wire, whereas droplets closer
      to the periphery follow the streamline around the wire. Droplets
      on the wire coalesce, and once they grow past a threshold size,
      they drain under gravity. Due to the no slip and no penetration
      boundary conditions at the solid surface, the wind speed is
      locally reduced in the vicinity of the mesh elements. This
      momentum defect is modeled in terms of a drag coefficient for the
      overall structure (C D 1.18) and the aerodynamic collection
      efficiency is ultimately expressed as [eta] a=SC/(1+[square root
      of]{square root over (C 0/C D)}), where C 0 is the pressure drop
      coefficient for a cylindrical mesh given as C
      0=1.44[1.3SC+(SC/(1-SC)) &lt;2&gt;]. The collection efficiency is
      not simply equal to the shade coefficient of the mesh, but changes
      nonmonotonically with the openness of the mesh and the aerodynamic
      characteristics of the flow through the mesh. As D* increases from
      unity (an impermeable plate), the aerodynamic collection
      efficiency ([eta] a) increases from zero as the lateral deflection
      of the air stream is diminished. Beyond a local maximum at D* crit
      3.1(or equivalently, SC 0.55), most fog droplets pass through the
      void area between wires without being deflected and [eta] a
      decreases.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The deposition efficiency ([eta] d) quantifies the fraction
      of fog droplets that are actually deposited from the population
      initially headed towards the solid wires. In their seminal work,
      Langmuir and Blodgett used numerical calculations to develop an
      empirical correlation for the deposition of small particles on an
      infinitely long cylinder (Langmuir I, Blodgett KB (2004) A
      mathematical investigation of water droplet trajectories.
      Collected works of Irving Langmuir (Pergamon Press, Oxford), which
      is incorporated by reference in its entirety.); the deposition
      efficiency ([eta] d St/(St+[pi]/2)) monotonically increases as the
      dimensionless radius ratio R* increases, i.e. cylinders with
      progressively smaller radii are more efficient collectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The resultant overall collection efficiency from the two
      components<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0061] is shown in FIG. 2C as a contour map in R*, D* parameter
      space, assuming a wind velocity of 2 m/s and uniform droplet size
      r fog 3 [mu]m (0&lt;=St&lt;=4). The contours indicate that the
      collection efficiency of a conventional Raschel mesh (D* 5.1, R*
      0.005; [eta] 4.8%) is much lower than that of a thinner and denser
      wire mesh (D* 3.5, R* 0.024; [eta] 12%). The contour map can also
      be used as a design chart for selecting an optimal mesh by
      choosing D* (or SC) and maximizing R*. The chart can be employed
      to estimate the maximum fog collection efficiency and evaluate the
      amount of collected water expected for a specific mesh surface, if
      the characteristic wind speed of the fog ([nu] 0), liquid water
      content, total mesh area, and collection time are known.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In the design chart presented in FIG. 3, contours of
      efficiency of aerosol harvesting ([eta]) are plotted as a function
      of spacing ratio (D*) and R*. The contours correspond to different
      values of r fog, shown at upper right in FIG. 3. The efficiency
      increases monotonically with increasing value of R*, i.e.,
      decreasing size of the cylindrical strands (R). On the contrary,
      the variation of [eta] with D* is not monotonic. Instead, the
      efficiency goes through a maximum value at intermediate spacing
      ratios, i.e., the optimal value of D* is between about 3 and about
      4. When the spacing ratio is small (D* approaching 1), the aerosol
      harvesting efficiency is close to zero. At such low spacing
      ratios, the mesh behaves like an impermeable solid object: the
      gas, along with the liquid droplets suspended in it, are deflected
      around the mesh. As a result, very few droplets impact the mesh,
      resulting in a low collection efficiency. As D* increases, the
      openness of the mesh increases, and the airflow is perturbed to a
      smaller extent. As a result, more droplets impact the cylindrical
      strands of the mesh and the collection efficiency increases.
      However, as D* increases further, less solid material per unit
      projected area is available for droplets to impact, and therefore
      the efficiency decreases. At still larger value of D*, the strands
      of the woven mesh are far away from each other, and most fog
      droplets go through the mesh without being intercepted by the
      solid strands. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the two
      effects, i.e., deflection of the air stream around an impermeable
      blunt body at low D*, and passage of the air stream through the
      mesh at high D*. As a result, the optimal efficiency for
      collection of liquid droplets is expected for a mesh with low R
      and intermediate value of D* (D* 3 to 3.5).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Based on the design chart, the mesh surface with highest
      efficiency for a given aerosol condition (characterized by a
      particular size of the liquid droplet and gas velocity) can be
      selected. Note that efficiency increases moving from left to right
      on the x-axis of FIG. 3. Therefore, for a given mesh with wire
      radius R, the efficiency of collection is highest for the largest
      droplets (r fog). Because the volume of a droplet is directly
      proportional to the cube of its radius, mesh surfaces that are
      highly effective in capturing large droplets will harvest most of
      the liquid volume fraction in the aerosol.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The design chart outlined FIG. 2C can be extended to other
      permeable surfaces like springs. An array of springs can be used
      to capture tiny droplets of water in a moving column of air.
      Springs are symmetric structures, and therefore fog collectors
      made of springs will perform equally well irrespective of the
      direction of fog-laden wind. The spacing between two helical
      elements of a spring can be tuned by applying a
      tension/compression in the vertical direction. Therefore, the
      spacing ratio (D*) or shade coefficient can be chosen based on the
      incoming wind velocity and other physical properties of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The theoretical collection efficiency anticipated from this
      design framework for meshes can be adversely affected in actual
      performance due to two issues that depend on the surface
      wettability; i) convective loss of deposited droplets (or
      re-entrainment; as shown schematically in FIG. 3A) and ii) mesh
      clogging that modifies the local aerodynamics ( FIG. 3B).
      Re-entrainment arises from aerodynamically-induced detachment of
      deposited water droplets back into the air stream before they can
      reach the critical volume at which gravitational drainage
      dominates. As the small deposited water droplets coalesce, the
      growing droplets are influenced by the competition between
      aerodynamic drag forces and surface adhesion forces. See, for
      example, 24. Milne A J B, Amirfazli A (2009) Drop shedding by
      shear flow for hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic surfaces. Langmuir
      25:14155-14164, and Ledesma-Aguilar R, Nistal R, Hernandez-Machado
      A, Pagonabarraga I (2011) Controlled drop emission by wetting
      properties in driven liquid filaments. Nat. Mater. 10:367-371,
      each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. When F
      drag&gt;F adhesion, the droplets are re-entrained in the fog flow,
      leading to a decrease in the fog collection efficiency ( FIG. 3A).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In FIG. 3B a second problem that occurs on a mesh when the
      deposited liquid volume becomes large is identified. In the
      clogging region, the hysteretic wetting force pinning a droplet in
      the interstices of the mesh exceeds the gravitational draining
      force when the deposited water droplet size is less than a
      critical volume. The void area between mesh elements could become
      occluded by these pinned (non-draining) drops, depending on the
      half spacing of the mesh as discussed below. Such clogged parts of
      the mesh are impermeable and obstruct the local wind,
      significantly hampering the overall fog-harvesting ability of the
      grid. The effective void fraction approaches zero (or D*
      effective-&gt;1) as the mesh clogs and the aerodynamic collection
      becomes zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] To overcome these two challenges and to design fog
      collection mesh surfaces with high efficiency in practice, the two
      critical water drop radii-denoted r e and r c in FIGS. 3C, D-that
      are sensitive to the physico-chemical surface properties of the
      meshes are considered. In FIG. 3C, the right-most shaded region
      represents the range of paramater space where the aerodynamic drag
      force (which grows as F drag [rho][nu] 0 &lt;2&gt;r &lt;2&gt;
      drop) exceeds the adhesion force (which grows as F adhesion
      [gamma] LV (1+cos [theta] rec)r drop); droplet re-entrainment is
      expected in this region where F drag&gt;F adhesion. A detailed
      force balance on a spherical cap gives a critical droplet radius
      at which these two forces balance each other:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [gamma] LV is the surface tension of water,
      [theta]=([theta] adv+[theta] rec)/2 is the mean contact angle of
      the droplet on the surface, and [theta] adv, [theta] rec are the
      advancing contact angle and receding contact angle, respectively
      (see below for details). A droplet with radius r drop&gt;r e is
      susceptible to re-entrainment. To reduce re-entrainment, the slope
      of the adhesion force curve, which is proportional to the work of
      adhesion [gamma] LV (1+cos [theta] rec), must be increased. This
      can be achieved in practice by lowering the receding contact angle
      [theta] rec.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] As the droplets grow on the mesh, gravity has to overcome
      the surface pinning force in order to shed these collected
      droplets into the collecting gutter at the base of the mesh.
      Balancing the the gravitational body force F grav [rho]gr
      &lt;3&gt; drop with the hysteretic force F CAH [gamma] LV(CAH)r
      drop that characterizes depinning of a liquid droplet in the
      interstitial gap of a woven mesh with a simple square weave.
      Setting F grav=F CAH gives a second critical radius for 'choking'
      or clogging of the mesh<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where B=(1-cos [theta])/sin [theta] (see below for
      additional details). FIG. 3D shows that mesh-clogging as a result
      of contact line pinning can be reduced (i.e. the minimum droplet
      size r c that will freely drain off the mesh) by developing
      surface coatings with smaller values of the contact angle
      hysteresis CAH=cos [theta] rec-cos [theta] adv<br>
      <br>
      [0069] For an ideal fog-collecting surface, liquid droplets
      convected towards the mesh and deposited on the surface will be
      drained quickly by gravity into the collecting gutter without loss
      by re-entrainment to the airflow, thus refreshing the base mesh
      surface for capture of new fog droplets. Design of an improved
      mesh to maximize fog collection efficiency thus involves: I)
      minimizing rc to avoid clogging, II) maximizing re to reduce
      re-entrainment, while also III) selecting a mesh opening near the
      optimal aerodynamic value of D* 3.1 and IV) maximizing R* to the
      extent possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The surface forces controlling adhesion and hysteresis
      depend upon the physico-chemical surface characteristics of the
      mesh (Quere D (2008) Wetting and roughness. Annu. Rev. Mater. Res.
      38:71-99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety), and
      therefore smart engineering of suitable coatings can enable woven
      meshes to collect fog with improved efficiency. If r e&gt;&gt;r c
      can be achieved by surface modifications, then the performance
      degradation associated with both shaded regions in FIGS. 3C, 3D
      can be minimized. Such a mesh surface would have both low contact
      angle hysteresis (CAH&lt;&lt;1) and a low receding contact angle
      ([theta] rec-&gt;0). This material challenge can be summarized in
      the surface modification design space shown in FIG. 3E. The two
      important design parameters are contact angle hysteresis (CAR) and
      a scaled work of adhesion (W a/[gamma] LV=1+cos [theta] rec) that
      can be exploited to rank the wetting properties of various
      materials for preventing clogging and re-entrainment problems.
      From the expression for mesh clogging (r c) given in eq.(3), it is
      clear that a coating with extremely low hysteresis (CAH-&gt;0)
      will lead to a small value of the critical mesh half spacing
      (denoted D crit) above which the clogging problem does not occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Previously deployed fog harvesting setups used a
      double-layered Raschel mesh made of polyolefin (denoted PO) which
      has CAH &lt;(PO)&gt;=cos [theta] rec &lt;(PO)&gt;-cos [theta] adv
      &lt;(PO)&gt; 0.40 (see Table 1). By contrast, a topographically
      smooth surface dipcoated with a blend of 50% POSS -50% PEMA
      (denoted PPD) has one of the lowest values of contact angle
      hysteresis reported to date; CAH &lt;(PPD)&gt;=cos [theta] rec
      &lt;(PPD)&gt;-cos [theta] adv &lt;(PPD)&gt; 0.06. See, for
      example, Meuler A J, Chhatre S S, Nieves A R, Mabry J M, Cohen R
      E, et al.(2011) Examination of wettability and surface energy in
      fluorodecyl POSS/polymer blends. Soft Matter 7:10122-10134, which
      is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The critical opening
      size for a PPD coated mesh D crit &lt;(PPD)&gt; 0.41 mm is
      significantly smaller than D crit &lt;(PO)&gt; 1.5 mm, and
      therefore finer meshes, if dipcoated with POSS-PEMA, will drain
      more readily and be less susceptible to clogging.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] This hysteretic drainage criterion involves differences in
      the surface energies based on advancing and receding contact
      angles; however, from eq. (2) it is clear that the absolute
      magnitude of the receding contact angle is also important for
      preventing re-entrainment and subsequent loss of deposited
      droplets. The adhesive work (per unit area) required to pull a
      droplet off the surface (against aerodynamic drag) scales as W
      a=[gamma] LV (1+cos [theta] rec). Therefore, 'sticky' surfaces
      with low [theta] rec (and high W a) promote the adhesion of
      droplets on solid surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The surface properties of the POSS coating can be
      manipulated further by altering the deposition technique ( FIG.
      3E). The CAH can be further decreased to CAH 0.01 by spray-coating
      the mesh to create a re-entrant roughened topography using
      POSS-PEMA (see, for example, Srinivasan S, Chhatre S S, Mabry J M,
      Cohen R E, McKinley G H (2011) Solution spraying of poly(methyl
      methacrylate) blends to fabricate microtextured, superoleophobic
      surfaces. Polymer 52:3209-3218, which is incorporated by reference
      in its entirety), but the receding contact angle increases to
      [theta] rec 159[deg.]. Therefore, such spray coated meshes
      (denoted PPS in FIG. 3E) are extremely clogging-resistant, but the
      higher [theta] rec value reduces drop adhesion which leads to
      greater re-entrainment and a lower overall collection efficiency.
      A liquid impregnated textured surface or 'SLIPS surface' (29, 30,
      31) with low CAH and low [theta] rec can be obtained by imbibing a
      nonvolatile oil (e.g., Krytox oil) into the pores of the
      spray-coated surface (31). This liquid-impregnated surface
      (denoted KO in FIG. 3E) has CAH 0.03 and [theta] rec 100[deg.],
      and therefore it is expected to harvest fog better than dip-coated
      or spray-coated meshes.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The fog harvesting technique described was based on
      physical impaction and interception of liquid droplets in a flow.
      The mesh surfaces captured liquid particles. In addition to water
      droplets, fog also includes a high level of humidity. The
      condensation of water vapor in this humid mass represents another
      source of water. Woven mesh surfaces have a large interface
      available for heat transfer, and by selecting the thermal
      emissivity and heat transfer properties of the mesh surface,
      harvesting of droplets in fog can be supplemented by condensation
      of humidity to provide additional water.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A woven mesh surface can be cooled by processes including
      natural convection, infrared emission, and artificial cooling
      through conduction. Materials that are highly emissive in the
      infrared (such as, for example, carbon black nanoparticles), can
      be used as a coating on the permeable structures to further
      enhance the liquid-collecting efficiency. Carbon nanoparticles can
      be coated by simply exposing the permeable structure to an open
      flame; e.g., candle soot can be a source of carbon black
      nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can also be added using
      layer-by-layer deposition. Besides infrared emissivity,
      nanoparticles (of any suitable material) can create structures on
      the micrometer and/or nanometer scale to enhance heat transfer
      (e.g., by increasing the effective surface area of the permeable
      structures).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In some circumstances, it may be beneficial to provide more
      than one layer of the permeable structures to increase the
      efficiency of liquid collection. For example, in high-velocity
      wind conditions, as in the case of inertial Chilean fog, droplets
      collected on the mesh might blow away. One more more additional
      meshes placed downwind of the first structure can act as a barrier
      and capture such droplets. In another example, when fog droplets
      are extremely small, and the wind velocity is low, a single
      layered collection surface may have limited collection efficiency.
      One or more additional layers can be selected so that its capture
      elements (e.g., cylindrical wires) are aligned with the openings
      of the first permeable structure. Then, by adjusting the distance
      between the two mesh structures, fog collection can be optimiazed
      without significantly disturbing the wind profile. Multiple layers
      of mesh placed close together are likely to touch when the wind is
      blowing; this contact can aid the drainage of liquid droplets
      collected on the meshes.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The liquid-collecting permeable structures discussed above
      involved flat or curved woven wire mesh. Three dimensional
      geometries for the permeable structures are also contemplated.
      Examples of such three-dimensional geometries include helical
      springs, cones or inverted cone shapes, including one or more
      layers of mesh surfaces to capture omnidirectional fog/mist flow.
      Like a fog-well, an axially symmetric structure can show uniform
      collection efficiency regardless of direction of fog/mist flow. In
      addition, convenience for collecting liquid into a container or
      pipe system can be significantly enhanced by engineering the
      aspect ratio and symmetry of the devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Apart from fog harvesting, the permeable structures can be
      used in other applications as well. Such structures can be used
      (1) to eliminate mist in engines and turbines or (2) to eliminate
      small droplets/colloidal particles in unit operations in chemical
      process industries that involve pipes and reactors. These mist
      eliminators decrease pressure drops across unit operations like
      distillation columns and therefore save energy required for
      pumping. Demisters are used to separate liquid droplets from air
      in absorbers, seawater desalination plants, washers, sulphuric
      acid plants, vacuum columns, sound absorbers, vibration dampers,
      distillation and rectification plants, oil separators,
      evaporators, flash vessel systems, and other equipment. Filters
      based on such structures can selectively capture hazardous
      colloidal emissions based on their size. The design framework
      allows the construction of a size-specific "membrane" that allows
      particles or liquid droplets under a certain size to pass through,
      while almost completely blocking particles above a threshold size.
      Further, by appropriately tuning the wetting parameters of the
      surface, a membrane that selectively collects a few liquids while
      letting other liquids go through can also be constructed.<br>
      <br>
      Examples<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In FIG. 4, the x-axis is the ratio of fog droplet radius to
      the radius of the mesh wire (r fog/R), and the y-axis is the
      spacing ratio ((R+D)/R), so for a given fog condition (fixed r
      fog), each positively sloped line through the origin represents a
      unique mesh spacing. In FIG. 5, the critical mesh opening size for
      PP (left panel) and POSS-PEMA (right panel) are represented on the
      contour plots for the expected aerodynamic efficiency of fog
      harvesting.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Consider a mesh with a PP material/coating with a critical
      opening size of 1190 [mu]m, as shown in the left panel of FIG. 6 (
      FIG. 6A). For any point to the right of the limiting spacing
      (i.e., any point in the shaded region), the mesh is expected to
      clog with liquid droplets; consequently, the mesh will never reach
      its predicted efficiency in collecting droplets. The overall
      efficiency of fog harvesting is the product of the two sequential
      processes (1) the collection of fog droplets on mesh surfaces, and
      (2) the drainage of water from the mesh to a storage tank. For
      points in the shaded region, the efficiency of fog impaction might
      be higher, but the drainage efficiency decreases significantly and
      therefore, the overall fog harvesting efficiency will not improve.
      Due to this restriction, the higher efficiency portion of the
      design space cannot be fully utilized and at best 6% efficiency
      can be obtained with a PP coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] However, a POSS-PEMA coating with smaller contact angle
      hysteresis (than PP) has a lower critical opening size, and
      therefore, a significantly higher fraction of the design space is
      free of clogging and drainage limitations. Therefore, a mesh
      surface with smaller radius (smaller R) and a correspondingly more
      effective value of D* could be chosen. An appropriately chosen
      POSS-PEMA coated mesh will have an expected aerodynamic efficiency
      of about 12-13%, as shown in the right side of FIG. 6B.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Therefore, changing the surface chemistry from PP to
      POSS-PEMA allowed the choice of a surface texture with double the
      overall expected efficiency. The triangular wedge shaped portions
      between the two straight lines shown in FIG. 6B was not accessible
      with a PP coating, but was available if the meshes were coated
      with POSS-PEMA.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] With this mechanistic understanding of fog harvesting, the
      model was tested with a set of woven wire meshes. The results were
      compared to those obtained with a polypropylene Raschel mesh,
      which has been used in the field to harvest fog. The comparison
      therefore provides a good benchmark to compare performance to
      actual deployments in the field. The woven wire meshes were
      dip-coated in a 50% POSS-50% PEMA solution (total solids=10 g/l)
      for 5 minutes, then air-dried and annealed in an oven at 60[deg.]
      C. for half an hour, as shown in FIG. 7. The mesh samples were
      tested using an artificially generated fog environment, as
      schematically shown in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Materials and Methods Preparation of Meshes. Raschel mesh
      samples with 35% shade coefficient were procured from Fogquest
      volunteers in Chile and were cut into 30 mm by 30 mm pieces. To
      keep the Raschel mesh flat and to ensure that the meshes are
      normal to the direction of fog stream, the three edges of square
      planar mesh were supported by a metal wire frame with diameter of
      127 [mu]m. Sample wire meshes surfaces were prepared by cutting
      commercially available wire meshes (McMaster-Carr,
      Corrosion-Resistant Type 304 Stainless Steel Woven Wire Cloth)
      into the same square planar shape with 30 mm side.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Polyolefin emulant coating (denoted by PO in FIGS. 3E, 9B).
      It has been shown that by tuning the relative concentration of the
      FluoroPOSS species and a compatible polymer binder (eg PEMA) the
      wettability characteristics of a dip-coated surface can be tuned
      over a wide range (see, for example, Meuler A J, Chhatre S S,
      Nieves A R, Mabry J M, Cohen R E, et al.(2011) Examination of
      wettability and surface energy in fluorodecyl POSS/polymer blends.
      Soft Matter 7:10122-10134). To generate a coated wire mesh that
      closely mimics the surface properties of the polyolefin Raschel
      mesh, the as-received wire mesh was dip-coated using a 1.7 wt. %
      1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric
      silsesquioxane (fluorodecyl POSS) 98.3 wt. % poly(ethyl
      methacrylate) (PEMA, Mw=515 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) solution in a
      volatile hydrochlorofluorocarbon solvent (Asahiklin AK-225, Asahi
      Glass Company) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The meshes were
      dipped for 5 minutes, and then air-dried to evaporate the solvent.
      Uniformity of the coating was checked by scanning electron
      microscope (SEM) and by contact angle measurements at multiple
      locations on the surface.<br>

      were dipped for 5 minutes, and then air-dried to evaporate the

      at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The superhydrophobic spray-coated
      meshes were prepared by spray deposition of the polymer solution
      using an air spray-brush (McMaster-Carr) using a pressurized
      nitrogen stream to produce a re-entrant microtexture with very low
      contact angle hysteresis (see, for example, Srinivasan S, Chhatre

      of poly(methyl methacrylate) blends to fabricate microtextured,
      superoleophobic surfaces. Polymer 52:3209-3218). A representative
      micrograph of the spray-coated mesh is shown in FIG. 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Liquid Impregnated surfaces (denoted by KO). The
      spray-coated meshes were immersed into nonvolatile Krytox oil
      ([gamma] LV=17 mN/m at 25[deg.] C., [mu] 113 mPa.s at 20[deg.] C.,
      DuPont) using a DCAT 11 (DataPhysics Instruments) tensiometer at a
      rate of 0.5 mm/min and then retracted at the same speed. A thin
      film of fluorinated Krytox oil remains imbibed into the porous
      spraycoated texture after the mesh is completely withdrawn from
      the oil bath, resulting in a 'SLIPS' surface with very low contact
      angle hysteresis (see, for example, Quere D (2005) Non-sticking

      [0089] Experimental Procedure. All fog collection experiments were
      performed at a relative humidity of RH=100% and temperature of
      26.4+-0.5[deg.] C. in a controlled-humidity glove box
      (environmental chamber, Electro-Tech Systems, Inc.) to eliminate
      evaporation and condensation. Each sample was positioned 10 mm in
      front of the end of two plastic concentric cylinders with
      different diameters of 100 mm and 20 mm, respectively. As shown in
      FIG. 7, fog droplets (r fog=3 [mu]m) created from a nebulizer
      (Omron Compair XLT Nebulizer Compressor Kit NE-C25, Q=16 mL/hr)
      were convected towards the mesh sample by a wind stream of
      velocity [nu] 0 2 m/s, generated by a speed-tunable fan
      (Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan). The
      concentric axis of the two cylinders and axes of symmetry of
      meshes and container were aligned to be on the same vertical
      plane. The mass of water collected in the container with dimension
      of 50 mm by 50 mm located 50 mm under the mesh samples was
      measured every hour for Raschel meshes and every 30 minutes for
      wire woven meshes to quantify the time evolution of efficiency.
      Once the efficiency reached the asymptotic value, the readings
      from at least three consecutive experiments were averaged to
      calculate the fog collection efficiency.<br>

      Lab results were translated into L/m &lt;2&gt;/day assuming
      uniform fog harvesting for 24 hours<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Guided by this framework relating surface wettability and
      fog harvesting performance, a set of parametric experiments were
      performed using a family of simple woven meshes with a range of
      surface coatings (see below section for details). Results were
      benchmarked against the canonical Raschel mesh, using an
      artificially generated laboratory fog. These results are
      summarized in FIG. 9 and Table 1. As shown in Table 1, for most
      coating materials (cos [theta] rec&lt;&gt;-1), r e&gt;&gt;r c, and
      r e does not impact the fog collection efficiency. For a given fog
      condition (i.e., fixed r fog) the critical mesh half spacing with
      a given coating to prevent the clogging and re-entrainment
      problems (r c=D crit&lt;D&lt;r e) can be represented as a line
      (D*=(D/r fog)R*+1) through the origin with positive slope D/r
      fog.Therefore the high efficiency region to the right of these
      lines are inaccessible due to clogging (i.e. in this region of
      FIG. 9A the mesh openings are too small D&lt;r c and the clogged
      mesh grids become impermeable). A first study is of the polyolefin
      Raschel mesh (with large CAH, and a critical opening size D crit
      &lt;(PO)&gt; 1.5 mm). Because of the clogging constraint, large
      portions of the design space with the highest efficiency cannot be
      accessed and, at best, a theoretical efficiency of 5% efficiency
      can be obtained. As shown in FIG. 9B, the measured fog-harvesting
      efficiency of a Raschel mesh (D* 5.1) was [eta] 2%, under
      simulated fog conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The locus of the conventional polyolefin Raschel mesh in
      the design space of FIG. 9A is shown by the open diamond. Because
      it lies above the critical clogging line (i.e., D Raschel&gt;D
      crit &lt;(PO)&gt; 1.5 mm) it is not prone to clogging. Additional
      dipcoating of the Raschel mesh with a POSS-PEMA coating therefore
      does not appreciably enhance its fog collection performance
      (sample - shown in FIG. 9B with [eta]=2+-0.5%). To access the
      regions of higher efficiency, it is clear from these resultes that
      meshes with higher R* are required. Surfaces that are dipcoated in
      POSS-PEMA (to achieve smaller CAH) have a lower critical opening
      size D crit &lt;(PPD)&gt; 0.41 mm, and therefore, a significantly
      higher fraction of the design space is free of clogging and
      drainage limitations. As a result, meshes that were previously
      unusable with thinner fibers (higher R*) and higher shade
      coefficients closer to the optimal value can now be employed for
      fog harvesting. These finer meshes are predicted to have much
      higher fog collection efficiencies ([eta] 12%), provided a
      suitable low hysteresis coating is applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In FIG. 9B, the role of surface coating alone for a
      particular mesh geometry is examined. The measured efficiency
      increases from [eta] 2% (for a woven mesh that is dip-coated to
      achieve the same surface wettability characteristics as the
      polyolefin Raschel mesh) to [eta] 5% for a POSS-PEMA dip-coated
      woven mesh (PPD, ?) with the same radius R 445 [mu]m and the same
      shade coefficient SC 0.5 (D* 3.5). However, the fog-collecting
      efficiency of a sprayed texture (PPS, [image])) and
      liquid-impregnated surface (KO, [image]) woven mesh (again with
      the same R 445 [mu]m) do not perform as well as the dip-coated
      mesh due to the predominance of re-entrainment and clogging.
      Interaction with water droplets impacting and sliding along the
      Krytox-impregnated 'SLIPS surface' results in a progressive loss
      of the nonvolatile impregnating liquid (see FIG. 13 for details).
      This leads to increasing contact angle hysteresis and the mesh
      openings start to clog. Optimization studies focused on the
      dip-coated surfaces as they tend to be stable over much longer
      timescales.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In FIG. 9C, the fog-collecting efficiency is plotted
      against the wire radius, keeping the weave constant (D* 3.5) with
      the same surface coating (dip-coated with POSS-PEMA). The
      theoretical fog collecting efficiency [eta](R,D) given by the
      analysis in eq. (1) above (broken line) provides a good estimate
      of the observed trends. The measured efficiency increases
      monotonically from 5% to 10% as the fiber radius decreases from R
      445 [mu]m to R 172 [mu]m for the first 4 meshes (?, -, -, and -)
      that lie in the region of the design chart where clogging is not a
      limiting factor. However, the finest mesh (R 127 [mu]m, [image])
      is located inside the hysteresis-limited region (with mesh spacing
      D&lt;D crit=r c), and clogging once again prohibits any further
      increase in the efficiency. A mesh located in the clogging-prone
      region of the design space still collects an appreciable amount of
      fog, but its efficiency could be improved still further by
      reducing the clogging constraint imposed by eq.(3) (i.e., lowering
      the slope of the bounding line for D crit, via lower values of
      CAH).<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The maximum fog harvesting efficiency observed in the
      experiments is [eta]=9.9+-0.5% (N=3) for a fine POSS-PEMA
      dipcoated mesh with close to optimal weave (R 172 [mu]m, D* 3.5,
      CAH 0.06, -). In FIG. 9D, the time evolution of the fog harvesting
      performance for the optimal mesh and the Raschel mesh is compared
      over many hours. The optimized wire mesh collects water at a
      faster rate and also reaches steady state faster than the Raschel
      mesh. Thus, by an appropriate choice of the surface texture and
      coating chemistry, the fog harvesting efficiency for
      representative fog conditions ([nu] 0=2 m/s, r fog=3 [mu]m) has
      been enhanced approximately five-fold.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] A comparison of theoretical fog collection efficiency
      across many fog conditions (see below) indicates that the fog
      harvesting efficiency for the POSS-PEMA dipcoated wire mesh (R 172
      [mu]m, -) is also more robust than the conventional Raschel mesh
      to changes in fog conditions (1&lt;=r fog&lt;=40 [mu]m, &lt;=[nu]
      0&lt;=10 m/s). As a result, fog harvesting technology based on
      POSS-PEMA dipcoated woven meshes may be deployable in many regions
      of the world where the size and velocity of fog droplets are not
      suitable for traditional Raschel meshes to work well. The
      performance of these rapidly-draining woven meshes are less
      susceptible to daily or seasonal changes of wind speed and
      direction, or temperature. Optimally-engineered surfaces can work
      effectively in foggy conditions for longer periods of time, and
      subsequently produce much more water; even in a mild fog with
      droplet radius of 3 [mu]m, wind speed of 2 m/s and liquid water
      content of 0.1 g/m &lt;3&gt;, the optimal mesh surface (R 172
      [mu]m, -) can collect approximately two liters of water through an
      area of 1 m &lt;2 &gt;per day. Using literature values for
      conditions in a typical Chilean fog environment (see, for example,
      Schemenauer R S, Joe P I (1989) The collection efficiency of a
      massive fog collector. Atmos. Res. 24:53-69, which is incorporated
      by reference in its entirety) and the design framework described
      here, the amount of water that can be collected using the optimal
      fog harvesting mesh can be estimated. Typical Chilean fog
      conditions are characterized by a larger droplet size and higher
      wind velocity (r fog 13 [mu]m, [nu] 0 6 m/s) and in such inertial
      conditions, the collection rate is predicted to be as large as
      twelve liters of water through an area of 1 m &lt;2 &gt;per day,
      assuming a liquid water content of 0.7 g/m &lt;3&gt;. From such
      calculations it is clear that understanding the enabling roles of
      surface wettability in conjunction with the physical
      characteristics of the woven mesh geometry (i.e. fiber radius and
      shade coefficient) expands the accessible fog harvesting design
      space as well as future geographic opportunities for deploying fog
      harvesting technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Using the literature values for conditions in a typical fog
      environment in Chile, and the design framework presented above,
      the amounts of water that could be collected using a Raschel mesh
      and the optimal fog harvesting mesh were predicted. The results
      for fog environments in Chile and the lab were summarized in Table
      1. From the last column of Table 1, it was clear that the optimal
      wire mesh was more efficient in collecting fog than a double layer
      Raschel mesh. Also, the Chilean fog conditions had a higher wind
      velocity and larger droplet size; in other words, the fog droplets
      had more inertia. In such inertial conditions, the woven mesh
      performed marginally better than the Raschel mesh (about 10%
      better than the best case scenario). However, under less inertial
      fog conditions (like those used in the lab), the woven meshes
      provided a significant advantage over the Raschel meshes. The
      relative advantage of this design framework was clarified further
      by comparing theoretical fog harvesting efficiencies of the
      Raschel mesh with optimally chosen woven mesh under a wide range
      of wind velocities and droplet radii, as plotted in FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] As the wind velocity and droplet size increased from
      condition 1 to condition 6 (see FIG. 10), the fog became more
      inertial and theoretical collection efficiencies increased both
      for the Raschel mesh (indicated bars in FIG. 10) and the woven
      meshes (indicated bars in FIG. 10). Under all six fog conditions,
      the woven mesh was expected to perform significantly better than
      the Raschel mesh. However, the main advantage of the design
      framework was evident under non-inertial (light) fog conditions,
      i.e., conditions 1 and 2. The fog harvesting efficiency for the
      woven mesh was more robust to changes in fog conditions, so it did
      not deteriorate to the same extent as the Raschel mesh. As a
      result, the fog harvesting with woven meshes can be effectively
      used in a more places, e.g., where fog might not be dense enough
      for the Raschel meshes to work well. Nor are fog conditions at any
      one place constant; rather, they are expected to change based on
      the time of the day, temperature, wind patterns, season, and other
      factors. Accordingly, a permeable surface having properties chosen
      for the local conditions can produce more water than a generic
      surface. For example, condition 6 might be representative of
      Chilean fog at the peak of the winter. However, a woven mesh will
      work even when the fog is not as thick, as in the Chilean summer,
      when the conditions are similar to conditions 3 or 4. Higher
      efficiency at all fog conditions will help to collect more water,
      at more places, and over a longer part of the year, all of which
      benefits the economics of fog harvesting.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Derivation of critical droplet radii r e and r c. Two
      criteria for the critical radius of a droplet can be derived by
      equating the drag force acting on a drop to the adhesion force and
      secondly by equating gravitational force and pinning force based
      on contact angle hysteresis. FIG. 11 shows a schematic diagram of
      water droplets on a cylindrical mesh filament (cross-sectional
      view) and on one grid element of a woven mesh (top view). Both
      droplets are assumed to be spherical caps with the algebraic
      average of contact angles [theta]=[theta] adv+[theta] rec/2.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The first critical droplet radius r e for re-entrainment of
      droplets into the airstream is a threshold value of the liquid
      droplet radius at which the aerodynamic drag force (F drag) and
      the surface adhesion force (F adhesion) acting on a water droplet
      ( FIG. 11A) are balanced. To calculate the critical droplet radius
      r e the drag force exerted by wind on a fog droplet and the force
      of adhesion on the droplet exerted by the mesh were equate. First
      the drag force is obtained from the following equation,<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      F drag=[1/2][rho] air[nu] 0 &lt;2&gt; C D A P (eq. s1-1)<br>
      <br>
      [0101] where [rho] air is the density of air, [nu] 0 is the
      velocity of fog stream, C D is the drag coefficient (which
      typically ranges from 0.4 to 1 for a bluff body such as a droplet
      at Reynolds numbers of Re~10 &lt;3&gt;) and A P is the projected
      area normal to the direction of fog flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The projected area can be obtained by a simple
      trigonometric formula.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      A P =r drop &lt;2&gt;([theta]-sin [theta] cos [theta])/sin
      &lt;2&gt;[theta] (eq. s1-2)<br>
      <br>
      [0103] where [theta] is the algebraic average of advancing and
      receding contact angles ([theta] adv+[theta] rec)/2.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] On the other hand, the adhesion force on the liquid droplet
      is calculated in the following way-<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      F adhesion =L l[gamma] LV(1+cos [theta] rec) (eq. s1-3)<br>
      <br>
      [0105] where L l is the characteristic length of the droplet
      (2[pi]r drop) and [gamma] LV is the surface tension of water.
      Finally, by equating eqs s1-1 and s1-3 and substituting eq. s1-2
      into eq. s1-1, the following equation for the critical radius r e
      is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      r e=4[pi] [gamma] LV sin &lt;2&gt;[theta](1+cos [theta] rec)/[rho]
      air[nu] 0 &lt;2&gt; C D([theta]-sin [theta] cos [theta]) (eq.
      s1-4)<br>
      <br>
      [0106] If the droplet is not a spherical cap this will only change
      the precise form of f ([theta]) in eq. s1-4, but not the
      fundamental scaling or magnitude of the expression<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      r e([gamma] LV/[rho] air[nu] 0 &lt;2&gt; C D) f([theta]).<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Similar expressions have been developed by Milne and
      Amirfazli for sheared droplets of water on airfoil surfaces. See
      Milne A J B, Amirfazli A (2009) Drop shedding by shear flow for
      hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic surfaces. Langmuir
      25:14155-14164, which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The critical droplet radius r c for drainage of droplets
      from the mesh is found by balancing gravitational force (F grav)
      and pinning force (F CAH) acting on a water droplet that covers a
      single grid of the mesh ( FIG. 11) is calculated here.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The gravitational force is expressed as-<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      F grav=[rho] water gV (eq. s1-5)<br>
      <br>
      [0110] where [rho] water is the density of water, g is the
      constant of gravity, and V is the volume of the spherical cap
      shaped water droplet. Using simple trigonometric algebra,<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      V=[pi]/6 h(3 r drop &lt;2&gt; +h &lt;2&gt;) (eq. s1-6)<br>
      <br>
      [0111] where h can be also expressed as h=r drop (1-cos
      [theta])/sin [theta].<br>
      <br>
      [0112] To calculate the critical radius of the water droplet that
      causes clogging on a mesh surface, the radius of a hemispherical
      droplet that covers a single square grid of mesh (or r drop=D). In
      this case, the pinning force can be expressed as<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      F CAH 2 r drop[gamma] LV (cos [theta] rec-cos [theta] adv) (eq.
      s1-7)<br>
      <br>
      [0113] If the pinning force is smaller than the gravitational
      force, the droplet will be drained off the mesh, leading to a
      fresh unoccupied mesh grid for the next fog deposition cycle.
      Therefore, by equating eqs. s1-5 and s1-7, the critical radius at
      which clogging occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Once again, if the droplet is not a hemispherical cap this
      will change the precise form of eq. s1-8 but not the fundamental
      scaling r c [square root of]{square root over
      ([gamma]LV/[rho]waterg)}[square root of]{square root over (CAH)},
      where CAH=cos [theta] rec-cos [theta] adv.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Table 1 shows The values of the receding contact angle,
      contact angle hysteresis, and critical radii r e and r c for each
      surface coating, with the laboratory fog condition used in the
      humidity chamber experiment ([nu] 0 2 m/s) and a representative
      value of C D=0.7. For this airstream velocity, all four of the
      coatings show r c&lt;&lt;r e. As a result of the large values of
      [theta] rec (which lead to easy drop roll-off and low adhesion
      forces), the POSS-PEMA spraycoating (denoted PPS) shows a smaller
      value of r e than the half spacing D of most of the woven meshes
      used in the fog collection experiments, which explains the low
      collection efficiency value measured experimentally (because of
      re-entrainment of deposited water droplets back into the convected
      air stream). The liquid-impregnated surfaces initially exhibit a
      critical droplet drainage radius (r c) that is similar to the
      POSS-PEMA dipcoating (denoted PPD), but after a short period of
      operation this ultimately transitions to a value that is greater
      than the original polyolefin material (denoted PO). A micrograph
      of the POSS-PEMA spraycoated mesh is shown FIG. 12.<br>

      [0116] Time evolution of the performance of liquid-impregnated
      textured surfaces and schematic diagram of experimental setup for
      fog collection efficiency measurement<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Experimental details of the preparation of these surfaces
      are described in the Methods section. Repeated interaction with
      successive water droplets impacting and sliding along the liquid
      impregnated textured mesh surface (denoted by the label KO in FIG.
      3E, 8B) results in a progressive loss of the nonvolatile low
      surface tension liquid that is impregnated into the microtecture,
      as shown in FIG. 13, which shows the evolution of the advancing
      (dark line) and receding (light line) contact angles of water
      droplets on the liquid-impregnated surfaces. The contact angles
      were measured every three minutes while water droplets were
      released from a height of 10 mm (corresponding to impact velocity
      [nu] 0.44 m/s; We 6.7) from the inclined surfaces (45[deg.]) with
      the flow rate of 3.3 ml/min (corresponding to 70 impacts per
      minute). This leads to a steady increase in the contact angle
      hysteresis (CAH) over a period of 5 mins and the mesh openings of
      the KO-impregnated mesh subsequently start to clog.<br>
