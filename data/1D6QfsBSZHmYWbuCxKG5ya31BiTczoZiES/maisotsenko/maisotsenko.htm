      <p>Renewable Energy is advance national energy goal to change the
        way we power our homes, businesses, and cars. </p>
      <p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is the USA
        primary laboratory for renewable energy and it recommends
        utilizing the Maisotsenko Cycle for cooling applications. </p>
      <p>Atmospheric air is a clean renewable energy source, and it can
        be used for many applications, using the Maisotsenko Cycle or
        M-Cycle a revolutionary new breakthrough in thermodynamics (see
        our U.S. Patents No 6,497,10 7; 6,581,402; 6,705,096; 6,776,001;
        6,779,351; 6,854,278; 6,948,558; 7,007,453; 7,197,887;
        7,228,669; etc.). </p>
      <p>High degree of thermodynamic perfection of the M-Cycle allows
        atmospheric air to be cooled (without humidification) not the
        wet-bulb temperature, but the dew point temperature, and it
        increases psychrometric temperature difference and,
        consequently, energy resource of the atmospheric air. </p>
      <p>The M-Cycle has transitioned into the Coolerado Cooler from the
        conceptual stage to commercial applications which offers up to
        an 80% reduction of power for air conditioning of homes,
        commercial, and industrial buildings. The Coolerado Cooler has
        gained Federal recognition through the agencies of the
        Department of Energy at NREL and FEMP. Our coolers fall into a
        new category of an ?ultra? class cooler because of our extreme
        energy efficiency and ability to cool air below the wet bulb
        temperatures without compressor and CFC-ozone depletion. </p>
      <p>Today the M-Cycle assists Federal agencies reach their
        energy-use reduction goals and it has been successfully tested
        and researched for cooling applications by NREL (FEMP), Delphi,
        SMUD, PG&amp;E, Sanwa, etc. Since then, this product received
        wide recognition from all over the world: Coolerado Cooler won
        the 2004 R&amp;D 100 award, the US Green Builder 2006 Top Ten
        Product award, and just recently, the 2007 Sustainable Business
        Silver Medal of Honor award. </p>
      <p>However, this is only the first of many practical applications
        that the M-Cycle can be applied towards in reducing total energy
        consumption and pollution by increasing thermal transferal
        efficiencies (see attached 2). </p>
      <p>All of these power generation technologies can be improved
        through the M-Cycle. For instance, the M-Power Cycle enabled
        combustion engine will reduce environmental pollution from 75%
        to 95%, reduce fuel consumption by 25% to 40%, and have a
        minimum thermal efficiency of 55% (see attachment 3). Also, the
        M- Power Cycle should have many applications for increasing the
        efficiency of power systems because it utilizes the best heat
        recovery process for various forms of combustion engine. Today
        the M-Power Cycle promises better and cleaner generation
        technologies (see our U.S. Patents No 6,948,558 and 7,007,453).
      </p>
      <p>The M-Cycle is also the enabling technology around our
        prototype evaporative refrigerant condenser and is 60 percent
        more efficient than today's best condensers. </p>
      <p>The unique properties of the M-Cycle makes it the ideal
        candidate for advanced energy efficient vehicles and fuel cells,
        power plant systems and micro scale power plants, improve energy
        efficiency of buildings and solar, thermal, and wind energy
        based technologies. </p>
      <p>I believe it is a very logical step to extend the proven
        M-cycle heat and mass transfer technology towards
        environmentally-friendly and energy efficiency technologies. </p>
      <p>Please allow me a brief introduction of our companies. Idalex
        Inc. and Coolerado LLC are emerging technology firms.&nbsp; We
        have patented the M-cycle for many practical applications. </p>
      <p>The world leader in automotive thermal technology Delphi Corp.
        has since license the manufacturing right to produce the special
        heat and mass exchanger, which realizes the M-Cycle, and has
        just begun to mass-produce this product (Coolerado Cooler) for
        stationary building air conditioning, vehicular air
        conditioning, etc. </p>
      <p>I would like to meet with you and your colleagues in order to
        discuss the potential for a technology partnership in the
        pursuit of evolving breakthrough energy efficient
        products.&nbsp; I am convinced that the M-Cycle will provide
        with an opportunity for rapid development of new renewable
        energy technologies for cleaner environment and greater world.

      <p>Dr. Valeriy Maisotsenko obtained a Graduate Engineering Degree
        (equivalent to a masters degree) from the Odessa Institute of
        Refrigeration Engineering in 1963; a candidate of science degree
        in technology (equivalent to a Ph.D.) from the Odessa Institute
        of Refrigeration Engineering in 1970; and a doctor of science
        degree in technology (equivalent to a U.S. post-doctorate
        degree) from the Moscow Civil Engineering Institute in 1988. </p>
      <p>Dr. Maisotsenko is the former director of the Thermal Physics
        Research Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine. While in this capacity,
        he was recognized by the Communist government of the former
        Soviet Union as one of 11 top inventors in the USSR. This was
        the first time the Soviet Government ever publicly recognized
        any of its scientists. Dr. Maisotsenko’s efforts rewarded him
        with more than 125 heat-transfer and thermodynamics patents. </p>
      <p>In 1992, Dr. Maisotsenko immigrated to the United States of
        America and became a U.S. citizen in 1999. </p>
      <p>Dr. Maisotsenko is a co-founder of Idalex Technologies in
        Arvada, Colorado. As Idalex’s chief scientist, he has
        co-authored 12 patents for this research and development
        company. He also is the co-founder of Coolerado LLC, a company
        that is using the Maisotsenko Cooling Cycle to provide
        affordable cooling to the world. </p>

      <p>In conventional indirect evaporative cooling, the working air
        stream passes through the wet channels of the heat exchanger
        only once. This cooler air draws the heat from the product
        stream passing through the dry channels. (Artwork by Idalex) </p>
      <p>Dr. Valeriy Maisotsenko, former director of the Thermal Physics
        Research Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, brought a new
        thermodynamic cycle with him when he came to the United States
        in 1992. </p>
      <p><i>Humidity affects different air temperatures</i> </p>
      <p>To understand the Maisotsenko Cycle, or M-Cycle, it is first
        necessary to explain the thermodynamic concepts of dry bulb
        temperature, wet bulb temperature and dew point. The dry bulb
        temperature is the air temperature measured with a standard
        thermometer. </p>
      <p>A standard thermometer with a wet piece of cloth covering its
        bulb is used to measure wet bulb temperature. As air passes over
        the wet cloth, the water in the cloth evaporates, drawing heat
        out of the thermometer. The wet bulb temperature is therefore
        lower than the dry bulb temperature. </p>
      <p>Taken together, the dry and wet bulb temperatures are used to
        calculate the moisture or humidity in the air. The greater the
        difference between the two temperatures, the drier the air is. </p>
      <p>The dew point is the air temperature where moisture in the air
        begins to condense or change from a vapor to a liquid. For dew
        to collect on a surface like a glass of ice water or blade of
        grass, the surface temperature must be at or below the dew point
        temperature. The dew point temperature is always the coldest of
        the three temperatures. </p>
      <p><i>Heat exchanger key to cycle</i> </p>
      <p>Theoretically, the wet bulb temperature is the lowest
        temperature any evaporative cooling system or cooling tower can
        achieve. However, the M-Cycle is able to use indirect
        evaporative cooling technology to cool well below the wet bulb
        temperature, almost to the dew point of the incoming air.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> In the Maisotsenko Cycle, both the product and working air are
        incrementally cooled by some of the working air that is
        fractioned off to absorb moisture and heat. Because the working
        stream gets colder as it progresses through the cycle, it is
        able to draw more heat out of the product stream. (Artwork by
        Idalex) </p>
      <p>This is accomplished with a wet- and dry-channel heat and mass
        exchanger that is geometrically very different from a
        conventional IDEC component. The uniquely designed plate-wetting
        and channel system splits the incoming air stream into product
        and working (exhaust) streams. </p>
      <p>The working stream is first pre-cooled in a dry channel, then
        split again into many streams and directed into wet channels.
        The wet channels cool and saturate the working air
        incrementally, with each stream benefiting from the cooling on
        the next increment. This cycle occurs multiple times in a short
        physical space within the exchanger, resulting in progressively
        colder temperatures. </p>
      <p>The product stream travels the entire length of the exchanger
        in dry channels. Heat from the product air transfers across a
        heat exchange plate and into the colder working air and water as
        it evaporates on the working, wet side of the plate. The heat
        and moisture are then rejected as exhaust. When it enters the
        space to be conditioned, the product air has been cooled below
        the wet bulb of the incoming air with no moisture added. </p>
      <p><i>M-Cycle has many applications</i> </p>
      <p>This new thermodynamic cycle, once considered impossible by
        scientists, promises tremendous energy-efficiency gains in HVAC,
        water-cooling and power production. T he Maisotsenko Cycle is
        the foundation of the Coolerado cooler. In independent
        laboratory tests, a cooler cooled product air up to 22 percent
        below the wet bulb temperature, and to within 85 percent of the
        dew point temperature. </p>
      <p>Idalex, the company that patented the M-Cycle, is currently
        working on other applications for this thermodynamic
        breakthrough. A Maisotsenko combustion turbine is in the design
        phase and Idalex is testing the first prototype of a highly
        efficient refrigerant condenser using Maisotsenko technology. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">New Cooler Combines Comfort, Efficiency</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A revolutionary new cooling technology that delivers the
        comfort of an air conditioner with the efficiency of an
        evaporative cooler is creating a big buzz among utilities and
        energy and facility managers. </p>
      <p>Coolerado, located in Arvada, Colo., puts a 21st century spin
        on evaporative cooling. R&amp;D Magazine’s 100 Awards program
        hailed the system as one of the year’s most technologically
        significant products introduced to the world in 2004.&nbsp;
        Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Colorado
        Governor’s Office of Energy Management and Conservation have
        partnered with the company on demonstrations. </p>
      <p>“It cools as well as an air conditioner, and on a third the
        amount of electricity,” said OEMC Senior Deputy Director Ed
        Lewis. “It doesn’t have a compressor, there are no greenhouse
        gas effects and unlike a swamp cooler, it doesn’t release water
        into the air that enters the building.” </p>
      <p><i>Technology mimics air conditioning</i> </p>
      <p>Because the Coolerado cooler uses water to cool, people often
        mistakenly compare it to direct evaporative, or swamp coolers.
        The traditional, refrigerant-based air conditioner is a more apt
        comparison. </p>
      <p>The unit draws fresh outside air from the supply side. A heat
        and mass exchanger removes the heat from the product air similar
        to the way an air conditioner cools the air stream with
        refrigerant-filled cooling coils. </p>
      <p>Both the Coolerado Cooler and the conventional air conditioner
        reject heat into the atmosphere outside the building. The AC
        rejects heat as hot air, while the Coolerado unit rejects it as
        water vapor. Swamp coolers add moisture to the air and do not
        reject heat. </p>
      <p>Unlike conventional AC units, the Coolerado uses no
        ozone-depleting chemicals and has only one energy-consuming
        component—the fan. Setting the Coolerado apart from traditional
        indirect evaporative coolers are a unique wetting system, a heat
        and mass exchanger made of unusual material and the way the air
        flows through the modular HMX. “The heat and mass exchanger is
        what does most of the work, like the engine of the car,” said
        company President Rick Gillan. </p>
      <p>The HMX is made of plastic-coated, cellulose blend fiber in a
        geometric design that cools both the product and working air
        streams. This cascading incremental airflow creates a new
        thermodynamic cycle called the Maisotsenko Cycle after Dr.
        Valeriy Maisotsenko who discovered it. Dr. Maisotsenko is a
        partner in Idalex Technologies, Coolerado’s parent company. </p>
      <p><i>Consumer demonstrations show promise</i> </p>
      <p>Gillan estimates that more than half the world’s cooling
        applications could benefit from a Coolerado system. “This
        product helps from both the power consumption and power
        production sides.” </p>
      <p>Coolerado’s first commercial demonstration with the OEMC and
        Mount St. Vincent Home in northwest Denver illustrated the
        cooler’s consumer value. A project team installed a model C676
        on the roof of the attic above the school’s computer lab in
        2003. The unit cooled the poorly insulated, century-old building
        to 74 degrees using 80 percent less power than an air
        conditioner. </p>
      <p>SMUD Project Manager Dave Bisbee met Idalex representatives at
        an evaporative cooling meeting where he was sharing his
        utility’s experiences with an indirect/direct system. “The
        technology has been fraught with problems,” he said. “I told
        vendors that IDECs won’t take off until the reliability
        improves.” </p>
      <p>Gillan considered that a challenge and offered SMUD a Coolerado
        system to test. “We decided to test the Coolerado at a school
        that has been experiencing chronic problems with their IDECs.
        They had nothing to lose,” said Bisbee, “and if it works, the
        school has the option of replacing all of its IDEC units with
        Coolerados.” </p>
      <p>SMUD’s Customer Advanced Technologies Program sponsored the
        replacement of an IDEC on a Sacramento school with the Coolerado
        in August 2004. The first thermal measurements were impressive,
        but the true test will be a full cooling season, said Bisbee.
        “We’re cautiously optimistic,” he admitted. “We would like to
        see a unit work reliably for three or four years." </p>

      <p>Coolerado's Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of 40 has been
        independently verified, and is obtained by using a 21st century
        thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>Other companies touting a SEER at 19.50* as the highest
        efficiency air conditioners available use technology developed
        in the 1800s. </p>
      <p>Uses 80 Percent Less Power and No Chemical Refrigerants </p>
      <p>Atmospheric air is a clean renewable energy source, and it can
        be used for many applications, using the Maisotsenko Cycle or
        M-Cycle a revolutionary new breakthrough in thermodynamics (see
        our U.S. Patents No 6,497,10 7; 6,581,402; 6,705,096; 6,776,001;
        6,779,351; 6,854,278; 6,948,558; 7,007,453; 7,197,887;
        7,228,669; etc.). </p>
      <p>High degree of thermodynamic perfection of the M-Cycle allows
        atmospheric air to be cooled (without humidification) not the
        wet-bulb temperature, but the dew point temperature, and it
        increases psychrometric temperature difference and,
        consequently, energy resource of the atmospheric air. </p>
      <p>The M-Cycle has transitioned into the Coolerado Cooler from the
        conceptual stage to commercial applications which offers up to
        an 80% reduction of power for air conditioning of homes,
        commercial, and industrial buildings. The Coolerado Cooler has
        gained Federal recognition through the agencies of the
        Department of Energy at NREL and FEMP. Our coolers fall into a
        new category of an ?ultra? class cooler because of our extreme
        energy efficiency and ability to cool air below the wet bulb
        temperatures without compressor and CFC-ozone depletion. </p>
      <p>Today the M-Cycle assists Federal agencies reach their
        energy-use reduction goals and it has been successfully tested
        and researched for cooling applications by NREL (FEMP), Delphi,
        SMUD, PG&amp;E, Sanwa, etc. Since then, this product received
        wide recognition from all over the world: Coolerado Cooler won
        the 2004 R&amp;D 100 award, the US Green Builder 2006 Top Ten
        Product award, and just recently, the 2007 Sustainable Business
        Silver Medal of Honor award. </p>

        The within invention improves on the indirect evaporative
        cooling method and apparatus by making use of a working fluid
        that is pre-cooled with and without desiccants before it is
        passed through a Wet Channel where evaporative fluid is on the
        walls to take heat and store it in the working fluid as
        increased latent heat. The heat transfer across the membrane
        between the Dry Channel and the Wet Channel may have dry, solid
        desiccant or liquid desiccant and may have perforations, pores
        or capillary pathways. The evaporative fluid may be water, fuel,
        or any substance that has the capacity to take heat as latent
        heat. The Wet Channel or excess cooled fluid is in heat transfer
        contact with a Product Channel where Product Fluid is cooled
        without adding any humidity. An alternative embodiment for heat
        transfer between adjacent channels is with heat pipes. </p>

        The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
        providing enhanced indirect evaporative cooling of air, water,
        fuel, or other fluids while controlling the humidity. The design
        makes cooling down to the dew point possible without energy
        input other than the energy to produce the fluid flow needed.
        The design makes use of stacked composite plates (7) with
        channels (1, 2) for fluid flow between adjacent plates. On
        opposing surface areas of these plates, there are wet areas (4)
        or dry areas (3). The wet areas (4) provide cooling by
        conventional evaporation which is in turn used to cool the
        fluids in contact with the dry areas (3). The benefit is
        controlled heat transfer, which allows selected cooling of fluid
        flow such that the temperature as low as dew point are
        reachable. </p>

        A fuel cell using fuel and oxidant resulting in the production
        of water and heat in addition to electrical power. The fuel cell
        employs an evaporative cooler and has methods to adjust the
        moisture and temperature for the fuel and oxidant flows to
        improve the fuel cell efficiency. The water produced by the fuel
        cell is used to provide the water for wet channels of the
        evaporative cooler. The evaporative cooler has separate product
        channels and dry working channels that are cooled by heat
        transfer across a heat exchanger plate. The heat exchanger plate
        forms part of each wet working channel on the wet side of the
        heat exchanger plate and part of the product channel and the dry
        working channel on the dry side. The fuel passes first through
        the dry working channel then the wet working channel becoming
        humidified by the evaporation therein and cooling the heat
        exchanger plate before going to the anode of the fuel cell. The
        oxidant is cooled by passing through the product channel before
        being directed to the cathode. In another embodiment, the
        evaporative cooler is incorporated with the fuel cell and is
        formed by an anode separator, with the fuel flowing by a dry
        side of the heat exchanger plate of the anode separator that is
        being cooled by the evaporation on the wet side. The evaporation
        adding moisture to the fuel as it passes by the wet side and the
        heat exchanger plate cooling the fuel on the dry side. </p>

        channel. The first counterheat channel is joined to the first
        main flow channel for receiving a cooled primary stream

        first main channel splitting the primary stream therefrom. An
        evaporative coolant is injected into the first counterheat
        channel, and an evaporative saturant is injected into the second
        counterheat channel. Heat from the initially hot primary stream
        in the first exchanger evaporates the coolant in the first
        counterheat channel for self-cooling the primary stream in the
        first main channel. Heat from a hot secondary stream channeled
        through the second main channel evaporates the saturant in the
        second counterheat channel for adding mass to the primary stream
        channeled therethrough. </p>
