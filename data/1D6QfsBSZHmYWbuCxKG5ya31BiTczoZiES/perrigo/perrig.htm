            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo's invention
                eventually was exposed as an apparent fraud, at least in
                part, but there is still some valid question whether it
                might have actually worked as claimed. The storage
                batteries that were found hidden in the demonstration
                car might have served a legitimate purpose (i.e., a
                buffer system, as in many other devices), but apparently
                didn't. It is certain, however, that Perrigo had
                something unique; his device lit bulbs with a clearer
                light than normal electricity (Like E.V. Gray &amp;
                Moray), and the power could be transmitted over fine
                wires without meltdown. While the automobile
                demonstration was dubious, he also demonstrated a
                handheld unit that obviously worked as claimed. Perrigo
                also demonstrated the device before a federal judge and
                patent commissioners in the House of Representatives in
                1917. Would he have dared to fake such a presentation?
                Only an attempt to replicate the device based on his
                patent application will resolve the question. Here are
                all the newpaper factoids I have been able to accumulate
                (Thanks especially to the Kansas City Public Library
                "Vertical Files").</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Excerpt</b> from
                unidentified reference (probably by Dan Davis):</font> </p>
            <p>&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1926, Harry
                E. Perrigo claimed to have discovered a method to tap
                the energy from atmospherics. He even had a car which he
                converted to run on electricity that was generated in
                his "etheric wave accumulator". He applied for a patent
                December 31, 1925, with serial number 78,715 being
                assigned. Perrigo's patent application is considered a
                classic in patent law and is listed under the
                classification of "Perpetual Motion Machines &amp; Other
                Impossible Inventions".</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Despite the patent
                Office's attitude toward Perrigo's invention, there were
                a number of reputable people who claimed to have
                witnessed his device in action producing useable
                electric power.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The existence of
                electromagnetic radiation, the modern term, or electric
                waves in the ether as it used to be called was known by
                Hertz, a research scientist who discovered the
                photoelectric effect in 1887. Atmospherics, an
                electrical disturbance in the atmosphere, were known to
                produce noises in the early radio telegraph stations,
                some being strong enough to drown out the received
                signal. Perrigo deduced that here was a possible source
                of electrical power. All that was needed was a method of
                transforming the existing radiation into useable energy.
                He claimed to have developed a mechanism to intercept
                and collect from the "general ether field electric wave
                energy", and to transform it into useable electromotive
                force.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The basic method he
                used was an antenna arrangement which collected and
                resisted the incoming energy and raised it to a high
                enough current level where it could be run through a
                special electrical transformer to further intensify the
                available power.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo's antenna was
                derived from his experiments with various wire shapes,
                sizes and arrangements. One of his more successful
                attempts was to partially pound 100 roofing nails into a
                board 10 x 10 array and wrap very fine wire around each
                nail, making it a small electromagnet. Then by trial and
                error approach he connected the ends of the
                electromagnets to other nails in such a way that there
                was a maximum voltage between the wire and the nail. His
                patent application mirrored this electrical connection
                scheme in a more refined electromechanical approach.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two accumulator plates
                were made with 100 round protruding knobs in a 10 x 10
                square array. The accumulator plates were then
                sandwiched together with an insulator material between
                them. The insulator had 100 holes matching the
                protrusions on the plates. Placed in each hole was a
                special coil wrapped around a bundle of wires. Once the
                accumulator plates were sandwiched, a measurable
                electrical voltage existed between points AA and BB on
                plates 1 and 2, respectively. A very complicated
                transformer was attached to these two points. The plates
                were set on top of the transformer and Perrigo claimed
                this arrangement enhanced the energy accumulation
                process.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have no idea of what
                materials the plate or protrusions were made. The patent
                drawing would lead one to believe they are the same
                material. It could be a metal [lead has been mentioned,
                or galena] or a non-conductor such as wood or a
                combination. The protrusions were connected by the same
                wiring scheme previously mentioned for the roofing nail
                model. The connections were different for the two
                plates.</font> </p>

                constant current of 1500 volts down an aerial resembling
                a wireless mast, it is claimed. Anyway, he is lighting

                stood in the rain nearly 200 years ago with a string of
                a flying kite in his hand. Franklin discovered that
                electricity was in the air.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Harry E. Perrigo, by
                night and by day, stands in the little workshop behind
                his home at 2511 Park Avenue and imprisons electricity.
                Franklin did not know what to do with his wonderful
                discovery. He did not realize how wonderful it was. But
                Perrigo lives in an age when electricity has been made
                to work and he knows what to do with the energy he takes
                from the very atmosphere itself.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo has caught the
                wild voltage in the air: has caught and tamed it. He
                keeps it in a little box for everybody to use in
                lighting houses, or running automobiles or machines or
                street cars, heating homes, cooking or primping with

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just what is in that
                little box is a mystery. It is kept sealed, air tight,
                but no wires communicate with it from without.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo has perfected
                the invention enough, he says, that it is ready for
                general use.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"All that would be
                necessary for one to obtain electricity for domestic
                purposes", he explained, "is to install this little box
                where the customary electric meter is placed at home.
                Connect the wires in the house with the box on either
                side and there you will have it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You can get any
                amount of electrical voltage you desire by using the
                required kind of transformer. You could get enough
                voltage from the air through that box to light any
                reasonable number of electrical lamps -- say a hundred
                or more -- and the current costs nothing. It is as free
                as the air from which it comes.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Success Crowns His
                  Efforts ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It would take an
                expert electrician to tell just how Perrigo tames the
                electric currents from the air, and then it probably
                would not be told in language which could be understood
                by the ordinary individual.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo, more than a
                year ago, concluded through experiments that there is
                free electricity in the air. For months he spent his
                waking hours in work and study until one night success
                crowned his efforts.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He caught the
                energizing element. But he caught it with his bare
                hands, and paid the penalty by being rendered
                unconscious from the shock. Since then Perrigo has
                devoted all his time to improving his discovery and to
                make it an item in the industrial and home lives of the
                universe.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His experiments have
                been attended by constant danger. Frequently he receives
                the full force of the heavy voltage he is attempting to
                control. He has made his more delicate tests recently
                only in the presence of physicians. Not infrequently has
                the pulmotor been brought into use in order to save his
                life. But Perrigo always goes back to his work.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Has Implicit Faith
                  In Device ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some day, Perrigo
                says, that little box of his is going to revolutionize
                the production of energy for transportation as well as
                for domestic use. When he tells of his faith in the
                device it is not hard to believe that his success is
                probable.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo has bright red
                hair and his every movement is characterized by some
                seemingly hidden force, as though the electricity with
                which he works and plays has become a part of him. All
                his working life Perrigo has been an electrician and has
                been accustomed to handling high voltages.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And Mrs. Perrigo,
                enthusiastic and balancing, is largely responsible for
                her husband’s success. It is from her that the hard,
                everyday practical suggestions come while her husband
                sits among his coils and transformers and testing
                boards, dreaming out some new phase of the work. Mrs.
                Perrigo suffers too.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some days she fears,
                the pulmotors may not prevail. Some day the monster with
                which her husband wrestles may overcome him. That’s why

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But Perrigo, absorbed
                in his work, often forgets, and then -- a blue flame in
                his hands, a splutter and a pop and the inventor gets a
                shock that sometimes makes him unconscious.</font> </p>

                there. He has done what he determined to do. He has
                caught electricity from the air. Others, of course, have
                generated it, but Perrigo takes only that which nature
                has made.</font> </p>

                1917. He was mentioned during a discussion ofHouse Joint

                wanted Congress to grant him exclusive rights beyond
                those granted by Patent Law. His invention later was
                proved to be impossible, based on erroneous
                interpretation of gyroscope physics. Perrigo

                ways to attain "free energy".]</font> </p>

                purpose of the resolution, which by direction of the
                Committee on Rules I have called up, is to provide for
                the consideration, under the general rules of practice
                of the House, of House joint resolution 174, Calendar
                No. 77, entitled "Joint Resolution for the purpose of
                promoting efficiency, for the utilization of the
                resources and industries of the United States, for
                lessening the expenses of the war, and restoring the
                loss caused by the war by providing for the employment
                of a discovery or invention called the 'Garabed',
                claiming to make possible the utilization of free
                energy"...</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Borland: A hearing
                was had yesterday morning on an invention by a man named
                Perigo [sic], who claims to have invented a machine to
                collect electricity by free energy; that is, to collect
                it from the energy of the air. In other words, his
                invention is based on the idea, as I gather it, that
                electricity can be collected from the air, where it must
                be collected, by some other means than by the force of a
                dynamo.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, if this is true
                --- and I am not enough of a scientist to know --- there
                may be many devices that are patentable for doing that
                particular thing, or applying that particular principle.
                If Mr Giragossian has a device for utilizing free
                energy, his device or machine or appliance is
                patentable, but the principle of free energy evidently
                is not patentable under the existing law. Anybody else
                who produces a better machine for utilizing free energy
                is just as well entitled to use it for the benefit of
                mankind as the man who first obtains the patent on it.
                In other words, we cannot foreclose that principle.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, we have got a
                machine here in the Capitol --- I undrstand from Judge
                Romjue a few minutes ago that the machine which Mr
                Perigo had demonstrated before the Patent Committee had
                been brought over here. It was shown to the Patent
                Committee. It is in a small box. I have seen it. I would
                not know anything about it. It runs a dynamo or motor,
                and it lights certain lights. In other words, there is
                some power in that box. What that power consists of I
                have no means of knowing. The inventor says it contains
                free energy. In other words, this device has been
                brought to a state of completion. It is in actual
                working order.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, it does seem to
                me that this bill ought not to be passed at all unless
                it provides that this committee of scientists shall not
                only have the power but it shall be charged with the
                duty of ascertaining whether or not this device of Mr
                Giragossian utilizes the same principle of free energy..</font></p>

                water, and nothing has come from it? You may be right to
                be a skeptic. But the years Harry E. Perrigo, 3000
                Michigan Avenue, has spent inventing and perfecting the
                little machine in the wooden case entitle him to the
                attention of the public, especially his neighbors in
                Kansas City.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The dream outlined
                above will be true within a year, Mr Perrigo declares.
                It will be realized by his invention, he says, a device
                he calls the Perrigo.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo is an
                electrical engineer, educated in the Massachusets
                Institute of Technology. More than 10 years ago, while
                working in a power plant in Pee Dee, SC, he touched a
                wire, "dead" so far as any connection with any source of
                power was concerned, and found it charged with
                electricity. His idea came then.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If a wire, suspended
                in air, gathered atmospheric electricity, why couldn't
                that electricity be accumulated, condensed and converted
                into power?</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Telling his own story,
                Mr Perrigo said he kept the idea in mind constantly,
                thinking out devices, drawing sketches. He explained it
                to Mrs Perrigo, and talked over plans with her. She was
                enthusiastic, as any good wife would be, without any
                definite idea of what it was all about.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then one night, early
                in 1915, came the inspiration to act. Mr Perrigo lived
                at 2511 Park Avenue at the time. Stores and shops were
                closed, but with two or three strands of copper wire
                from the basement, with two embroidery hoops from Mrs
                Perrigo's work basket, with a leaf from the dining room
                table, with the bread box from the pantry, with a sheet,
                torn into strips, with shingle nails and paraffin, Mr
                Perrigo, with Mrs Perrigo's aid, made his first "free
                energy" device. And it worked.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before noon the next
                day, he said, electric lights were burning and a small
                electric motor was running from the power developed in
                the crude tangle of wires on the Perrigo dining room
                table.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The neighbors came in
                to see. Among them was Dr Bert McDowell, a dentist with
                offices at 4301 Main St.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I couldn't believe my
                eyes", Dr McDowell said the other day. "I had to be
                convinced, because the thing was there in plain sight
                and I knew Harry wasn't getting his power from outside,
                because his house was not even wired for electricity. He
                used gas for lights."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Yes", Mr Perrigo put
                in, "I was so fascinated with the thing I had made that
                I kept that little motor running constantly for two
                weeks. It buzzed and hummed and rattled frightfully, and
                gave my wife a headache, but she didn't complain, and I
                kept it going."</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo's story
                from that point on is one of five years of patient,
                unending work to perfect the Perrigo. It is one of long
                days and nights of toil, of sickness, failures, lack of
                money, the hooting of unbelievers, organized opposition,
                the hearty cooperation of a real helpmate.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Perrigo basement
                is piled high with coils and plates of many sizes and
                shapes, steps in the evolution of the present compact
                design, which, Mr Perrigo says, with the patents
                virtually proved, is ready for manufacture on a
                commercial basis.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the pile, Mr
                Perrigo dug out the other day a board, 12 inches square,
                an inch thick, both faces covered with shingle nails,
                set a half inch apart, each extending an inch out of the
                board.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each nail was wound
                tightly with silky fine copper wire, smooth spirals one
                atop another. The wires led from one nail to another,
                some from top to base, some from top to top, some from
                base to base, each wire soldered carefully in place.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Mrs Perrigo did all
                that for me", Mr Perrigo said. "She worked until long
                after midnight many nights. The job took weeks to
                complete. Then the thing wouldn't work. It's just one of
                a lot of experiments we put time and money into, only to
                find it was not the right thing."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From his first crude
                machine, Mr Perrigo, in his search for perfection,
                evolved may different types. At first he worked on the
                idea of an aerial to gather energy. A workshop he fitted
                up was strung with a network of wires. The wall was
                driven full of nails wound with copper wire.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The machines I made
                out there did the work", Mr Perrigo said, "but they were
                bulky and bunglesome and got out of order easily.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Other things than
                getting rid of bulk bothered me, too. My early machines
                were affected by passing air currents. Power would
                increase when I fanned the machine or when a person
                walked past it, and decrease when the atmosphere was
                calm.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The machine I have
                now gives a steady flow of current, whether in the
                basement, 14,000 feet in the air, in a motor car or on a
                fast moving train. The copper pegs in the wooden block
                do that."</font> </p>

                of only four parts: two lead plates, a wooden block and
                a coil of copper wire. The coil that Mr Perrigo says
                will deliver 500 horsepower is 10 inches across, 4
                inches high, of solid copper. Fine copper wire is wound
                smoothly about neat rows of copper stays, hardly larger
                than a toothpick, but longer, as long as the coil is
                high. The wire is connected in many devious ways. In
                those connections is the secret of the mysterious power.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The lead plates for
                this size Perrigo are a foot square. On each plate are
                100 spring coils of copper wire, spaced in rows, an inch
                apart. The plates appear identical, but are different in
                the way the connections of hair-like copper wire run
                from one coil to another.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wooden block is a
                foot square, also, and an inch thick. One hundred copper
                plugs run through the block, spaced just as the coils on
                the lead plates are spaced. Each plug is a bundle of
                copper stays, making a contact.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That is all there is
                to the Perrigo, so far as anyone can see. Complete, the
                500 horsepower size weighs 87 and one-half pounds. There
                are no moving parts.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Perrigo to operate
                an ordinary size motor car need be no larger than a
                1-pound coffee can", Mr Perrigo said. "A size to provide
                all the current needed to heat and light a 5-room house
                will go into the can. The different sizes can be made to
                furnish any desired voltage, and either direct or
                alternating current, by a slight change in the wiring."</font>

            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Inventor
                  Explains It ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Trying to avoid
                technical terms, difficult business for an engineer, Mr
                Perrigo explained his invention this way:</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The device is a
                generator as truly as the power-driven rotary generator
                in any power plant. Those generators don't actually
                'make' electricity. They condense it from the air. So
                does the Perrigo. But it does it through the system of
                wiring, rather than revolutions through a magnetic
                field. I get my starting point from the air by breaking
                up the ether waves. The coils on the lead plates do
                that. I know why they do. It's the way they are
                connected, one from the other. That's my secret.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"They do break up the
                ether waves, gathering electricity and conducting it
                into the big coil underneath. That's the generator. Its
                size and the way it is wired determines the voltage, the
                horsepower. Outgoing wires from this coil take the
                'juice' where you want it and it is there when you want
                it."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo has great
                plans for his electric 'chore boy' and great faith in
                it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It will replace every
                other source of power, light and heat", he predicts. "It
                means the doom of the steam engine, the end to coal
                mining, to the cutting of timber for fuel. It means
                petroleum will be used only for lubrication. It means
                smokeless, sootless cities. It means chimneys will
                disappear from housetops. It means cheap power for the
                farmer, the reclamation of much country that cannot be
                irrigated now because power is not available."</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What Other Persons
                  Think ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo is able to
                impart his faith to others, too. The enthusiasm of
                persons who have seen the device work is second only to
                that of Mr Perrigo himself.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">S.W. Fries, an
                electrical engineer, and district sales manager here for
                the Economy Fuse and Manufacturing Company, saw the
                Perrigo first about three months ago.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When I heard about
                the machine through Dr McDowell, I told him it couldn't
                be done", Mr Fries said the other day. "I've been
                converted. I don't know how it works, but it does. Its
                possibilities are too big to grasp. Its use will mean a
                new age in industry. I believe Mr Perrigo will be the
                most widely known inventor in the world as soon as his
                device comes into general use, and he will become one of
                the world's most wealthy men, just from returns which
                already seem assured."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Mr Perrigo gets
                enough electricity from somewhere to knock him
                unconscious", Dr O.W. Butler (3700 Benton Blvd) pointed
                out. "I've been called to his house many times in the
                last four years to revive him, and once I carried him
                out of his basement. He has worked at his experiments as
                long as four days and nights without sleep --- worked
                until his health is broken and his constitution is a
                bundle of jagged nerves."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"How are you going to
                manufacture your machine and get it on the market?" Mr
                Perrigo was asked when he asserted there was no stock
                for sale and he was seeking no financial aid.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Responsible backers
                are furnishing all the money I need for experiments,
                models for the patent office and other work I'm doing
                now", he answered.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As soon as one final
                amendment to my patent application is approved I'll be
                ready to permit motor car manufacturers to make the
                Perrigo in their own plants, charging them a small
                royalty on each machine. They will be eager for it when
                they see what it is. This will provide funds enough in a
                short time for my associates and myself to being to
                manufacture the machines for home use.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We don't expect to
                sell the Perrigo. We will lease them on the same plan
                the telephone companies use for their machines, charging
                a monthly rent, probably about $3 for a 5-room cottage
                size. That's cheap enough, isn't it, for all heat and
                light and power?</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I've always said I

                that it will not be necessary for the householder who
                desires the Perrigo installed to buy an expensive
                electric furnace, electric range or any special
                equipment.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A gas range can be
                wired through the pipes which now carry gas", he said.
                "It will be necessary only to replace the gas burners
                with electric heating plates and install snap switches
                where the gas valves are now. A furnace can be fitted in
                the same way, by removing the grate. No change will be
                necessary with the lights. The new machine will be
                installed where the meter is now. That's all."</font> </p>

                Perrigo was asked.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"No", he answered,
                "Each one will be sealed, just as the electric meter is
                sealed. To break the seal will put it out of order and
                the subscriber will have to call for a 'trouble' man.
                Anyway, if a man would take one apart he couldn't put it
                back together again without my drawings and blueprints.
                That's my secret and I'll keep it."</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Demonstration ~</font></b>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a visitor
                expressed a desire to see a machine actually produce
                light or power or heat, Mr Perrigo acquiesced. He went
                to the basement and returned almost immediately, bearing
                a boxlike affair, mounted on a little platform. A small
                electric motor, light sockets and switches were on the
                platform. The top of the box was glass. Through it Mr
                Perrigo pointed out parts of the machine inside.</font>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo fastened
                the loose ends of two wires that extended from the box
                to the connection posts of the motor and pushed a switch
                button. The motor started at once. The inventor said he
                had not changed the machine or even opened the box,
                which was closed with screws since he made it five years

                  Star</i>: "In your paper of January 15 there appeared
                a wonderful story relating to the invention of Harry E.
                Perrigo, an electrical engineer of Kansas City, of a
                device to generate electrical energy.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"One got the
                impression from reading the story that Mr Perrigo's
                device was a demonstrated success, that it had been
                patented, and that he was practically ready to permit
                its manufacture as a source of power.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It was a whale of a
                story and interested me, for it seemed if it were true
                that his device was destined to have as far-reaching
                influence on the human race in the future as the grain
                binder and the gas engine had had in the past.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I wrote to various
                publications devoted to mechanics and electricity,
                seeking further information. None knew anything about
                it. One said no such device had been patented, another
                that a vast amount of research and experimentation had
                been done in an effort to develop such a device and that
                the only result had been failure.</font> </p>

                if Mr Perrigo's device has been patented and if he is

                convincing way."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The story of Mr
                Perrigo's invention was printed in the Star as the
                record of an ambitious and interesting enterprise. The
                apparent success of the device was vouched for by
                persons who had seen the machine in operation and were
                convinced it produced the results Mr Perrigo claimed for
                it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Questioned recently as
                to new developments, Mr Perrigo said there could be no
                new mechanical developments.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The machine has been
                developed to a state as near perfect as I can make it,
                for two years", he said. "I am waiting for the patent
                office to take final action. My applications have been
                approved and investigation has shown no conflicting
                patents on record. The rest is simply a matter of

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A motor car was driven
                40 miles an hour in Kansas City yesterday on power drawn
                from the air.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A device making this
                feat possible was demontrated after years of rebuffs and
                failures by its inventors, Harry Perrigo, 1116
                Bennington Avenue, in the presence of Col, Paul
                Henderson, Chicago, vice president of the National Air
                Transport Inc., air mail contractors.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is the greatest
                invention since the stone age", was Col. Henderson's
                comment.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lou E. Holland,
                president of the Chamber of Commerce, who saw the
                demonstration with Col. Henderson, was enthusiastic over
                the invention and said he believed it would have a great
                effect on public utilities if it can ever be brought
                into general use.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device consists of
                a plate 14 inches square which, by a multiple
                arrangement of connected copper coils, it was explained,
                attracts electric current from the air.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electricity thus
                trapped passes through a generator and to a regular
                direct current motor, which was connected to the
                transmission shaft of the car.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo has been
                working on the device more than 10 years. Three years
                ago he suffered a nervous breakdown and has been back at
                his workshop only two months.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While photographers
                focused their cameras, Mr Perrigo and his wife entered
                his roadster in which the device was installed. He
                turned a switch and the motor hummed.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventor sat
                silent, listening. Then he threw in the clutch gently.
                The car moved away with only the sound of the cogs,
                whining softly as they meshed. He threw it into high and
                sped away.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the corner of 10th
                Street and Bennington Avenue, near his home, he stopped
                the machine while movie cameramen ground their machines.
                Then he backed it and turned around, stopping in the
                middle of the street.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later Mr Perrigo took
                the car out for a spin. It breezed along at 40 miles an
                hour.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I could make it go
                100 miles an hour just as easily", the inventor
                remarked, "if it were not for the danger of hurting
                someone."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The total weight of
                the motor, generator and controls is about 86 pounds,
                according to the inventor. In the rear of the car are
                reduction coils, because the device is five times too
                powerful for the work of pulling the car, Mr Perrigo
                said.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The proper motor for a
                Reo car will not weigh more than 30 pounds", he said.
                "The motor to run a Chevrolet will weigh not more than
                10 pounds. An airplane motor would weigh around 50
                pounds, and with that motor the air traveler could go
                around the world without waiting."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Col. Henderson walked
                around the machine, inspecting it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"What it would mean to
                my airplanes", he said, "--- no weight for motors, no
                space for gas, no motor trouble."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Like other spectators,
                he had difficulty in believing what he saw.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The work of bringing
                the invention to its present state of development has
                been the story of a lone man working with the unknown,
                usually meeting with discouragement.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Congress Wouldn't

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Five years ago, the
                inventor took one of his electric motors to Washington,
                set the boxlike contrivance on the speaker's stand in
                Congress and ran a motor and five lights with it. They
                called it an infernal machine.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even now, when he is
                seeking patents for his invention, the patent office
                refuses to believe the principles he advances are
                possible.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The machine has been
                taken up in an airplane 10,000 feet and it operated the
                same as if it were on the ground", Mr Perrigo said. "It
                has been tried out in hot places and cold places."</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He pictures it as
                power for every purpose --- the farm, the factory, the
                office, doing away with coal, gas, cost of water power
                and the cumbersome weight of engines.</font> </p>

                practical.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Holland, Mr
                Henderson and newspaper men Saturday witnessed a
                demonstration in which Mr Perrigo drove a motor car on
                electric power generated from the air.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is too early yet
                to talk to manufacturing the invention", Mr Holland said
                yesterday. "The patent rights must be perfected in both
                the United States and foreign countries. Also, it must
                be made clear that nothing will be done to demoralize
                present power manufacturing."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo's invention
                is the result of more than 12 years labor on the part of
                the inventor.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Twelve years ago I
                conceived the idea that the generation of power from
                ether waves was possible, while I was employed ion the
                power plant at Pee Dee, NC, where some wires not
                connected with anything that was 'live' seemed to be
                generating power", Mr Perrigo said yesterday.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After more than a
                year of experimenting I finally produced light in a bulb
                about the size of those used in flash lights. Now in my
                laboratory I light three 300 watt globes from a wire no
                larger than the thread which holds the button on a man's
                overcoat.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Three times in my
                experiments I was knocked unconscious because I did not
                know how much power it would generate.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The invention has
                been tested under all conditions. It has been strapped
                to the running board of a locomotive running between
                Kansas City and Chicago, it has been tested in an
                airplane at a height of 12,000 feet. It will generate
                power anywhere that air circulates.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"With the invention
                every home will have its own power plant and all the
                electricity needed for any purpose can be provided at a
                roughly estimated cost of $5 per month.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Kansas City
                Public Service company, for instance, could afford to
                install these plants because they would eliminate the
                enormous overhead which is the principal expense of such
                companies."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both Mr Perrigo and Mr
                Holland made it plain that the invention will not be
                permitted to upset the electrical world. No one will be
                given exclusive rights of its use, they said.</font> </p>

                manufacturer can use the invention who will pay the
                royalty fees", Mr Perrigo explained. "No one will be
                permitted to 'hog' the invention and no one can purchase
                it and shelve it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I have no doubt that
                it will bring me more money than Mrs Perrigo and I will
                need to supply our simple wants and I want humanity to
                benefit.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I want to see rural
                sections which have remained barren because it cost too
                much to pump the water to irrigate them, spring into
                bloom. I want to see the smallest farm house in the most
                isolated places with its electric lights and stoves; in
                other words, I want humanity to benefit."</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The supply of
                petroleum is limited", he answered. "There are 30 other
                purposes to which petroleum products can be turned, so
                the oil producers will not suffer."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Can you explain your
                invention so that the non-technically trained can
                understand it?"</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That would be
                difficult, especially without divulging information that
                is now in the patent office; besides, the generation of
                power always is difficult to explain.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Electric generators
                have been used in power plants for a great many years.
                We all know what you have to do to make a generator and
                we all know that electricity is its product but we don't
                know very much about what really is going on inside that

                The device supplied power in such quantity that it had

                from dry areas that cold be irrigated with this free

            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electricity Always
                  In Ether ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As near as a layman
                can understand, Mr Perrigo's theory is the revolution of
                the earth sets up a form of electric currents that are
                forever present in the ether. His theory is to capture
                those electrical impulses in very much to same way that
                a radio antenna picks up the programs broadcast from
                WDAF. Instead of a machine to turn the radio impulses
                into music, Mr Perrigo has a machine to turn the ether's
                electrical store into controlled power. He declares it
                is really no more mysterious than the fact that an
                electric dynamo picks electricity out of the air,
                although the dynamo must have a power to revolve it
                while his device sits perfectly still and seemingly
                produces many fold more electricity than a dynamo of the
                same bulk.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Demonstrating the
                different nature of this electricity, Mr Perrigo showed
                how high voltage could be transmitted over hair-size
                wires and light a series of electric lamps although a
                sufficient power of the well known electricity to light
                those lamps would have melted the small wires
                immediately.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Clearer Light Than
                  Usual ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And it imparted an
                unusual glow to the electric lamps, giving them a clear
                brilliancy with none of the effervescent haze that
                surrounds the wires in a lamp when lighted with ordinary
                electricity.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo has spent
                years on his invention. Years ago he conceived the idea
                that there was an unlimited source of electricity in the
                air that could be harnessed with a collector. He has not
                reached the present measure of success without a row of
                hard knocks along the way.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In whatever
                neighborhood he has lived since moving here 15 years
                ago, it has been common knowledge that Mr Perrigo was
                the frequent victim of electric shocks that often came
                near proving fatal. He has been revived by pulmotors
                time and again.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first model of his
                device was constructed with makeshift material. A leaf
                from Mrs Perrigo's dining room table was the basis, with
                the bread box used, sheets torn up and the strips
                shellacked to be used for insulation. But as junky as it
                was, it operated a small motor, and that original model
                is still preserved and used a s part of his
                demonstration.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sickness Delayed
                  His Work ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1922 he got the
                device to such a point of perfection that he went before
                Congress and defeated a war-time measure that proposed
                to give 17-year rights to another person for a blanket
                patent on all free energy devices.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then three years of
                sickness came, and the invention progressed slowly. Mrs
                Perrigo is not electrically inclined, but she has
                carried forward the experiments under his direction and
                has always been his assistant.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo is not
                offering stock for sale and says he has made all
                necessary arrangements for financing the device when it
                is ready for manufacture.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">H.E. Perrigo, a
                nervous, red-haired little electrician, stood last nigh
                among a confused display of strange devices in is
                basement workshop at 1116 Bennington Avenue. He was
                still a bit haggard from an illness of three years, but
                is energy, dynamic as that which his devices "pick out
                of the air", was unabated. Mr. Perrigo had just returned
                from a conference with Lou E. Holland, president of the
                Chamber of Commerce.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There are no
                batteries in this room", he said. "There are no light
                and power wires. There is nothing but these unconnected
                accumulators you see before you."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On an old kitchen
                chair stood an object about one and one-half feet
                square, several inches thick. It appeared to consist of
                two parallel metal squares, separated and held together
                by numerous pegs woven around which was a maze of thin
                copper wires. It stood on edge, resting against the back
                of a chair. On the seat of the chair was a round
                metallic object, resembling, at a glance, a huge spring,
                a foot and a half in diameter, from an alarm clock. In a
                mechanical sense it was in no way similar. But it might
                as well have been an alarm clock spring, for all Mr.
                Perrigo would tell of its construction. The first object
                was the collector, the second the generator.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Neither had any moving
                parts. They have no wheels. They are immobile, simply an
                arrangement of wires. On the to edge of the flat box was
                a switch. Thence ran two wires, connected with
                forty-five 100-watt standard electric light bulbs.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Perrigo pulled the
                switch. There was no arc as the contact was made. The 45
                bulbs flashed brightly and burned with a steady white
                glow. There was never a flicker. He turned 44 lights
                off, leaving one. It did not flicker as the 44 lights
                went off and on.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This little device,
                the Perrigo Electric Accumulator", said Mr. Perrigo,
                will light 8,000 bulbs as easily as it lights one. I can
                build one of any size, to produce the results that any
                amount of dynamo electricity will produce."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He picked up a little
                narrow box, in the top of which was a pane of glass,
                through which one might see more pegs, more intricate
                wiring. He connected a small electric fan to the poles,
                and the fan whizzed.</font> </p>

                yet", he said. "Some think I am picking up leaking
                electricity. This free energy device has been tested at
                an altitude of 12,000 feet, on the sea, on deserts,
                everywhere except in a submarine. Everywhere it runs
                smoothly, without fluctuation".</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In his Reo roadster he
                had a large motor mounted, the one he demonstrated

                Commerce, and Col. Paul E. Henderson, general manager of
                the National Air Transport, Inc. Mr. Perrigo crawled
                into the seat, threw a switch, and a big all-speed
                motor, standing in the place of the gasoline engine,
                roared.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Rheostat control",
                said Mr. Perrigo. "It will run at all speeds. I do not
                need clutches".</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There were two
                "mystery boxes" in the car, one of which picked the
                electricity out of the ether, the inventor explained,
                another which regulated its intensity.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It will be on the
                market in the near future", Mr. Perrigo said. "I cannot
                say more at this time. It will be manufactured by a
                Kansas City company.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We do not intend to
                harm the men who produce electrical current by other
                means. Perhaps they will manufacture and distribute the
                little units. The can do it gradually, so there will not
                be a sudden, destructive revolution. That is bad
                economy. There is to be no monopoly. But eventually
                there will be a unit in every home. There are no moving
                parts. A unit will last a lifetime".</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The germ of the
                invention, Mr. Perrigo related, came to him 15 years ago
                in Pee Dee, NC, when he was employed in an electric
                power plant.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"All of the dynamos
                were off", he said. "I was working on a dead one. I
                encountered some hot wires. Yet there was no juice being
                produced. It gave me an idea. Three years later I began
                developing it. I have worked on it since at odd times.
                About 8 or 9 years ago I began intensive work on it. I
                demonstrated it experimentally in 1922. Now it is
                perfected. I want the world to know it is a reality".</font>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I'm so glad it's all

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "energy from air"
                device demonstrated Saturday by H. E. Perrigo when he
                seemingly operated a motor car with electricity taken
                from the free air, got almost as much attention today
                when investors bobbed up from all corners of the city
                and told of having bought shares in his device as far
                back as 14 years ago.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So many tales of
                investing as much as $10,000 in Perrigo's hope came to
                light today that the state blue sky commissioner and the
                Better Business Bureau began an investigation.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Investors Are
                  Interviewed ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Several of the
                investors in Perrigo's device were interviewed by those
                agencies.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the investors
                talked to were of the opinion that Perrigo was
                impractical as an organizer, to say the least, and that
                they had been swindled on a gigantic fake or that
                Perrigo really had some great invention, but was
                unnecessarily slow in commercializing it.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preston T. Stockard,
                blue sky commissioner, said after talking to a few of
                the investors that he would demand a showing of the
                merit of the apparatus, and would question Perrigo as to
                his financing plans, preparatory to issuing a "stop
                order" against any more sales of stock.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Perrigo said at the
                demonstration Saturday that he was selling no interest
                or shares in his invention and that he had met expenses
                while experimenting by doing outside electrical work.
                Mrs Perrigo, however, said their financial problems had
                been met by "occasional financing as is always done".</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As far back as 5 years
                ago, a group of persons who had invested met and
                discussed the possibility of prosecution for the share
                sales or of taking some action to get control of the
                device away from Perrigo and find out whether it really
                had any merit.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No One Could See
                  Machine ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even persons who had
                given him money for a share were refused an opportunity
                to investigate the machine, and the whole investigation
                was dropped at that time.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the publicity
                resulting from his demonstration Saturday brought those
                investors to the front again today.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is not one in
                the lot who has seen demonstrations of Perrigo's
                devices, and all are convince that he has some radical
                departure from known devices, even though it might not
                be the revolutionary thing he believes he has.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They were given
                demonstrations at the time they put in $1,000, in some
                instances, more usually $2,000 and as much as $10,000 in
                two known cases.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Those persons said
                today the demonstration Saturday differed from previous
                demonstrations only in that a motor car was operated,
                seemingly with more power.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In one instance, that
                of Mrs Blanche Casey, the complaint was made that
                Perrigo's device was being used for no other purpose
                than to obtain a constant income of subscriptions. She
                and her late husband had $2,000 invested, getting in
                return a contract agreeing to give them 1% of whatever
                capital was issued when the device was marketed.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That contract was made
                in 1920. Mrs Casey said today she would be glad to take
                $1,000 for her contract because she was convinced
                Perrigo was incapable of commercializing his invention,
                even though it is all he says it is.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs Casey said she and
                Dr James F.A. Casey, later to become her husband, were
                in the motor car business together at that time and that
                they went with a mutual friend to Perrigo's house for a
                demonstration.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Little Change in
                  Seven Years ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">She told of the
                details of the demonstration and they were identical
                with most of the demonstration Saturday, which was seven
                years later. Mrs Casey said her husband became
                enthusiastic and desired to invest, but Perrigo refused
                to accept any subscription, declaring he had all the
                money he needed.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At that time he told
                them, she said, of getting the idea for the device from
                an old man with whom he had been friendly and that just
                before the aged friend died he passed the secret on to
                Perrigo.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As they drove away
                from Perrigo's home, the inventor rode with them, and
                suggested that it would be "a dirty trick not to let Dr
                Casey in on it", so let them have 1% for $2,000, first
                pledging them to secrecy.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs Casey said that a
                short time afterward Perrigo came to Dr Casey and
                herself, offering another 1% share for $25. That created
                suspicion and they investigated among their friends,
                finding many others had bought shares and had been sworn
                to secrecy as they had been.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs Casey said the
                decision she and her friends reached was that Perrigo
                most certainly did have some unusual electrical device,
                but that his failure to put it on a commercial basis
                must mean that it was really what it was set up to be.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, she said, they
                attempted to investigate and learn whether some
                commercial use could be made of whatever Perrigo did
                have, but that line was balked by his refusal to let
                anyone investigate.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs Casey offered her
                contract for perusal today, expressing willingness that
                it should be published so other investors could make
                comparison.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Her contract:</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This agreement made

            </p>

                and the balance to be paid in monthly payments of two
                hundred and fifty ($250) dollars each, to be paid on the
                20th day of each succeeding month thereafter, up to and
                including the 20th day of September, 1920, the first
                party will issue to the second party an amount of the
                capital stock, no matter what the capital stock may be.
                That is to say, that the second parties shall receive
                only one percent (1%) of said capital stock by reason
                and virtue of this contract.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. It is clearly
                understood and agreed, however, that said first party
                shall not be liable for damages to second parties in the

                the fact that said two thousand ($2,000) dollars is but
                a small consideration to be paid for the rights granted
                herewith, therefore, it is understood and agreed that in

                  Call ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another instance of an
                investor buying after one demonstration was that of a
                Chicago physician, Dr Louis Lyn Wall, who put $2,000 in
                for stock when he went with a friend to call at the
                Perrigo home.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The very first
                investor was George Breting (701 W. 32nd St). Mr Breting
                said he put money into the deal as early as 1913. His
                contract, he said, was different from the one given Mrs
                Casey, in that it specified Perrigo should use the money
                for living expenses, experimental work and anything
                necessary in developing the device.</font> </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Breting Not
                  Dissatisfied ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Breting was not
                dissatisfied with his investment. He expressed
                confidence that Perrigo actually has something that was
                revolutionary and that he was moving toward a patent and
                commercialization as rapidly as possible.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A conference of a
                group of investors in the project some time ago to
                attempt something that would speed up action was
                mentioned by Mr Breting, but the movement was dropped
                when it was found Perrigo did have an application of
                some sort in the patent office.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A rough estimate of
                the amount of stock sold that he knew about was made by
                Mr Breting and put the figure at $30,000 to $40,000. The
                blue sky commissioner was able to name several
                stockholders that were strangers to Mr. Breting,
                however.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No one of the
                investors was able to estimate what percent his total
                valuation of the device has been sold already by Mr
                Perrigo, and the varying percent of his valuation he
                gave for a given amount of money would make it
                impossible to make a reasonable calculation.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another thing coming
                to light today as a result of the publicity attending
                the demonstration was a shadow of question thrown on the
                instances in which Perrigo told of being shocked into
                insensibility while experimenting with his device.</font>
            </p>
            <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Told of Hysteria
                  Swoon ~</font></b> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A physician who has
                attended him several times told today f an instance when
                Perrigo was standing on the street and fell in a swoon,
                becoming rigid. It required several hours to revive him.
                Later on the same physician attended him after on of the
                shocks received while experimenting and found Perrigo's
                condition to be identical with the "acute hysteria"
                swoon.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the
                shareholders in the device expressed the intention today
                of going into court to force a showdown on the
                development of the device. The plan tentatively outlined
                was to ask the court for a receiver for the device,
                setting up a minority stockholders' plea of
                mismanagement and undue delay.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, it was pointed
                out, a cold-blooded businessman could submit the device
                to competent electrical engineers and find out whether
                it was revolutionary or a monumental fake. It was also
                pointed out that even though the entire think should
                turn out to be a fake, there must be something
                electrically unusual in its construction --- a powerful,
                new type of storage battery, a method of storing
                electrical energy in wires, a device for picking up
                electricity from outside sources, or what not --- and
                that principle might be put to commercial use to repay
                the money invested.</font> </p>

                wages of $40 a week for 10 months and bought materials
                for the experiments. In all, he estimated he spent
                $5,000.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He withdrew after
                Perrigo constantly evaded a test of his machine by

                on the machine at the laboratory at my home", Mr Pitt
                said last night. "I think that if Perrigo is sincere he
                should submit the machine to an analysis of experts in
                electricity. In the 10 months I dealt with him, I was
                unable to get a demonstration from which I could form an
                opinion or prove anything. I built three or four
                machines under his supervision."</font> </p>

                made in my laboratory", he continued. Perrigo went to
                the Irving-Pitt company and Mr Irving became interested
                in the idea. He turned it over to me with instructions
                to find out whether there was anything in it. I entered
                into a contract with Perrigo to build the machines in my
                laboratory. I agreed to pay him $50 a week salary and
                buy materials for him. This was to go on until the
                device was perfected and fit for a demonstration. I
                think our contract terminated when I quit paying
                Perrigo.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I tried repeatedly to
                get a demonstration of the machine. Once while I was
                away, Perrigo demonstrated it for Mrs Pitt and my son.
                But when I wanted a demonstration, the model was burned.
                Perrigo explained that something went wrong and it was
                short-circuited.</font> </p>

                yesterday afternoon when the Star, the better Business
                Bureau and the blue sky commissioner of Missouri
                launched an investigation of H.E. Perrigo's fantastic
                device for drawing electricity from the air,

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The whole fake turned
                out to be nothing more than small but powerful storage
                batteries cunningly concealed in the upholstering of the
                car, with a mass of complicated wire coils lending
                mystification.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus the invention
                took its place with the rubber fenders and the

                persons were found who had poured all the way from

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The actual cracking of
                the Perrigo bubble came in the midst of what was
                supposed to have been an electrical test of his device,
                forced on Mr Perrigo immediately by authorities
                insisting on a scientific test, while Perrigo
                insistently was demanding a delay of a few days.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It came when an
                inquiring reporter for <i>The Star</i> pushed his arm
                down into the framework and upholstering at the back of
                the seat, wormed the hand as far as it would go into the
                depths and found the familiarly shaped connections used
                on storage batteries.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo became
                violently excited, pouncing on the investigator and
                fighting to prevent the disclosure of the storage
                batteries he had vehemently denied existed.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then the battery men
                who had sold Perrigo the batteries, identified the
                product and, by electrical tests, proved to themselves
                the current Perrigo was putting into his motor was

                shouting in broken words, Perrigo still insisted his
                "free energy" device was the thing that furnished the
                power and that the batteries had nothing to do with it.</font>
            </p>

                and the method by which he had developed it was found to

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They told how Perrigo
                ordered the battery built specially, and demanded that
                it be strong enough so that at the end of an hour's
                constant use it still would be delivering 30 amperes at
                110 volts. That much current, they said, was enough to
                operate a motor car at any speed to which it was geared,
                for several hours.</font> </p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You put on a public
                demonstration of a device Saturday and have been selling
                stock in that device. Now we have learned you have
                bought a battery that could have been used to furnish
                the power you say you get from the air. There is a
                possibility of crooked work there and you must show us
                that battery or I will have you arrested here and now."</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo quailed at the
                word "arrest".</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It's out of my
                possession. It is not in my house. It is not in my car.
                It's out of my possession."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then he was told that
                he must tell where the battery went from his possession
                so it could be traced down and the possibility of fraud
                cleared up.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I gave to a junk
                man", he blurted.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The battery men
                interrupted to ask why he would give a new battery to a
                junk man instead of returning it for repurchase, which
                would have been done at only a 10% loss.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I didn't know you
                would do that", he argued, but could not explain such
                ignorance of electrical trade practice when he had spent
                his life with electricity.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The questioning then
                veered to the sale of shares. Perrigo denied at first
                that he had ever sold any shares or stock.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then one of the
                contracts given to a "customer" in 1920 was exhibited to
                him and he admitted he had sold such shares.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Stockard told him
                the preliminary investigation indicated he might have
                sold as much as 200% of the invention, and he admitted
                he could not supply a list of those to whom he had sold.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nor could he fix any
                price per unit at which he had sold. Some investors had
                paid $2,000 for a 1% share in whatever profit the device
                ever brought, others got 1% for $1,000 and one instance
                is known where he offered 1% for $25 at a time when
                business was not so good.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From shares the
                quizzing went back to the question of the storage
                battery. Every person in the room knew Perrigo was far
                from the truth when he had insisted he gave it to a junk
                man.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Several propositions
                were made to him whereby he could demonstrate that the
                "free energy" propelled motor car did not get its
                strength from that concealed battery.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was outlined
                clearly to Perrigo that he must accept one of the
                propositions or leave the room to face arrest.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo was hard to
                pin down to listen to any one of the proposals. He had
                one of his own.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I will fix up that
                car without a body on it", he said. "There will be
                nothing but the chassis, the motor and the accumulator.
                You can drive it anywhere and as long as you want to.
                All the secret connections will be inside of one-half
                inch pipes and I will trust you not to open them."</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo was pressed
                "to the wall" on that proposition.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You are only stalling
                for time", he was told.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He was offered a
                proposition that the car be submitted to a rigid search
                for the batteries; with the guarantee that the body and
                upholstering would be restored to perfection.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That proposal,
                however, repeated over and over, was ignored by Perrigo
                and he kept countering with a pleas for a delay in the
                test.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then the battery men
                announced they could make an electrical test of the
                current operating the motor in Perrigo's car that would
                prove conclusively whether it was being operated by
                batteries.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They proposed to
                connect instruments that would measure the amperes and
                the voltage, then run the motor for a period of time. If
                the power was coming from the battery, the power would
                decline steadily as the battery was drawn on. If it was
                really "divine power", then there would be no let-up in
                the current.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo weakened on
                that offer and showed signs of willingness to submit to
                such a test.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the cleverness he
                thought was going to pull him through that test was met
                by science on the part of the battery men.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo's idea was to
                run the motor idle. He told in detail why it was not
                geared to go out on the streets and pull hills to show
                it under power. But the battery men volunteered to set
                the brakes until it showed a certain amperage going
                through, then they could estimate the length of time
                required to show a decrease in the battery.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo objected to
                wearing out his brakes, but when a brand new set of
                brake linings were promised to him his last excuse was
                gone, and besides, the group was tiring of his evasions.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The entire group moved
                from Mr Holland's office to the Perrigo home at 1116
                Bennington Avenue. They gathered at the back door of the
                home where the "free energy" propelled car was stored in
                a basement garage. Perrigo went inside, leaving the
                others waiting outside.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was a lapse of
                an hour. Just why Perrigo was hesitating could not be
                deducted by those waiting.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally Perrigo sent
                Mrs Perrigo to the back door and called for Mr Holland
                to come inside. At last Mr Holland reappeared and
                announced he had convinced Perrigo the test must
                proceed, but Perrigo had asked that all persons be
                barred from the basement except those who were present
                in Mr Holland's office downtown.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first test was a
                test of one of the battery men. Perrigo took him to one
                side and asked him to be easy in making the test.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is a new
                machine", Perrigo pleaded, "and if you're to hard with
                me it will destroy my chances."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then he went back to
                the car and objected to the electrical testing devices
                which the battery men had brought from their plant. The
                trademarks of reputable manufacturers were shown on each
                of the devices and all were shown to be scaled.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next it became a
                question of connecting them in the right places. Perrigo
                actually was unable to show the men which were the
                proper wires, creating the doubt that he had been doing
                the real electrical work in his fakes and that he might
                have had an accomplice to do the work, while he features
                the sale of stock, the demonstrations and the ballyhoo.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After much sputtering
                of the wires, a test was obtained on the voltage going
                into the electric motor and it was found to be exactly
                that of the battery sold to Perrigo.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another device was
                about to be connected in, when it became necessary for
                Perrigo to go upstairs to answer the telephone.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While he was gone, the
                reporter for <i>The Star</i> lifted the lid of the
                little compartment built at the top of the seat back. A
                large crack was exposed, opening into the space behind
                and beneath the toolbox. His arm was pushed in sideways,
                then by reaching far down into the open space there his
                hand came in contact with a dumbbell-shaped connection
                such as is used on ordinary batteries in motor cars.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A battery man was
                called and he reached into the hole. His report was that
                the entire set he had sold was there.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then Perrigo returned,
                but not in time to find anyone searching for his
                batteries.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He was asked whether
                there was any battery about his car.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There is not", he
                answered emphatically.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then he was told about
                the batteries found in the concealed space and denied
                that such was true.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>The Star</i>
                reporter reached to uncover the battery and Perrigo flew
                at him in a rage, attacking the investigator. Perrigo
                was pushed back and the disclosure continued.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Electric Storage
                battery men then made a thorough investigation of the
                battery and pronounced it to be the identical battery
                they had sold him two days before the big stock selling
                demonstration and which he said he "had given to a junk
                man".</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The battery was
                disconnected and the "divine power" machine would not
                even start the motor. The battery men picked up their
                instruments to leave.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Do you say this car
                is run by those batteries", Perrigo shouted at them.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"No, we do not", one
                of them answered. "But we do say those batteries have
                plenty of power to do all you have done with this car
                and that they furnish the identical line voltage that is
                coming into the motor."</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perrigo then went into
                the jabbering and chattering stage, insisting the car
                was "run just as it was Sturday" and declaring the
                "world was missing something".</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The test came to an
                abrupt conclusion, with electricians and investigators
                shame-faced that they had been fooled at all by such a
                crude fake.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And those who had read
                Perrigo's claims that he would free them from all
                drudgery with free and unlimited power, cut off their
                fuel and ice and lighting bills, drive motor cars and
                trains and ships and airplanes without cost or upkeep,
                were given the sad news of another dream gone "blooey".</font>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Be it known that I,
                Harry E. Perrigo, a citizen of the United States,
                residing at Kansas City, in the county of Jackson and
                State of Missouri, have invented a certain new and
                useful Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and
                Transforming Ether Electric Energy, of which the
                following is a complete Specification.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The existence of
                electric waves in the ether has been shown by Hertz.
                Electric disturbances in the atmosphere known as
                "atmospherics" are known to produce noises in the
                telephones of wireless, telegraph stations which in some
                cases drown the signals being received. Ether wave
                electric potential is also recognized in various forms
                which are known to cause disturbances in the normal
                operation of electric transmission and telephone
                systems. These forms of electric wave possess potential
                energy, or capacity for doing work and are commonly
                described as a peculiar state or stress of a medium
                called</font> <br>
              <font face="Times New Roman,Times">ether.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The waves used in all
                known systems of utilizing ether waves, as for example
                in wireless telegraphy, are Hertzian waves artificially
                propagated by means of electrical apparatus.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Except when manifest
                as a force in electrical disturbances, the existing
                ether waves with an unknown potential heretofore have
                never been intercepted or collected and transformed into
                forms of electric energy suitable for doing useful work,
                previous to my invention and discovery of a method and
                apparatus for the same. By my invention electric power
                or energy is obtained for all purposes with out expense
                other than that of my method and apparatus involved and
                hereinafter described, for receiving and transforming
                this electric energy.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention as
                premised has for its objects:</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First; To intercept
                and collect from the general ether field electric wave
                energy and to transform said electric energy into a form
                of a distributable, measurable, electromotive force.</font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Second; To raise the
                potential of these collected electric waves to a
                pressure sufficient for applying said waves to practical
                uses.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Third; A method of
                intercepting and transforming an electromotive force
