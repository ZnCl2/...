    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      Remember those song birds we used to hear in the fields? The
      sounds of animals in nature singing a symphony of soft and subtle
      sounds as all things flow together to create a living and vibrant
      concerto? Science is now showing that these sounds actually do
      influence the growth of plants. Researchers have demonstrated that
      plants respond to sounds in pro-found ways which not only
      influence their overall health but also increase the speed of
      growth and the size of the plant.
      <p>Many people remember hearing in the late 1960's and 1970's
        about the idea that plants respond to music. There were lots of
        projects in high schools and colleges which successfully tested
        the effects of sound on plant growth. It was determined through
        repetitive testing that plants did respond to music and sound.
        The first book which brought this idea to most of us was: The
        Secret Life of Plants, by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird
        (Harper &amp; Row 1973). In this best selling book a number of
        astounding revelations about plant growth were revealed. The
        idea that plants were influenced by sound in both positive and
        negative ways was demonstrated by several world class scientists
        at that time. </p>
      <p>When we think of plants being affected by sunlight we are
        really looking at the effect of a portion of the electromagnetic
        spectrum on plants ­ that portion which includes visible light.
        It should not surprise us that sound also impacts plant growth
        because it is, in essence, an extension to other parts of the
        electromagnetic spectrum. </p>
      <p>The science was first disclosed in an article by Andy Coghlan
        which appeared in New Scientist (May 28, 1994, p.10). The
        article confirmed old ideas by placing them in a scientific
        context. It tells an excellent story about the impact of sound
        on plant growth, bringing to light what was before considered
        esoteric or mysterious science. After reading this short article
        and those which follow in this issue of the Flashpoints a good
        deal more will be thought of "singing gardeners" and "plant
        communicators." </p>
      <p>Many people remember reading accounts of plant growth being
        stimulated by sound waves. At that time, "talking" to plants and
        playing plants different types of music was used to influence
        growth. A number of people were using these techniques without
        being able to completely explain the phenomena. This article is
        part of that story ­ a story which could have a profound impact
        on the way we grow and produce our food. </p>
      <p>Eccentrics who sing to their plants? People playing melodies to
        organic matter with the expectation that it will help stimulate
        growth? These ideas were the thoughts of some "non-scientists"
        until French physicist and musician, Joel Sternheimer,
        discovered the mechanism for how plants respond to the
        stimulation of sound waves. Sternheimer composes musical note
        sequences which help plants grow and has applied for an
        international patent1 covering the concept. </p>
      <p>The sound sequences are not random but are carefully
        constructed melodies. Each note is chosen to correspond to an
        amino acid in a protein with the full tune corresponding to the
        entire protein. What this means is that the sounds sequenced in
        just the right order results in a tune which is unique and
        harmonizes with the internal structure of a specific plant type.
        Each plant type has a different sequence of notes to stimulate
        its growth. According to New Scientist, "Sternheimer claims that
        when plants "hear" the appropriate tune, they produce more of
        that protein. He also writes tunes that inhibit the synthesis of
        proteins." In other words, desirable plants could be stimulated
        to grow while undesirable plants (weeds for instance) could be
        inhibited. This is done with electromagnetic energy, in this
        case sound waves, pulsed to the right set of frequencies thus
        effecting the plant at an energetic and submolecular level. </p>
      <p>Sternheimer translates into audible vibrations of music the
        quantum vibrations that occur at the molecular level as a
        protein is being assembled from its constituent amino acids. By
        using simple physics he is able to compose music which achieves
        this correlation. Sternheimer indicated to New Scientist that
        each musical note which he composes for the plant is a multiple
        of original frequencies that occur when amino acids join the
        protein chain. He says that playing the right notes stimulates
        the plant and increases growth. This idea is particularly
        interesting because it may lead to the eventual obsolescence of
        fertilizers used to stimulate plant growth. This new method
        would be cheap and relatively easily provided throughout the
        world, thereby avoiding many of the problems associated with the
        extraction, shipping, environmental and economic costs of
        chemical fertilizers. </p>
      <p>Playing the right tune stimulates the formation of a plant's
        protein. "The length of a note corresponds to the real time it
        takes for each amino acid to come after the next," according to
        Sternheimer, who studied quantum physics and mathematics at
        Princeton University in New Jersey. </p>
      <p>In experiments by Sternheimer, he claims that tomatoes exposed
        to his melodies grew two-and-a-half times as large as those
        which were untreated. Some of the treated plants were sweeter in
        addition to being significantly larger. The musical sequences
        stimulated three tomato growth promoters, cytochrome C, and
        thaumatin (a flavoring compound). According to Sternheimer in
        the New Scientist, "Six molecules were being played to the
        tomatoes for a total of three minutes a day." </p>
      <p>Sternheimer also claims to have stopped the mosaic virus by
        playing note sequences that inhibited enzymes required by the
        virus. This virus would have harmed the tomato plants. </p>
      <p>The note sequences used by the inventor are very short and need
        only be played one time. For example, the sequence for for
        cytochrome C lasts just 29 seconds. According to Sternheimer,
        "on average, you get four amino acids played per second" in this
        series. </p>
      <p>The inventor also issued a warning for those repeating his
        experiments. He warns to be careful with the sound sequences
        because they can affect people. "Don't ask a musician to play
        them," he says. Sternheimer indicated that one of his musicians
        had difficulty breathing after playing the tune for cytochrome
        C. </p>
      <p>Plant stimulation by sound may have profound implications. The
        idea that a cheap source of "electromagnetic fertilizer" has
        been developed should be exciting for many third world
        countries. At a time when human progress can be made through
        simple solutions in agriculture, resources are being wasted in
        the extraction of mineral and oil compounds for fertilizers. If
        this method of fertilization were followed the human intellect
        would prove superior to physical capital in terms of
        distribution and production of this new technology. </p>
      <p>The idea that sound can have a healing effect on humans is
        being explored by a number of independent scientists around the
        world. The know-ledge of the "sound effect on proteins" offers
        insights to health practitioners of the benefits to humans. In
        addition to the favorable economic factors, the increased
        vitality of the plant substances can positively impact the
        health of all humans that consume them. </p>
      <p>The patent includes melodies for cytochrome oxidase and
        cytochrome C which are two proteins involved in respiration. It
        also includes sound sequences for troponin C which regulates
        calcium uptake in muscles. Further, a tune was developed for
        inhibiting chalcone synthase which is an enzyme involved in
        making plant pigments. </p>

        Abstract --- There is provided a method for determining the
        musical notes associated with an amino acid sequence, the
        musical periods of the sequence, the lengths of the notes, and
        the tone quality of the notes through the retroaction of the
        whole set of amino acids and using that information to regulate
        the biosynthesis of the protein. The amino acids that build a
        protein emit a signal of quantum nature at a certain frequency.
        Following the properties of this signal, the frequency is
        transposed into a musical note. This discovery has numerous
        applications since one can then deduce from the amino acid
        sequence of a protein a sequence of notes composing the melody
        that will act to stimulate or inhibit its synthesis inside an
        organism, wherefrom one can in addition delimit its biological
        functions. </p>

      <p><b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
        patent application, Ser. No. 08/347,353 filed Dec. 1, 1994. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention is directed to a method of
        regulating protein biosynthesis. More particularly, the
        invention is directed to a method for epigenetic regulation of
        in situ protein biosynthesis and its use in agronomy and health.
      </p>
      <p>[0003] Demonstration of the musical properties of elementary
        particles suggests an important role for the scale at which the
        phenomena happen. (J. Sternheimer, C. R. Acad. Sc. Paris 297,
        829, 1983). For example, it is known that the physical existence
        of quantum waves associated to particles propagate themselves
        not only in space-time, but also in that scale dimension, thus
        linking together successive levels of the organization of
        matter. (J. Sternheimer, Colloque International "Louis de
        Broglie, Physician et Penseur", Ancienne Ecole Polytechnique,
        Paris, Nov. 5-6, 1987). These waves allow an action of one scale
        onto the other, between phenomena that are similar enough to
        constitute, in a mathematically well-defined sense, harmonics of
        a common fundamental tone. (See J. Sternheimer, Ondes d'e'chelle
        [scaling waves], I. Partie Physique; II. Partie Biologique.
        Filed at Academie des Sciences (Paris) 1992 under seal no.
        17064). </p>
      <p>[0004] The theoretical reasons for the existence of scaling
        waves makes them appear as a universal phenomenon whose function
        is at first to ensure coherence between the different scales of
        a quantum system, and that especially takes shape and can be
        described in the process of protein biosynthesis. The peptidic
        chain elongation effectively results from the sequential
        addition of amino acids that have been brought onto the ribosome
        by specific transfer RNAs (tRNAs). When an amino acid, initially
        in a free state, comes to affix itself to its tRNA, it is
        stabilized with respect to thermal agitation --while keeping a
        relative autonomy because it is linked to the tRNA by only one
        degree of freedom--for its de Broglie wavelength to reach the
        order of magnitude of its size. This stabilization gives the
        amino acid wave properties. </p>
      <p>[0005] Interference between the scaling wave associated to the
        amino acid and those similarly produced by the other amino
        acids, results in a synchronization, after a very short period
        of time (which can be evaluated to be about 10.sup.-12.5
        second), of the proper frequencies associated with these amino
        acids according to one and same musical scale, which more
        precisely depends upon the transfer RNA population. However, to
        within the approximation of the chromatic tempered scale, this
        scale appears universal due to the very peculiar distribution of
        amino acid masses which is already very close to it. </p>
      <p>[0006] The scaling wave phenomenon appears in a more explicit
        way when the amino acid carried by its tRNA fixes itself onto
        the ribosome. It is at this moment that the stabilization with
        respect to thermal agitation becomes such that the wavelength of
        the amino acid outgrows its size by a full order of magnitude.
        The scaling wave which then emits interferes, at the scale of
        the protein in formation, with similar waves previously emitted
        by the other amino acids. This interference draws constraints of
        a musical type for the temporal succession of the proper
        frequencies associated to these waves, so that the scaling waves
        continue their itinerary and insure coherence and communication
        between different levels of the organism. For example, the
        succession of these waves minimizes the dissonance (harmonic
        distance) and the frequency gaps (represented by melodic
        distance) between successive amino acids. Additional properties
        imply the existence of periods of minimization of harmonic
        distances showing punctuations in the temporal succession of
        frequencies which other levels will complete with correlations
        all the more rich and marked that they themselves are more
        numerous to influence the protein synthesis. The result is the
        prediction that proteins possess, in the very succession of the
        proper quantum frequencies associated to the sequence of their
        amino acids, `musical` properties all the more clear and
        elaborate that their biosynthesis is more sensitive to
        epigenetic factors in general. Conversely, it must be possible
        to act epigenetically, in a specific way for each protein onto
        that biosynthesis. </p>
      <p>[0007] The observation of protein sequences confirms that all
        proteins possess musical properties in the sequence of their
        amino acids and these properties are all the more developed that
        those proteins are, in a general way, more epigenetically
        sensitive. (Data from M. O. Dayhoff, Atlas of protein sequence
        and structure, volume 5 and supplements, N.B.R.F. (Washington)
        1972-78). In addition, the acoustic transposition of the series
        of proper frequencies corresponding to the production of scaling
        waves in phase with the elongation of a given protein,.shows a
        stimulating action onto the biosynthesis of this protein in
        vivo, and in a correlative way it has an inhibiting action for
        scaling waves in phase opposition. </p>
      <p>[0008] In the case of animals having a nervous system the sound
        wave is transformed into electromagnetic impulses of the same
        shape and frequency right from the starting point of the
        auditory nerve. These impulses, by virtue of the scale
        invariance of scaling wave equations applied to the photon
        (which generalize Maxwell's equations), have a direct action, by
        scale resonance, on their quantum transpositions. Because the
        squared quantum amplitudes are proportional to the number of
        proteins that are simultaneously synthesized, the resonance
        phenomenon results, in the case of scaling waves in phase, in an
        increase of the rate of synthesis, as well as a regulation of
        its rhythm, and in the case of scaling waves in phase
        opposition, in a reduction of this rate. (cf. P. Buser and M.
        Imbert, Audition, Hermann diteur, Paris, 1987). Among plants,
        the sensitivity to sounds is visible through interferometry and
        the scaling waves behave theoretically in a similar way. </p>
      <p>[0009] The solution to the scaling wave equation, which
        effectively shows the existence of scaling waves having a range
        close to Avogadro number, anticipates similar properties for the
        scaling waves drawn from the spatial distribution of amino acids
        (whose de Broglie wavelength is then comparable to their size)
        inside the protein after it has been synthesized. The solution
        then provides a range approximating the square root of that
        number. The observation of their tertiary structures confirms
        the existence of harmonies within vibratory frequencies of amino
        acids spatially nearby inside proteins (and especially at their
        surface, as can be expected from their wavelength). An
        appreciable stabilization of the effects obtained with the use
        of the musical transpositions is then observed using colored
        transpositions of these spatially distributed frequencies. </p>
      <p>[0010] The present invention is drawn from these observations.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0011] The method of the invention comprises determining the
        musical notes associated with an amino acid sequence, the
        musical periods of the sequence, the lengths of the notes, and
        the tone quality of the notes through the retroaction of the
        amino acids and using that information to regulate the
        biosynthesis of the protein. </p>
      <p>[0012] Stated in another way, the amino acids which build a
        protein emit a signal of quantum nature at a certain frequency.
        Following the properties of this signal the frequency is
        transposed into a musical note in such way that playing back the
        melody of a protein will stimulate or inhibit its synthesis.
        This discovery has numerous applications since deduction of the
        amino acid sequence of a protein provides a sequence of notes
        composing the melody which will act on its synthesis inside an
        organism. Thus, by diffusing to a plant the music of a protein
        which plays an important role in flowering, more flowers are
        produced. </p>
      <p>[0013] Stated more scientifically, the method of this invention
        uses the regulating action on the biosynthesis of proteins by
        scale resonance of transpositions into sound of temporal
        sequences of quantum vibrations associated with their
        elongation. This action may be an increase of the rate of
        synthesis or a reduction of this rate, depending upon whether
        the modulation of the vibration frequencies used is in phase
        with, or in phase opposition to the elongation. This is true for
        the quantum vibrations as well as for their transposition into
        sound. The result is further stabilized by the actions, again
        through scale resonance, of colored light transpositions of
        grouped quantum vibrations arising from the spatial conformation
        of proteins issued from this elongation. </p>
      <p>[0014] This method applies in a specific way to every protein
        of known structure. Its use is all the more appropriate when the
        synthesis of this protein is even more dependent upon epigenetic
        factors, that is to say external to the DNA of the system to
        which it belongs, and especially in the present case, upon
        acoustic and electromagnetic factors. In addition, the method
        uses the determination of metabolic agonisms and antagonisms of
        these proteins due to scale resonance phenomena naturally
        associated with their biosynthesis. The characterization of
        these proteins in their associated metabolic subsets is another
        feature of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0015] The identification of proteins designed to be regulated
        as part of a given application includes other criteria a
        correspondence between acoustic and electromagnetic phenomena or
        which effects can be observed on living beings and the
        transposed proteic sequences. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0021] The present invention will now be described more fully
        hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
        which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This
        invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and
        should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth
        herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this
        disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will convey the
        scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>[0022] There is provided a method of regulating protein
        synthesis in situ, using a musical sequence corresponding to the
        amino acid sequence of a protein through the decoding and
        transposition into sound of a temporal series of quantum
        vibrations associated with the elongation of the amino acid
        chain of the protein. The method of regulating protein synthesis
        in situ requires at least the following steps: the sequence of
        musical notes is determined; the period appearing in the
        molecule is determined; the period is rectified, if necessary;
        the rhythmic style is checked through the distribution of the
        bases of DNA; and the tone quality is determined. </p>
      <p>[0023] <b>Determining The Sequence Of Musical Notes</b>. The
        sequent of music notes associated with the amino acid chain of a
        protein is determined by associating a musical note with each
        amino acid. More specifically, within the approximation of the
        tempered scale a universal code for the stimulation of protein
        synthesis is obtained. That code is: </p>
      <p>[0024] Gly=low A; Ala=C; Ser=E; Pro Val, Thr, Cys=F; Leu, Ile,
        Asn, Asp=G; Gln, Lys, Glu, Met=A; His=B flat; Phe, as well as
        SeC=B; Arg, Tyr=sharp C; Trp=sharp D </p>
      <p>[0025] which are deduced from the notes of the code by taking
        the notes of the chromatic tempered scale which are symmetrical
        to those of said keynotes with respect to central G. </p>
      <p>[0026] There is another code for inhibition, which is deduced
        from the preceding code by symmetrization of the logarithms of
        the frequencies around their central value: </p>
      <p>[0027] Trp=C; Arg, Tyr=D; Phe, SeC=E flat; His=E; Gln Lys, Glu
        Met=F; Leu, Ile, Asn, Asp=G; Pro, Val, Thr, Cys=A; Ser=B flat;
        Ala=sharp D; Gly=sharp F </p>
      <p>[0028] that are deduced from the notes of the code by taking
        the notes of the chromatic tempered scale which are symmetrical
        to those of said keynotes with respect to central G. </p>
      <p>[0029] The application of the universal code results in scaling
        waves respectively in phase with and in phase opposition to
        those taking place during the synthesis process. The term
        "universal code" means that this code is identical for all
        proteins to within the approximation of the tempered scale; the
        low A, for a central frequency located 76 octaves below the
        centre of gravity of the initial frequencies of leucine,
        isoleucine, and asparagine, is at 220 Hz. The expression of
        harmonic distance given above extends the definition suggested
        by Y. Hellegouarch in C. R. Math. Rep. Acad. Sci. Canada, Volume
        4, Page 227, 1982. The exact values of the frequencies depend on
        the proportions of the groups of the above-mentioned amino acids
        among the transfer RNA population surrounding the protein
        biosynthesis. </p>
      <p>[0030] <b>Determination of Frequency</b>. The next step is to
        derive the frequency of each of the notes. The following code is
        derived in the following manner, which also optionally enables
        to give a more precise frequency value to each note. The
        frequency of the musical notes is calculated from the
        frequencies of amino acids in their free state (proportional to
        their masses) by minimizing the global harmonic distance
        .SIGMA.ij P.sub.i P.sub.j logsup (pi, qj) calculated for all
        possible pairs of notes, (pi/qj) being the harmonic intervals
        globally the closest to the corresponding proper frequency
        ratios. Their respective proportions P.sub.i, P.sub.j in the
        environing population of transfer RNAs are taken into account.
        While respecting the condition .delta.f&lt;.DELTA.f/2 where
        .delta.f is the displacement of the initial frequency towards
        its synchronized value and .DELTA.f is the interval between the
        two successive synchronized frequencies of the obtained scale,
        which encompass this initial frequency. The resulting frequency
        is then transposed into the field of audible frequencies. See,
        method described in the French patent number 8302122. </p>
      <p>[0031] <b>Determination Of The Musical Period</b>. Once the
        frequency of each musical note is determined, the musical period
        is determined by identifying similar series of musical notes.
        The existence of musical periods results directly from that of
        scaling waves. </p>
      <p>[0032] An indication is given by the presence of obvious
        cadences producing punctuations in the musical development.
        Obvious cadences include such cadences as GG, F-S. That is to
        say, F closely followed by S, as well as the cadence ending the
        signal peptide when it is present, for stimulation; series of R
        or Y, for inhibition; exceptionally, relative pauses induced by
        harmonic variations which would otherwise be too straight; and
        in all cases, cadences expressing the return to the tonic note.
      </p>
      <p>[0033] The similar passages are then determined. One method of
        determination is by the direct repetition of notes. When this
        method is used the period is given by a simple calculation of
        autocorrelations of notes. More specifically, by minimizing the
        frequency differences between notes by the number that minimizes
        the average on the protein of melodic distances between notes
        located an integer number of intervals apart. </p>
      <p>[0034] A second method is to determine the melodic movements of
        the musical notes. The period is calculated by autocorrelations
        of signatures--or frequency variation signs--from one note to
        the next. More specifically, the period is determined by
        calculating autocorrelations of the melodic distances from one
        note to the other, the distances being counted with their sign,
        i.e., multiplied by the corresponding signatures; or even more
        finely, by the number which minimizes the average on the protein
        of step by step melodic distances variations, to within an
        integer number of intervals apart. The repetition of the melodic
        contours are processed by a calculation of autocorrelations of
        pairs, or even better, of triplets of signatures. </p>
      <p>[0035] A third method of determining the period of the musical
        notes is by the logic of the harmonic movement that reproduces
        the notes or the melodic movement to the nearest simple harmonic
        transposition. The period is then given by the number that
        minimizes the average on the protein of harmonic distances
        between notes located an integer number of intervals apart. </p>
      <p>[0036] Sometimes when an "alignment" of similar sequences is
        present, the period appears in the additions or in the deletions
        of certain of the sequences. The result gives a melodically and
        harmonically coherent progression. To do that, account is taken
        of the fact that the last notes of each period or member of
        phrase--usually the second half, and more particularly the last
        note--as well as those situated on the strong beat are the most
        important for this progression. The final result is the most
        significant respecting the whole of these criteria. These
        different elements are balanced according to their relative
        importance in the protein, and especially the harmonic and
        melodic distance by the square of the ratio of their normalized
        standard deviations. There is usually one that is distinctly
        more significant than the others. </p>
      <p>[0037] Cases similar to allosteria nevertheless exist, and have
        a biological meaning (stimulation or inhibition by such molecule
        or such other one during the metabolism), but influence more
        frequently the position of the measure bars than the period. It
        is noted that metabolic function is different according to the
        context, for instance, CG rich or AT rich; the measure bars
        depending upon the composition of the DNA, as the "Christmas
        trees" that can be seen during certain syntheses clearly
        displayed (cf. B. Alberts and al., Molecular biology of the
        cell, 2nd edition, Garland Publ. Co. 1989, page 539). </p>
      <p>[0038] <b>Determining The Lengths Of Musical Notes</b>. If
        necessary, the period is rectified so that the melodic passages
        that repeat or follow one another can be found in the same place
        inside the measure. From this rectification the individual
        lengths of the musical notes are deduced. This operation of
        adjusting the phrasing to the measure is comparable to the well
        known phenomenon of lengthening the vowels of a sung text. </p>
      <p>[0039] In practice, the operations described above can be
        performed most easily with a keyboard, such as a Casio.TM.
        equipped with a "one key play" device, or with a computer
        programmed especially for that purpose with stored sequence of
        musical notes and where the sequence of notes can be played.
        However, some precautions are required. Prudence implies, among
        other things, to decode the same molecule or a musically similar
        molecule, in the direction of inhibition (or in any case in the
        direction opposite from the initial one), taking into account
        the fact that molecules very often have a preferential decoding
        direction. It is often the case that pairs of molecules that
        sensibly exert the same function find one pair being more
        musical in inhibition and the other one in stimulation. </p>
      <p>[0040] <b>Checking Rhythmic Style Through The Distribution Of
          The Bases of DNA</b>. When the molecule is musical enough, the
        period of autocorrelations corresponds to that of the protein.
        The autocorrelations determine in principle the measure bars,
        the ranks of base triplets--or more precisely of bases in third
        position in these triplets--for which the peaks of
        autocorrelation are the highest, corresponding to the most
        accentuated notes. By referring to codon sage, in comparison
        with known molecules (already decoded, or more regular and thus
        raising less difficulties) having the same supposed rhythmic
        style; the style of musical rhythm (which by constraining the
        accentuation of notes, influences the choice of bases in third
        position) determining the codon usage. Molecules of the same
        style must therefore have the same codon usage. If necessary,
        the decoding of some passages is corrected. </p>
      <p>[0041] <b>Determining The Tone Quality</b>. Tone quality is,
        in principle, different for every molecule and for every
        distribution of musical notes. In theory, tone quality mainly
        depends upon the molecule itself but it also depends upon all
        the levels of the organism which retroact on the harmonic
        structure of amino acid vibrations. The tone quality of the
        musical sequence is determined by comparing the repartition of
        the music sequence of the amino acid chain to the average
        repartition of those notes of the whole of the protein to
        determine which harmonics must be raised or lowered. The term
        "tone quality" or timbre is characterized by the harmonic
        structure of a note and more precisely by the variation of
        harmonic structure over a given note. </p>
      <p>[0042] A first approach is given by adjusting the distribution
        of molecule notes to the theoretical graph of that distribution.
        The distribution is deduced from the scaling wave equation. The
        distribution also corresponds to what can be observed in
        average, on the whole of proteins. This adjustment to the tone
        quality requires determination of which harmonics are amplified
        and which are softened in the wanted tone. See, French Patent
        No. 8302122. The closest tone quality is then selected in a
        palette of given ones. For example, a voice memory or as one can
        already find included in many expanders and musical softwares.
        To distinguish more precisely between three situations: (1)
        distribution of notes constant along the molecule to provide a
        relatively fixed harmonic structure; (2) straight distribution
        changes to provide different successive tones of instrument, for
        instance cytochrome C with several organ registers; and (3)
        progressive distribution change which then reproduces the time
        evolution of the harmonic structure of one note, for example,
        myosin, where this evolution indicates a timbre of trumpet. </p>
      <p>[0043] Apart from this, determining the tempo gives no real
        problem to the technician because it normally follows from the
        rhythmic style. It is generally all the faster that there are
        important redundancies in the proteic sequence, as it is the
        case for fibrous proteins. </p>
      <p>[0044] <b>Determining The Colors</b>. Optionally, the colors
        are determined by applying the universal code. The color is
        deduced from vibration frequencies of individual amino acids
        through the formula (drawn from scaling wave theory):
        .nu..about..nu..sub.0 Argch (e (.function./.function..sub.0)
        Logch 1), where (.function., .function..sub.0 represent the
        proper quantum frequencies associated with aminoacids as
        previously, and .nu., .nu..sub.0 those of colors, the index 0
        showing central values. This gives the following code relating
        to the stabilization of proteins synthesized in situ (the code
        related to the stabilization of their inhibition is deduced as
        in section 1 by symmetrization of the logarithms of frequencies
        with respect to the central lemon yellow): </p>
      <p>[0045] Gly=dark red: Ala=bright red: Ser=orange; Pro, Val. Thr,
        Cys=ochre; Leu, Ile, Asn, Asp=lemon yellow; Gln, Glu, Lys,
        Met=green; His=emerald: Phe=blue; Arg, Tyr=indigo; Trp=purple, </p>
      <p>[0046] these frequencies then being moved towards red or purple
        according to the global repartition of the molecule frequencies
        in a way similar to the description for tone quality as above.
        The spatial position of colors is the same as those of the amino
        acids in the tridimensional spatial representation of the
        molecules. </p>
      <p>[0047] Several examples are set forth below to illustrate the
        invention and the manner in which it is carried out. In these
        examples as well as in the figures, the one-letter notation for
        amino acids: Gly=G; Ala=A; Ser=S; Pro, Val, Thr, Cys=P, V, T, C
        respectively; Leu, Ile, Asn, Asp=L, I, N, D; Gln, Glu, Lys,
        Met=Q, E, K, M; His=H; Phe=F; Arg, Tyr=R, Y; Trp=W is used. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0048] This example illustrates decoding a protein that is
        regular from beginning to end. Cytochrome C provides a constant
        deletion of eight amino acids (sometimes seven) among animal
        proteins when compared to plants. Observing the autocorrelations
        of musical notes and melodic contours confirmed the value of the
        musical period. </p>
      <p>[0049] The occurrences of the same note was counted and the
        same direction of pitch variation occurred three times in a row
        (the same triplet of signatures), which was distant from an
        integer number k of musical notes. The following result was
        obtained: </p>
      <p>[0050] Values of k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 </p>
      <p>[0051] Note autocorrelations 19 15 15 20 19 15 17 21 14 17 18
        13 </p>
      <p>[0052] Melodic contour autocorr. 1 7 4 6 5 10 8 13 5 4 4 4 </p>
      <p>[0053] Total 20 22 19 26 24 25 25 34 9 21 22 17 </p>
      <p>[0054] the peak at k=8 being worth about 2.5 standard
        deviations (as compared to its expectation value 22.3.+-.4.7
        determined from the repartition of notes of the molecule). The
        significance of this peak was reinforced when using melodic
        distances. </p>
      <p>[0055] The peak outgrew distinctly 3 standard deviations when
        the autocorrelations of melodic intervals were included by
        taking as a definition of the melodic distance between two
        notes, the absolute value of the difference of the ordinal ranks
        of their tempered frequencies arranged in ascending order. This
        definition is derived from the usual nomenclature: second,
        third, etc., for the notes of a musical mode. The secondary peak
        at k=7 then became slightly significant, corresponding to the
        relative stretching of the seventh note which tended to precede
        the return to the tonic; whereas, the one at k=4 was reinforced
        when harmonic distances were used to spatial foldings of the
        molecule. </p>
      <p>[0056] The observation of the cadences also confirmed this
        value, as well as that of the internal similarities. The last
        five notes of the first, second and third group of eight
        produced together an exact harmonic superposition. In other
        words, a canon for three voices. More precisely, these last two
        investigations showed a greater relative importance of the
        seventh note (F-S cadence on the second period) and the eighth
        note (back to the A minor tonic) for each period. The latter
        once more prevailing over the former. That is, the perfect S-Q
        cadence on the sixteenth note prevailed over the preceding F-S
        cadence with the recovering of the initial tonality. The
        division of the period resulted in six semiquavers, one quaver,
        one crotchet (which meant relative lengths 1-1-1-1-1-1-2-4 with
        a 6:8 rhythm as shown in FIG. 1). The coherence of the melodic
        progression (wherefrom the observed regularity mainly proceeds)
        as well as the richness of the harmonic progression, the A minor
        tonality being accompanied with modulations in E minor (second
        bar), G minor (eighth bar), and F major (third and ninth bar)
        was apparent. </p>
      <p>[0057] The first and seventh notes of each period fostered,
        respectively, adenine and thymine in third position; whereas,
        the third and eighth notes fostered in the same way cytosine and
        guanine. This confirmed the above division for the period and
        the relative lengths of notes. In other words, the seventh and
        eighth notes had lengths that were respectively twice and four
        times the first. This also showed that in an AT-rich environment
        strong beats were on the first and seventh notes, and therefore
        the measure bars were on the first. However, in a CG-rich
        environment the musical sequence started on an anacrouse (strong
        beat on the third and eighth notes, measure bar on the third). </p>
      <p>[0058] The conclusion was that the protein had distinct
        metabolic roles, depending on its environment. </p>
      <p>[0059] Actually, the range of its metabolic action was first
        demonstrated by the degree of its musical evolution. In
        comparison with the sequence of Euglena gracilis, in the three
        first measures an improvement of 56% of the melodic [regularity]
        level and of 16% of the harmonic [regularity] level was observed
        as defined from the minimization of the respectively melodic and
        harmonic distances between successive notes. </p>
      <p>[0060] The search of musical similarities with other proteins
        showed the possibility to superpose cytochrome C onto endozepine
        with a musical reading frame compatible with the measure bar on
        the first note. This resulted in a slightly AT-rich molecule;
        thereby predicting an anti-depressive role for the cytochrome
        (and its music), through the eventual desinhibition of
        neurotransmission; as well as, a musical enchainment (then
        beginning on an anacrouse) with cytochrome oxidase. Cytochrome
        oxidase is slightly CG-rich and ends the respiratory chain. </p>
      <p>[0061] As for tone quality, because tonality was present in A
        (minor), the quasi absence of the fourth (D) and the relative
        weakness of the fifth (E) compared to the distinct dominance of
        the tonic note and to the abundance of the octave (low A-medium
        A) privileged harmonics 1 and 2, to the prejudice of the
        followings, indicated an organ timbre with slightly different
        registers according to the passages. </p>
      <p>[0062] As shown in FIG. 2, colors effectively grouped
        themselves into colored stains onto the mature protein with, as
        in the case for music, remarkable harmonic responses. The color
        determination was useful to confirm the musical decoding,
        insofar as some autocorrelations of notes were translated not
        into the musical period but in the spatial folding of the
        molecule. The spatial folding must eventually be subtracted to
        determine the musical periods. It was found that where a
        secondary peak of these autocorrelations, k=4, due to the
        .alpha.-helix of the beginning which can be seen in FIG. 2,
        corresponded to these foldings. Conversely, the musical decoding
        gave indications about the spatial structure of a protein. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0063] This example illustrates control of the decoding of a
        protein showing rhythmical variations. The decoding was
        controlled at different levels including the decoding of
        molecules known to be metabolically agonist and the coherence of
        the conclusions that were drawn from the musical similarities
        observed. </p>
      <p>[0064] Recovering full sections of the metabolism facilitates
        the decoding. In Example 1, the "rhythmic formula" of cytochrome
        C was transcribed as follows: </p>
      <p>1 .vertline.6/8
        GDVEKGK:K:::.vertline.IFIMKCS:Q:::.vertline.CHTVEKG-
        :G:::.vertline., etc. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + </p>
      <p>[0065] where the +underline the strong beats, the .vertline.
        indicate the place of measure bars and the: indicate the
        lengthening of notes. </p>
      <p>[0066] In subunit III of cytochrome oxidase, which is musically
        chained to cytochrome C, the beginning is a four-time formula as
        shown by the internal similarities. The notes 7 to 22, which
        remind in their contours the manner of Bach, were split into
        groups of four notes, each one being superposable to the next.
        At the tenth measure, another measure which was not only
        superposable was found onto the first measure of cytochrome C,
        but was in fact, even practically identical to the third measure
        of the same cytochrome. This implied a lengthening of the eighth
        measure (as the cadence seen at the end of this measure already
        indicated in itself), in a six-time measure (FIG. 1): </p>
      <p>2 .vertline.4/8
        MTHQSHAY.vertline.HMVKPSPW.vertline.PLTGALSA.vertli-
        ne.LLMTSGLA.vertline. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
        MWFHFHSM.vertline.TLLMLGLL.vertline.TNTLTMYQ.parallel.6/8
        WWRDVTR:::::.vertline. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
        ESTYQGH:H:::.vertline.TPPVQKG:::::.parallel. + + + + + + + + + +
        + + </p>
      <p>[0067] This change in rhythm (from 4/8 to 6/8) was visible in
        base autocorrelations of the DNA where, at this point, the
        prominent peak went from the fourth to the sixth base triplet. </p>
      <p>[0068] As seen in FIG. 1, the sequence started on an anacrouse
        emphasizing the strong beat on the third note, in view of the
        enchainment with the CG-rich rhythmic variant of cytochrome C. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0069] The example illustrates reconstitution of a metabolic
        chain including stimulations and inhibitions. </p>
      <p>[0070] The decoding of histone 4 was particularly easy. The
        periodicity of 7 is clearly visible on the sequence at the
        outset of the molecule. The repetition of G within a two amino
        acid interval indicates a binary rhythm, and the GG cadences
        that end the two first periods specify right away a four-time
        rhythm: </p>
      <p>3 .vertline.SGRGKGG:.vertline.KGLGKGG:.vertline.; + + + + + + +
        + </p>
      <p>[0071] this pattern continued until the end of the sequence,
        with the only exception being the last measure which was
        syncopated to recover the rhythm of the first two measures. See
        FIG. 3. The global repartition of the notes showed a harmonic
        structure corresponding to the tone of a flute. The "skip of
        notes" repeated from the beginning, which suggested a sound with
        an attack and a timbre similar to that of Pan's pipes. </p>
      <p>[0072] Histone 4 is one of the most conserved proteins among
        the animal and plant kingdoms. This does not mean that its
        metabolic action doesn't sometimes need to be tempered. The
        theme of histone 4's first two measures was found in inhibition
        and transposed to the fourth, in the conserved part of the
        beginning of chalcone synthase, which is the pigmentation enzyme
        of many flowering plants. See FIG. 3. This may be compared to
        the supposed role of chromatin, which histone 4 is part of, in
        the process of magnesium fixation. During spring, plants need a
        lot of magnesium for photosynthesis and the plant's fixation
        needs to be stimulated. Chalcone synthase is then inhibited;
        whereas, during the fall, the weaker stimulation of histone
        desinhibits chalcone synthase and allows the replacement of the
        green of the leaves by brighter colors of that season, the
        diversity of which, so much praised by the poets, becomes thus
        more understandable through their epigenetic component. </p>
      <p>[0073] When listening to the musical transposition of histone
        4, several auditors reported "an urge to eat chocolate" which
        contains magnesium. Some auditors found that "it produces the
        same effect as that of granulated magnesium, except that this
        effect is immediate in this case". This presents some
        inconvenience for people having a slightly too high rate of
        cholesterol. Actually, the musical decoding of chalcone
        isomerase--the metabolically agonist of chalcone synthase, but
        which "works better" musically in stimulation--included a series
        of themes and variations whose succession reproduced, in
        flowering plants, themes of the full metabolic chain regulating
        cholesterol in man. In addition, the frequency of the ascending
        fourths in chalcone isomerase tended to approximate that
        observed in the alcali light chain of mammalian myosin, which
        stimulated muscular contraction (while magnesium acted as a
        muscular decontractant). Listening to the musical transposition
        of histone 4 encouraged physical exercise which is another way
        to lower cholesterol. </p>
      <p>[0074] In fact, this example underlines the importance of a
        quasi-general phenomenon, that is, the epigenetic co-operation
        of different factors in the stimulation of protein synthesis,
        which accounts for the aspect meaningful in itself of the
        musical sequences. In this way for example, listening to myosin
        will generally suggest a military march. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>[0075] This example illustrates the biochemical analysis of an
        epigenetic cooperation involving harmonic superpositions. The
        biochemical analysis of these epigenetic cooperations is a
        valuable help for decoding. </p>
      <p>[0076] Another way to stimulate epigenetically the muscular
        decontraction is heat, whose healing action for rheumatism, for
        example, is well known. The action of heat is conveyed by a
        group of proteins called heat shock, generally synthesized
        together. This suggests that the proteins should show harmonic
        superpositions. In fact, the hsp 27 protein, which appeared to
        be the most musical, superposed itself onto the beginning of the
        hsp 70 protein, the most abundant, which sort of played here the
        role of a bass line. These two molecules were again superposable
        together with the beginning of troponin C, which regulates
        calcium in muscular contraction. The conclusion was that it
        plays a role as an anti-rheumatic and that its musical level is
        high (FIG. 4). Other molecules, also of a high musical level and
        epigenetically sensitive, were implicated in this type of
        ailment, from the stimulation of prolactin and beta-lipotropin
        (precursor of beta-endorphin) to the inhibition of estrogen
        receptor, including the inhibition of IgE and interleukin 1
        beta. </p>
      <p>[0077] These examples clearly show how large sections of the
        metabolism can be reconstituted step by step, with many ways to
        check or control the coherence of the results obtained, and
        thereby to precise the musical decoding of the concerned
        proteins. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
      <p>[0078] This example shows a practical application of the method
        of this invention using the transcriptions in the form of either
        musical scores, or of recordings of the obtained musical
        sequences. </p>
      <p>[0079] The recordings of musical sequences may be realized from
        musical scores described earlier, by using one of the methods
        evaluated in B. H. Repp, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 88, p.622 (1990).
        The most precise of these methods was used in the examples
        hereby given. </p>
      <p>[0080] In the fields of agronomy and textile industries this
        invention provides methods to stimulate certain specific protein
        synthesis, for example, bovine lactation, fermenting of baker's
        yeast, the sweet taste of some fruits, animal or plant fibres
        (keratine of sheep's wool, fibroin of silkworm, etc.), as well
        as the proteins specific to certain medicinal plants. In the
        field of environment the method of this invention is used, for
        example, in the assimilation of industrial effluents through
        plants by stimulating the biosynthesis of the corresponding
        proteins. </p>
      <p>[0081] The method of this invention was used on a cow who
        regularly, during 15 days and at the time of milking, listened
        to recordings of musical transcriptions of the amino acid
        sequences of bovine prolactin, lactoglobulin, and lactalbumin. A
        reduction, by a ratio of 3, of the relative quantity of whey was
        observed, resulting in a milk highly enriched in proteins, and
        in a particularly savory cheese. </p>
      <p>[0082] In another experiment growing tomato plants were given a
        "cocktail" of musical transpositions of different proteins
        including: specific virus inhibitors, various extensions, then a
        flowering enzyme (LAT 52), an antibacterial protein having
        musical similarity to thaumatin, an improvement of sugar
        percentage (P 23), and inhibitors of fruit softening enzymes
        (pectinesterase and polygalacturonase). A distinct increase in
        size and number of fruits (summing up to a ratio of about 3.5)
        was observed, as well as, a sensitive increase of the sweet
        taste in a significant proportion of the fruits that had
        particularly received P 23. </p>
      <p>[0083] These noteworthy results go along with a certain amount
        of precautions, namely, there exist some counter-indications to
        an excess of stimulation, especially of prolactin, which must be
        cautiously taken into consideration by breeders that carry out
        these methods, as well as for the animals themselves who may be
        fragilized. In the experiments carried out on cows with Mozart
        music--bovine prolactin has in fact, apart from a "musical
        level" particularly high which can here define in a
        mathematically simple way some musical turns that can be
        qualified as "typically Mozartian"--the rate of mammites could
        seem worrying. In such a case one ought to complete the hearing
        of prolactin with that of alpha-1 antitrypsin, whose musicality
        is also very elaborate and whose metabolism is complementary.
        Similarly for tomatoes receiving outside stimulations, one must
        be cautious not to interrupt the cycle too suddenly. </p>
      <p>[0084] These results give an indication of the order of
        magnitude of results obtainable in such conditions. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
      <p>[0085] In the therapeutic and preventive fields, many ailments
        are characterized by a specific metabolic weakness and can
        therefore be efficiently prevented or treated with the help of
        the present invention. This example illustrates such prevention
        or treatment. </p>
      <p>[0086] Because the minimal length of a musically active
        sequence is of the order of that of a signal peptide, i.e., from
        several amino acids to a few tens, this action may be very fast
        and appear after a few seconds or a few minutes. Nevertheless,
        the complete integration of the produced effect can take
        slightly more time, or even require, in case of a strong
        cultural conditioning, i.e., a certain initial training. But
        usually, this initial training is accomplished rather rapidly
        for the obvious benefit of the persons concerned. </p>
      <p>[0087] For a responsible use of the described method, it is
        important to know the metabolic role of the molecules involved.
        And it is of course one of the interests of the musical decoding
        of proteins (associated to the corresponding colors) to allow,
        by systematically spotting the similarities and
        counter-similarities of melodies (and colors) from the protein
        sequences that are known and available in data banks, to select
        proteins that are metabolically agonist and antagonist of a
        given protein, for which the degree of musical elaboration also
        gives an indication of the importance of its metabolic role. The
        described method therefore allows determinations of precise
        particular indications for some proteic sequences. </p>
      <p>[0088] As earlier noted, in animal or plant proteins,
        especially among the most musical ones, successive melodic
        fragments of human metabolic chains were observed. Therefore,
        the transpositions which were found to be active on man were not
        limited to human molecules. On the other hand, the metabolism of
        those species seems in some way more "specialized" for the
        production of certain molecules, and it is indeed the most
        musical proteins that will be the most important for the
        applications. Of course, these correspondences between different
        species facilitate the delimitation of the metabolic role, and
        the decoding of proteic sequences. </p>
      <p>[0089] The musicality of a molecule implies in itself that its
        epigenetic stimulation is preferable for a therapeutic use,
        (because of the range of its metabolic interactions), to its
        direct absorption. The "most musical" molecules are generally
        those for which either the production by genetic engineering, or
        the therapeutic use which derives from it, will meet some
        problems, such as of transportation to the site of action, or of
        stability, or more specifically of secondary effects related to
        doses that should be much more important than what they are in
        the body to obtain comparable effects, because then, the scaling
        waves naturally associated to their production are not present
        any more. This is particularly true for the inhibition of
        proteins, when the natural inhibitor is much heavier, or simply
        when the production needs to be reduced at a given time or in a
        systematic way. </p>
      <p>[0090] Eventually, concerning the use of transcriptions of
        proteic sequences, the very quickness of their action may allow,
        by differential comparison, especially bipolar, of their
        positive and negative effects to precisely which one is the most
        appropriate in a given situation. This identification is
        facilitated by the comparison with transcriptions of known
        proteic sequences of acoustic or electromagnetic phenomena
        exhibiting distinct series of frequencies, and for which some
        effects have been observed in a similar situation. </p>
      <p>[0091] As will be appreciated from the above, the invention is
        in no way limited to those methods of putting it into effect, of
        construction and of application which have been described above
        in detail; on the contrary, it covers all versions which may be
        conceived of by workers skilled in the art, without exceeding,
        either the framework or the scope of the present invention. </p>

        <p><b>Suj :&nbsp; Proteodies vs. music&nbsp; (after a response
            to an e-mail from United States, July 2001)</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir: </p>
      <p>I did not "develop a theory of music-amino acid
        correspondence".&nbsp; I already made a similar deny in a letter
        to the New Scientist which was&nbsp; published on aug. 6, 1994,
        p. 50, as well as to the french magazine 'Courrier
        International' which published it a bit earlier, on july 7th of
        the same year. </p>
      <p>More precisely, man-composed melodies follow cognitive
        constraints of a statistical nature which clearly separate them
        from sequences of frequency intervals as they may be computed
        from protein elongation processes, whatever (truly remarkable)
        properties they have in common on other grounds. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Therefore, the latter, when expressed in sound form,
        differ from music, as they do from noise. They are new
        stuff, which could not have been processed before present genome
        sequencing, but which come to be now - whether, in fact, or to
        which extent they should, may be open to debate.&nbsp; Still,
        they have impressive, reproducible effects, observable at both
        macroscopic and molecular levels, on in situ viruses, cells,
        plants, animals - and people, who can exert appropriate control
        on them, thanks to their audibility. But have to do it with
        great care. </p>
      <p>Why? because unlike music as long as it falls in behind
        cognitive laws, proteodies as we call them may be quite
        dangerous if not manipulated carefully. What may heal, may also
        harm, and whenever a metabolic cascade is triggered, may not be
        that easy to reverse. In 1997, a color form expression
        corresponding by chance to a short excerpt of an
        epileptogenic&nbsp; GABA receptor, which was broadcasted on a
        japanese television program, drove 700 children to hospital -
        the full sequence would have driven tens of thousands (cf.
        Yomiuri Shimbun, dec. 25, 1997; Japan Times, apr. 4, 1998). Such
        a risk, which is quite real, can only be increased by confusing
        publicity. </p>

      <p><b>Suj : Re : rencontres sur le son</b> <br>
        <b>Date : 20/03/01 (extrait de réponse par courrier électronique
          à une offre de participation à une conférence)</b> </p>
      <p>Cher monsieur </p>
      <p>Certes la musique me passionne... Cependant je ne puis
        souscrire au titre que vous mavez communiqué pour votre projet
        de conférence: "le son: des phénomènes vibratoires aux dérivés
        musicaux". La musique ne se réduit pas à un "dérivé" de son ou
        de phénomène vibratoire, car entre les deux il y a un sujet qui
        sexprime. Cest comme si lon disait que la fable du corbeau et
        du renard dérive du papier sur lequel elle est imprimée. </p>
      <p>Une mélodie peut être comprise de façon active (au sens
        physique du terme) comme une suite de sons, et de façon passive
        comme un son dans lequel on change plusieurs fois lunité de
        mesure de fréquence sonore: on, cest-à-dire le sujet qui
        choisit lunité, et quon ne peut évacuer. Dans linfluence des
        musiques de protéines sur les plantes, ce qui agit est non pas
        la vibration mécanique mais linformation contenue dans la suite
        des intervalles dune fréquence à lautre, cest-à-dire dans la
        donnée des changements dunités successifs effectués par la
        plante-sujet qui reçoit ces sons. Le son nest ici que le
        support de linformation, laquelle peut être transmise sur
        dautres supports de la même façon que le texte de cet e-mail se
        passe de papier. </p>
      <p>En ces temps de réification sauvage où le sujet est ouvertement
        occulté, où les plantes sont transformées en objets dont on
        modifie le génome et les vaches carrément massacrées pour rien,
        ce serait terrible que de vouloir réifier aussi la musique, lieu
        du sujet par excellence, en la présentant comme un dérivé du
        son! Si lécoute dun timbre particulier peut éveiller lenvie
        ou le besoin de le développer en une mélodie, cest parce quil
        aura éveillé chez le sujet qui lentend une sensation quil aura
        su exprimer: bien sûr que la suite des notes reflètera (si le
        compositeur est ainsi sensible) certaines propriétés de
        lamplitude des harmoniques de ce timbre, mais qui ne suffisent
        nullement à la déterminer. </p>
      <p>Même si vous entendez par "phénomène vibratoire" lémotion qui
        accompagne la dérépression dun gène et la synthèse dune
        protéine résultante chez une personne qui aura su en capter un
        écho ou un fragment à lintérieur delle-même, le résultat sous
        la plume du compositeur ne pourra en être un simple dérivé à
        cause des limites propres à la cognition, qui limitent
        drastiquement la longueur du fragment en question. Il lui
        restera tout un travail délaboration pour produire une musique,
        qui pourra suivre des lois mélodiques, rythmiques et harmoniques
        similaires, mais qui seront nécessairement distinctes sur le
        plan cognitif: on sen rend bien compte lors des tentatives de
        mémorisation des musiques de protéines par ceux qui les
        écoutent, qui diminuent toujours, et souvent à leur insu, la
        quantité moyenne dinformation par intervalle, soit en réduisant
        ceux-ci, soit en introduisant des redondances, même relatives
        (cest-à-dire en répétant localement certaines séquences sur une
        autre tonalité). </p>
      <p>En un mot, les objets peuvent produire des sons, les sujets
        font de la musique... </p>
      <p>Je serais heureux de développer ces éléments, mais dans une
        conférence portant un titre qui ne les contredirait pas! Si vous
        voulez en discuter plus avant, vous pouvez mappeler au siège de
        notre association (1 rue Descartes à Paris) le mardi et le jeudi

      <p>Sir: </p>
      <p>Thank you for your e-mail. </p>
      <p>There is no 'agricultural music CD' available or for open sale.
        There are proteodies available, i.e. epigenetic sound sequences
        able to stimulate or inhibit specifically well-defined proteins,
        and which must be used very carefully since they may also affect
        humans. They cannot therefore be diffused in open air in places
        where human may travel through. </p>
      <p>For grapes, are presently available: - stilbene synthase, for
        resveratrol synthesis, i.e. protection against some specific
        diseases; - caffeoyl-coenzyme A methyltransferase; - several
        proteins to enhance sugar content in grape. </p>
      <p>If any of these fits a problem of yours please let me know, as
        we may then discuss of a user's license. A young agricultural
        engineer who passed his thesis in Gand on this subject has
        recently recieved funding from a french foundation to develop
        use of this method for grapes and wine, and is taking contacts
        for this. His name is Yannick van Doorne, and he may be
        contacted to help users apply the method correctly. His work is
        coordinated by Pedro Ferrandiz. </p>
      <p>Yours <br>
        Joël Sternheimer </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>Dear sir: </p>
      <p>Thank you for your e-mail. </p>
      <p>For vineyard and grapes, as in general, things depend on the
        specific problem which one faces. Here, a few proteins have been
        decoded: stilbene synthase and caffeoyl-coenzyme A
        methyltransferase, both of which protect against certain
        diseases of the grape without affecting its taste; and a few
        proteins acting on color and sugar content. If any is of
        interest to you, we may discuss about it. </p>
      <p>Please note, however, that proteodies differ from music on
        cognitive grounds, as explained in
        http://members.aol.com/jmsternhei/faq.htm; they should be used
        with much caution since they may affect humans, and therefore
        not in the open where people may walk, only in greenhouses or in
        desert, or at least in well-protected places. Unless the plants
        are sick precisely because humans are, and therefore healing one
        will heal the other (as it is for the proteodic homology between
        stilbene synthase, which catalyzes resveratrol synthesis, and
        human lactate dehydrogenase, which partially accounts for the
        heart-protecting effects of grapes and wine). </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">What Will Happen to Milking Cows that
              Listen to the Radio?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>- the reason why they can do "good work" with&nbsp;
            favorite Mozart -</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>It has been said that more milk is obtained with background
        music, which is Mozart, than without music. In fact, there is an
        old genre painting in England on which milkwomen are milking
        cows with a radio in their neibourhood. They might have done so
        because it has been known by experience that the quantity of
        milk increases by music or human voice. However, the scientists
        do not officially admit such relation between the milk quantity
        and music. About this, Dr. Sternheimer says: "From the point of
        view of the protein music, there is certain relations between
        the music of Mozart and the quality of milk." The characteristic
        music style of Mozart can be recognized in the melody of
        prolactin, a protein which plays an important role in producing
        milk in cows and is also called mammotropic hormone. A
        musicologist points out: "The melody of prolactin contains
        several passages very similar to those of Mozart. One typical
        example is the final 8 notes in the attached score." A pianist
        finds out, in the attached score, a feature seen in the earliest
        works of Mozart at his Salzburg period. </p>
      <p><b>Prolactin facilitates to produce tasty milk</b> </p>
      <p>So as to verify his theory, Dr. Sternheimer made some
        experiments with cows in Charente at the central west of France:
        what will be the difference between milk with music and that
        without music? At milking, the music of lactogloblin and
        lactoalbumin in addition to that of prolactin were played near
        cows. Then the quantity of whey became one third of that
        obtained in the case of no music, and therefore milk with high
        quality rich in proteins were obtained. Cheese made from the
        milk was, according to a testing panel, very delicious. The
        cheese made of the milk was also sold in a shop in Paris and the
        sales became 6 times more than usual during 2 weeks when the
        experiment has been carried out. We have already made "musical
        bread" and now tasty cheese with music came to join it. We miss
        then good musical wine.&lt;BR&gt;Setting aside the topic, we
        must be very careful when the music of protein is applied to
        cows. If prolactin is too stimulated in cows, they tend to be
        affected with mammites. It is to be noted that "musical remedy"
        should be used appropriately. Readers, therefore, must be
        cautious not to play the attached score for amusing although it
        corresponds to the melody of the prolactin of cow and not of
        human beings. </p>
      <p><b>Cows affected with the mad-cow disease may be saved by using
          the protein music</b> </p>
      <p>As for other diseases of cows, there may be pointed out the
        mad-cow disease about which much was talked recently. This
        disease is officially called the bovine spongiform
        encephalopathy (BSE), which makes the brain of cow a sponge-like
        material and leads them to death. The first cow affected with
        this disease was discovered in 1986 in England. There is also a
        counterpart for human being, which is called the
        Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Both diseases, of cows and of human
        beings, are said to be caused by a protein called prion which is
        neither a virus nor a&nbsp; bacterium. <br>
        What is then the protein melody corresponding to the prion? </p>
      <p>Here again, let's listen to Dr. Sternheimer: "Since the 1950's,
        the effect of the music of Mozart on the milking of cows has
        been appeared, for example, in newspapers. Then, many breeders
        in England began to switch on the radio during the daytime in
        their cattle pen although Mozart is not always heard from the
        radio... </p>
      <p>By the way, among melodies we hear often in these years, there
        is one - the so-called "trance" music - which contains a passage
        common to that of prion at its repeated portion and which may
        promote the synthesis of the prion. It is therefore no wonder if
        cows in the cattle pens heard such music with this passage from
        the radio which were on during the daytime and they were
        influenced unfavorably. If the music is uncomfortable for us, we
        can turn off the radio or leave the place not to hear the music
        any more, and we can avoid the harm which may bring us. However,
        cows cannot escape from the music even if they feel it
        uncomfortable." </p>
      <p>Dr. Sternheimer, therefore, proposes that it will be worth
        while trying, as a measure for coping with the mad-cow disease
        by using the music of protein, to put the music which inhibits
        the prion on the air so as to be heard by cows. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">A Decisive Factor of Deliciousness is the
              "Ears" of Bread</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>- the Pastoral Symphony of Beethoven is a favorite of
            yeast?</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>About three years ago, an article appeared in a newspaper: "To
        Japanese noodles or Udon, the "Four Seasons" of Vivaldi; the
        "Pastoral Symphony" of Beethoven to bread" (Asahi Shimbun, July
        23, 1993). With classical music, fermentation of food stuffs is
        somehow promoted and tasty food products are obtained. To our
        regret, the reason is not revealed in the article, and only the
        following explanation is given: just as human beings become
        relaxed when they listen to music, enzyme or yeast seems to
        become active by classical music. The interesting and mysterious
        effects of classical music on enzyme or yeast were made clear by
        Dr. Sternheimer, who remarks: "the Pastoral Symphony of&nbsp;
        Beethoven has certainly positive effects on yeast. However,
        there exist far more appropriate melodies for it". He says so
        because he knows the&nbsp; great effects of protein music that
        he has discovered. It must be noted that there are two types of
        melodies for a protein: one which promotes the synthesis of the
        protein and the other which inhibits the synthesis. For example,
        if a fermentation or brewing step of food stuffs is included in
        a food production process, the use of a melody or melodies
        appropriate for relevant enzyme, which is mainly composed of a
        protein and contained in the yeast for the fermentation step,
        makes it possible to promote or inhibit the activity of the
        enzyme. Therefore, the taste of the obtained food product will
        be influenced by the melodies. </p>
      <p>Bread yeast becomes encouraged by a melody specially made for
        it. </p>
      <p>To make bread, we must prepare flour, water, yeast, and so on.
        Whether baked bread becomes tasty or not depends mainly on the
        activity of yeast during the fermentation provided that the same
        food stuffs are used. If the activity of enzyme called alcohol
        dehydrogenase (ADH), which is contained in bread yeast and plays
        an important role in fermentation, is promoted during the
        fermentation of dough by the music of the enzyme, one can obtain
        tasty bread. In fact, in a blind test for comparing the taste
        between the "musical bread" and normal bread without music, the
        former was by far preferred. </p>
      <p>By the way, as for the reason why the Pastoral Symphony helps
        to make delicious bread, Dr. Sternheimer analyzes: "a part of
        the melody for activating ADH is contained in the theme of the
        first movement of the symphony". For bread, therefore, the whole
        symphony is not necessary, but only the first movement is
        sufficient. </p>
      <p>However, if we could ask the bread yeast the preference of
        music, it would say in chorus to choose the melody for promoting
        ADH rather than the Pastoral Symphony on the ground that the
        former is more comfortable. </p>
      <p><b>Improving Food Quality with the Protein Music</b> </p>
      <p>Between the protein music and existing music such as classical
        music, there is a difference similar to that between sovereign
        remedy and food. In more detail, the whole melody of the protein
        music is effective, while effective portions may be included in
        the existing music. Therefore, the protein music may be
        symbolically called "musical remedy". It must be noted, however,
        that the protein music should be treated with care just as
        sovereign remedy in general. </p>
      <p>Before the positive effects of the Pastoral Symphony on bread
        was found, many trials might have been done. According to Dr.
        Sternheimer, so as to obtain the same effects by using
        non-specific music as those by specific music, one must play the
        non-specific music for more than a month, which period can be
        known by a simple calculation. Accordingly, arbitrary music
        cannot produce remarkable effects in a short time and a specific
        melody must be selected if relatively quick response is desired.
      </p>
      <p>The main characteristics of the protein music are: the melody
        for obtaining desired effects can be theoretically deduced; and
        the same effects as those by classical music can be obtained far
        faster than by using classical music. For example, the article
        cited at the beginning says about bread: "before baking dough,
        yeast was fermented for 72 hours with the Pastoral Symphony.
        This is a fermentation time more than ten times longer than
        normal". On the other hand, dough was fermented with the ADH
        music by Dr. Sternheimer for 1 hour and a half. Therefore,
        delicious bread is obtained about 50 times more efficiently in
        time with the use of the ADH music than with the Pastoral
        Symphony. </p>
      <p>We are looking forward to increasing the pleasure of table
        in&nbsp; the near future using the protein music, which may
        bring us delicious bread, good beer, wine and sake, and miso
        paste and soy sauce with high quality. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Musical Tomatoes</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Two years ago in summer, an interesting experiment was planned
        in a region affected by drought in Senegal in Africa. </p>
      <p>The aim of the experiment was to draw full potential of
        tomatoes with the help of music in the course of cultivation.
        For this purpose, a conventional radio-cassette recorder and a
        tape on which is recorded a melody were used. These were all the
        preparations. </p>
      <p>We often hear that music is effective in promoting the growth
        of plants. However, no one has been able to give convincing
        explanations of such phenomena. It is therefore natural that
        most of the reactions of those who engaged in the experiment
        were negative: "It's joking" or "Incredible". </p>
      <p>For comparison, two sections were prepared for cultivating
        tomatoes: a section with music (referred to as "music section")
        and a section for control without music (referred to as "control
        section"). Taking into consideration the results obtained in the
        preceding experiences, the quantity of water given to each
        section was different: twice a day for the control section
        according to the standard of the region; once a day for the
        music section but with music for three minutes every day. </p>
      <p>No less than two weeks, the difference of growth became
        remarkable between the plants of tomato of the two sections. The
        difference of heights became larger and larger thereafter. When
        the time of crop came, the difference in number, size and
        appearance of fruits was apparent between the two sections. The
        harvest of musical tomatoes became, as a whole, twenty times
        more than that of the control section. Furthermore, what is to
        be noted is that although insects gave damages to fruits in the
        control section, tomatoes in the music section were left intact.
      </p>
      <p>Facts are more convincing than theories. Seeing is believing. </p>
      <p>The difference was so apparent that farmers who have observed
        the experiment from the beginning have completely changed their
        mind in the course of the experiment and even said at the end:
        "We have expected such good results from the beginning". </p>
      <p>What "magic" was used to produce such remarkable effects? </p>
      <p>The key to understand the magic consists, of course, in the
        melody recorded on the tape. </p>
      <p>The melody was offered by Dr. Joel Sternheimer, a physicist in
        France. He has elucidated the secret or a secret, at least, of
        the effects of music on living creatures through the research of
        quantum physics and molecular biology. </p>
      <p>According to him, the principle is as follows: </p>
      <p>Animals and plants synthesize a number of proteins in their
        body. In the process of synthesis, each protein being formed
        emits a series of quantum-mechanical signals which are related
        with the amino acids sequence. By decoding the signals and
        transforming them into audible sounds, melodies proper to each
        protein are obtained, which are called, as a whole, "Protein
        Music". If the Protein Music is in turn played near animals or
        plants, the synthesis of corresponding protein is controlled
        through a kind of resonance phenomena. This is the essential
        difference of the Protein Music from that composed by human
        beings. </p>
      <p>The melody used in the experiment of tomatoes in Senegal was
        that of TAS14. </p>
      <p>In general, plants begin to produce a special protein when
        sufficient water is not available so that they can be resistive
        to scare water. The mechanism might be obtained in the course of
        evolution to survive even under severe circumstances. One of the
        proteins which increase resistance to water deficiency is the
        TAS14 of tomatoes. </p>
      <p>By playing the melody of TAS14 near the plants of tomato, the
        synthesis of the protein was promoted and water resistance
        became increased, which has lead to good growth of plants and
        fruits of tomato. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Music and "Musical Medicine"</font></b></center>
      <p>It is well known that Mozart promotes cows to produce milk. The
        reason for this phenomenon is not well investigated and
        explanation is given simply as: "Music must have made cows
        comfortable, which has contributed them to produce milk". </p>
      <p>However, according to the theory of "Protein Music" proposed by
        Dr. Sternheimer, this phenomenon can well be
        explained.&lt;/P&gt; </p>
      <p>Prolactin is known as a protein which promotes the development
        of mammary gland and the secretion of milk. This protein is also
        called a mammary gland stimulating hormone for its function. Dr.
        Sternheimer thought of translating prolactin into melody. As is
        expected, a typically Mozart-like passage was really included in
        the melody of prolactin. </p>
      <p>Next step is to verify the effects of the protein music. An
        experiment of milking cows under music was performed for two
        weeks: in addition to the melody of prolactin, those of
        lactogloblin and lactoalbumin were also used. The three types of
        music were diffused twice a day, ten minutes each time. </p>
      <p>Obtained milk contained an average of 3 to 4 times less whey as
        a result of the increase in prolactin, lactoglobulin and
        lactalbumin in the milk, which is the result just as expected. </p>
      <p>Cheese was made from the milk, which was presented for tasting
        test. Those who have tried it assured its excellence taste. The
        cheese was also brought to a shop in Paris where it was sold six
        times faster than usual during the two weeks of experiment. </p>
      <p>As is proved above, protein music acts on living creatures at
        the molecular level and produces desired effects. This is the
        essential difference of protein music from music composed may
        men. We must therefore pay attention not only to the merits but
        also to side effects of protein music. Cows, for example, risk
        to be easily affected with mammites with the excess of prolactin
        music. Human beings are not exceptions: protein music also has
        effects on them. </p>
      <p>Prolactin is, for human beings, also a stress hormone which is
        produced under physical fatigue or mental stress. By creating
        this hormone, we try to protect our bodies. Therefore, the
        melody which stimulates the synthesis of prolactin may have
        favorable effects in curing ulcer caused by stress. </p>
      <p>A lady speaks of her experience as follows: </p>
      <p>"I was affected with typical stomach ulcer. I was in bed and
        was to be brought to hospital for operation. Then, I decided to
        listen to thecassette of prolactin. During the night of the day,
        I felt really better. I listened it many times for a week. The
        ulcer then disappeared and thevolume of my bust became two times
        more than before. Since then, I am well." </p>
      <p>Excess of prolactin may cause leak of milk for women, and
        impotenceand/or feminization of bust for men. The melody of
        prolactin does not bring always merits for human beings. </p>
      <p>Protein music in general gives us a resonating feeling all over
        thebody if the melody is really necessary for the person. As if
        "it is really his music". The existence of this sensation is the
        only criteria for judging if the person may continue to listen
        to the melody. </p>
      <p>In summary, protein music must not be used for amusement and
        must be used personally, just as a medicine. In this sense,
        protein music may be called as a "musical medicine". </p>

        <i>Sat, 7 Feb 1998 18:24:19 +0100 (MET)</i> </p>
      <p>Hi all ! </p>
      <p>As promised, here's part 2 : the health and medical aspect of «
        protein music »&nbsp; - a promising but difficult field of
        research. </p>
      <p>So far, Joel has « decoded » about 600 proteins (vegetal or
        animal/human), and there is 100 000 known proteins in human
        cells. Of course his first choice was proteins who might have an
        interest for agriculture and for health. He did try them on
        himself, family, friends, friends of friends... Now, Joel is no
        MD, this is illegal stuff, even if it is done for free (which is
        the case). It may be safely discussed on an Internet mailing
        list, but it'd better not be mentioned in press or TV. And
        there's no scientific documentation. </p>
      <p>About 100 different protein melodies turned to have some effect
        on a wide variety of ailments, from flu to cancer &amp; AIDS. To
        my knowledge there was no complete healing for heavy
        pathologies, but rather better comfort, slowing down or stopping
        the evolution. I heard lots of case stories of good results for
        lots of things. </p>
      <p>One year ago we (I and my wife, Laurence) started attending the
        bi-monthly free seminars Joel was holding at Universite
        Europeenne de la Recherche (a non-profit educational association
        hosted, ironically, in the buildings of the State's Department
        of Research). We got to know him, and he gave us a lot of
        melodies to try. We soon bought a mini-disc, the only practical
        player for easy access and repeat - each piece last from 10
        seconds to 1 minute and you quickly end with dozens of them... </p>
      <p>Research for the right melodies was done by Joel, in lengthy
        testing sessions. It's a tricky affair. Joel has a thorough
        knowledge about his proteins and biology in general, but there
        is always different solutions to try, some of them not good for
        you. The fact that you spontaneously feel good while listening a
        melody is an indication, but no sure thing. Melodies can not be
        given haphazardly, or be publically available, for fear someone
        hears the wrong one and gets sick from it. At the time, I
        thought this precaution was a bit far-fetched. I learned
        otherwise. </p>
      <p>We eased pain with the beta-endorphin music, no problem, and
        headaches with histone 4. Of course placebo effect is common in
        analgesia, but we did it on friends who knew nothing about it
        and it worked. Collagen music had spectacular effects on bruises
        or burns. My wife once had a severe sunburn that disappeared in
        one hour. On the negative side, music for certain hormones was
        not so great for her, and I felt no effect with statherin (for
        dental cavities) or kininogen inhibitor (for hemorrhoids). One
        day I mentioned I had a tendency to grow intestinal polyps, and
        I got something for that. Thought it would be a long term
        effort, no easy way to see any result for years... But after
        hearing the melody twice, the next day, I had severe intestinal
        bleeding, which lasted 3 days. Needless to say, I never listened
        to it again - and never bled since. So I realized this was
        potent stuff, and not that easy to use safely. </p>
      <p>This very experimental stage is likely to last some time.
        Discreet and informal use is going on with a small batch of
        friends. Joel's time is obviously limited. A few other persons
        have learned to « prescribe », but nothing is documented or
        organized. There is no scientific testing at the moment. Joel is
        too much an off-beat character, and too ethically oriented (some
        would say obsessive) to fit in with institutional research. For
        example he can't stand the idea of sacrificing laboratory
        animals for medical tests. Maybe someone else will do it
        someday, or do a clinical human double blind research, but I
        can't see it happening soon It all sounds too weird for « normal
        » medical research. </p>
      <p>So right now Joel is concentrating on agricultural
        applications, a less touchy area. Once the technique is more
        validated (by big scale tests, and/or scientific publications),
        maybe the health aspects can get into the open. </p>
      <p>Well, that's it for today. I'll be glad to answer any further
        questions. </p>
      <p>Best regards to all ! <br>

      In the <i>New Scientist</i> of 28 May 1994, p.10, was an article
      about <b>Joel Sternheimer</b>, a french physicist and musician,

      grow <br>
      better. I don't know if he as tried DNA yet.
      <p>In 1988-89 I used a computer program called MacVector (I think
        I am right) that use to sing you entire DNA song. Four alphabets
        of DNA were given <br>
        specific tunes and you can fill in any DNA sequence in the

        <b>Abstract</b>: Mutual information function, which is an
        alternative to correlation function for symbolic sequences, and
        a symbolic spectrum are calculated for a human DNA sequence
        containing mostly intron segments, those that do not code for
        proteins. It is observed that the mutual information function of
        this sequence decays very slowly, and the correlation length is
        extremely long (at least 800 bases). The symbolic spectrum of
        the sequence at very low frequencies can be approximated by
        1/f/sup alpha /, where f is the frequency and alpha ranges from
        0.5 to 0.85. It is suggested that the existence of the
        repetitive patterns in the sequence is mainly responsible for
        the observed long-range correlation. A possible connection
        between this long-range correlation and those in music notes is
        also briefly discussed. </p>

Peptide







        palindromes are invariably found in all proteins, and long
        palindromes exceeding 10 residues in length are not rare. They
        are particularly abundant in DNA-binding proteins such as H1
        histone. When a complementary strand of the coding sequence is
        translatable being free of a chain terminator, a complementary
        protein encode by it becomes equally abundant in peptide
        palindromes. The simultaneous musical transformation of both
        strands of mouse H1 histone variety-1 DNA enable us to
        appreciate the symmetrical beauty of successive palindromes
        appearing in both H1 histone and its complementary protein.</p>

    </center>
    <blockquote>The globins are the protein products of a large and
      ancient multigene family, including the alpha and beta globins of
      hemoglobin , myoglobin, and even the leghemoglobins of plants. The
      common function of the globins is to bind oxygen. The sequences
      represented here are all beta globins. Functional hemoglobin
      contains two molecules each of the alpha and beta globin chains.
      The juxtaposition of the four chains, each of which can bind an
      oxygen molecule, allows hemoglobin to adjust its oxygen-binding
      capacity according to the oxygen concentration of its environment.
      <br>
      It is beta globin that is altered in human sickle-cell anemia and
      thalassemia. In sickle-cell anemia only one amino acid of 146 has
      been altered, while in thalassemia, the amino acid sequence is
      terminated prematurely. Both alterations lead to changes in
      folding pattern that severely alter the function of the molecule.
      In the normal folding pattern the six helical regions of the
      molecule are folded into a single compact domain. The folded
      protein encloses the iron-containing heme group to which the
      oxygen is bound.<b><font size="+1"><span style="text-decoration:

      There are two versions of beta globin that can be heard here:
      http://whozoo.org/mac/Music/BetaGlobin2.mp3 <br>
      <br>
      One is the piece composed by John Dunn for the CD Life Music.
      (&nbsp;
      http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/18/genetic_music.html&nbsp; ) In
      this setting, the beta globins of four mammals are represented:
      human, whale, bat and echidna (an egg-laying mammal). The piece
      begins with a human voice reciting the amino acid sequence of the
      protein. The names of the amino acids fade and are gradually
      replaced by their corresponding tones. The human and whale
      sequences dominate the piece, with counterpoint provided by the
      sequences of the other two species. The use of both speaking and
      singing human voices to represent parts of both the human and
      whale sequences underscores the similarities in their respective
      blood proteins.
      <p>The second beta globin was set by M. A. Clark, using John
        Dunn's recently developed BankStep program. (
        http://algoart.com/&nbsp; ) This composition was a simple etude
        and consists of two slow readthroughs of the protein over a
        background of low strings that play out the encoding DNA
        sequence. Several features of the protein are represented by
        different voices. The alpha helical regions that constitute much
        of the protein are played on harp, punctuated by a high chime
        that marks the turns. Overlaid on this are two additional
        voices, high strings playing the more soluble amino acids
        alternating with oboe playing the lower solubility amino acids
        of the protein's core. The two voices overlap for amino acids of
        intermediate solubility.</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>SEQUENCIA: The Music from DNA</b></center>
      <p>Announcing the release on CD of SEQUENCIA, <b>music composed
          by Susan Alexjander, in partnership with biologist David
          Deamer.</b> </p>
      <p>All the compositions on this CD are derived from the molecular
        vibrations of DNA, adjusted to the registers of the human ear. </p>
      <p>In SEQUENCIA, raw data derived from the light absorption
        spectra of the four bases (adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine)
        that make up the DNA molecule are converted into audible
        frequencies. These are processed by a Macintosh computer and
        performed by a music synthesizer, and are arranged into four
        pitch collections, or "scales", based on the individual base
        molecules. The synthesized material, mixed with vocals, cello,
        tabla, and violin, become the palettes for Alexjander's
        compositions, which range from somber and minimal to
        improvisational. </p>
      <p>The SEQUENCIA CD, released by Science &amp; the Arts as part of
        their Logos Series, which explores processes in the natural
        world, contains 3 works by Alexjander based on DNA: Eikos,
        Sequencia, and Pataphysical Thymine. The performers include
        Susan Alexjander, synthesizer; Don Lax and Wendy Reid, violins;
        Karen Andrie, cello; Diana Nieves, voice; Andrew McLester,
        tabla; William Trimble, alto saxophone. </p>
      <p><b>Susan Alexjander is a San Francisco Bay Area composer,
          performer, teacher, and radio broadcaster. She has taught
          courses and seminars&nbsp; on the physics and metaphysics of
          sound and music for over ten years. </b>Currently Ms
        Alexjander is gathering material on the geometry and&nbsp;
        patterns in the mineral domain for her second Logos Series CD.
        SEQUENCIA has appeared internationally on radio, CNN, and has
        been used as art music for dance. </p>

      <p>Composer Richard Krull, left, joined researchers Aurora Sanchez
        Sousa and Fernando Baquero in an interpretation of DNA code into
        easy listening music </p>
      <p><b>MADRID, Spain (AP) --</b> <b>Imagine the human genome as
          music. Unravel DNA's double helix, picture its components
          lined up like piano keys and assign a note to each. Run your
          finger along the keys.</b> </p>
      <p>Spanish scientists did that just for fun and recorded what they
        call an audio version of the blueprint for life. </p>
      <p>The team at Madrid's Ramon y Cajal Hospital was intrigued by
        music's lure -- how it can make toddlers dance and adults cry --
        and looked for hints in the genetic material that makes us what
        we are. They also had some microbial genes wax melodic. </p>
      <p>The end product is "Genoma Music," a 10-tune CD due out in
        February. "It's a way to bring science and music closer
        together," said Dr. Aurora Sanchez Sousa, a piano-playing
        microbiologist who specializes in fungi. </p>
      <p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is composed of long strings of
        molecules called nucleotides, which are distinguished by which
        of four nitrogen-containing bases they contain: adenine,
        guanine, thymine or cytosine, represented as A, G, T and C.
        These became the musical notes. </p>
      <p>French-born composer Richard Krull turned DNA sequences -- a
        snippet of a gene might look like AGCGTATACGAGT -- into sheet
        music. He arbitrarily assigned tones of the eight-note, do-re-mi
        scale to each letter. Thymine became re, for instance. Guanine
        is so, adenine la and cytosine do. </p>
      <h3>It's all in the genes</h3>
      Played solo on percussion, classical guitar or the other
      instruments used on the CD, the sequences would sound cute but
      rudimentary, the musical equivalent of PacMan in an era of
      Microsoft Xbox.
      <p>So the alphabet soup of bases served as just that, base lines
        to accompany melodies composed by Krull and his scientific
        colleague. They say the melodies were influenced, even dictated,
        by the mood and rhythm of the underlying genetic code. </p>
      <p>In general, the genome music is an easy-listening sound that is
        vaguely New Age. One of the prettiest songs is based on Connexin
        26, a human gene that causes deafness when it mutates. </p>
      <p>Another song draws on a yeast gene known as SLT2. Sanchez
        Sousa, the main author of the project, is fond of the sequence
        because it features a stretch in which one triplet of nitrogen
        bases appears several times in rapid succession -- a repetitive
        phenomenon that has a musical equivalent called ostinato. </p>
      <p>She declined to discuss marketing plans for the CD. She said
        she's circulated it only among academics so far, and
        psychologists in particular find it relaxing. </p>
      <p>Her team's plans for future music include having the hospital
        choir sing a vocal piece based on DNA from a bacteria. </p>
      <p>Seeking music in nature goes way back. In the 6th century B.C.,
        the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras argued that
        celestial bodies in rotation gave off pitched sounds that
        blended into a beautiful harmony he called "the music of the
        spheres." </p>
      <p>The idea is that matter and its behavior -- wheat fields
        shimmering and tongues of fire dancing -- may hold something
        intrinsic that can be transformed into music, said Dr. Fernando
        Baquero, head of microbiology at Ramon y Cajal Hospital. </p>
      <p>Maybe that's why people like music: It's already inside them
        anyway, so hearing it touches a piece of them, Baquero said. </p>
      <p>"When we like something, it is because we recognize it," he
        said. "It's funny, but to like is to recognize." </p>
