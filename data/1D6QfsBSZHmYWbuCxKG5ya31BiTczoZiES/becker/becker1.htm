        <p align="left">Silver can help regenerate human cells that have
          been destroyed by disease or damaged in accidents. </p>
        <p align="left">The silver-based procedure has been so
          successful in clinical tests, that one patient who had
          sustained three crushed fingers in an accident grew new tissue
          immediately. Within 2-1/2 months, skin coverage was complete
          and there was normal, full sensation, good blood supply and
          all joints had a normal range of motion. If left untreated,
          the 3~year-old electrician's fingers would have fallen off
          after turning black with gangrene, and he would have been left
          with a totally useless hand. In fact, his orthopedic surgeon
          recommended amputation of al1 three fingers, but the patient
          requested silver-ion therapy that was successful. </p>
        <p align="left">The mechanism by which silver ions help rebuild
          tissue has been studied for more than a decade by Robert O.
          Becker, M. D., Becker Biomagnetics, Lowville, New York. Becker
          first reported his findings at the First International
          Conference on Silver and Gold in Medicine, cosponsored by The
          Silver Institute in 1987. </p>
        <p align="left">In the decade since, this technique has been
          used in a clinical setting at Mountain Medical Specialties in
          Lakemont, Georgia, where hundreds of patients with various
          wounds have recovered. In addition, a laboratory study
          conducted by the U.S. Army Institute for Surgical Research in
          Fort Sam Houston, Texas, showed that laboratory animals with
          burn wounds treated under controlled conditions experienced
          shortened time for reconstruction with silver-nylon dressings.
          Recovery of skin function was faster when electric current was
          applied compared to no application of electric current. </p>
        <p align="left">Becker discovered that when positively charged
          silver ions are electrically introduced into wounds with a
          proprietary silver-coated nylon fabric used as the positive
          electrode, large amounts of primitive embryonic stem cells are
          produced. These stem cells are responsible for the
          reconstruction of destroyed tissue at a pace considerably
          faster than if the wound had been left to heal by itself. In
          other cases, the wound might not heal at all without the
          introduction of these stem cells </p>
        <p align="left">"The advantages of this technique," says Becker,
          "are the ease of use, use of the patient's own cells, no
          immune reaction, no need to use human fetusus as a source of
          stem cells, no need for anti-rejection drugs and it is
          economic." [bag - the pharmas just hate that] </p>
        <p align="left">On September 29, 1998, Becker received a U.S.
          patent (5,814,094) for the devices, materials and techniques
          involved in regeneration of tissue using silver ions. </p>
        <p align="left">After several hundred cases, Becker believes
          that the technique works in three stages. The first stage is
          the chemical combination of the highly active free silver ions
          with all bacteria or fungi present in the wound that are
          inactivated within 20 to 30 minutes. The second stage occurs
          over the next few days. Silver acts on fibroblast cells (the
          cells that normally cause wound healing by scar formation) to
          cause them to revert to their embryonic state, becoming stem
          cells. These cells are universal building blocks whose role is
          to reconstruct new tissue regenerating the original structure
          rather than simply to form scar tissue only. </p>
        <p align="left">In the final stage, silver ions form a complex
          with the living cells in the wound area to produce immediately
          convertible stem cells. As stem cells flood the wound, they
          are rapidly converted into new, mature normal tissues of the
          types present before the wound occurred. The end result of
          this conversion is complete restoration of all anatomical
          structures including nerves and blood supply with no scar
          formation. In all cases treated, no evidence of argyria
          (discoloration of skin) or any other side effect was noted. </p>
        <p align="left">No other known treatment provides sufficient
          numbers of the embryonic or stem cells required for true
          regeneration of damaged or destroyed tissue in humans and
          animals. This success indicates that there is the potential
          not only for the healing of near-surface wounds, but for
          regenerative repair of internal organs such as the heart,
          liver, brain and the spinal cord. </p>

          promoting tissue healing processes and inducing regeneration.
          The system includes a device and a method, a composition, and
          methods for making the composition in vitro and in vivo. The
          system is implemented by placing a flexible, silver-containing
          anode in contact with the wound, placing a cathode on intact
          skin near the anode, and applying a wound-specific DC voltage
          between the anode and the cathode. Electrically-generated
          silver ions from the anode penetrate into the adjacent tissues
          and undergo a sequence of reactions leading to formation of a
          silver-collagen complex. This complex acts as a biological
          inducer to cause the formation in vivo of an adequate blastema
          to support regeneration. </p>

        <p align="left"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p align="left"><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The present invention relates to an
          iontophoretic system for the stimulation of tissue healing and
          regeneration. In particular, the present invention relates to
          a method and device for stimulation of tissue healing and
          regeneration, a composition for use therewith, and methods for
          making the composition. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>2. Discussion of Background</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Healing, like all other biological processes, is
          a cellular process. The occurrence of an injury immediately
          triggers the onset of this process, which continues until the
          injury is healed. Although its exact mode of action is not yet
          understood, it is clear that a feedback mechanism monitors the
          extent of tissue damage and adjusts cellular activity in the
          injured area to produce the exact amount of healing needed. </p>
        <p align="left">As used herein, the terms "wound" and "injury"
          refer to tissue damage or loss of any kind, including but not
          limited to cuts, incisions (including surgical incisions),
          abrasions, lacerations, fractures, contusions, burns, and
          amputations. </p>
        <p align="left">Healing processes can be classified into three
          types, determined by how the cells in the injured area react
          to the injury. The simplest type of healing is scarification
          healing, wherein cells at the edges of a wound produce
          collagen and elastic fibers which simply bind the edges of the
          wound together without restoring severed nerves or blood
          vessels. This type of healing produces a visible scar, and
          sometimes results in numbness and circulatory inadequacy in
          the region of the wound and regions distal thereto. In the
          higher animals, including man, the heart, skeletal muscle, and
          nerve tissue (including the brain) heal by scarification. </p>
        <p align="left">A second type of healing is tissue replacement,
          wherein the cells of some body tissues produce more cells of
          their own kind to replace missing portions. In humans, the
          skin and portions of the gastrointestinal tract heal by
          replacement. In this type of healing, the replacement rate of
          the cells in the injured area increases to produce sufficient
          numbers of cells to help heal the injury, then returns to
          normal after healing is complete. Replacement is effective
          only if enough normal cells of the needed types are present in
          the area, and only for the particular types of cells that are
          capable of healing in this manner. Replacement is often
          inadequate for healing full-thickness skin wounds, which
          frequently heal with limited re-epithelialization, resulting
          in poorly innervated, thin and inelastic skin, while
          subcutaneous soft tissue defects heal primarily by
          scarification. However, such results are generally adequate
          for function if the wound is on the torso or the extremities
          (excepting the hand). </p>
        <p align="left">The most effective--and most complex--type of
          healing is regeneration. This type of healing is capable of
          replacing entire limbs and internal organs, and even portions
          of the brain and heart. Regeneration is a biphasic process. In
          the first phase, normal, mature cells at the site of the
          injury revert to an embryonic, unspecialized form
          ("de-differentiate"). These cells multiply rapidly, then
          become activated and demonstrate a variety of energetic
          processes which may include amitotic division, nuclear
          transfer, migration of free nuclei into residual tissues, and
          production of exceptionally large cells containing nuclear
          material from a number of individual de-differentiated cells
          (thus, "activated cells" are cells that undergo these
          processes). Activation results in the rapid accumulation of a
          large mass of embryonic cells known as the blastema, which is
          the essential element for regeneration. The blastema may be
          viewed as providing the biological raw material needed for
          rebuilding the missing tissues: formation of an adequate
          blastema results in complete regeneration of the missing
          tissues, whereas if the blastema is inadequate in size, only
          partial or incomplete regeneration takes place (formation of a
          stunted or incomplete part, or merely regeneration of
          individual tissue types that are not fully organized into the
          desired structure). </p>
        <p align="left">In the second phase of the regeneration process,
          the embryonic cells of the blastema respecialize
          ("re-differentiate") into the various types of cells needed to
          rebuild the missing tissues and organized structures in
          complete anatomical detail. The rebuilding process is
          essentially a recapitulation (albeit on a local scale) of the
          original embryonic development of the tissues being replaced.
        </p>
        <p align="left">In vertebrates, regenerative healing is found in
          certain species of amphibians (notably salamanders). It is
          almost totally lacking in humans, except in the fetus and in
          very young children (who may regenerate the distal finger tip
          if the wound is left open). In adults, regeneration is largely
          limited to parts of the fracture healing process. Clearly, it
          would be beneficial if humans could regenerate other damaged
          tissues, both in terms of more cost-effective treatment
          modalities and improved outcomes for patients. </p>
        <p align="left">The stimulus which initiates the complex
          regenerative process in amphibians has been reported to be a
          specific type of electrical signal, but the mechanism which
          provides the blueprint for the tissues to be regenerated is
          largely unknown. In the case of regeneration of individual
          tissues, however, a number of inducer substances that carry a
          specific signal causing either embryonic, de-differentiated,
          or mature cells to convert into specific tissue types have
          been identified. These "biological inducers" are analogous to
          chemical catalysts in that they effect cellular transformation
          by contact with the cells, but the inducer itself does not
          take part in the transformation. It is believed that
          biological inducers act by producing a signal in the nature of
          a specific electrical field which causes an event to occur on
          the surface of the target cell, which in turn causes the DNA
          in the target cell to alter the cell type in a specific
          fashion. By way of example, a "bone induction material" that
          causes the transformation of muscle cells into bone has been
          identified (M. Urist, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 70, pp.
          3511-3515 (1973)). </p>
        <p align="left">Healing in general is known to be related to the
          degree of the injury, the amount of nerve tissue present at
          the site, and the electrical potential difference between the
          site and surrounding intact tissue (the "current of injury").
          In particular, regeneration in amphibians such as salamanders
          and fracture healing in mammals are associated with complex
          changes in the local DC (direct current) electric field. An
          injury results in changes in the electric field and stimulates
          the animal's neural system, which in turn produces an
          electrical signal at the site of the injury, stimulating the
          complex cellular responses that eventually produce healing.
          The electric field gradually returns to normal, pre-injury
          levels as the injury heals. Conversely, failure of the normal
          healing process, as in fracture nonunions, is associated with
          the absence of appropriate electrical signals at the site of
          the injury. </p>
        <p align="left">These observations have lead to widespread use
          of electrical stimulation for the treatment of injuries in
          humans, especially fracture nonunions. Many studies have
          demonstrated that the application of small electrical currents
          (in the microampere range or lower) or weak magnetic or
          electric fields affects the growth or reunion of bone. See,
          for example, R. 0. Becker and A. A. Pilla, "Electrochemical
          Mechanisms and the Control of Biological Growth Processes," in
          Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry (ed. J. O'M. Bockris and B.
          E. Conway), Vol. 10, pp. 289-338 (1971); R. 0. Becker, et al.,

        <p align="left">Furthermore, electrically-injected silver ions
          are known to have significant antibacterial and antifungal
          properties. Silver is a well-known antibiotic, widely used in
          topical applications in the form of silver nitrate solution,
          silver sulfadiazine, and so forth. However, the useful
          antibacterial effect of such compounds is limited and due only
          to the small amount of free silver ions produced by
          dissociation of the compound or to formation of toxic
          by-products (for example, use of silver nitrate (AgNO.sub.3)
          solutions may lead to the formation of nitric acid). The
          antibacterial action of these ions is limited to a very
          localized effect directly on the wound surface. </p>
        <p align="left">Electrically-generated silver ions, on the other
          hand, penetrate at least approximately 1 cm into the wound and
          can be produced in much larger amounts than is possible with
          topical preparations such as silver sulfadiazine. Thus,
          electrically-injected silver is effective even against
          antibiotic-resistant strains, inhibiting bacterial growth in
          vivo and in vitro at current densities as low as 10
          nA/mm.sup.2 and concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/ml.
          Susceptible organisms include S. aureus, E col., Candida and
          Torulopsis. These effects are described in a number of
          publications, including the following: J. A. Spadaro, et al.,

        <p align="left">At any particular silver concentration,
          electrically-generated silver ions are more effective in
          inhibiting bacterial growth than silver salts (T. J. Berger,
          et al., "Electrically Generated Silver Ions: Quantitative
          Effects on Bacterial and Mammalian Cells," Antimicrobial
          Agents and Chemotherapy, Vol. 9, pp. 357-358 (1976); Hall, et

        <p align="left">Becker (U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,265) has disclosed
          processes and products that involve subjecting mammalian cells
          to the influence of electrically-generated silver ions. Anodic
          silver causes cells such as mammalian fibroblasts to assume a
          simpler, relatively unspecialized form and to resemble
          dedifferentiated or embryonic cell types. In mammals,
          including humans, this effect is associated only with the
          silver ions; the effect is not related to the electrical
          current or voltage. The afore-mentioned publications are
          incorporated herein by reference. </p>
        <p align="left">A variety of devices for use in electrical
          stimulation are known. Liboff, et al. disclose a noninvasive
          magnetic field generator for producing a controlled,
          fluctuating, directionally oriented magnetic field parallel to
          an axis projecting though the target tissue (U.S. Pat. No.
          4,932,951). An externally-generated magnetic field can be
          combined with the local magnetic field to produce a resultant
          field that enhances transfer of ions such as Ca.sup.++ across
          the membrane of a living cell (Liboff, et al., U.S. Pat. No.
          4,818,697). </p>
        <p align="left">Other devices make use of the antimicrobial
          properties of silver and other metals. Raad, et al. (U.S. Pat.
          No. 5,324,275) disclose a catheter tube surrounded by two
          parallel helical conductors made of copper, gold, silver or
          other heavy metals. When connected to a DC power source such
          as a 9-volt battery, ions are transferred between the
          conductors through body fluids, and induce an antimicrobial
          effect proximate the area between the conductors. </p>
        <p align="left">Milder (U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,520) describes a
          material containing dissimilar metal powders, such as silver
          and gold, silver and copper, or silver and platinum mixed into
          a conductive polymer substrate. When contacted by an
          electrolytic solution, each metal granule that contacts the
          electrolyte becomes either an anode or a cathode, so the
          material contains an array of small batteries. Metal ions are
          driven into the solution to kill bacteria on and near a device
          to which the material is affixed. The material can be used in
          devices such as catheters, cardiac pacemaker leads,
          artificial; hip joints, and so forth. </p>
        <p align="left">Seiderman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,401) describes a
          method for iontophoretic administration of medicaments such as
          silver protein (a colloid of silver with protein). The
          medicament is coated onto a metallic foil electrode so that,
          when in contact with a wound, natural body fluids and the
          negative electric charge of the wound site create a voltaic
          effect that causes the medicament to migrate into the wound. </p>
        <p align="left">Yamamoto (U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,049) and McKnight,
          et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,800,792) disclose collagen
          compositions used for wound treatment. Yamamoto contacts
          renatured collagen with a silver-ion-containing solution at pH
          between 4.0 and 9.0, forming a composition wherein silver ions
          are chelated to functional groups in the collagen. The
          composition is then exposed to UV radiation to strengthen the
          binding of the silver ions to the collagen. When the
          composition contacts bodily fluids, the silver ion is slowly
          released to protect the collagen from fungal and bacterial
          attack. McKnight's laminated collagen dressing is made from a
          layer of reconstituted collagen film laminated to a thin
          continuous layer of an inert polymer material such as
          polyurethane. Preferably, the collagen film contains finely
          divided silver metal particles, added by soaking the dried
          film in Tollen's reagent ((AgNH.sub.3).sub.2 OH) for 5 minutes
          to oxidize excess glutaraldehyde and deposit silver metal on
          the accessible surfaces of the collagen fibers. </p>
        <p align="left">Silver, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,323) dress a
          wound with a biocompatible, biodegradable collagen product and
          apply low intensity direct current in the range of 10-100
          microamperes. The collagen product may be a sponge made of
          collagen powder or flakes, and contains electrodes made of
          carbon or metal inserted therein. Donadelli (U.S. Pat. No.
          4,312,340) treats scarred skin using a solution containing
          embryonic placenta, collagen and vitreous humor extracts
          diluted in distilled water, treated by partial electrolysis to
          provide a formation of groups of amino acids. A variable low
          frequency electric field is applied to create an electric
          charge below the scarred area. Romero-Sierra, et al. (U.S.
          Pat. No. 3,799,162) apply histamine to a lesion, and then
          radiate the cells bounding the lesion with low intensity
          nonionizing electromagnetic radiation to stimulate production
          of collagen at the site. </p>
        <p align="left">Despite the wide variety of known treatment
          modalities, no known treatment produces sufficient numbers of
          the de-differentiated (i.e., embryonic) cells required for
          true regeneration in humans and other mammals. In fact, the
          treatment of injuries involving traumatic loss of skin and
          soft tissue, particularly for hand injuries, ranges from
          judicious neglect to major surgery. In the case of hand
          injuries, the twin requirements of flexibility and sensation
          mean that the above-described natural and enhanced healing
          processes are inadequate to yield good functional results. </p>
        <p align="left">There is a need for a flexible, effective system
          that helps promote and enhance tissue healing processes in
          mammals, including humans. Use of such a system would not only
          improve the outcome of the processes responsible for most
          healing in humans (scarification, tissue replacement), but
          would, in appropriate instances, induce true regenerative
          healing resulting in regrowth of the specific tissue types
          appropriate to the situs of the injury (normally innervated,
          full thickness skin, subcutaneous soft tissues, bone, etc.).
          The system would make use of simple, efficient delivery
          devices, be safe and easy to use, and be capable of being
          applied directly to the wound site. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">According to its major aspects and broadly
          stated, the present invention is an iontophoretic system for
          promoting tissue healing processes and inducing regeneration.
          The system includes a device and a method, a composition, and
          methods for making the composition in vitro and in vivo. The
          system is implemented as follows: a flexible,
          silver-containing anode is placed in contact with the wound, a
          cathode is placed on intact skin near the anode, and a
          wound-specific DC voltage is applied between the anode and the
          cathode. </p>
        <p align="left">Electrically-generated silver ions from the
          anode penetrate into the adjacent tissues and undergo a series
          of three reactions. First, the silver ions combine with
          proteins, peptides and various other chemical species normally
          present in solution in the tissues. The silver ions also
          combine with any bacteria, fungi or viruses present in the
          treatment area. If treatment is continued after all or most
          available sites for this type of reaction have been exhausted,
          the newly-generated silver ions associate with cells in the
          region, particularly fibroblast cells and epithelial cells,
          resulting in de-differentiation of these cells into embryonic
          cell types. Then, if treatment is continued after this second
          reaction is substantially complete, the free silver ions form
          a complex with collagen fibers present in the wound. This
          silver-collagen complex is believed to act as a biological
          inducer to activate the previously-produced de-differentiated
          fibroblast or epidermal cells to multiply and produce an
          adequate blastema. </p>
        <p align="left">In mammalian-including human-wounds treated at
          appropriate, wound-specific voltages, for a sufficient period
          of time to carry out the above-described reactions, and with
          anodes capable of supplying a sufficient number of silver ions
          for these reactions to take place, the resulting effects are
          analogous to those observed in animals that are naturally
          capable of regeneration. That is, the activated
          de-differentiated cells rapidly multiply to form a blastema
          that is adequate for supporting regeneration of the missing or
          injured tissues (skin, subcutaneous tissues, bone, and so
          forth). </p>
        <p align="left">A major feature of the present invention is the
          scaling of the applied voltage to the size of the wound.
          Surprisingly, an approximately constant voltage on the order
          of 0.1 V/in.sup.2 of wound area (about 0.0155 V/cm.sup.2) has
          been found to be optimum for promoting healing and
          regeneration of tissues while substantially avoiding the
          deleterious effects associated with biological electrolysis
          (to be described further below). Not only are specific
          voltages in this range remarkably effective in stimulating
          tissue healing and regeneration, but the electrically-injected
          silver ions are extremely effective against a wide variety of
          bacterial types (including gram positive, gram negative,
          aerobic and anaerobic forms), fungi, and local viral
          infections. Therefore, under optimal treatment conditions, the
          electrically-injected silver ions are an extremely effective
          agent against mixed infections and against many
          antibiotic-resistant strains. </p>
        <p align="left">An important feature of the invention is the
          anode, which is made of a material having a sufficiently high
          silver content to supply the needed silver ions to the wound.
          The anode is made of a flexible, silver-containing material
          that is conformable to the wound surface, such as
          silver-coated nylon fabric or the like. Materials usable with
          the invention contain a sufficient quantity of silver to
          produce an approximately constant current into the treated
          area for at least several hours, preferably 12-24 hours or
          thereabouts. Thus, silver-containing fabrics with a low
          specific resistance are needed, preferably fabrics having a
          specific resistance no greater than approximately 5
          .OMEGA./cm, preferably no greater than approximately 1
          .OMEGA./cm. Furthermore, fabrics with an approximately uniform
          silver content (i.e., a uniform silver content per unit area)
          that produce a uniform specific resistance throughout the
          electrode are preferred. Other metals (gold, copper, zinc, and
          so forth) may also be effective. </p>
        <p align="left">Another feature of the invention is the cathode,
          which, like the anode, is made of a flexible,
          electrically-conducting material, preferably a material having
          a specific resistance no greater than approximately 500
          .OMEGA./cm. By way of example, the cathode may be made of
          carbon rubber or like materials. </p>
        <p align="left">Still another feature of the invention is the
          placement of the cathode. For optimum results, the cathode is
          placed so as to achieve an approximately uniform flow of
          current through the treated region. In the human body, current
          tends to follow the shortest path from the anode to the
          cathode. Therefore, whenever possible, the cathode is
          positioned on the opposing side of the extremity being treated
          from the wound: for wounds on the palm of the hand, the
          cathode is placed on the back of the hand; for wounds on the
          dorsal surface of the forearm, the cathode is positioned on
          the ventral surface, and so forth. </p>
        <p align="left">Another feature of the invention is the
          silver-collagen complex, a specific physical association of
          the electrically-injected silver ions with the collagen fibers
          present in the wound area. While not wishing to be bound by
          theory, it is believed that this complex generates a unique
          localized electric field that activates embryonic cells in the
          treated area, eventually leading to formation of an adequate
          blastema to support regeneration. </p>
        <p align="left">Other features and advantages of the present
          invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a
          careful reading of the Detailed Description of a Preferred
          Embodiment presented below and accompanied by the drawings. </p>

          numerals refer to and identify the same structural elements,
          portions or surfaces consistently throughout the drawings, as
          such elements, portions or surfaces may be further described
          or explained by the entire written specification. The terms
          "proximal," "distal," "dorsal," "ventral," "volar,"
          "opposing," "anterior" and "posterior" are used in the
          customary anatomical sense. The "size" or "surface area" of a
          wound or injury means the approximate surface area on a
          macroscopic scale. The terms "scaled voltage" and "specific
          voltage" refer to the voltage per unit surface area, for
          example, V/cm.sup.2 or V/in.sup.2. Similarly, the term
          "specific resistance" means the resistance per unit surface
          area. </p>
        <p align="left">A number of critical factors have been
          identified that are required for the successful use of silver
          iontophoresis techniques to promote tissue healing and
          regeneration. These factors are as follows: </p>
        <p align="left">1. There is a critical, previously unsuspected
          relationship between the size of the wound and the optimum
          magnitude of the voltage applied across the anode and the
          cathode. Electrical injection of silver ions using an
          approximately constant DC voltage scaled to the size of the
          wound is surprisingly effective in promoting healing and
          regrowth of injured and missing tissues. Treatment is
          accomplished by placing a flexible, silver-containing anode in
          contact with the open surface of the wound, placing a cathode
          in contact with intact skin near the wound, and applying an
          appropriate DC voltage, generally for at least approximately
          24 hours. </p>
        <p align="left">2. The silver content of the anode should be
          high enough to ensure a low specific resistance, preferably a
          specific resistance no greater than approximately 5
          .OMEGA./cm, more preferably no greater than approximately 1
          .OMEGA./cm. Anodes with higher specific resistances may also
          be useful for the practice of the invention however, the
          optimum effect is achieved with low-resistance anodes. In
          addition, the silver should be approximately uniformly
          distributed (that is, the amount of silver per unit surface
          area of the anode should be approximately uniform). </p>
        <p align="left">3. The cathode should be a flexible material
          capable of making and maintaining a low resistance contact
          with intact skin, so that the combined specific resistance
          (i.e., cathode resistance and contact resistance) is no
          greater than approximately 500 .OMEGA./cm. </p>
        <p align="left">4. The cathode should be positioned to maximize
          current flow into the wound. </p>
        <p align="left">5. To maximize the input of silver ions into the
          wound, the current should be maximized by minimizing the total
          circuit resistance. </p>
        <p align="left">When these critical factors are present, an
          unexpected phenomenon occurs: the input of sufficiently large
          numbers of silver ions during a biologically appropriate time
          frame (within 3-5 days) enables formation of a complex between
          the silver ions and the collagen fibers in the wound. This
          silver-collagen complex acts as a biological inducer to cause
          the continual de-differentiation of fibroblast cells and the
          continual multiplication of previously de-differentiated cells
          in the area of the wound, leading to the accumulation of many
          more embryonic cells in the area and, eventually, formation of
          an adequate blastema to produce regeneration. These factors
          will be discussed more fully below. </p>
        <p align="left">Scaling the applied DC voltage to the size of
          the wound is crucial to successful treatment. The voltage
          should be high enough to ensure an adequate input of silver
          ions into the wound, but not so high that the deleterious
          effects caused by biological electrolysis become evident.
          "Biological electrolysis" or electrolysis in vivo differs from
          electrolysis in vitro in the following respects: electrolysis
          occurs in living tissues whenever there is current flow, no
          matter how small. However, a wide variety of naturally
          occurring agents act as buffers to prevent the accumulation of
          potentially harmful electrolysis products. These products are
          continually removed by blood and lymphatic circulation (which
          also ensures a continual supply of fresh buffers), thereby
          preventing a buildup of electrolysis products in the area. If
          the critical voltage is exceeded, this natural buffering
          action is rapidly overwhelmed and electrolysis products
          accumulate with attendant pH shifts. This point defines the
          onset of "biological electrolysis," which can be avoided by
          taking the above-described critical values of voltage/area
          into consideration. </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, selection of the appropriate treatment
          voltage requires a knowledge of what happens in living tissue,
          where the effects of electrolysis can be overcome by
          circulation and buffering factors up to a point. The effects
          of naturally-occurring buffers, blood circulation and lymph
          circulation depend on the size of the wound. Thus, the results
          of in vitro testing do not apply, nor do in vivo observations
          of only one size of wound--each wound has its own maximal
          voltage range which has to be clinically determined. </p>
        <p align="left">The critical specific voltage has been
          determined to be approximately 0.09-0.11 V/in.sup.2 (about
          1.4.times.10.sup.-2 -1.7.times.10.sup.-2 V/cm.sup.2),
          preferably approximately 0.1 V/in.sup.2 (about
          1.55.times.10.sup.-2 V/cm.sup.2). Not only are specific
          voltages in this range surprisingly effective in promoting
          tissue healing and regeneration, but the
          electrically-generated silver ions are extremely effective
          against a wide variety of bacterial types, including gram
          positive, gram negative, aerobic and anaerobic forms. Similar
          effects have been noted against a number of common fungi that
          colonize open wounds, and may also occur in a number of local
          viral infections (including herpes). Therefore, under optimal
          treatment conditions, silver ions are an extremely effective
          agent against mixed infections and against many bacteria that
          have become antibiotic-resistant. </p>
        <p align="left">For any given size of wound, voltages lower than
          optimum have no undesirable effects, but simply reduce the
          efficacy of treatment in an approximately linear fashion due
          to the production of fewer silver ions during any given period
          of time, and more limited electrophoretic migration of those
          ions into the tissues. At sufficiently low voltages, it is
          simply not possible to supply enough silver ions in the time
          frame required to produce the desired effects. </p>
        <p align="left">Higher voltages result in undesirable effects,
          also in an approximately linear relationship to the applied
          voltage. These effects range from irritation and slower
          healing at modest overvoltages to localized pH alterations due
          to accumulation of electrolysis products, cellular necrosis,
          and actual increases in wound size at higher overvoltages. The
          resulting buildup of dead tissue shields bacteria, fungi, etc.
          in the region from the silver ion action and limits the
          penetration depth of the ions. </p>
        <p align="left">Use of the appropriate anode material
          contributes to a uniform current/voltage distribution over the
          treatment area, together with a longer use time before the
          onset of polarization. Preferably, the anode is made of a
          flexible material with an approximately uniform silver
          content, for example, flexible, silver-containing fabric. In
          practice, the anode is replaced daily, thus, anode materials
          which are capable of supplying a sufficient quantity of silver
          ions for approximately 24 hours are preferred. Therefore, the
          silver content of the anode is preferably sufficient to yield
          a specific resistance no greater than about 1 .OMEGA./cm, as
          noted above. Anodes with somewhat higher resistance (lower
          silver content) may also be useful; however, these will be
          exhausted in shorter periods of time, necessitating more
          frequent replacement. Furthermore, higher-resistance anodes
          may lead to non-linear voltages and thereby reduce the
          efficacy of treatment. </p>
        <p align="left">The anode should also not only have a
          sufficiently high content of silver (or other suitable metal;
          see below), but the silver should be approximately uniformly
          distributed. Non-uniform distribution means that the wound
          will not be uniformly treated: some localized areas may be
          subjected to significantly higher specific voltages that
          others and the number of silver ions supplied to different
          areas will differ. In some such instances, the local specific
          voltage may be high enough to cause toxic effects. </p>
        <p align="left">It will be understood by those skilled in the
          art that suitable anode materials may include those containing
          silver alloys as well as substantially pure silver. Other
          metals that produce the desired results may also be usable in
          the practice of the invention, for example, gold, copper,
          platinum, zinc, and so forth. </p>
        <p align="left">Suitable cathode materials include flexible
          carbon rubber or the like (preferably containing the maximum
          possible amount of carbon or graphite), or carbon-filled or
          metal-containing fabric, having a specific resistance no
          greater than approximately 500 .OMEGA./cm. </p>
        <p align="left">Optimum cathode placement is determined by
          current flow in the human body. Current tends to follow the
          shortest path from the anode to the cathode (i.e., the body
          cannot be viewed as a single volume conductor). Therefore,
          part or all of the wound will not be adequately treated if
          cathode placement is nonoptimum. For example, for wounds on
          the palm of the hand, placement of the cathode on the wrist
          results in more silver ions being delivered to the proximal
          portion of the wound and frequently an inadequate amount to
          the distal portion. A more uniform distribution is achieved by
          placing the cathode on the opposite side of the hand (the
          dorsum), directly opposed to the palmar wound. </p>
        <p align="left">Optimal treatment according to the present
          invention has as its aim the continuous introduction of the
          largest possible population of silver ions into the wound
          until healing or regeneration is complete, in a fashion that
          does not introduce harmful by-products or produce deleterious
          effects on the cellular processes. As noted above, the total
          circuit resistance is minimized--and the current maximized--in
          order to maximize the number of silver ions delivered to the
          treatment site. The current may be monitored to ensure that
          there are no high-resistance areas in the circuit (for
          example, a dry treatment electrode, loose cathode, and so
          forth). </p>
        <p align="left">When introduced into living tissues,
          electrically generated silver ions undergo a series of three
          reactions in a sequential fashion (FIG. 1): </p>
        <p align="left">In the first reaction, the silver ions combine
          with proteins, peptides and other chemical species normally
          present in solution in the tissues. Further chemical or
          physiochemical combinations do not occur until all such simple
          sites are completely filled. The first reaction typically
          requires approximately 24 hours to go to completion (wherein
          the term "completion" refers to saturation of available
          sites). The antibacterial action of silver ions is a result of
          this type of process, beginning at about 20-30 minutes
          following exposure of the bacteria to the ions. </p>
        <p align="left">If more free silver ions are made available
          following the first reaction, the second reaction occurs. The
          second reaction is an association between the silver ions and
          sensitive cells present in the wound, resulting in
          de-differentiation of these cells into embryonic cell types
          (as used herein, the term "sensitive cells" refers to cells
          that are sensitive to free silver ions, including, among
          others, mature fibroblast cells and epithelial cells). These
          embryonic cells are not activated in the sense that they do
          not multiply to produce additional cells of the same type;
          however, they are capable of re-differentiation into other
          cell types. Hence, these cells do not form an adequate
          blastema mass to produce organized, multi-tissue regeneration.
          Production of de-differentiated fibroblasts requires a
          continuous supply of excess silver ions for at least
          approximately 48-72 hours following saturation of the active
          chemical sites in the first reaction ("excess" in this context
          means that more silver ions are supplied than are needed to
          combine with all available proteins, peptides, etc. in the
          above-described first reaction). </p>
        <p align="left">If sufficient silver ions are made available
          after the second reaction, a third reaction begins to take
          place. The third reaction constitutes a specific physical
          association of at least some of the silver ions with the
          collagen fibers present in the wound to produce a unique
          structure ("silver-collagen complex") having the specific
          properties required to induce activation of the
          de-differentiated fibroblast cells previously produced in the
          second reaction. </p>
        <p align="left">Collagen fibers have size-specific sites which
          are capable of forming a complex with hydrated metallic ions
          (J. A. Spadaro, et al., "Size-Specific Metal Complexing Sites
          in Native Collagen," Nature, Vol. 225, pp. 1134-1136 (1970)).
          The copper/collagen complex, in particular, has a unique
          electrical field which is involved in the initial epitaxial
          deposition of bone mineral (apatite) on bone collagen (A. A.
          Marino, et al., "Evidence of Epitaxy in the Formation of
          Collagen and Apatite," Nature, Vol. 226, pp. 652-653 (1970)).
          While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a
          silver-collagen complex according to the present invention has
          a unique local electrical field, and acts as a biological
          inducer to activate the de-differentiated fibroblast cells
          formed in the above-described second reaction. In mammalian
          wounds (including human wounds) treated at appropriate
          specific voltages with an excess of electrically generated
          silver ions, the formation of this silver-collagen inducer
          complex results in activation of the de-differentiated
          embryonic cells formed by the action of the silver ions on the
          pre-existing mature cells. Together, these effects result in
          cell behavior and action akin to those observed in animals
          that are capable of regeneration. In this fashion, an adequate
          blastema to support regeneration is formed in human tissue. </p>
        <p align="left">The above-described factors are designed to
          maximize the amount of silver ions introduced into the wound
          during the window wherein the above-described reactions can
          occur and lead to the formation of an adequate blastema for
          regeneration--a necessary condition for completing the
          sequence of three reactions within a biologically appropriate
          time. Of these factors, the first (scaling the applied voltage
          to the size of the wound) is believed to be crucial. If too
          few silver ions are provided, healing simply proceeds
          according to normal (i.e., nonregenerative) processes.
          Lower-than-optimum voltages reduce the efficiency of the
          treatment and lead to eventual failure of regenerative healing
          (although healing by scarification and tissue replacement will
          still occur). Higher-than-optimal voltages inhibit the third
          reaction (formation of the silver/collagen complex) due to pH
          shifts, accumulation of electrolysis products, tissue
          necrosis, and expansion of wound size. </p>
        <p align="left">Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a
          schematic view of an electrical stimulation device in use. A
          device 10 includes a DC power source 12 with a positive
          terminal 14 and a negative terminal 16. A treatment electrode
          or anode 20 is placed in contact with the surface of a wound
          to be treated, for example, a full-thickness defect 22 on the
          palm of a patient P. Anode 20 is made of a flexible,
          metal-containing material, preferably a flexible
          metal-containing fabric such as silver-impregnated or
          silver-coated nylon. Anode 20 may be covered by a "stent" of
          gauze moistened with normal saline and a cover (such as
          plastic film or like material), represented as 24. A return
          electrode (cathode 26) is placed in contact with intact skin
          near wound 22, for example, proximal to wound 22 as shown.
          Anode 20 and cathode 26 are connected to power source 12 by
          cables 30, 32, respectively. If desired, cathode 26 may be
          incorporated into power source 20, for example, attached to
          one side of the power source. </p>
        <p align="left">While treatment with the system shown in FIG. 2
          may be helpful, current flow (and, therefore, the supply of
          silver ions) to wound 22 is not optimized by the placement of
          cathode 26. As described above, the preferred placement of
          cathode 26 is one that results in an approximately uniform
          distribution of current through the wound, thereby ensuring
          approximately uniform delivery of silver ions thereto. Optimum
          placement of cathode 26 is on the opposite side of the body
          from the wound being treated, as illustrated in FIG. 3. For a
          wound 22 on a surface 44 of the body (for example, the palm of
          the hand), anode 20 is placed in contact with the wound, and
          cathode 26 is placed on an opposite surface 46 (for example,
          on the surface directly opposed to the palm). This placement
          ensures an approximately uniform distribution of current flow
          through wound 22, indicated schematically by arrows 48. </p>
        <p align="left">For optimum treatment, anode 20 substantially
          engages a surface 38 of wound 22, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
          The presence of void spaces (even if filled with conducting
          solution) results in inadequate treatment at those points.
          Depending on the extent of wound 22, anode 20 may be in
          contact with exposed subcutaneous tissues 42 as well as dermal
          tissue 40 at the margins of the wound. Thus, the material of
          anode 20 needs to be sufficiently flexible to conform to
          surface 38. As shown in FIG. 4, anode 20 is dimensioned to
          just cover wound 20, that is, anode 20 has a slightly larger
          surface area than the area of wound surface 38. </p>
        <p align="left">As described above, anode 20 contains a
          sufficient quantity of silver so that, when device 10 is
          connected for use as shown in FIG. 2, the current density
          delivered to wound 22 is approximately constant for a period
          of several hours, preferably at least approximately 24 hours.
          By "approximately constant current" is meant a DC current that
          may increase to a peak 50 immediately after the onset of
          treatment, but that decreases within several hours to an
          approximately constant level 52 and maintains that level until
          the onset of polarization at 54 (FIG. 5). FIG. 5 shows the
          current vs. time in vitro for a 25 cm.sup.2 section of a
          silver-coated nylon fabric usable with the invention, applied
          to a block of gelatin prepared with physiological saline. A
          standard return electrode was applied to the opposite face of
          the block and a voltage of 0.42 V applied between the two
          electrodes. The current density at peak 50 was approximately
          3.5 .mu.A/cm.sup.2, decreased to approximately 1.5
          .mu.A/cm.sup.2 within 5 hours, and remained at that level
          until the onset of polarization approximately 20 hours later.
        </p>
        <p align="left">A flow chart illustrating treatment according to
          the present invention is shown in FIG. 6. Patients are treated
          as soon as possible following the injury, preferably
          immediately following cleaning and debridement (if needed) of
          the wound. However, treatment may be initiated at any time
          thereafter, or whenever deemed medically necessary. The
          treatment electrode (anode 20) is applied directly to the
          surface of the wound, moistened with physiological saline or
          other suitable liquid, covered, and connected to the positive
          terminal of a low-voltage DC power source (such as source 12).
          The return electrode (cathode 26) is placed on intact skin
          near the wound (on an opposing surface whenever possible) and
          connected to the negative terminal of the source. Then, a low
          intensity DC voltage and current are applied continuously for
          a period of at least approximately 24 hours. The wound is
          inspected and cleaned daily, and anode 20 is replaced at that
          time. Cathode 26 is inspected daily and changed as needed. </p>
        <p align="left">Liquids suitable for use with the invention
          include electrically conducting liquids such as normal saline
          (also known as isotonic saline or physiological saline),
          Ringer's solution, wound exudate and other body fluids found
          in the area of the wound, and mixtures and dilutions thereof.
          Tap water may also be useful; however, the composition of tap
          water is so variable that other electrically-conducting
          liquids are preferred. The terms "normal saline," "isotonic
          saline" and "physiological saline" refer to a solution of
          sodium chloride (NaCI) in purified water (H.sub.2 O),
          containing approximately 0.9 gram of sodium chloride per 100
          milliliters of water. Such a solution is approximately
          isotonic (i.e., has the same osmotic pressure) with body
          fluids. The term "Ringer's solution" means a solution of about
          0.86 gram sodium chloride (NaCI), 0.03 gram potassium chloride
          (KCl), and 0.033 gram calcium chloride (CaCl) in purified
          water. The term "wound exudate" refers to any substance that
          is exuded from a wound, including materials that pass through
          the walls of blood vessel walls into the surrounding tissues.

        <p align="left">The key element in promoting healing and
          regeneration according to the present invention is the
          production of de-differentiated cells in the region of the
          wound, which in turn depends on the above-described critical
          factors. The voltage applied across the treatment (anode 20)
          and return (cathode 26) electrodes must be wound-specific,
          that is, proportional to the size of the wound (preferably,
          approximately 0.1 V/in.sup.2); the anode must have an
          approximately uniform silver content that is sufficiently high
          to ensure a specific resistance no greater than approximately
          1 .OMEGA./cm; the cathode must be made of a suitable
          low-resistance material capable of making and maintaining a
          low resistance contact with intact skin; the cathode is
          positioned so as to maximize current flow into the wound
          insofar as practicable; the total circuit resistance is as low
          as possible. In all instances, the treatment electrode is
          configured so as to yield an approximately uniform voltage
          distribution throughout the area of the wound. </p>
        <p align="left">Scaling the voltage to the size of the wound is
          particularly important in the case of larger wounds (that is,
          wounds with surface areas greater than approximately 8-10
          in.sup.2 (about 50-65 cm.sup.2), where a naonuniform voltage
          distribution through anode 20 may result in the production of
          electrolysis effects in localized "hot spots." </p>
        <p align="left">In all cases, the total voltage applied across
          anode 20 and cathode 26 is preferably no greater than about
          0.9-1.1 V. The the area of anode 20--and the size of a wound
          treated therewith--is therefore limited to approximately 9-11
          in.sup.2 (about 60-70 cm.sup.2). For larger wounds, two or
          more devices 10, each with its own anode, cathode, etc. are
          used, thereby ensuring that no single anode-cathode pair has
          an applied voltage greater than the preferred maximum. Thus,
          power source 12 may have several output voltages, each with a
          corresponding output terminal (for example, 0.1 V, 0.2 V, and
          so forth) for treatment of wounds of the corresponding size.
          Anodes 20 for use with such a power source have terminals that
          allow them to be connected only to the output terminal with
          the correct output voltage: a 1"-square anode to the 0.1V
          terminal, a 2"-square anode with the 0.2V terminal, and so
          forth. </p>
        <p align="left">During treatment, silver ions from anode 20
          migrate into the tissues surrounding wound 20, where the ions
          undergo the three reactions shown in FIG. 1: binding to
          proteins, peptides, etc. in the area; de-differentiation of
          normal cells (primarily fibroblasts) into primitive,
          de-differentiated cells, and binding to collagen fibers to
          form a silver-collagen composition that in turn activates the
          de-differentiated cells. The activated cells multiply rapidly
          and re-differentiate to form the specific types of normal
          mammalian cells needed to restore the region to its pre-injury
          state (dermal and epidermal tissue, muscle tissue, nerve
          tissue, blood vessels, bone cells, and so forth, as may be
          needed for the particular site being treated). </p>
        <p align="left">As noted above, silver compounds such as
          AgNO.sub.3 have long been known to possess bactericidal and
          fungicidal properties; however, compounds of the higher
          oxidation states of silver (Ag(II) and Ag(III)) have recently
          been found to be significantly more effective than monovalent
          (Ag(I)) compounds (M. S. Antelman, "Silver (II,III)
          Disinfectants," Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, March,
          1994, pp. 52-59). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it
          is thought that the superior bactericidal and fungicidal
          effects of electrically-generated silver ions may be due at
          least in part to the formation of free silver ions of these
          higher oxidation states and their action on bacteria, fungi,
          etc. present in the tissues. </p>
        <p align="left">It is believed that the silver-collagen complex
          formed at the treatment site results from a specific
          attachment of silver ions to collagen fibers, resulting in the
          formation of electrically active sites which act as biological
          inducers to activate the de-differentiated fibroblast cells.
          The complex may also have a de-differentiating effect on at
          least some of the remaining silver-sensitive cells in the
          area, but without requiring the direct attachment of the
          silver ion to the cell membrane as in the second reaction
          (FIG. 1). Thus, optimum treatment conditions result in a
          greater immediate effect on the cellular components in the
          wound area than do silver ions alone, since a much greater
          number of active de-differentiated cells are produced than
          would result solely from the direct action of
          electrically-introduced silver ions on the fibroblast cells.
          The complex also permits the expression of additional long
          term healing and maturational effects after active silver
          treatment is terminated, as will be described further below. </p>
        <p align="left">The silver-collagen complex may be prepared in
          vitro by application of low-voltage DC current from a silver
          anode to a collagen-containing substrate, then formed into
          suitable shapes (rolls, sheets, etc.) for external application
          to surface wounds or internal application to body parts (if
          desired, the complex may be incorporated into a wound
          dressing). The complex may act to produce de-differentiation
          of mature, sensitive cells; alternatively it may activate
          previously de-differentiated cells in the area. For
          applications where there are insufficient numbers of mature
          fibroblast cells present, the complex may be infiltrated with
          de-differentiated cells produced by the above-described
          technique in order to provide a source of de-differentiated
          cells to start the in vivo induction process. </p>
        <p align="left">The present invention is further illustrated in
          the following nonlimiting examples. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Portions of granulation tissue ranging in size
          from approximately 1-2 mm were removed from optimally treated
          wounds and explanted into an appropriate tissue culture
          medium, resulting in the formation of large numbers of new
          cells in the culture medium. The new cells were embryonic in
          nature and formed in contact with the explants, multiplying
          rapidly and spreading out from the explants until
          approximately 3/4 of the culture dish was covered with
          embryonic cells. New cell formation ceased after 3-4 weeks,
          and all the cells then present reverted to normal fibroblast
          morphology. No further cell multiplication occurred. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Explants of granulation tissue were cultured as
          described in Example 1; however, the original explants were
          removed from the culture medium before cessation of new cell
          formation. All new cell production ceased after removal of the
          explants from the culture medium. Histological analysis
          revealed that the explants removed from the culture medium
          were composed solely of collagen fibers. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Explants of granulation tissue were cultured as
          described in Example 1. The explants were removed from the
          culture medium at approximately 1-week intervals, placed in
          sterile saline and refrigerated for 3-5 days. All new cell
          production ceased after removal of the explants from the
          culture medium; cell production resumed after the explants
          were re-implanted in the medium. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Granulation tissue from a wound treated with a
          specific voltage greater than the above-described optimum was
          explanted into a suitable tissue culture medium. No new cell
          production was observed, regardless of the length of time the
          culture was maintained. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Granulation tissue from an optimally treated
          wound was maintained in tissue culture until the cessation of
          new cell formation, but before reversion of the embryonic
          cells to mature fibroblasts. The explanted granulation tissue
          was removed, injected with silver ions for approximately two
          hours, and then re-implanted into the original culture medium
          at its original site. New cell production resumed. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Gelatin blocks were prepared from commercial
          collagen product in a normal saline solution. After hardening,
          the blocks were subjected to appropriate levels of DC voltage
          from a silver anode for 12 hours. After cessation of
          electrical treatment and removal of the anode, the blocks
          demonstrated a voltage and current production only slightly
          lower than that administered for an additional 10-12 hours. </p>
        <p align="left">While the exact structure of the silver-collagen
          complex has not been determined, Examples 1-6 indicate the
          production of such a complex under the appropriate conditions
          (i.e., when wounds are treated with the optimum specific
          voltage). The complex does not form when wounds are subject to
          higher voltages. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 7</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Volunteer patients were treated for a wide
          variety of traumatic wounds using the above-described
          methodology, including wounds to the extremities which may
          heal with difficulty due to poor natural healing processes.
          Each patient was advised of the experimental nature of the
          treatment and was offered conventional treatment; each patient
          who selected the experimental treatment was free to
          discontinue it at any time. Treated wounds included burns,
          lacerations, crush injuries, amputations, and infections.
          Patients ranged in age from 2.5 years to 81 years. </p>
        <p align="left">Patients were treated as soon as possible
          following the trauma. Debridement, if needed, was done under
          anesthesia. Silver ions were introduced directly into the
          wound by means of a small electrical current from a
          silver-containing nylon anode as described above. The
          treatment electrode (anode 20) was cut to approximately fit
          the wound, wetted with tap water and/or normal saline, and
          applied directly to the wound. The electrode was then covered
          with a small flexible, carbon-rubber electrode with an
          integral, thin, flexible wire that was connected to the anode
          of a DC power source. The wound was then wrapped in a soft
          dressing with a water-impermeable layer to prevent the
          dressing from drying out. </p>
        <p align="left">The return electrode (cathode 26) was placed on
          the opposing side of the limb from the wound as indicated in
          FIG. 3. Where this placement was not feasible (for example,
          fingertip injuries), the return electrode was placed proximal
          to the wound as shown in FIG. 2. The power source was a
          voltage-controlled, battery operated solid state unit set to
          deliver a constant, direct current voltage. </p>
        <p align="left">Most patients were treated on an outpatient
          basis after the patient and his/her family members were
          instructed in the techniques of electrode preparation and
          application. Treatment was continuous; the anode was changed
          daily with no special sterile precautions. The cathode was
          removed daily, cleaned with tap water and reapplied to the
          original site. All patients continued their daily dressing
          changes at home with weekly follow-up visits; all reported
          minimal difficulty or pain associated with the dressing
          changes. Patients with obviously contaminated wounds were
          given systemic antibiotics for the initial three days of
          treatment to prevent systemic infection (for example,
          infection resulting from any initial surgical debridement). No
          infections occurred in the entire series; all pre-existing
          infections cleared rapidly (within 3-4 days). Patient
          compliance was excellent, and treatment was terminated when a
          satisfactory clinical result was achieved. </p>
        <p align="left">A total of 24 wounds were treated, including
          bums, lacerations, crush injuries, open fractures,
          amputations, and infections. All wounds involved soft tissue
          loss with full thickness skin loss ranging in area from 1
          cm.sup.2 to 18 cm.sup.2 with an average of about 4 cm.sup.2.
          Treatment voltages ranged from about 0.3 V to about 0.9 V,
          depending on the surface area of the wound. Current densities
          ranged from approximately 4-8 .mu.A/cm.sup.2, with the
          magnitude of the current in individual cases being dependent
          upon the surface area of the wound. Treatment times ranged
          from 7 to 72 days, with an average of 30 days; follow-up times
          ranged from 2 to 22 months with an average of 10 months. </p>
        <p align="left">All patients regained their preinjury activity
          level; all patients with occupational injuries returned to
          their original or equivalent occupations. Despite the lack of
          sterile precautions, there were no infections (in one case, a
          pre-existing post-operative infection was well treated with
          the silver ions alone). </p>
        <p align="left">In all cases, full thickness skin loss was
          replaced with normal-appearing, full thickness, flexible skin
          appropriate to the area, with regrowth of subdermal tissues
          and minimal or no scarification. Initially, the skin appeared
          to be full-thickness, flexible and innervated; however, it was
          darker than normal and underwent a subsequent maturation
          period of several months before gradually acquiring a more
          normal coloration, dermatoglyphic pattern, and hair growth (in
          appropriate regions). The normal dermatoglyphic pattern on
          volar skin areas became more evident with the passage of
          additional time following treatment. Skin areas were sensitive
          to light touch, and almost all patients reported the sensation
          in the area to be subjectively normal without paresthesias,
          numbness or cold intolerance; only three patients had less
          than fully normal sensation. Typical results were as follows:
        </p>
        <p align="left">Patient 1. An 11-year-old female lacerated the
          radial aspect of the left thumb, incurring a full-thickness
          skin loss of approximately 2 cm.sup.2 in area extending from
          the midpoint of the nail to the mid IP joint and centered over
          the neutral line between dorsal and volar skin. Treatment
          using an appropriate voltage was instituted on the day of
          injury and continued for 28 days. </p>
        <p align="left">At the conclusion of treatment, the wound was
          completely healed with apparently full-thickness skin of a
          darker than normal coloration, and with good sensation. Normal
          dorsal-type skin was regenerated dorsal to the neutral line;
          normal volar skin was formed volar to the neutral line.
          Coloration and sensation returned to normal over the next
          month, accompanied by a full range of motion at the IP joint.
          Thirteen months post-injury, there was no scarring or
          contracture; sensation was completely normal and the area of
          the original injury could not be discerned. </p>
        <p align="left">Patient 2. A 28-year-old male incurred multiple
          longitudinal lacerations of the distal phalanx, middle finger
          right hand, in an industrial accident. On admission, the
          finger tip was noted to be "filleted" with three deep
          longitudinal lacerations extending from the dorsal to the
          palmar surface and proximally into the nail bed with total
          avulsion of the nail and exposure of the terminal phalanx. The
          skin over the central portion was insensate. </p>
        <p align="left">The wound was immediately irrigated, the various
          parts loosely approximated with an absorbable suture and
          dressed with silver-containing nylon fabric, and treated with
          an appropriate voltage. Antibiotics were given for 3 days
          starting immediately post-operative. Seven days after start of
          treatment, there was evident healing of the laceration;
          treatment was terminated 20 days later. At that time, the skin
          was almost completely healed, there was a normal contour to
          the finger tip and sensation was present in the central
          portion of the wound. Two months after injury, there was
          minimal scarring on the distal pad, a normal appearing nail
          was approximately 50% regrown, and normal sensation and range
          of motion were present. At 12 months follow-up, the finger was
          asymptomatic, normal in appearance, and fully innervated with
          normal sensation. </p>
        <p align="left">Patient 3. A 33-year-old male utility worker
          contacted a 7,200-volt electrical line through both hands. He
          was unconscious for several minutes and incurred bums of the
          right hypothenar eminence and dorsum of the left hand at the
          MCP joint line. The hypothenar burn extended from just distal
          to the 5th MP joint to the base of the 5th metacarpal and
          consisted of three confluent, ovoid areas of full-thickness
          skin loss, with a total area of approximately 12 cm.sup.2.
          These areas were blanched and without sensation. The extent of
          subcutaneous necrosis could not be estimated. The dorsal bum
          of the left hand involved the second through the fifth MCP
          joint dorsal surface with full-thickness skin loss over the
          protuberant areas totaling approximately 4 cm.sup.2. </p>
        <p align="left">Treatment was begun to both hands on the 4th day
          after injury, and continued for 16 days on the left hand and
          32 days on the right hand. At the end of the treatment, the
          wounds on the dorsum of the left hand were epithelialized with
          full-thickenss, flexible skin with good sensation and normal
          range of motion in the MCP joints. The distal half of the
          hypothenar wound on the right hand was re-epithelialized with
          full-thickness sensate skin. The proximate half of the wound
          was normal in contour and covered with full-thickness skin
          except for an approximately 1 cm.sup.2 area in the center
          which was covered with thinner skin. Six months after injury,
          the hypothenar burned area of the right hand was fully
          innervated and flexible with a normal range of motion of the
          MCP of the little finger. At that time, the skin was beginning
          to acquire a normal color and dermatoglyphic pattern. </p>
        <p align="left">Patient 4. A 54-year-old male injured his left
          foot in a lawnmower accident, resulting in extensive soft
          tissue injury and open fractures of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
          metatarsals and cuboid bone. He underwent debridement and
          stabilization on the day of the accident. Further debridement
          was done on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 23rd days after the
          accident. Due to the amount of soft tissue loss and bone
          injury (FIG. 7a), the patient was scheduled for a vascularized
          composite graft to the injured area. He was given a 50% chance
          of success, and was advised that the foot might have to be
          amputated if the surgery failed. </p>
        <p align="left">Treatment was initiated on the 32nd day after
          injury; the patient was placed on oral antibiotics for four
          weeks. Seventeen days after the start of treatment, the wound
          was debrided, a portion of avascular bone was removed, and two
          pins that were projecting into the open wound were removed. </p>
        <p align="left">Thirty-one days after the start of treatment,
          the gross infection had resolved and the wound was closing
          very well (FIG. 7b). Over the next four months the wound
          closed to a small opening (FIG. 7c). At that time, it was felt
          that an underlying osteomyelitis precluded complete closure of
          the opening. Therefore, the bone was debrided under local
          anesthesia and treatment continued. The wound was completely
          closed and healed within two months thereafter (FIG. 7d). The
          patient has continued to do well; he has regained an excellent
          range of motion of the foot with a normal gait pattern. </p>
        <p align="left">Patient 5. A 21-year-old male caught the middle
          finger of his right hand in a metal press, and lost the distal
          one-half of the distal phalanx of the middle finger at the
          level of the base of the nail. Treatment according to the
          present invention was initiated immediately upon presentation,
          without wound debridement. After 2 days, the patient was pain
          free and able to change the dressings by himself. Seventeen
          days after treatment was initiated, regeneration of bone and
          soft tissue was apparent (FIG. 8b). Thirty-eight days
          afterwards, the distal phalanx was fully restored with
          organized, multitissue structure; regeneration of appropriate
          tissues (skin, muscle, nail, etc.) was underway. Treatment was
          discontinued at this time. </p>
        <p align="left">Seven weeks after cessation of treatment, the
          nail was almost completely restored and the volar surface of
          the finger tip had a normal dermatoglyphic pattern (FIG. 8e).
          The patient had a full range of motion of the finger and
          normal sensation of the finger tip, with no permanent physical
          impairment. </p>
        <p align="left">Scaling the treatment voltage to the size of the
          wound, in conjunction with the other above-identified factors,
          allows the entry of sufficient numbers of free silver ions
          into the wound to optimize healing and, in appropriate cases,
          induce regeneration of missing tissues. It is believed that
          the observed results were largely due to the action of the
          silver-collagen complex which produced a large volume of
          de-differentiated cells in the treatment region. The residual
          silver-collagen composition in the area is believed to be
          responsible for the observed long-term continuation of the
          healing and maturational process after cessation of active
          treatment, eventually resulting in the restoration of
          substantially normal function. </p>
        <p align="left">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art
          that many changes and substitutions can be made to the
          preferred embodiment herein described without departing from
          the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by
          the appended claims. </p>

                  Silver"</font></b></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">Dr. Becker first used silver in 1971. His
          experiments at this time focused on proving that minute
          amounts of electrical current could dedifferentiate cells and
          stimulate limb regeneration in rats. For his experiments, Dr.
          Becker elected to use a platinum electrode as the negative
          pole ( cathode ) and a pure silver electrode as the positive
          pole ( anode ) with a 106 - 108 Megohms resistor wired into
          the circuit. He implanted the device in 35 rats, and achieved
          the most notable results using 1 nanoamp of current. </p>
        <p align="left">In 1972, Dr. Becker was ready to begin
          experimentation with electrical stimulation for bone growth in
          humans, particularly in cases where broken bones ( nonunions )
          refused to heal. Again, Dr. Becker chose to use silver,
          primarily because he believed silver was less likely to
          chemically react with tissues and he believed that silver
          would transmit the electrical current most efficiently. </p>
        <p align="left">Testing conducted by Dr. Becker's team
          demonstrated that the positive pole of a silver electrode in a
          low current circuit would kill all forms bacteria within a 1/2
          inch radius. Dr. Becker hypothesized that this effect was due
          to the delivery of silver ions directly into the adjacent
          tissues. Never-the-less, his primary concern was that the
          positive current at the treatment site might cause delays in
          healing. Up to this point, research indicated that growth
          stimulation occurred at the negative electrode. </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Becker eventually concluded that while all
          five of metals they tested stopped growth of all bacteria, the
          current required for all types except silver required
          dangerously high levels of current. Dr. Becker hypothesized
          that the other metals killed bacteria by poisoning the
          bacteria and normal cells. Eventually, Dr. Becker confirmed
          that the silver deactivated or killed all bacteria with no
          side effects with small ( and safe ) levels of current. </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Becker eventually began experimenting with
          silver-impregnated nylon as a form of wound dressing designed
          to kill bacteria; he continued to use "positive current" to
          kill bacteria and "negative current" to stimulate tissue/bone
          growth. Becker's team commonly used between 100 to 200
          nanoamps of electrical current per centimeter of electrode in
          their research. Dr. Becker concluded that other researchers
          were using far too much current in related experimentation,
          and that electricity exceeding one volt posed the possibility
          of dangerous side effects in nearby tissues. </p>
        <p align="left">In 1977, Becker first noticed that the silver
          anode ( positive pole ) appeared to actually be stimulating
          bone growth as well as eliminating infections. By 1978 he had
          repeated this phenomenon a number of times, and decided to
          reevaluate the theory that only the negative current
          stimulated tissue growth. </p>
        <p align="left">In 1980 Dr. Becker, through extensive research
          and experimentation, concluded that the current was not the
          determining factor with this stimulated growth. Rather, it was
          the silver ions that were responsible for the accelerated
          healing at the anode. He found that cells within 5 millimeters
          of the silver were actually altered. In cultures, Dr. Becker
          demonstrated that silver ions effected cell changes to the
          extent that the cells grew extremely quickly, producing
          primitively formed cells including fully dedifferentiated
          cells and rounded fibroblasts. Furthermore, the process of
          using silver ions to stimulate healing resulted in a 50%
          reduction in the healing time. </p>
        <p align="left">While it is universally accepted by
          knowledgeable researchers that silver ions can, in fact, alter
          cell morphology, some dispute the claim that actual cell
          dedifferentiation occurs. However, these conflicting findings
          may be due solely to the actual amount of current used;
          increased levels of current may in fact interfere with the
          process. Dr. Becker is virtually alone in the belief that the
          amount of current used should be minute, approaching the same
          levels of the natural DC current present in the human body. </p>
        <p align="left">Before Becker's research group dissolved, Dr.
          Becker found that silver ions, electrically injected, could
          suspend the mitosis of ( cancerous ) malignant fibrosarcoma
          cells. Dr. Becker hypothesized that cancer cells, regardless
          of the initial cause, were cells caught in a partially
          differentiated and primitive state. However, this promising
          research was never fully explored. </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Becker's conclusion was that low-current
          silver electrodes stimulate bone formation by
          dedifferentiating cells and possibly stimulating periosteal
          cells. Dr. Becker's greatest cautionary note is the
          observation that high levels of current will stimulate cancer
          cell growth; the key is low-current with pure silver
          electrodes. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Research Points of Interest</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Red blood cells of a frog can be
          dedifferentiated by using extremely small amounts of current,
          measured in billionths of amperes. <br>
          Bone growth stimulation occurred with platinum electrodes ( at
          the negative electrode ) at a maximum of 3 micro amps (
          generated by a power source delivering an initial 100 micro
          amperes ) <br>
          The average amount of voltage required to induce electrolysis
          in human tissues was 1.1 volts of direct current ( any amount
          of current above this point can cause cell damage or cell
          death ) <br>
          Becker's group demonstrated that by using silver electrodes
          and 0.1 micro amperes of current, bone growth stimulation
          still occurred, and nonunion fractures healed. <br>
          Dr. Becker noted that cancer cell growth was stimulated by
          300% using the 10 microampere method. <br>
          Dr. Becker noted that the combined effect of the proper level
          of current and the delivery of silver ions could
          dedifferentiate cancer cells; both elements must be correctly
          applied for any results ( the activation of primitive-type
          genes in a cell nucleus ). <br>
          Dr. Becker realized that the silver electrode method could be
          used on a patient's cells, and that large quantities of
          primitive cells could be stored for use at later date. </p>
        <p align="left">In January of 1980, primarily due to political
          reasons, the inflow of research grant money stopped, and Dr.
          Becker was forced to close his laboratory, even though he was
          likely on the verge of incredible breakthroughs in full tissue
          and organ regeneration in humans. </p>

        <p align="left">Dr. Robert Becker, " The Body Electric,"
          recognized a correlation between low silver levels and
          sickness. He said the silver deficiency was responsible for
          the improper functioning of the immune system. Dr. Becker's
          experiments conclude that silver works on the full spectrum of
          pathogens without any side effects or damage to any part of
          the body. He also states that the silver was doing something
          more than killing disease organisms. It was also causing major
          growth stimulation of injured tissues. Burn patients and
          elderly patients noticed more rapid healing. He discovered
          that all cancer cells change back to normal cells. All strains
          of pathogens resistant to other antibiotics are killed by
          colloidal silver. Yet at that time he couldn't find a silver
          supplement on the market. </p>

        <p align="left">A project begun at the State University of New
          York by Robert Becker and associates involved a silver nylon
          product in the early 1970s. This project was originally
          instigated in order to find an electromagnetic shield.
          Instead, it lead to the revolutionary discoveries by Becker of
          silvers unique antimicrobial properties, and his discovery
          that silver ions could induce fibrocytes to dedifferentiate
          into stem cells and back again. One of Beckers research
          associates, A. Bart Flick, continued work in this area for
          professional and commercial applications. As a result, Flick
          has filed patents in 1994, 1996 and 2000 for silver-based
          wound dressings that are far superior to anything that has
          ever been available before. He has also obtained approval for
          these dressing from the US Food and Drug Administration.
          Because of the success of these silver dressings, many other
          medical product manufacturers have filed for their own
          parallel products... </p>

        <p align="left">The Silver Institute, Washington DC <br>
          July 27, 1999 </p>
        <p align="left"><i>Washington, D.C.</i>  Silver, the same
          commodity used in coins and in the manufacture of jewelry,
          silverware, mirrors and electronics, helps regenerate human
          cells that have been destroyed by disease or damaged in
          accidents, according to a recently released report in this
          month's edition of Silver News, a bi-monthly newsletter
          published by The Silver Institute. </p>
        <p align="left">Clinical tests indicate that the silver-based
          procedure is so successful that one patient who had sustained
          three crushed fingers in an accident grew new tissue rapidly.
          Within 2-1/2 months, skin coverage was complete and there was
          normal full sensation, good blood supply and all joints had a
          normal range of motion. If left untreated, the 30-year old
          electrician's fingers would have fallen off after turning
          black from gangrene, and he would have been left with a
          totally useless hand. Ironically, his orthopedic surgeon
          recommended amputation of all three fingers, but the patient
          requested silver-ion therapy which proved successful. </p>
        <p align="left">The mechanism by which silver ions help rebuild
          tissue has been studied for more than a decade by Dr. Robert
          Becker of Becker Biomagnetics in New York. Dr. Becker
          initially reported his findings at the First International
          Conference on Silver and Gold in Medicine, co-sponsored by The
          Silver Institute in 1987. In the decade since, this technique
          has been used in clinical settings where hundreds of patients
          with various wounds have recovered. In addition, a laboratory
          study conducted by the U.S. Army Institute for Surgical
          Research in Houston, Texas, showed that laboratory animals
          with burn wounds treated under controlled conditions
          experienced shortened time for reconstruction with
          silver-nylon dressings. Recovery of skin function was faster
          when electric current was applied compared to no application
          of electric current. Last fall, Dr. Becker received a U.S.
          patent (5,814,094) for the devices, materials, and techniques
          involved in regeneration of tissue using silver ions. </p>
        <p align="left">After several hundred cases, Dr. Becker believes
          that the technique works in three stages. The first stage is
          the chemical combination of highly active free silver ions
          with all bacteria or fungi present in the wound which are
          inactivated within 20 to 30 minutes. The second stage occurs
          over the next few days. Silver acts on fibroblast cells to
          cause them to revert to their embryonic state, becoming stem
          cells. These cells are universal building blocks whose role is
          to reconstruct new tissue. In the final stage, silver ions
          form a complex with the living cells in the wound area to
          produce immediately convertible stem cells. The end result of
          this conversion is that the stem cells supply all the building
          blocks necessary to completely restore all anatomical
          structures. </p>
        <p align="left">No other known treatment provides sufficient
          numbers of the embryonic or stem cells required for true
          regeneration of damaged or destroyed tissues in humans and
          animals. The success indicates that there is the potential not
          only for the healing of near-surface wounds, but for
          regenerative repair of internal organs such as the heart,
          liver, brain and the spinal cord. </p>
