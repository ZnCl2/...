      Luigi Gino Valerio Rota was born on July 1, 1886 at Lu Monferrato
      province from Alessandria in Italy. He made studies of physics in
      Turin at the beginning of the 19th century, and settled in
      Marseilles before joining England where he was between 1917 and
      1921 the first foreigner working in the research laboratories of
      the British Admiralty. It is at that time that he was invested in
      work on the microwaves which allowed the discovery and the
      development of the first radars. <br>

      <b>IT HAS UNCANNY FORCE </b><br>
      <br>
      Harnessing of Earth's Elements Now in Bounds of&nbsp; Possibility.
      An invention that will revolutionize the world! This is the claim
      of a young, almost unknown, Italian scientist, Professor L. V.
      Rota, who claims to have discovered the secret of telluric
      currents. "My invention," states the professor, "can cause
      battleships, submarines, aeroplanes and guns to crumble to dust at
      any moment that any government gives the order to move them. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Speed up Travel. </b><br>
      <br>
      It can be harnessed up for the service of man and can immensely
      speed up travel, transport and communication, whether by land,
      water or air. It can cheapen-*very sort of manufacture and enhance
      every domestic and social immunity. "For instance, a cargo of
      mails or goods could be sent across the Atlantic through the upper
      air, without a human being aboard the craft, at a speed of ten to
      400 miles an hour. The vessel would rise vertically the prescribed
      height, travel horizontally in a predetermined direction and drop
      gently and punctually upon its destination. <br>
      <br>
      <b>"Travel Any Distance</b>." <br>
      <br>
      "Wireless messages, dispatched from no costly or elaborate
      stations, would travel to any distance free from all danger of
      dissipation or confusion and with absolute privacy as between
      sender and receiver. "The nature of all mineral and oil deposits
      in any part of the world and their depth and volume will be
      accurately determined without so much as sinking a shaft.
      "Currents rushing through the air will provide the householder
      with cheaper, safer and more brilliant lighting than he has ever
      ventured to desire. "A new power for every Industry will first
      make coal, steam, oil and electricity more efficient and afterward
      will dispense with them altogether. "When our company Is formed?
      within eighteen months ? we will give spectacular demonstrations
      that all these things?and more?can be accomplished." <br>
      <br>
      <b>Currents Long Suspected. </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The existence of these currents, which emanate from the earth
      (hence their name) have been suspected by other scientists. Lord
      Kelvin before his death declared their reality. Professor Rota
      claims to be the first to discover and record them. They may also
      be described as "molecular force," and they must not be confused,
      says the professor, with Ampere's thermo-electric currents or with
      Foucault currents. It is the study of these telluric currents, in
      their nature, intensity and direction, that is believed to open up
      such possibilities of tremendous Importance for the future of
      humanity. Professor Rota has recently given a preliminary
      demonstration at Marseilles. With a cigar-shaped apparatus,
      seventeen feet long, thirty Inches In diameter and weighing 200
      pounds, he convinced a number of press correspondents that this
      apparatus could remain suspended motionless In the air for
      twenty-four hours, carrying a considerable weight, and be
      propelled or stopped without the use of any mechanical motor.<br>

            ( 1886-1951 )</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By </b><br>

        <b>Mike Watson</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      L.G.V. Rota was a Frenchman of Italian origin. He was born 1886
      and died in Genesieux near Valence, France in 1951. His early life
      is relatively unknown. He was involved in early aviation and
      experiments in wireless communication and also anti-gravitation.
      He originated in northern Italy and was contemporary with Marconi
      so that he was almost certainly influenced by his work. Rota wrote
      little about his discovery: The Universal Current. He produced two
      short booklets, based on seminars, one in collaboration with a
      medical Doctor Kresser, and another in which he briefly outlined
      his work, but with only general details as to how the universal
      energy he claimed to have discovered was tapped or used. Neither
      was there any significant theory. However, Rota did discuss his
      research with one or two confidants, notably a man called Slade
      who wrote some articles on Rota’s work. Later, after Rota’s death
      the author visited his laboratory, obtained some of Rota’s
      laboratory notes and examined some apparatus. Some years later the
      author met Rota’s son and he showed me apparatus and notes I had
      not previously seen. Using this data and after many experiments
      over the years, it has been possible to piece together to some
      extent a coherent idea of Rota’s discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      Around the time of the end of first world war, Luigi Giovani
      Valerio Rota discovered a new naturally occurring
      non-electromagnetic energy which, he claimed, controlled the
      manifestation of all matter. This energy, which he called the
      Universal Current, flows some few meters below the earth’s
      surface. The energy flowing within the earth generates a field in
      the atmosphere. It was tapped by large buried laminated metallic
      structures which Rota called blocks. The energy could light lamps,
      power machines, inhibit electromagnetic propagation such as radio
      waves and stop or control electromagnetic induction, and also
      develop antigravity effects and is involved in the life process.
      Rota maintained that all matter is made of condensed Universal
      Currents and that any metal could be slowly dissolved releasing
      the condensed Universal Currents from which it was made. The
      enormous energy developed during the dissolution of matter could
      be harnessed. The released energy was not in the form of charged
      particles but in the form of more Universal Current, which in
      turn, could be converted into electrical energy. The Universal
      Current was generally (but not always) harmless and although
      similar in behavior to electricity it is much more fundamental.
      Rota understood electricity as a degeneration of the Universal
      Current. In short, matter is composed of nothing but Universal
      Current and could be decomposed back into it.<br>
      <br>
      <b> Early research</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Rota’s early interests seem to have been in aviation and possibly
      early wireless transmission, but there is no information surviving
      from this period. At this time (1910-1915) he had a laboratory in
      Marseilles and it was there that he devised and experimented on
      several unusual aircraft which finally resulted in what he called
      the “Stabilisiteur” (a description is given later in this
      document) which he defined as a device that floats weightless in
      the air. He claimed:<br>
      <br>
      “The device works by opposing the magnetic and electric field of
      the earth rendering the device weightless”.<br>
      <br>
      This claim would at first sight appear impossible, nevertheless
      the device worked and later a version was given a public
      demonstration and reported in the press at the time. During one of
      these experiments he touched the Stabilisiteur and received an
      enormous electric shock which rendered him unconscious for 50
      minutes. Rota said that the voltages and currents used in the
      machine were very small and he could not understand how a
      potential of such a large magnitude build up. The search for a
      solution, ultimately lead him to the discovery of the Universal
      Current. This unknown energy, he thought, had amplified the small
      electric current used in the machine.<br>
      <br>
      Around 1910-1918 on the suggestion of one of his teachers Rota
      seems to have been involved in investigating earth currents. Lord
      Kelvin had advanced the notion that due to non-uniformities in the
      earth’s magnetic field earth currents are produced as the earth
      rotates in its own magnetic field. Rota’s notes of the period show
      that he thought the telluric currents originated deep within the
      earth itself and were not external in origin, in short, he had
      adopted Lord Kelvin’s view. He found that magnetic fields produced
      by these currents were perturbed by the presence of ships aircraft
      etc and Rota used this effect to locate the position of ships and
      aircraft at a distance. He took out patents on the associated
      apparatus, the text of which is below, and he used a version of it
      in all his later research. Although he thought that the magnetic
      disturbances which the apparatus was detecting were caused by
      telluric currents, around 1923 he started to change his mind.
      Sometime later he finally decided that the apparatus was detecting
      a much more fundamental energy of which electromagnetism was a
      mere byproduct, this energy he called the “Universal Current”
      because, in his view, it lay at the root of all physical phenomena
      including the life process.<br>
      <br>
      Although his first laboratory was in Marseilles in the south of
      France, from the early 1920’s to the end of the 1930’s Rota had a
      laboratory in northern France near Rouen at Mont-Saint-Aignan.
      Around the outbreak of the 2nd world war he moved close to Romans
      near Valence in the south of France and set up a new laboratory
      there. Both the Rouen and Romans facilities were quite large. He
      was evidently quite wealthy, his early work being funded by a
      family friend and it seems that between the wars on at least one
      occasion, he was under contract to the French government.<br>
      <br>
      <b>My Interest</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I became interested in the research of L.G.V. Rota after reading
      an article on his work in a long defunct popular fringe science
      journal called the Modern Mystic and Monthly Science Review. The
      article was entitled "Universal Currents" by a person writing
      under the pseudonym of Layman. The editor of the Modern Mystic,
      A.R.Heaver knew Layman. It turned out that Layman was a retired
      geologist by the name of Slade, who got to know Rota well over the
      years between the wars, and the three articles in the magazine
      were an educated layman's account of the bits and pieces of
      information that Rota had imparted over this period. These
      articles are included below.<br>
      <br>
      When the author met A.R.Heaver in 1958, the Modern Mystic and
      Monthly Science review had already been defunct for some ten
      years. Also both Layman and Rota had died, but Heaver put me in
      touch with a man who had known Rota since childhood, he also knew
      most of the people in the area in which Rota had his laboratory. A
      visit to what remained of Rota’s laboratory was organised and it
      transpired that some of Rota's equipment was still fairly intact
      although some of the equipment had been removed and some dumped in
      an outhouse used by a local farmer as a shed. I managed to finance
      the digging up of one of the many metal blocks that Rota had used
      to tap the universal current, and subsequently brought the block
      to England for examination.<br>
      <br>
      Some 16 years later, out of the blue, I was visited by a
      Frenchman, Guy Leblond, who knew about L.G.V. Rota and he informed
      me that Rota had a son. I shortly afterwards met Rota's son,
      Daniel Rota in St. Malo in northern France. Daniel Rota was only a
      small boy when Rota died and he knew that his father had made some
      important discovery, but not being a scientist he understood
      little about it. However in the intervening 16 years since I had
      visited Rota’s laboratory he had brought most or all his father's
      papers and laboratory equipment up to his then house in St. Malo .
      He allowed me to see and photograph the equipment (some of which
      are shown below).<br>
      <br>
      Sometime later Guy Leblond unexpectedly visited me with a piece of
      Rota equipment I had not previously seen. Leblond said this was
      called the "Transducteur". I had not been shown it previously
      because Daniel Rota believed it as containing Rota's "secret"
      regarding the universal current. It seems that the in part
      Transducteur amplified the Universal Current sufficiently so that
      they could heard without electronic aid, since Rota invariably
      used headphones and even galvanometers to detect the Universal
      Current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Natural electric currents called telluric currents were well known
      to 19th century scientists. These electric currents are due to
      induction from disturbances of the earth’s magnetic field caused
      by solar flares and storms. Magnetic storms induced quite heavy
      electric currents in the earth’s surface which, while they lasted,
      blocked telegraph transmission. The sensitivity of the apparatus
      of the time to disturbance was due to the use of an earth return
      in the telegraph circuit. The earth return consisted of large
      buried metal plates one at each end of the circuit. The telegraph
      circuits stretched sometimes 100 Km in length and consequently
      magnetic fluctuations due to solar magnetic storms would induce
      currents in the overhead wires causing spurious
      telephone/telegraph signals. Magnetic devices such as electrical
      transformers relays etc. would saturate. On some occasions the
      electric currents would reach formidable levels. It is likely that
      the disturbing currents which existed in telephone wires and the
      rather strange behaviour of these disturbances interested Rota and
      led to his research. This is not unknown today.<br>

      Sir,<br>
      <br>
      Not alone the press but&nbsp; large number of individual
      scientists are striving painstakingly and anxiously to explain the
      origin and source of the mysteriuous signals intercepted at
      various wireless stations a week ago.<br>
      <br>
      Seven yars have passed since I beganm y reseraches intothe problem
      of which these phenomena are the outward signs, that is to say
      into the question of:-<br>
      <br>
      1. the source of terrestrial magnetism<br>
      <br>
      2. The real nature and constitution of the true center or core of
      the earth.<br>
      <br>
      3. The derivation of seismic phenomena<br>
      <br>
      4. The propagation of electric waves and everything that this wide
      field of research covers today.<br>
      <br>
      It was while engaged in this study that I came upon what I believe
      to be a discovery of the most scientific import that may yet
      favorably revolutionize the natural sciences especially insofar as
      they concern electricity or electric waves, and one which, in any
      future war that may unhappily arise is destined to afford to the
      nation wise enough to exploit it to the full an insuperable means,
      either of offense or defense...<br>

      <b>Unidentified Letter</b><b> :<br>
      </b><br>
      ...In the convenient circumstances mentioned, Prof. Rota
      diligently continued his researches concerning Telluric Force more
      especially in relation to seismological and meteorological
      conditions. In the course of these researches he found that not
      only does Telluric Force undoubtedly exist in and emanate from the
      earth, but he satisfied himself thatTelluric currents have a range
      of notless than 300,000 miles.<br>
      <br>
      Telluric currents must not be confounded with Ampere
      thermo-electric currents or with Foucalt currents.<br>
      <br>
      Teluric currents vary in their specific nature, intensity,
      direction, and limits of influence.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of employing these Telluric currents as means of power
      naturally followed and Prof. Rota therefore directed his attention
      to the invention of instruments for detecting, collecting,
      concentrating, controlling and so applying these currents that the
      employment of such instruments would enable the successful
      commercial exploitatio of Telluric Force...<br>

      ..."My studies have led to the discovery of three classes of
      telluric, or earth currents, never previously defined. These
      currents have no analogy with Ampere's thermo-electric currents.
      The late Lord Kelvin proclaimed, shortly before his death, the
      existence of an uknown telluric current, but without further
      defining it. It is evident also from newton's lete to Bentley in
      1691 that the discoverer of the law of gravitation had some
      suspicion of a law of universal attraction. These telluric
      currents vary in their specific nature, their intensity,
      direction, and limits of influence. Their radius of action is
      immense, their action very powerful, and they cause the natural
      phenomena which scientists have endeavored in vain to explain.<br>

      <b>Telluric Currents</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      These telluric currents have brought about an atmospheric
      condition which renders impossible the formation and condensation
      of clouds, hence we have not had our usual rainfall, because they
      also control the electric state of the atmosphere, and they
      absolutely master the formation of all electric storms. Given full

      Wireless telegraphy and signalling; wireless control of distant
      apparatus; determining presence of metallic bodies. - <br>
      <br>
      Apparatus for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves in
      or from a predetermined direction consists of a series of alined
      cylinders or prisms with their axes lying along the desired
      direction, the cylinders &amp;c. being connected to each other by
      transformers, and an end cylinder being connected to the
      oscillation producing or reception circuit. The cylinders are
      connected alternately through choking- coils to opposite poles of
      a battery. In the transmitting-arrangement shown in Fig. 1, three
      cylinders, A, A&lt;1&gt;, A&lt;2&gt;, formed of sheet metal or of
      wire, are connected to each other by adjustable transformers P, S
      and P&lt;1&gt;, S&lt;1&gt; and are connected through choke-coils
      s, s&lt;1&gt;, s&lt;2&gt; and variable -resistances r, r&lt;1&gt;
      to opposite poles of a battery or dynamo p. Prisms of square,
      rectangular, triangular, or other cross section may be substituted
      for the cylinders. The receiving-apparatus is similar to that
      described above, the extreme cylinder being at opposite potential
      to the extreme cylinder A&lt;2&gt; of the transmitter. The
      cylinders A, A&lt;1&gt;, A&lt;2&gt; may be enclosed in outer
      cylinders insulated from each other, the outer cylinders being
      connected to opposite poles of the battery between the
      choking-coils s, s&lt;1&gt;, s&lt;2&gt; and the resistances r,
      r&lt;1&gt;. In another arrangement, an earthed tube passes through
      some or all of the cylinders. The apparatus shown in Fig. 1 may be
      duplicated, with the cylinder axes parallel or slightly inclined.
      The cylinders may also be arranged with their axes inclined or
      vertical, and the upper cylinder may terminate in an inverted cone
      formed of wire or bands. The presence of a magnetic body between
      the transmitting and receiving stations is indicated by the
      disturbing effect upon the receiving apparatus. When used for
      detecting submarines, the cylindrical transmitters and receivers
      4, 5, Fig. 8, may project from ships' sides below the water-level,
      and are partly enclosed by a tube 3 closed with insulating
      material. The apparatus is adjustable as regards depth below the
      surface of the sea, and may be withdrawn when not required. Fig.
      10 shows three apparatus converging on a pair of co-axial
      cylindrical tubes Q, Q&lt;1&gt; insulated from each other, with
      the object of concentrating the radiation towards a point P, where
      a spark may be produced. Instead of being arranged one within the
      other, the cylinders Q, Q&lt;1&gt; may be built up of parallel
      wires and may be arranged in alignment, with an intermediate
      inductance. In another form, Fig. 12, these cylinders are coupled
      to each other by a transformer P, S, and are connected to opposite
      poles of a battery p through choking-coils h, h&lt;1&gt; and
      resistances r, r&lt;1&gt;. An outer cylinder formed in two
      insulated sections 4, 5 is also connected to the battery p. The
      apparatus may be used for telegraphy, telephony, or for the
      distant control of mechanism, and is stated to ensure secrecy in
      working, to prevent interference by atmospherics or by signals
      intended for other stations, and to prevent absorption and
      dissipation due to atmospheric electricity.<br>

      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We, LUIGI ROTA, of Clarence House, Park Road, Teddington, in the
      County of Middlesex, Professor, and ERNESTO BINETTI, of 132, Via
      del Tritone, Rome, in the Kingdom of Italy, Commendatore, do
      hereby declare the nature of this invention and in what manner the
      same is to be performed, to be particularly described and
      ascertained in and by the following statement:-<br>
      <br>
      The objects of the present invention are to construct apparatus
      which will:-<br>
      <br>
      1. Concentrate the wave or train of waves upon a desired point for
      whatever purpose the apparatus may be designed. '<br>
      <br>
      2. Assure the absolute secrecy of the communications, that is to
      say, each station may correspond at any distance by
      radio-telegraphy and radio-telephony as well as by radio
      telemechanism, exclusively with the appointed station without the
      communications being intercepted or troubling or being received by
      other stations. '<br>
      <br>
      3. Enable several stations to be installed close together, each
      station not being disturbed or troubled by messages intended for
      other stations or by atmospheric waves, at the same time
      permitting a receiving station to determine the direction of the
      station from which it receives its messages and to put itself in
      communication with the sending station.<br>
      <br>
      4. Suppress all dissipations or absorptions to which the waves are
      subject during their travel due to natural electrical disturbances
      produced by atmospheric electricity:<br>
      <br>
      5. Permit all transmission and receiving stations to transmit or
      receive in all directions if the apparatus is put out of circuit.<br>
      <br>
      6. Increase the capacity, determine the phases and intensity of
      the wave, making it possible to transmit electric power wirelessly
      to a distance, as for producing Joule's effect at a distance.<br>
      <br>
      7. Transmit a wave having a force and such a constitution that it
      can indicate when a magnetic body has come between the
      transmitting and receiving stations, whether the body be upon the
      earth, upon water or under water.<br>
      <br>
      The accompanying drawings show diagrammatically various examples
      of the methods of carrying the invention into effect, from which
      it will be observed that it may have various arrangements, forms
      and sizes, single or double, and may be arranged horizontally,
      vertically or inclined, and with respect to its cross sectional
      form it may be circular, square, rectangular, triangular or of
      other form. We will hereinafter, both in the description and
      claims, refer to these forms as cylinders, and they may be
      constructed of sheet metal or of wires or bands arranged parallel
      to each other, according to the work for which the apparatus is
      intended and the system and power of the station in which it is
      installed ; the system may be direct coupled or indirect coupled,
      and the waves may be damped waves or undamped or continuous waves
      and of any length.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus always remains the same in principle and in its
      fundamental basis and action, but, according to. the.work. which
      it is intended to perform, it may be modified in various ways.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus consists of two, three or more cylinders united in
      series by means of a reciprocal induction and, further, each
      cylinder is in communication with a battery, accumulator or
      dynamo, and the said battery is common to all the cylinders but in
      a contrary direction for each alternate cylinder. Upon the
      principle of the action of transformers, one is able to obtain by
      the first transforming, the augmentation of intensity, in the
      second, the electromotive force, by means of the third, these two
      (intensity and electromotive force) may be made equal; or vice
      versa, if desired or necessary, all these effects in co-relation,
      the energy originally produced and its intensity, its
      electromotive force and its periods. The battery has for its
      object to reconstitute all the force lost by passive losses,
      resistances and otherwise, and further to give to the energy of
      the wave its constitutive and primitive property. The cylinders
      increase the capacity and diminish the resistance, and in union
      with the relative inductions and currents of the batteries, they
      define the energy of the wave with intensity and phase desired and
      determined, <br>

      As shown in Fig. 1, the cylinders A, A1, A2, are provided with the
      relative transformers a, a1, --P, P', being the primaries and S,
      S', the secondaries; p is the battery of accumulators and r, r1,
      the resistances ; s, s1, s2 are coils to prevent the oscillation
      circulating in the battery circuit. By the first coil s the
      cylinder A is connected with the positive pole of the battery; by
      the second, s1, the cylinder A1 is connected with the negative
      pole of the battery, and by the third, s2, the cylinder A2 is
      connected with the positive pole of the battery. The production of
      the current in the battery of accumulators is suitable for the
      relative transformers of the cylinders and the energy produced by
      the exciting apparatus. In the receiving apparatus, P, P1, are the
      primaries, and S, S1, are the secondaries, p is the battery, r,
      r1, are the resistances, x, s1, s2 are the coils to prevent, the
      wave passing into the battery circuit. A-2 is a negative cylinder
      (the opposite to, the last cylinder of the transmitting station),
      the second cylinder, A1, is positive, and the third cylinder, A,
      is negative. The first cylinders are generally shorter and the
      last cylinders longer, and further this latter may sometimes
      terminate with a conical formation 42 of larger diameter (of wire
      or bands) as shown in Fig. 7, which also represents a vertical
      arrangement. All the transformers may be fixed or adjustable, both
      in the transmission and receiving apparatuses. Also the
      resistances, connected to the batteries may be fixed or variable.
      It is now easy to understand that we can diminish or increase the
      energy of the wave. It is possible to produce waves with definite
      phases and intensity and to receive a definite wave at a single
      receiving station, that is to say, a perfect syntony, and also to
      distinguish various waves different from one another, rendering it
      thus possible to communicate with or receive messages from various
      stations.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus shown in Fig. 2 is similar to that shown in Fig: 1
      with this difference, that the first cylinder, A, has a second
      concentric cylinder A10 connected to it at A11 and with the wire
      at b.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 shows other cylinders 3, 31, 32, in addition to the
      cylinders A, A', A2, The cylinders 3, 31 32, are insulated from
      each other at i, i1, and they are united to the battery of
      accumulators and also with the cylinders A,A1, A2, by means of
      coils h, h1, h2, to prevent, by means of their inductance, the
      oscillations traveling into the circuit of the battery. This
      method gives the maximum intensity of the apparatus and prevents
      the radiating of the wave during its traverse of the cylinders A,
      A2, which act as antenna or transmitting points. <br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 is the same, in principle as those previously described but
      with this difference, that there is in the interior of the
      apparatus and concentric therewith, a complete cylinder A12,
      connected to earth, farther increasing the capacity of the
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      This connection with the earth would be the same as in Fig. 5. In
      this figure n, nl, n2, n3, are four cylinders arranged as
      previously described. The cylinder n is connected with the circuit
      by means of the wire m. There is in the same cylinder, n, another
      cylinder E, which is concentric therewith and which terminates at
      d in the second cylinder n1. The said cylinder E is connected to
      earth by means of the wire m1, which is generally smaller than the
      wire m, and further, in certain cases (due to a different system
      of excitation being used) there may be inserted at the point, K, a
      capacity or a self inductance, to make the wire m1 agree with the
      arrangement and work of the wire m, producing in m1, a retardation
      because the wire m1 is united to the 'cylinder E, and this latter
      'terminating in n1, would otherwise have precedence of action with
      respect to the cylinder n (and to the wire m connected thereto).<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 is similar to that described with respect to Fig. 1 with
      this difference, that the apparatus is doubled starting from the
      point b1 and finishing with the last cylinders, which are parallel
      as shown in Fig. 6 or at an angle to each other as shown in, Fig.
      6a. The two sets of cylinders A Al A2 are connected by inductances
      h, h1, h2 acting as above described. Upon the principle of
      electrodynamics, two fluxes or currents parallel and in the same
      direction will attract each other. Due to the common attraction
      they will travel always uniting more and more, with the
      suppression of radiation or expansion. This apparatus shown in
      Fig. 6 is specially suitable for indicating a magnetic body which
      may happen to be between the two stations of transmission and
      reception, as hereinafter explained. To obtain the desired
      information or indication, starting with the principle that
      currents magnetize magnetic bodies, for this reason, due to the
      improved apparatus by which we obtain a wave having the properties
      of a current and with a certain intensity, then, if this wave
      remains neutral to all the disturbances and currents of the
      atmosphere during its traverse, on encountering a magnetic body,
      it will magnetize it. The wave will then lose its original
      properties and it will no longer act (due to the loss or defect)
      at the receiving station in such a way as to do the desired work
      there. It will thus make known the presence of a body (or
      obstacle) according to its constitutive matter. Or, in other
      words, as it is a law of nature that to every action which seeks
      to exert itself upon matter, this latter opposes the same with a
      reaction equal and inverse, then the wave coming by means of this
      apparatus reproduces the same matter in the body which it
      encounters, it must be admitted that the body, as soon as it has
      received a part of the flux, causes a reaction upon a certain
      scale in such a way that it changes the whole of the original
      action, that is to say, it prevents a regular reception, which is
      immediately known or noticed at the receiving station, for the
      receiving apparatus is so constructed as not to be affected by all
      disturbances, thus effecting the desired work, that is to say,
      indicating the presence of a body.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus shown in Figs. 3 and 6 are especially useful for
      doing the work just described. The apparatus shown in Figs. 8 and
      9 is specially suitable for signifying the presence of a magnetic
      body which may be .upon or in the water (and it is the same with a
      magnetic body which may be upon the land), and this body we admit,
      for example, may be a submarine.<br>
      <br>
      The idea will certainly occur that it is impossible to transmit
      through sea water as it is true that sea water absorbs very
      rapidly electric waves, but it must be remembered that known
      electric waves are simply a disturbance of the lines of magnetic
      force, instead of, as we obtain by the present invention, the
      production of a real current. For this reason the absorption is
      slower over the greater part of its travel and its production is
      dynamically stronger and more united. The wave therefore has the
      faculty of being perceived by the reception apparatus, being
      signalled at the receiving station with very delicate apparatus,
      that is to say, by means of a telephone of the micro-ampere type
      or of the hundredth of a micro-ampere, or by means of a
      galvanometer, for example of the Nobili type, or the more delicate
      Deprez-D'Arsonval. Thus the apparatus will be able to determine
      very nearly all the evolutions of a submarine, it being well
      understood that it is necessary to ascertain all the losses due to
      resistance, absorption and other causes and the distances apart of
      the transmitting and receiving ships.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8 shows the arrangement for the transmission as well as for
      the reception ; Fig. 9 represents the double transmission which
      will be effected as described with respect to Fig. 6, that is to
      say, with a single transmission apparatus to which two apparatuses
      constructed according to the present invention have been applied
      working synchronously together.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 8, 1 represents one transmission antenna independent of
      that which is to effect the desired object, 2 is the body. of the
      vessel, and 3 is a cylinder closed by insulating material. 4 and 5
      are the two cylinders forming part of the apparatus constructed
      according to the present invention, a part of the cylinder 5
      protruding from the closed cylinder 3. For the reason that sea
      water destroys very rapidly the materials, and the search should
      be made at ) different depths as well as at the surface of the
      water, the two apparatuses will be made movable and will be
      plunged into the sea only at the desired time and in agreement
      both for transmission and receiving.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 10 shows the arrangement given to the apparatus to obtain
      Joule's effect at a distance, that is to say, a spark at a
      predetermined point by means of electric waves produced by the
      apparatus herein described. Fig. 10 represents three apparatuses,
      1, II, III, each having its own excitation apparatus ; all three
      working together and in accordance with the principle stated above
      of the common attraction of the fluxes, they unite in Q at the
      point E to obtain the desired effect at P. Q, Q1, may be two
      complete cylinders insulated from each other or as described with
      respect to Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 11 the cylinders 4,5, are made with parallel wires with an
      intermediate inductance.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus shown in Fig. 12 is very similar to that shown in
      Fig. 3, the outer cylinders 4 and 5 being similar to those marked
      z and zl in Fig. 3, and the inner cylinders A, A1, corresponding
      with two of the inner cylinders A., A1, shown in Fig. 3. The
      inductances h, h1, act in similar manner to those shown in Fig. 3.<br>
      <br>
      It is necessary to state that the number of apparatuses such as I,
      II, III, is not limited but is always in accordance with the work
      desired to be done. The arrangement of the apparatus I is
      generally at' an angle of 45 degrees to the apparatus III or the
      last of the series.<br>
      <br>
      It may be stated that the various modifications of the apparatus
      herein repre- sented are those forms which in experiments have
      given the best practical results, are simple and work perfectly.<br>
      <br>
      Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of
      our said invention and in what manner the same is to be performed,
      we declare that what we claim is: -<br>
      <br>
      1. Apparatus for transmitting and receiving electric waves,
      consisting of&nbsp; a series of cylinders united by means of
      reciprocal transformers and connected to a battery, accumulator or
      dynamo, the connection between the cylinders being so made that
      each cylinder is connected to the opposite pole to that to which
      the next adjacent cylinder is connected, the connection being made
      by coils having such an inductance as to prevent the wave
      circulating in the battery circuit, substantially as shown and
      described.<br>

      Apparatus for detecting the proximity of mines, submarines,
      icebergs, &amp;c. comprises a. wooden cylinder d carried by spokes
      d&lt;1&gt; and bearings d&lt;2&gt; on a shaft d&lt;3&gt; fixed
      within an outer wooden cylinder a. The cylinder d has insulated

      rotated by a flexible shaft e&lt;2&gt; and bevel gear e&lt;1&gt;.
      A fixed frame g with coils of soft-iron wire g&lt;1&gt; or plates
      has within it a magnetic declination needle g&lt;2&gt;. An outer
      iron casing a&lt;1&gt; with pointed ends may be provided, and the
      apparatus is suspended from a ship by a telescopic shaft
      b&lt;3&gt; with ball bearings b&lt;2&gt;, c, or by other suitable
      suspension, allowing the axis of the device to be kept horizontal,

      lenses, a lamp a&lt;4&gt; serving for illumination. The device may
      be used with the cylinder d stationary and its axis at
      right-angles to the magneto meridian, or with the cylinder rotated
      and its axis parallel to the meridian or inclined thereto at 30 to
      35 degrees. The apparatus is stated to indicate the proximity and
      direction of a mine &amp;c, Two such devices may be used in
      conjunction, with the cylinders respectively stationary and
      rotating, and one of the devices may have a dip needle. In a
      modification, stated to detect the proximity of an iceberg owing
      to its high electric potential, the casing a is omitted, and two
      copper cylinders are provided, one within and the other without
      the cylinder a, extending approximately half its length and
      carried by a disk which closes the end of the cylinder d. The
      copper cylinders are connected to an electroscope or torsion
      balance.<br>

      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide improved means
      for signalling the presence and the direction of floating mines,
      submarine and' other ships, or other magnetic or paramagnetic
      bodies or icebergs. The apparatus signals the presence of such
      bodies whether Seating or submerged, and as it indicates the
      direction of such bodies it may also indicate the speed at which
      they are traveling.<br>
      <br>
      I have discovered that there are certain telluric or earth
      currents which produce in the earth telluric magnetic vortices.
      The presence or intensity of these currents is shown when they
      encounter a magnetic or paramagnetic body however small this may
      be. Due to this fact it is possible to recognise the presence of a
      mine, submarine, ship or other magnetic or paramagnetic body, by
      means of the apparatus forming the subject of the present
      invention, which indicates these currents.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in
      which:-<br>

      <br>
      The apparatus consists of a wooden cylinder or casing a, which may
      be enclosed in a pointed outer iron casing a1 This latter is only
      necessary when the apparatus is intended for use in water as. it
      diminishes the resistance and withstands the pressure of the
      water. The cylinder a is hermetically closed and is supported by
      the rods b, fixed to a vertical shaft bl, supported by a ball
      bearing b2 carried by the vertical rod b3. This latter may be
      telescopic and the two parts may be fixed with relation to each
      other by a set screw, b4, or by other suitable mechanism. The ball
      bearing b2 allows the apparatus to be rotated upon a vertical
      axis. The vertical rod b3 is supported by a ball bearing c,
      carried by the arm c1 fixed to the ship. This bearing c allows the
      shaft and rod&nbsp; to hang in a vertical position. Any other
      suspension means may be employed which will allowthe indicating
      apparatus to be retained with its longitudinal axis horizontal,
      which will allow the apparatus to be oriented about a central
      vertical axis, and which will allow it to be raised or lowered.
      The apparatus may be suspended either at the bows or side of a
      ship.<br>
      <br>
      Within the casing a, and concentric therewith, is mounted a
      rotating cylinder d made of wood. The cylinder d is carried by
      radial arms or spokes d1 mounted, by means of ball bearings d2
      upon a rod d3, fixed to the casing a. The cylinder d may be
      rotated by any suitable means, such as clockwork, located in the
      space a2 at the right hand end of the casing a. In the drawings a
      bevel toothed wheel e, indicated by broken lines, is attached to
      the end of the cylinder d This bevel wheel e is driven by the
      bevel pinion el, mounted upon the end of a flexible shaft e2 both
      parts being shown in broken lines. The flexible shaft e2 would be
      carried up to the deck of the ship and be there driven by suitable
      mechanism. It will be understood that an electric motor cannot be
      used in the end a2 of the casing a, as it would prevent accurate
      observations being taken. The cylinder d has a surface velocity of
      from 4 to 9 meters per second.<br>
      <br>
      On the rotating cylinder d is wound Insulated copper or soft iron
      wire d4 in one or more layers forming a closed circuit. The ends
      of this circuit are furnished with suitable brushes or contacts
      d5, and these latter are in contact with the rings f, f1 which are
      connected to a very sensitive galvanometer f2. Partly located
      within the cylinder d is a fixed frame 0 which may be of any
      suitable form. In the drawings it is shown as rectangular but it
      may be cylindrical or polygonal. This frame g is concentric with.
      the cylinder d and carries coils of soft iron wire as shown or
      thin plates forming a closed circuit. In side the frame and
      parallel to a plane of a convolution of the wires or plates, is
      located a magnetic declination needle g2 as the wires. or plates
      are caused to point to the north. Above the needle g2 in the
      construction shown, is fixed a mirror h, and at the extreme left
      hand end of the cylinder is another mirror hl. Within the
      inspection chamber a3 is an electric lamp a4 (Fig. 1) for
      illuminating the ealvanometer f2 and the magnetic needle q2. An
      inspection tube i, indicated in broken lines in Figs 1 and 3,
      passes up to the deck of the ship and enables the galvanometer f2
      to be seen by direct vision and the magnetic needle g2 to be seen
      by double reflection by means of the mirrors h, h1.<br>
      <br>
      Prisms may be employed instead of the mirrors h h1 and the tube i
      may be fitted with lenses to enable the observations to be more
      readily made.<br>
      <br>
      When the apparatus is used upon a ship having an iron hull it will
      probably be necessary to employ compensating or correcting
      magnets, which are not shown upon the ship or within the apparatus
      as will be understood.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus will generally be fixed at about 3 to 5 meters from
      the hull of the ship, but the greater the distance the better,
      especially when it is carried by a battleship.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may be used with the cylinder d rotating or
      stationary, and it is lowered into the water or onto the surface.
      Whatever may be its position the signalling action will always
      take place, but to render this action more sensitive it is well to
      use the apparatus in the following manner. If the apparatus is
      used with a stationary cylinder d, it should be retained with its
      longitudinal axis at right angles, as far as possible, to the
      magnetic meridian.<br>
      <br>
      If the apparatus is used with the cylinder d rotating, it should
      be kept on the magnetic meridian, or making with the magnetic
      meridian an angle of 30 to 35 to the right or east thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The extensions j are provide at each end of the casing a, to
      enable the apparatus to be turned and retained in the desired
      direction by mechanical connections.<br>
      <br>
      I may in some cases employ two apparatuses, one having a magnetic
      declination needle as above described, and the other having,
      within the fixed frame g a magnetic declination needle and also a
      magnetic dipping needle. One apparatus is used with a rotating
      cylinder, and the other is used with a stationary cylinder d..
      Each apparatus is retained in the direction which is most suitable
      as above explained, so that one apparatus is at right angles to
      the other apparatus. It is known that terrestrial magnetism
      induces currents in moving conductors so that the quantity of flux
      received by each apparatus will vary.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus will be sensitive to telluric currents when a
      paramagnetic body is encountered, such as a mine, a submarine, or
      a ship, and the larger bodies will be detected at considerable
      distances reckoned in miles. Experience will determine the type of
      body by the intensity of the current. When the presence of a body
      has been signalled by the apparatus, it is advisable to stop the
      ship upon which the apparatus is carried, and it will then be
      possible by watching the magnetic needle and galvanometer to
      ascertain whether the body is fixed or in motion, and if in
      motion, whether it is approaching or receding from the apparatus
      and what is its depth. By being able to follow the direction of
      the object and knowing whether it is approaching or receding one
      is able to calculate the course of the object. According as the
      apparatus is increased in size, so it will be able to detect mines
      at a greater distance.<br>
      <br>
      I have discovered that icebergs when carried by currents have a
      very high electric potential. In order to render the apparatus
      suitable for detecting an electrically charged body as well as a
      para-magnetic body, the apparatus above described and shown in
      Figs. 1,2 and 3, may be modified as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
      <br>
      The outer casing al is dispensed with. The cylinder d, covered
      with wire d4 is mounted upon spokes dl, carried by ball bearings
      d2 rotating upon a rod d3. All the other parts, not shown, are
      similar to those shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The cylinder d is
      closed at one end by a discs d10 which projects beyond the casing
      a and fits against this latter. To the disc d10 is fixed a copper
      cylinder k, which covers about half of the casing a. This copper
      cylinder 1e may be further supported by means of small rollers k1
      carried by the casing a. Within the casing a is fixed another
      copper cylinder k2 having the same length as the copper cylinder
      k. The two coppers cylinders k, k are connected to a suitable
      apparatus, such as an electroscope or torsion balance, located in
      the inspection chamber a3 to reveal the most delicate electric
      charges and to measure their intensity and variations.<br>
      <br>
      Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of my
      said invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, I
      declare that what I claim is:-<br>
      <br>
