      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Field</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The subject matter presented herein relates generally to
      directed- energy systems and methods, and more particularly, to
      directed-energy systems and methods for disrupting electronic
      circuits, especially those containing semiconductors.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The configuration and operation of known directed-energy
      devices can vary widely, as is illustrated by the disclosures of
      U.S. Patent Nos. 6,809,307; 6,784,408; 6,849,841 ; 6,864,825 and
      7,126,530, which are incorporated herein by reference in their
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Known directed-energy devices can produce, for example,
      electromagnetic waves (EMW) and electromagnetic pulses (EMP),
      which propagate away from a source with diminishing intensity,
      governed by the theory of electromagnetism. An electromagnetic
      pulse (EMP) is in effect an electromagnetic shock wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] This pulse of energy can produce a powerful electromagnetic
      field. The field can be sufficiently strong to produce short lived
      transient voltages of potentially thousands of volts on exposed
      electrical conductors, such as wires, or conductive tracks on
      printed circuit boards, where exposed.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The EMP effect can result in irreversible damage to a wide
      range of electrical and electronic equipment, particularly
      computers and radio or radar receivers. Subject to the
      electromagnetic hardness of the electronics, a measure of the
      equipment's resilience to this effect, and the intensity of the
      field produced, the equipment can be irreversibly damaged or in
      effect electrically destroyed. The damage inflicted is not unlike
      that experienced through exposure to close proximity lightning
      strikes, and may require complete replacement of the equipment, or
      at least substantial portions thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Known computer and telecommunications equipment can be
      particularly vulnerable to EMP effects, as it is largely built up
      of high density Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) devices, for
      instance, which can be very sensitive to exposure to high voltage
      transients. What can be significant about MOS devices is that very
      little energy is required to permanently damage or destroy them.
      Any voltage typically in excess of ten or tens of volts can
      produce an effect termed gate breakdown that effectively destroys
      the device. Even if a voltage pulse is not powerful enough to
      produce thermal damage, the power supply in the equipment can
      readily supply enough energy to complete the destructive process.
      Damaged devices may still function, but their reliability may be
      seriously impaired, or not function as intended or at all.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Shielding electronics by equipment chassis can provide
      limited protection, as any cables running in and out of the
      equipment can behave very much like antennae, in effect guiding
      the high voltage transients into the equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Computers used in data processing systems, communications
      systems, displays, industrial control applications, including road
      and rail signaling, and those embedded in military equipment, such
      as signal processors, electronic flight controls and digital
      engine control systems, are all potentially vulnerable to the EMP
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Receivers can be particularly sensitive to EMP, as the
      highly sensitive miniature high frequency transistors and diodes
      in such equipment can be easily destroyed by exposure to high
      voltage electrical transients. Therefore, radar and electronic
      warfare equipment, satellite, microwave, UHF, VHF, HF and low band
      communications equipment and television equipment are all
      potentially vulnerable to the EMP effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A known effective countermeasure method to protect against
      the harmful effects of electromagnetism is to wholly contain
      equipment in an electrically conductive enclosure, termed a
      Faraday cage, which can prevent the electromagnetic field from
      gaining access to the protected equipment. A Faraday cage can be
      capable of stopping an attack using electromagnetism, such as an
      EMP. SUMMARY<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In an exemplary embodiment, a directed-energy system
      includes a charged particle generator configured to generate
      plural energized particles; and a charge transformer configured to
      receive the plural energized particles that include charged
      particles from the charged particle generator and to output
      energized particles that include particles having substantially
      zero charge, wherein the charged particle generator is configured
      to direct the plural energized particles through the charge
      transformer in a predefined direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] An exemplary method of disrupting an electronic circuit can
      include generating plural energized particles; directing the
      plural energized particles to an incident surface of a charge
      transformer; transforming the plural energized particles within
      the charge transformer, wherein the transformed particles are at
      substantially zero charge; generating a wavefront at an exit
      surface of the charge transformer comprising the transformed
      particles at substantially zero charge; and impinging an
      electronic circuit with the wavefront comprising the transformed
      particles at substantially zero charge.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0017] Referring to FIGs. 1 and 2, an exemplary embodiment of a
      directed- energy system can include a charged particle generator
      100 configured to generate plural energized particles and a charge
      transformer 114 configured to receive the plural energized
      particles that include charged particles from the charged particle
      generator and to output energized particles that include particles
      having substantially zero charge. The charged particle generator
      100 can be configured to direct the plural energized particles
      through the charge transformer 114 in a predefined direction,
      e.g., toward a target device. In an exemplary embodiment, the
      plural energized particles can be in the form of a photon particle
      wave, e.g., a mixture or cross-generation of photons and
      electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Power and control components will be known to those of
      skill in the art. For example, in an exemplary embodiment,
      energized particle generator 100 can include a DC power supply 102
      and DC-to-AC converter 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In an exemplary embodiment, charged particle generator 100
      can include charged particle emitter 106. In an embodiment,
      charged particle emitter 106 can include any source of radio
      frequency energy, particularly microwaves. In some embodiments,
      charged particle emitter 106 may include known magnetrons. In some
      other embodiments, charged particle emitter 106 may include
      solid-state power amplifiers, gyrotrons, traveling wave tubes
      (TWTs)1 and/or klystrons. In some embodiments, charged particle
      emitter 106 may be a lower-power source and may generate energy
      levels of approximately 1 kilowatt (kW) to approximately 100 kW or
      greater, although the scope is not limited in this respect.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Without limiting the scope of the invention, other examples
      of suitable charged particle emitters that can form a photon
      particle wave include known energy emission devices such as free
      electron lasers and discharges or arcs at edges of planar
      antennae, for example, spark gap generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In some embodiments, charged particle emitter 106 may
      include a free electron laser, or FEL. A FEL is a laser that
      shares the same optical properties as conventional lasers such as
      emitting a beam consisting of coherent electromagnetic radiation
      which can reach high power, but which uses some very different
      operating principles to form the beam. Unlike gas, liquid, or
      solid-state lasers such as diode lasers, which rely on bound
      atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam
      as the lasing medium, hence the term free electron. This gives
      them a wide frequency range compared to other laser types, and
      makes many of them widely tunable, currently ranging in wavelength
      from microwaves, through terahertz radiation and infrared, to the
      visible spectrum, to ultraviolet, to soft X-rays.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In an exemplary embodiment, charged particle emitter 106
      can include an excitation signal, produced by known signal
      generation devices, for example. Such an excitation signal could
      be a 120 VAC clipped (square) wave that can have an effect of
      driving a magnetron outside of a typical 2.45 GHz frequency, for
      example. In an embodiment, when a 120 VAC square wave excitation
      signal is applied to a magnetron, bandwidths on the order of 0 to
      10 GHz can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an exemplary embodiment, the output of charged particle
      emitter 106 can be a photon particle wave that can include a
      mixture of photons and electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In an exemplary embodiment, charged particle generator 100
      can include an energized particle, e.g., photon and/or particle
      beam or wave, forming module 108. In an exemplary embodiment,
      energized particle (photon particle beam or wave) forming module
      108 can be positioned in a throat section of a waveguide launcher
      between charged particle emitter 106 and waveguide 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In an exemplary embodiment, energized particle forming
      module 108 can be made of an electropositive material, such as a
      polycarbonate sheet. In an embodiment, this material can include
      DELRIN manufactured by DuPont. In an embodiment, energized
      particle forming module 108 can act like a roughing filter, i.e.,
      it can start the process of reducing the charge of the charged
      particles in the mixture of photons and electrons. After passing
      through energized particle forming module 108, the mixture of
      photons and electrons can then be directed via waveguide 110 as an
      electromagnetic wavefront 112 to impinge on the surface of charge
      transformer 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In an exemplary embodiment, waveguide 110 can include a
      hollow conducting tube, which may be rectangular or circular, for
      example, within which EM waves can be propagated. Signals can
      propagate within the confines of metallic walls, for example, that
      act as boundaries. <br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an exemplary embodiment, waveguide 110 can be configured
      as a circularly polarized antenna and may radiate substantially
      circularly polarized energy. In other embodiments, waveguide 110
      may be linearly polarized and may radiate signals with a linear
      polarization (e.g., a horizontal and/or a vertical polarization).
      Antennas in many shapes, such as horns, lenses, planar arrays, and
      reflectors may be suitable in some of these embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As shown in FIG. 2, exemplary waveguide 110 can be
      configured as part of a device that can include a magnetron
      portion, a throat section of a waveguide launcher area that can
      include energized particle forming module 108 positioned between
      charged particle emitter 106 and waveguide 110, and a cone-like
      portion or horn. In an exemplary embodiment, a magnetron can be
      placed in the magnetron portion such that there can be a
      three-inch gap between the top of the magnetron's cathode and the
      top of the enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In an exemplary and non-limiting embodiment, waveguide 110
      can be designed to promote sufficient velocity of the photon
      particle wave that can include a mixture of photons and electrons
      particles, here designated as EM wavefront 112, moving through the
      waveguide 110. Again referring to FIG. 2, x refers to a length of
      exemplary waveguide 110 (which can include energized particle
      forming module 108) and y refers to a height of an aperture
      opening at the end of waveguide 110. In an exemplary embodiment,
      the ratio of x/y can be approximately 3 to 3.5 to 1 to promote
      sufficient velocity of the particles moving through the waveguide
      110. For example, assuming that the aperture opening height (y) is
      six inches, then waveguide 110 length can be from 18 to 21 inches.
      In another embodiment, a length of waveguide 110 can be based on
      the ratio of six times the air gap above an exemplary magnetron's
      cathode. Using the previously mentioned three-inch gap, this
      results in a waveguide length of eighteen inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an exemplary embodiment, the aperture opening can be
      generally rectangular. In an embodiment, the aperture opening
      width can be eight inches for an aperture opening height (y) of
      six inches. In an exemplary embodiment, the length of the launcher
      area before the waveguide 110 can be approximately two inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an exemplary embodiment, the interior surface of
      exemplary waveguide 110 can be coated with approximately two mils
      (0.002 inches) of a noble metal, such as 14-carat gold. Other
      noble metals can include ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium,
      iridium and platinum. Such a coating can improve the gain
      characteristics of waveguide 110. An example of a suitable coating
      process that can be used to enhance the performance of antennas or
      waveguides may be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,221 ,329, the
      disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In an embodiment, waveguide 110 can be configured to
      minimize backscatter of the energized particles using known
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In an exemplary embodiment, EM wavefront 112 can be
      directed through charge transformer 114. In an embodiment, charge
      transformer 112 can have dielectric and physical characteristics
      such that the energized charged particles, e.g., electrons, in an
      EM wavefront 112 can be transformed. While not wishing to be bound
      by any particular theory, this may be done either by changing
      characteristics of the particle, or by generation or emission of
      different particles as a result thereof, thereby creating a
      wavefront 116 at the output of the charge transformer 114.
      Wavefront 116 can propagate toward a target device, e.g., a device
      containing an electronic circuit including a semiconductor. In an
      exemplary embodiment, wavefront 116 with energized particles can
      be focused and can be of high enough energy to allow for
      operations in, for example, a space of approximately 20 feet x 30
      feet. In an exemplary embodiment, a 600 W magnetron can produce a
      wavefront 116 of about 10 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; at the aperture, which
      can result in about 2 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; at 1 meter from the aperture,
      which can be an effective range for an embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In an exemplary embodiment, charge transformer 114 can
      include an incident surface for receiving the EM wavefront 112 and
      an exit surface for radiating the wavefront 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In an exemplary embodiment, charge transformer 114 can
      include a composite of glass and/or polycarbonate materials, for
      example, and can vary in shape. For example, flat plates or panes
      with parallel surfaces can be used as well as convex lenses of a
      desired focal length. Hybrid configurations with parallel surfaces
      at the center and convex surfaces at the edges can also be
      acceptable configurations.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Referring to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, charge
      transformer 114 can include at least one
      electronegative/electropositive material pair, i.e., an
      electronegative layer next to an electropositive layer, or vice
      versa, that first receives EM wavefront 112, followed by
      approximately 1/2 inch of glass or quartz, followed by two
      electronegative layers. In an exemplary embodiment, this assembly
      of layers can be vacuum-sealed in ABS plastic.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Suitable materials for the electronegative/electropositive
      material pair can include known materials that can exhibit
      electronegative/electropositive behavior. As previously mentioned,
      an electropositive material can include a polycarbonate sheet made
      of DELRIN, for example. Suitable polycarbonate can also be chosen
      for electronegative layers. In another embodiment, plate glass can
      be sputtered with metal oxides to achieve desired
      electronegative/electropositive behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an exemplary embodiment, the approximately 1/2 inch of
      glass layer can include leaded glass if additional dampening of
      the emitted zero-charge particle stream is desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In an exemplary embodiment, there can be plural pairs of
      electronegative/electropositive material that first receives EM
      wavefront 112 followed by a glass or quartz layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In an exemplary embodiment, horizontal and/or vertical
      slits or other openings can be formed into or cut out of charge
      transformer 114 so that in addition to wavefront 116 propagating
      from charge transformer 114, charged particles in EM wavefront 112
      can also propagate from the device. A controlled amount of charged
      particles along with wavefront 116 may be useful depending on the
      operating environment. In an exemplary embodiment, the slits or
      other openings may be adjustable by an operator using known
      methods and/or materials. For example, tape, a slide mechanism, or
      an aperture mechanism could be used to adjust the slits. [0041]
      Charge transformer 114 may incorporate known coating materials or
      multiple deposition layers on either the incident surface or the
      exit surface to aid in the wavefront 116 generation, and/or have
      abrasion or polishing performed on either surface to enhance
      desired characteristics of the charge transformer 114. Similarly,
      side surfaces may have similar operations performed to enhance the
      desired charge transformer 114 characteristics. Other compositions
      materials and combinations of materials may be used in the
      fabrication of the charge transformer 114 to achieve desired
      transformation effects. Additionally, other geometries may be used
      for charge transformer 114, including, without limitation,
      stacking additional charge transformer components in combinations
      that may reflect, refract or redirect EM wavefront 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an exemplary embodiment, wavefront 116, after exiting
      charge transformer 114, is shown in FIG. 2 impinging on a target
      device, which in an exemplary embodiment can be up to one meter
      away. Wavefront 116 can propagate through free space until it
      impinges an electronic device where it can disrupt the operation
      of semiconductors therein, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an exemplary embodiment, a sighting device, such as a
      laser rifle scope or sight, can be incorporated into an exemplary
      directed-energy system and used to help direct the wavefront 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] An exemplary method for disrupting the operation of an
      electronic device can include generating plural energized
      particles, directing the plural energized particles to an incident
      surface of a charge transformer and transforming the plural
      energized particles within the charge transformer. The transformed
      particles can be at substantially zero charge and include
      substantially zero charge particles. A method can further include
      generating a wavefront at an exit surface of the charge
      transformer comprising the transformed particles at substantially
      zero charge and impinging an electronic circuit with the wavefront
      comprising the transformed particles at substantially zero charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Transforming the plural energized particles within the
      charge transformer can include laterally aligning the plural
      energized particles to produce a polarization of the plural
      energized particles. The plural energized particles can be
      generated by cross-generation of photons and electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Various system components described above may be resized
      depending on the system parameters desired. For example, charge
      transformer 114 and waveguide 110 can be made larger or smaller
      and can have different dimensions and geometries depending, for
      example, on the power or distance requirements of a particular
      application. Exemplary directed-energy systems can be sized for
      operation within a room, e.g., a floor space of approximately 20
      feet x 30 feet. Additionally, an exemplary charged particle
      emitter 106 may be configured by those skilled in the art to have
      multiple voltages, frequencies, and power levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The precise theory of operation of the charged particle
      generator 100 in combination with the charge transformer 114 is
      not entirely understood. Without wishing to be bound by any
      theory, it is believed that the charge transformer 114 reduces the
      charge in the EM wavefront 112. Based on empirical data to date,
      it has been determined through experimentation, using, for
      example, exemplary embodiments described herein, that the
      particles in wavefront 116 are at a zero-charge state and
      approximately the same mass as an electron (9.10938188 *
      10&lt;'31&gt; kilograms).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] While reiterating that the precise theory of operation is
      not entirely understood, it is believed that the effect is such
      that when a wavefront of exemplary zero-charge particles with
      sufficient energy density impinges a circuit, including a
      semiconductor, for example, the kinetic energy of the particles,
      rather than an associated electromagnetic charge, causes a type of
      saturation of the semiconductor. It is possible that the
      zero-charge particles impinging on semiconductor react with
      impurities, e.g., metal oxides, present in the semiconductors, to
      cause a resonant frequency. This resonant frequency may cause
      mechanical or physical oscillations in a defect region of a
      semiconductor, which in turn may cause electron flow to stop or
      become greatly reduced because a physical travel path for the
      electrons and/or holes (charge carriers) has been disrupted, e.g.,
      in a gate region of the semiconductor. Experimental observations
      have shown that a semiconductor may be temporarily disrupted for
      the amount of time the zero-charge particles are impinging on the
      semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Unlike systems that rely exclusively on an electromagnetic
      field or charged particles to gain access to protected equipment
      for disruptive purposes, it is believed, based on experimental
      observations, that an exemplary embodiment of a directed-energy
      system using zero-charge particles can be an effective way to
      defeat known countermeasure methods, such as Faraday cages,<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to electronic countermeasure
      jamming systems that are capable of interrupting radio links from
      triggering devices used in connection with improvised explosive
      devices. In particular, the invention related to a look through
      mode for sensing the presence of radio links.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Description Of Related
        Art</span><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Known countermeasure systems have diverse broadband radio
      signal generators that are fed into a relatively simple antenna.
      The antenna attempts to have omni-directional coverage. The
      simplest antenna is a half dipole oriented vertically at the
      center of the area to be protected by jamming The problem with
      such antennas is that they do not have spherical coverage patterns
      for truly omni coverage. Coverage of such a simple antenna appears
      shaped like a donut with gaps in coverage above and below the
      plane of the donut because the simple dipole cannot operate as
      both an end fire antenna and an omni antenna. More complex
      antennas may add coverage in end fire directions but generate
      interference patterns that leave gaps in coverage.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In an environment where small improvised explosive devices
      (IED) are placed in airplanes, busses or trains and triggered by
      radio links distant from the IED, it becomes more important to
      successfully jam the radio link without gaps in jamming system
      coverage.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Known omni directional systems radiate to provide 360
      degree coverage on a plane with elevations plus or minus of the
      plane. Very few truly omni directional antenna systems are known
      to create coverage in three dimensions on a unit sphere.
      Difficulties are encountered that include, for example, the feed
      point through the sphere causes distortion of the radiation
      pattern, metal structures near the antenna cause reflections that
      distort the radiation pattern, and the individual radiating
      element of an antenna inherently does not produce a spherical
      radiation pattern. In addition, providing a spherical radiation
      pattern over a broad band of frequencies can be extremely
      difficult. Antenna structures intended to shape the radiation
      pattern at one frequency can cause distortion in the radiation
      pattern at another frequency.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0007] A system includes a generator and at least one device. The
      generator includes a waveform oscillator and a blanking pulse
      generator. Each device includes a transmit antenna, a receive
      antenna, an antenna unit, a mixer and a detector. The antenna unit
      includes a receiver coupled to the receive antenna, an amplifier
      coupled to the receiver and a transmitter coupled to the transmit
      antenna and the blanking pulse generator. The mixer has inputs
      coupled to the amplifier and the waveform oscillator. The detector
      is coupled to the mixer.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      [0093] In yet another embodiment, frequency modulated waveform
      signal 1292 is caused to dwell for a longer period at a particular
      frequency to address an important threat within the band of any
      one of the band specific modulators 1224, 1226, 1228. In FIG. 17,
      there is depicted frequency modulated waveform signal 1300 that is
      comprised of six segments: 1304, 1306, 1308, 1310, 1312 and 1314.
      Segment 1304 has a relatively fast rise in frequency for a unit of
      time when compared to segment 1306 that has a comparatively slower
      rise in frequency for the same unit of time. Then, segment 1308
      resumes the relatively fast rise in frequency per unit of time
      that characterizes segment 1304. Segments 1310, 1312 and 1314 are
      mirror symmetric conjugates of segments 1308, 1306 and 1304
      respectively. This frequency modulated waveform signal 1300 is
      repeated at a desired predetermined rate. A representative threat
      table with only the scanning parameters is depicted in Table 1.<br>
