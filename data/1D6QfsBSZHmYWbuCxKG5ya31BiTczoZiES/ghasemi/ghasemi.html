        <i>New spongelike structure converts solar energy into steam.</i><br>

      <br>
      A new material structure developed at MIT generates steam by
      soaking up the sun.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      The structure — a layer of graphite flakes and an underlying
      carbon foam — is a porous, insulating material structure that
      floats on water. When sunlight hits the structure’s surface, it
      creates a hotspot in the graphite, drawing water up through the
      material’s pores, where it evaporates as steam. The brighter the
      light, the more steam is generated.<br>
      <br>
      The new material is able to convert 85 percent of incoming solar
      energy into steam — a significant improvement over recent
      approaches to solar-powered steam generation. What’s more, the
      setup loses very little heat in the process, and can produce steam
      at relatively low solar intensity. This would mean that, if scaled
      up, the setup would likely not require complex, costly systems to
      highly concentrate sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Hadi Ghasemi, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Mechanical
      Engineering, says the spongelike structure can be made from
      relatively inexpensive materials — a particular advantage for a
      variety of compact, steam-powered applications.<br>
      <br>
      “Steam is important for desalination, hygiene systems, and
      sterilization,” says Ghasemi, who led the development of the
      structure. “Especially in remote areas where the sun is the only
      source of energy, if you can generate steam with solar energy, it
      would be very useful.”<br>
      <br>
      Ghasemi and mechanical engineering department head Gang Chen,
      along with five others at MIT, report on the details of the new
      steam-generating structure in the journal Nature Communications. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Cutting the optical concentration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Today, solar-powered steam generation involves vast fields of
      mirrors or lenses that concentrate incoming sunlight, heating
      large volumes of liquid to high enough temperatures to produce
      steam. However, these complex systems can experience significant
      heat loss, leading to inefficient steam generation.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, scientists have explored ways to improve the efficiency
      of solar-thermal harvesting by developing new solar receivers and
      by working with nanofluids. The latter approach involves mixing
      water with nanoparticles that heat up quickly when exposed to
      sunlight, vaporizing the surrounding water molecules as steam. But
      initiating this reaction requires very intense solar energy —
      about 1,000 times that of an average sunny day.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, the MIT approach generates steam at a solar intensity
      about 10 times that of a sunny day — the lowest optical
      concentration reported thus far. The implication, the researchers
      say, is that steam-generating applications can function with lower
      sunlight concentration and less-expensive tracking systems. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      “This is a huge advantage in cost-reduction,” Ghasemi says.
      “That’s exciting for us because we’ve come up with a new approach
      to solar steam generation.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>From sun to steam</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The approach itself is relatively simple: Since steam is generated
      at the surface of a liquid, Ghasemi looked for a material that
      could both efficiently absorb sunlight and generate steam at a
      liquid’s surface.<br>
      <br>
      After trials with multiple materials, he settled on a thin,
      double-layered, disc-shaped structure. Its top layer is made from
      graphite that the researchers exfoliated by placing the material
      in a microwave. The effect, Chen says, is “just like popcorn”: The
      graphite bubbles up, forming a nest of flakes. The result is a
      highly porous material that can better absorb and retain solar
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      The structure’s bottom layer is a carbon foam that contains
      pockets of air to keep the foam afloat and act as an insulator,
      preventing heat from escaping to the underlying liquid. The foam
      also contains very small pores that allow water to creep up
      through the structure via capillary action.<br>
      <br>
      As sunlight hits the structure, it creates a hotspot in the
      graphite layer, generating a pressure gradient that draws water up
      through the carbon foam. As water seeps into the graphite layer,
      the heat concentrated in the graphite turns the water into steam.
      The structure works much like a sponge that, when placed in water
      on a hot, sunny day, can continuously absorb and evaporate liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers tested the structure by placing it in a chamber of
      water and exposing it to a solar simulator — a light source that
      simulates various intensities of solar radiation. They found they
      were able to convert 85 percent of solar energy into steam at a
      solar intensity 10 times that of a typical sunny day.<br>
      <br>
      Ghasemi says the structure may be designed to be even more
      efficient, depending on the type of materials used.<br>
      <br>
      “There can be different combinations of materials that can be used
      in these two layers that can lead to higher efficiencies at lower
      concentrations,” Ghasemi says. “There is still a lot of research
      that can be done on implementing this in larger systems.”<br>

      Currently, steam generation using solar energy is based on heating
      bulk liquid to high temperatures. This approach requires either
      costly high optical concentrations leading to heat loss by the hot
      bulk liquid and heated surfaces or vacuum. New solar receiver
      concepts such as porous volumetric receivers or nanofluids have
      been proposed to decrease these losses. Here we report development
      of an approach and corresponding material structure for solar
      steam generation while maintaining low optical concentration and
      keeping the bulk liquid at low temperature with no vacuum. We
      achieve solar thermal efficiency up to 85%... This high
      performance results from four structure characteristics: absorbing
      in the solar spectrum, thermally insulating, hydrophilic and
      interconnected pores. The structure concentrates thermal energy
      and fluid flow where needed for phase change and minimizes
      dissipated energy. This new structure provides a novel approach to
      harvesting solar energy for a broad range of phase-change
      applications.<br>

      A localized heating structure, and method of forming same, for use

      a hydrophilic surface, and an expanded carbon structure adjacent

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to structures that promote
      localized heating, and more specifically to structures for
      promoting the heating and phase change of liquids for use with
      solar collectors and other heating systems to harvest solar
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Solar irradiation is a promising source of renewable
      energy, as the hourly incident solar flux on the surface of the
      earth is greater than the annual global energy consumption. This
      resource is utilized in a variety of applications divided mostly
      into two main areas: photovoltaics and photo-thermal applications.
      Photo-thermal applications for harvesting solar energy currently
      suffer from low efficiency and require high concentrations of
      sunlight, which add complexity and cost to the solar energy
      harvesting systems. These applications are divided into three
      categories: low, medium, and high temperature. Currently, low and
      medium temperature applications are limited to small-scale
      residential and commercial use. In high temperature applications,
      concentrated solar power (CSP) systems have recently been used to
      produce steam with the temperature of approximately 450° C. The
      superheated steam drives a heat engine (efficiency of 35-40%) to
      generate electricity. The thermal efficiency (?th) of these
      systems are defined as<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0005] where {dot over (m)} denotes the mass flow rate, hLV total
      enthalpy of liquid-vapor phase change, Copt the optical
      concentration, and qi the direct solar irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Solar collectors are one type of system to harvest
      low-temperature solar energy. In these collectors, working fluid
      (mostly water) flows through a solar panel to absorb irradiated
      power. These collectors are divided into two groups: surface and
      volumetric collectors. Conventional surface-based solar collectors
      (e.g., those which use a black surface to absorb sunlight and
      transfer the thermal energy to the adjacent working fluid) have a
      typical efficiency, ?th, of 52%. Volumetric collectors have been
      recently proposed and utilize nanofluids—fluids seeded with
      nanoparticles—to harvest solar energy. A range of nanoparticles
      (NPs) and fluids are considered for these collectors. For example,
      Otanicar et al. in “Nanofluid-based direct absorption solar
      collector,” Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy 2, 033102
      (2010) used nanofluids of carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphite, and
      silver NPs in these solar collectors. The ?th efficiency of 55%
      and 57% was achieved with graphite and silver NPs, respectively.
      Tyagi et al. in “Predicted Efficiency of a Low-Temperature
      Nanofluid-Based Direct Absorption Solar Collector,” Journal of
      Solar Energy Engineering 131, 041004 (2009) showed 10% increase in
      ?th of solar collectors by using Al NPs-water as the working
      fluid. The enhanced efficiency of volumetric collectors compared
      to the surface collectors is attributed to three factors: higher
      absorbance of nanofluids due to NPs, uniform temperature in the
      fluid, and enhanced thermal conductivity of nanofluid. If NPs
      smaller than the mean free path of the bulk material are used, the
      absorption spectrum is typically broadened with no change in
      absorption peak leading to enhanced absorption efficiency. The
      measured absorbance of these nanofluids can reach 95% and the rest
      is the reflectance. However, the critical drawback of these
      systems is the high portion of heat loss by convection which is
      between 28-41% as measured by Otanicar et al., mentioned above.
      This limitation puts a cap on further development of volumetric
      collectors. In both surface and volumetric collectors, nearly half
      of the absorbed energy is dissipated to the surrounding medium and
      is converted to low-quality energy. This suggests new approaches
      are needed to minimize the dissipated heat in order to boost the
      photo-thermal efficiency of the solar collectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] With another approach, localization of thermal energy is
      suggested to drive a thermally-activated phenomenon. Local heating
      of NPs is achieved through illumination by electromagnetic waves
      (e.g., generally, lasers). The local temperature rise around these
      NPs is used for a range of applications. For example, Sershen et
      al. in “Temperature-sensitive polymer—nanoshell composites for
      photothermally modulated drug delivery,” Journal of Biomedical
      Materials Research 51, 293-298 (2000) utilized the photo-thermal
      local heating for drug-delivery. Specifically, Au NPs in a
      microgel structure show enhanced temperatures with laser
      illumination and cause a collapse in the surrounding hydrogel
      matrix. The burst leads to the release of any soluble material
      held in the hydrogel. Lowe et al. in “Laser-induced temperature
      jump electrochemistry on gold nanoparticle-coated electrodes,”
      Journal of the American Chemical Society 125, 14258-9 (2003)
      locally heated the surface of gold nanoparticle-coated indium tin
      oxide (ITO) electrodes in an electrolyte solution. The induced
      temperature rise impacts the open-circuit potential of the
      electrode. Jones and Lyon in “Photothermal patterning of
      microgel/gold nanoparticle composite colloidal crystals,” Journal
      of the American Chemical Society 125, 460-5 (2003) introduced
      local photo-thermal heating for phase-change of a microgel/gold
      nanoparticle composite colloid. By illuminating with a laser
      resonant with Au plasmon absorption, they introduced local heating
      to cause a crystalline-amorphous phase change in the microgel
      matrix. In these approaches, high-quality energy is introduced
      locally to drive a physical or chemical phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] For surface plasmon (SP) induced heating, Govorov et al.
      developed a model to predict maximum temperature rise at the
      surface of plasmonic NPs as<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0009] where T8 denotes the temperature of the medium, RNP&lt;2
      &gt;the radius of the NP, k the thermal conductivity of the
      medium, ? the frequency of the incident wave, e0 dielectric
      constant of the medium, eNP dielectric constant of the NP, I0 the
      intensity of the electromagnetic wave in the medium, and c the
      speed of light. This equation suggests that (T-T8)? RNP&lt;2&gt;.
      Keblinski et al. in “Limits of localized heating by
      electromagnetically excited nanoparticles,” Journal of Applied
      Physics 100, 054305 (2006) studied the limit of the global
      temperature rise of a NP under illumination by electromagnetic
      waves. They solved the diffusive heat equation with constant heat
      flux at the surface of the NP. In the liquid and amorphous phases
      due to lack of crystallinity, the mean free path is on the order
      of atomic distances and consequently the applicability of the
      diffusive heat equation at the nanoscale is justified. The maximum
      temperature rise on the NP is given by<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0010] where sp denotes the cross-sectional area of the NP and tnp
      the radius of NP. Similarly, by analogy with electrostatics, the
      temperature rise for an ensemble of NPs that form an agglomerate
      with the radius of Rag is<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0011] where ?N denotes the concentration of particles per volume.
      For plasmonic NPs, a comparison of the temperature rise calculated
      from the existing theories and the measured temperature rise from
      experiments generally does not show a good agreement between the
      theory and the experiments. The discrepancy suggests that the
      fundamental understanding of heat generation at this scale is
      still unresolved. The interfacial thermal resistance, the role of
      hot electrons, and the mechanism of heat transfer at this scale
      (ballistic or diffusive) are among the open questions.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Local heating can be utilized in the heating or
      phase-change of water to harvest solar energy. Efficient
      harvesting of solar energy for steam generation is a key factor
      for a broad range of applications, from large-scale power
      generation, absorption chillers, and desalination systems to
      compact applications such as water purification for drinking,
      sterilization, and hygiene systems in remote areas where the only
      abundant energy source is the sun. Current methods of generating
      steam using solar energy rely on a surface or cavity to absorb the
      solar radiation, and transferring heat to the bulk liquid directly
      or via an intermediate carrier fluid. These methods, however,
      require high optical concentration and suffer from high optical
      loss and surface heat loss, or require vacuum to reduce convective
      heat loss under moderate optical concentration. The steam
      generated is usually in thermal equilibrium with the bulk liquid.
      Nanofluids have been studied as volumetric absorbers, potentially
      minimizing the surface energy loss by uniform temperature in the
      fluid and enhanced thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. Local
      generation of steam in a cold bulk liquid can be achieved through
      high concentrations or illumination of nanofluids by
      electromagnetic waves with high power intensity. Recently, Neumann
      et al. in “Solar vapor generation enabled by nanoparticles,”
      ACSNano 7, 42-9 (2012) and “Compact solar autoclave based on steam
      generation using broadband light-harvesting nanoparticles,” Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 11677-81 (2013) succeeded in the
      generation of steam in bulk water with Au NPs with the power of
      10&lt;3 &gt;kW/m (optical concentration, Copt, of 1000). However,
      the solar-thermal conversion efficiency of the approach was still
      only 24%. High optical concentrations limit the utilization of
      these approaches in stand-alone compact solar systems.
      Furthermore, high optical concentrations add complexity and cost
      to the solar-thermal conversion system.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Various embodiments of the present invention provide
      structures that harvest solar energy efficiently in the form of
      heat. These structures concentrate the solar energy locally where
      it is needed and consequently minimize the dissipated thermal
      energy. The structures described herein aim to enhance the surface
      evaporation, to boost the efficiency of solar heating and to
      achieve local boiling at low Copt by minimizing heat dissipation
      to the surrounding medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As discussed in more detail below, one embodiment of a
      localized heating structure provides a layered structure which
      absorbs solar illumination and confines the thermal energy
      (formation of a hot spot) to near the structure's surface while
      efficiently wicking the fluid to this hot spot for enhanced
      evaporation flux. This localized heating structure yields a
      solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 85% at 10 kWm&lt;-2
      &gt;solar illumination, while generating steam in open air. One
      example of a localized heating structure includes a double layer
      structure (DLS). The DLS includes a thermally insulating,
      hydrophilic layer having a network of interconnected pores
      supporting a porous, hydrophilic, expanded carbon structure. The
      four main characteristics of the localized heating structure
      include (1) high absorption in the solar spectrum, (2) low thermal
      conductivity to suppress thermal conduction away from the hot
      internal region, (3) hydrophilic surfaces (i.e., contact angle, ?,
      &lt;90°) to leverage capillary forces and promote fluid flow to
      the hot region, and (4) interconnected pores for fluid flow to and
      from the structure. Localization of heat is achieved by the
      broad-spectrum absorbing and thermally insulating properties of
      the heating structure while the fluid flow is channeled to the hot
      spot by its hydrophilic and porous nature. The enhancement in the
      fluid evaporation rate through the heating structure is an
      increasing function of the solar concentration and for incident
      power equivalent to one sun (1000 W/m&lt;2&gt;), this enhancement
      is 1.9 times that of water without the heating structure. The
      thermal efficiency of this structure is 71% and 80% for solar
      power 1000 W/m&lt;2 &gt;and 2000 W/m&lt;2&gt;, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In another embodiment, a heating structure localizes the
      solar energy internally for solar heating. The heating structure
      includes a porous, expanded carbon structure sandwiched between
      two thermally insulating layers, such as aerogel layers, e.g.,
      silica aerogel layers. A hot region is induced in the expanded
      carbon structure and the low surface temperature of the top
      thermally insulating layer minimizes the energy dissipation by
      convection and radiation. The thermal efficiency of this system
      can reach close to 100% by proper design of the thermally
      insulating layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In another embodiment, a hydrophobic, volumetric absorbing
      structure promotes the nucleation of a vapor phase throughout the
      liquid volume, which significantly enhances the rate of boiling.
      With this volumetric absorber structure, the threshold
      concentration of solar energy required for local phase-change is
      reduced drastically compared to previous structures. The mechanism
      of local phase-change may be extended to other micro- and
      nanoparticles (NPs) and other base fluids. Details of illustrative
      embodiments are discussed below. Although the discussion below
      describes structures for the heating and phase change of water,
      other liquids may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 1 schematically shows a localized heating structure 10
      according to embodiments of the present invention, and FIG. 2
      shows an exemplary heating structure in a container with water.
      The heating structure 10 includes a bottom layer having a
      thermally insulating, hydrophilic layer 12 with a network of
      interconnected pores and a top layer having a porous, hydrophilic,
      expanded carbon structure 14. Preferably, the thermally insulating
      layer 12 has a thermal conductivity of less than about 10 W/(mK).
      As shown in FIG. 3B, the thermally insulating bottom layer 12 is
      configured with smaller pore sizes than the top layer 14 in order
      to promote liquid supply and the expanded carbon structure top
      layer 14 is configured with larger pore sizes than the bottom
      layer 12 in order to promote vapor escape. Preferably, the density
      of the thermally insulating layer 12 is less than about 3000
      kg/m&lt;3 &gt;and the pores of the thermally insulating layer 12
      have an average diameter of about 300-600 µm. The expanded carbon
      structure 14 preferably has a porosity of greater than about 80%.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The low surface temperature of the heating structure 10
      minimizes losses due to thermal convection and radiation to the
      environment. For a constant heat generation, the steady state
      solution of a diffusive heat equation with boundaries at T8
      provides the maximum temperature at the center of the slab<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Where h denotes the thickness of slab. At low values of
      Copt, by proper selection of the medium, the value of ? can be
      tuned to achieve a hot spot in the center of slab. For example,
      for a slab with thickness of 1 cm under solar illumination with no
      optical concentration Copt=1 and the thermal conductivity of 0.03
      W/(mK), the temperature rise can reach to 83° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The porous structure and hydrophilic surface of the
      localized heating structure 10 promotes the flow of water to the
      surface due to capillary force. For a pore with diameter of a, the
      capillary rise (ht) is given by<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0029] where ? denotes the liquid-vapor surface tension, ? the
      contact angle, ? the density of fluid, and g gravitational
      acceleration. For a hydrophilic surface (?&lt;90), ht is positive
      and for a hydrophobic surface (?&gt;90), ht is negative. To
      leverage the capillary force in the surface evaporation, the
      surfaces of both layers of the heating structure 10 are made
      hydrophilic. The capillary force in the expanded carbon layer 14
      enhances the evaporation rate of fluid through a few mechanisms,
      e.g., formation of thin films on the surface of graphite sheets,
      enhanced roughness of the surface, and formation of three-phase
      contact lines at the edges of the capillaries.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As shown in FIG. 2, the localized heating structure 10 is a
      floating structure that includes two or more layers of which the
      bottom layer is a porous, thermally insulating layer 12, such as
      carbon foam or an aerogel, and the top layer is the porous,
      expanded carbon structure 14, such as expanded graphite. The
      bottom layer 12 helps to further suppress the thermal conduction
      from the hot region in the top layer 14 to the bulk underlying
      water. The combination of these two layers concentrates the
      incident solar power locally near the surface of the liquid where
      the thermal energy for evaporation is needed. As shown with the
      arrows in FIG. 1, during the evaporation process, the fluid wicks
      into the pores in the thermally insulating layer 12, then into the
      hot spot in the expanded carbon structure 14, evaporates and forms
      vapor, which leaves the heated structure 10 from the top surface
      of the expanded carbon structure 14. Preferably, the thickness of
      the thermally insulating layer 12 may be less than about 20 cm,
      and the thickness of the expanded carbon structure 14 may be less
      than about 10 cm, and preferably about 5 to about 8 mm, although
      other thicknesses may also be used depending on the materials and
      desired application. The top layer 14 may also be made to be
      magnetic, which facilitates its collection after use, through the
      addition of iron during the fabrication procedure, as described in
      more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The reflectivity of the expanded carbon structure 14 is
      preferably less than about 10% in the solar spectrum (250-2250
      nm). Thus, 90% or more of the irradiated solar power is absorbed
      within the top layer 14. Absorption in the top layer 14 induces
      the hot spot or region in the top layer 14 of the heating
      structure 10 where evaporation occurs. The thermal energy
      concentrated in this region can be transferred through several
      modes, e.g., liquid-vapor phase change, convection to the air, and
      conduction to the bottom underlying water. The last two modes of
      heat loss (convection and dissipation to the deeper water) should
      be minimized to boost the thermal efficiency of the evaporation
      process. Convection is strongly affected by the surface
      temperature of the heating structure. With the solar illumination
      of one sun, assuming h of 10 W/(m&lt;2&gt;K), this mode dissipates
      approximately 10% of the incident solar power to the environment.
      The porous, thermally insulating bottom layer 12 of the heating
      structure 10 minimizes conduction to the water. Thus, embodiments
      of the heating structure 10 enhance the evaporation rate while
      keeping the underlying water temperature low by channeling the
      heat and fluid to where they are needed. For example, when the
      thermally insulating bottom layer 12 is formed from a carbon foam,
      the foam structure itself has a thermal conductivity of 0.03-0.05
      (W/(mK)) in air. Once it is immersed in the water, the thermal
      conductivity of the bottom layer is determined by the effective
      medium theory because water within the foam also conducts heat.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Therefore, the thermally insulating layer 12 is preferably
      chosen so that it has a low thermal conductivity even when soaked
      in water or the liquid to be evaporated. The thermally insulating
      layer 12 is important for localizing thermal energy within the top
      layer 14. Preferably, the thermally insulating layer 12 includes
      both open and closed pores. The closed pores have several
      advantages, e.g., floating the structure, lowering the thermal
      conductivity, and limiting the fluid flow to the surface. Low
      thermal conductivity and limited fluid flow lead to the formation
      of the hot spot and generation of steam in the top layer 14 at low
      optical concentrations. The open pores provide paths for fluid to
      flow to the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The top expanded carbon structure 14 may be formed from a
      low thermally conductive expanded graphite layer which absorbs
      solar irradiation volumetrically. For example, the expanded
      graphite layer may be formed from acid-washed graphite flakes
      (commercially available from Anthracite Industries Inc.). In one
      embodiment, the acid-washed graphite flakes may be mixed with iron
      (II) acetate anhydrous, 97% (commercially available from Strem
      Chemicals) with a ratio of 60-40 wt %. The mixture or flakes are
      heated in a microwave for about 7 seconds to form an exfoliated,
      expanded fluffy structure. The trapped gases between the graphite
      layers expand in the synthesis process and detach the flakes from
      each other. The volumetric exfoliation during this process is
      approximately 100 times. The surface area of the exfoliated
      graphite layer is approximately 320 m&lt;2&gt;g&lt;-1&gt;, 32
      times higher than unprocessed graphite flakes, which allows for
      more efficient heat transfer to the fluid. The dispersed iron
      species formed after the decomposition of iron (II) acetate
      provides a ferromagnetic structure. The ferromagnetism of the
      exfoliated graphite helps its collection after use. The
      acid-washed graphite flakes originally have a hydrophobic surface.
      However, in the exfoliation process, due to high temperature, the
      graphite surface is oxidized and turns into a hydrophilic surface.
      Other candidates for the porous, hydrophilic carbon structure 14
      may include amorphous carbon foams and carbon nanotube (CNT)
      sponges.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The bottom thermally insulating layer 12 may be formed from
      carbon foam, e.g., Duocel carbon foam of type PPI 80 (80 pores per
      inch) (commercially available from K. R. Reynolds). In one
      embodiment, the carbon foam is washed in 4% molar nitric acid for
      2 hrs while stirring to make its surface hydrophilic. FIGS. 3A and
      3B show a perspective view and cross-sectional view, respectively,
      of a localized heating structure 10 with a top layer formed 14
      from an expanded graphite layer and a bottom layer 12 formed from
      carbon foam. FIG. 3A is shown with a 5× magnification, and FIG. 3B
      is shown with a 43× magnification. A more detailed description of
      the dual layer structure and its testing parameters are described
      in Ghasemi et al., “Solar steam generation by heat localization,”
      Nature Communications, 5:4449 (2014), incorporated by reference
      herein in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Alternatively, or in addition, the thermally insulating
      layer 12 may be formed from an aerogel. Aerogel synthesis is well
      known and established processing steps can be used to synthesize
      the thermally insulating layer 12. For example, a procedure for
      synthesizing wet silica gels by the sol-gel polymerization of
      tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) may be used. Because hydrolysis
      of TMOS is much faster than that of tetraethyl orthosilicate
      (TEOS), NH3 is used as a condensation catalyst rather than HCl as
      a hydrolysis catalyst. TMOS is diluted by methanol (MeOH) followed
      by adding NH3 and water. One possible mixing mole ratio of
      chemicals is NH3:TMOS:water:methanol=0.07:1:4:6. Then, the sol may
      be gelled in a disposal vial. For example, the sol may be gelled
      in a disposal vial for about one week, and then the lid of the
      sol-gel mold may be removed. By varying the pH during the aerogel
      synthesis process, and/or the drying time during the drying
      process, the pore size of the aerogel can be controlled. Although
      silica aerogels are naturally strongly absorbing from 5-30 µm,
      absorption from 3-5 µm can be further increased through the
      addition of water or other dopants (e.g., carbon-based dopants)
      into the aerogel. The thermal conductivity of aerogels also
      depends strongly on its structures, which should be optimized in
      conjunction with its optical properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Embodiments of the heating structure 10 provide the maximum
      ?th which is 68% at 1000 W/m&lt;2 &gt;The efficiency achieved
      under 1× concentration of solar illumination is about 11% higher
      than the maximum values previously reported. Thus, the heating
      structure 10 of the present invention provides a significant step
      forward in enhancing the efficiency of the phase-change process in
      solar systems and other heating systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The localized heating structure 10 may also include one or
      more additional layers on either side of or between the bottom and
      top layers 12, 14. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the heating
      structure 10 may include an aerogel layer 16 adjacent to the top
      layer 14, so that the expanded carbon structure 14 is sandwiched
      between the aerogel layer 16 and the thermally insulating layer
      12. This configuration of the localized heating structure 10
      concentrates the solar energy in a specific flow region for solar
      heating and minimizes the dissipated thermal energy. The aerogel
      layer 16 is transparent in the visible spectrum but opaque in the
      infrared region. Preferably, the aerogel layer 16 is formed from a
      silica aerogel. The thermal conductivity of silica aerogel is
      0.02±0.003 W/(mK). This low value of thermal conductivity allows
      for localization of thermal energy in the expanded carbon
      structure 14. In solar heating systems, the working fluid flows
      through the expanded carbon structure 14 to absorb the thermal
      energy. Since the surface temperature of the top aerogel layer 16
      is low, the energy dissipation by the convection and radiation is
      minimized. The thermal efficiency of this heating structure 10 can
      reach close to 100% by proper design of the aerogel layer 16 and
      the bottom layer 12. Furthermore, embodiments having this
      configuration are economically a better choice than nanofluids
      based solar collectors. Preferably, the top aerogel layer 16 is
      transparent to solar radiation, but the transparency of the bottom
      layer 12, when formed with an aerogel layer, is not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Embodiments of the localized heating structure 10 may be
      formed with various materials and layers, but should include a
      porous layer 14 for absorbing the solar radiation and an
      insulating layer 12 between the liquid to be evaporated and the
      porous layer 14. The porous, absorbing layer 14 allows water or
      other liquids to be evaporated to be supplied to this region and
      vapor to escape from this region. The porous, absorbing layer 14
      could be designed with low thermal conductivity such that heat
      does not leak out. The thermal insulation layer 12 helps to
      prevent the solar radiation absorbed by the porous, absorbing
      layer 14 from being lost to the environment by convection and by
      thermal radiation. For example, other layers may be incorporated
      below the porous, absorbing layer 14, to better supply water to
      this layer 14 and/or to provide a path for the generated steam to
      leave the layer 14. Other structures especially designed for the
      vapor passage can be incorporated into the heating structure 10.
      In addition, both layers 12, 14 are described as having
      hydrophilic surfaces (i.e., contact angle, ?, &lt;90°), but a
      combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces may also be
      used. For example, a composite with mixed hydrophilic and
      hydrophobic regions may be used to better control the liquid
      supply rate. In addition, the porous absorbing layer 14 can also
      be designed to have different porosities, smaller pores for liquid
      supply and larger pores for vapor escape.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] For applications that require heating throughout the entire
      fluid volume, another embodiment of a heating structure is
      provided that locally absorbs and concentrates the electromagnetic
      illumination. As shown in FIG. 5, a volumetric absorber 20 is
      formed from NPs 22 in an aqueous suspension 24. The volumetric
      absorber 20 can form a homogeneous spherical agglomerate with the
      radius of Rag. In this case, the steady state solution of the heat
      equation provides the maximum temperature at the center of the
      agglomerate of<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      For low optical concentration, Copt, and in an aqueous solution,
      the expected temperature rise, T, is much smaller than the
      temperature required for vapor-phase nucleation. For low values of
      Copt, the temperature rise on the NPs 22 in contact with water is
      small. Thus, local boiling on the surface of NPs 22 requires
      concentration close to Copt=100. The developed system consists of
      an aqueous solution 24 of NPs 22 that have hydrophobic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In one embodiment, a hydrophobic carbon is used, e.g.,
      carbon black (CB) particles. For example, a nanofluid composed of
      these particles and water are prepared with carbon concentration
      of 1 wt %. The nanofluid is sonicated for 5 min to make a
      homogenous solution. The particles precipitate after few minutes;
      however, the nanofluid will undergo buoyancy-driven convection
      once it is exposed to a threshold concentration of solar
      irradiation and again becomes homogeneous. The transmittance of
      this fluid is less than 0.01% suggesting that the most of solar
      power is absorbed by the particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In an aqueous solution, if two hydrophobic surfaces are
      brought close together, the liquid water is not a stable phase
      between them and the liquid transforms to the vapor phase 26.
      Although the formation of vapor phase is thermodynamically
      feasible, a kinetic barrier may limit the formation of vapor phase
      to only few nanometer gap between the hydrophobic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A stability analysis is performed to demonstrate the
      formation of a vapor phase once two hydrophobic surfaces come
      close to each other. The thermodynamic potential of the system is
      written as<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      where U denotes the internal energy, T temperature, P pressure, S
      entropy, V volume, µ the chemical potential, N the number of
      moles, subscript C the composite system, superscript R the
      reservoir (in this case, the liquid phase) and subscript i the
      components in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Consider the thermodynamic potential for the V-shape pore.
      The reference state (state 0) is when the V-shape pore is
      completely filled with water. If the thermodynamic potential of
      the vapor state (B) is less than the value of the fully wetted
      state (B0) (e.g., if B-B0&lt;0), there exists the possibility for
      the formation of a stable vapor phase. Thus, we evaluate<br>
      <br>
      B-B0=(P&lt;L&gt;-P&lt;V&gt;)V&lt;V&gt;+(?&lt;LV &gt;cos
      ?)A&lt;SV&gt;+?&lt;LV &gt;A&lt;LV &gt;&nbsp; (9)<br>
      <br>
      where ?&lt;LV &gt;denotes the surface tension of liquid-vapor
      phase, A the surface area, superscript V vapor phase, superscript
      L liquid phase, superscript LV the liquid-vapor phase, superscript
      SV the solid-vapor phase. Since the radius of the liquid-vapor
      interface (a) is much smaller than the capillary length of water
      (2.6 mm), the liquid-vapor interface is assumed to be spherical.
      Thus,<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      Assuming the Young-Laplace equation is valid at the liquid-vapor
      interface of these nano-scale pores, the pressure drop across the
      liquid-vapor interface is<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Combining eqs. (10)-(16), and eq. (9) for a given contact
      angle of the fluid on the solid surface (?), the difference in
      thermodynamic potential, B-B0, is determined as a function of the
      angle of V-shape pore (2a). This suggests that for small contact
      angle the vapor phase is a stable phase in a V-shape pore. For an
      agglomerate of particles, these vapor phases could be
      interconnected. This interconnection of the vapor phase drops the
      thermal conductivity of medium surrounding the light-absorbing
      particle from the relatively high liquid value of ~0.6 W m&lt;-1
      &gt;K&lt;-1 &gt;to that of the vapor phase ( ~0.02 W m&lt;-1
      &gt;K&lt;-1&gt;), which is a 30× reduction in the value of ?.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The rough surface on these particles provides the correct
      condition for the formation a stable vapor phase. The density of
      CB particles (?CB) is ~2000 kg/m&lt;3 &gt;and their radius (rp) is
      ~100 nm. Given this and assuming the thermal conductivity of vapor
      phase surrounding the particles, for Copt=6, if the size of
      agglomerates is more than 120 µm, then the temperature of vapor
      phase exceeds the saturation temperature and stable vapor bubbles
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Preferably, the size of the agglomerates ranges form
      100-600 µm. The vapor temperature reaches 100° C. after a several
      minutes, while the liquid temperature is still close to 80° C.
      Copt=5.5 is the lowest concentration to generate steam with the
      temperature of 100° C. Using this structure, steam is generated
      with 200 times lower concentration than previous structures. This
      drastic drop in the threshold Copt is attributed to the existence
      of the stable vapor phase in the hydrophobic surface of
      agglomerate of CB particles. As the thermal conductivity of vapor
      phase is 30 times less than that of liquid water, the threshold
      Copt drops significantly.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The bubble grows once it is supplied enough energy for the
      phase transformation. As the bubble grows, the temperature inside
      the vapor bubble is a function of the density of particles, ?N. We
      assume ?N remains constant as the droplet grows. The supplied
      energy to the bubble contributes to both phase change at the
      liquid-vapor interface and thermal conduction to the liquid phase.
      If the vapor phase is assumed to be an ideal gas, for a vapor
      bubble with the radius of (Rag+r), combining the energy balance
      and the Young-Laplace equation at the liquid-vapor interface gives<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      where {dot over (q)} is equal qi(? r Rag&lt;2&gt;) and R denotes
      the gas constant. For a given solar irradiation, {dot over (q)},
      one can rewrite the equation in terms of the bubble growth rate,
      {dot over (r)}, and solve the differential equation for r=r(t).
      The initial condition of this ordinary differential equation is
      r(0)=Rag. The bubble grows to 500 µm in around 160 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In conclusion, embodiments significantly enhance the
      temperature rise on the surface of NPs and achieve local boiling
      at much lower solar concentrations than reported before. This
      approach provides the ability to tune the thermal conductivity of
      the surrounding medium around the NPs. In one embodiment, carbon
      black particles in a water solution were used. The hydrophobic
      surfaces of these particles promote the formation of vapor phase
      around these particles. Since the thermal conductivity of water
      vapor is 30 times less than that of liquid water, the temperature
      rise over these particles under the electromagnetic illumination
      is much higher than the NPs in contact with liquid water. Thus,
      local temperature for phase-change process is achieved at lower
      solar concentrations. Embodiments of the present invention can be
      extended to other absorbing and plasmonic NPs. By tuning the
      surface characteristics of these particles, the temperature rise
      over these particles can be adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Although the above discussion emphasizes hydrophobic
      surfaces, it is understood that the important characteristics of
      embodiments of the invention include clusters of micron-sized or
      nano-sized particles clustered together in the liquids, the
      clusters should strongly absorb solar radiation, and the clusters
      should form to create thermodynamically stable nucleation sites.
      Although hydrophobic materials can form such stable nucleation
      sites, it is understood that such sites could be also formed by
      using composites particles, or particles with some regions
      hydrophilic and other regions hydrophobic, or particles with
      adjusted hydrophilicity.<br>

      [0050] Embodiments of the localized heating structure 10 and the
      volumetric absorber 20 have the potential to be utilized in a
      number of applications. For example, embodiments may be used in
      evaporative ponds for enhanced evaporation. These ponds are used
      for desalination, mineral extraction, hazardous waste collection,
      agricultural water treatment. High evaporation rate in these ponds
      has both economic (fast processing) and environmental (land use)
      advantages. In addition, embodiments may be used in solar
      collectors for domestic water heating with up to 30% higher
      efficiency than the current technologies. Embodiments may boost
      the maximum temperature of water in these collectors and decrease
      the surface area of these collectors. Embodiments may also be used
      in superheated vapor generation systems, such as power plants,
      distillation systems, and sterilizing systems. Currently, most of
      these systems function with fossil fuels or electricity.
      Embodiments provide an efficient approach to utilize solar energy
      in these systems.<br>
