      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abstract</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Known for over 150 years,
          the Faraday homopolar generator has been claimed to provide a
          basis for so-called&nbsp; "free-energy" generation, in that
          under certain conditions the extraction of electrical output
          energy is not reflected as a corresponding mechanical load to
          the driving source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During 1985, I was invited
          to test such a machine. While it did not perform as claimed,
          repeatable data&nbsp; showed&nbsp; anomalous&nbsp; results
          that did not seem to conform to traditional theory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In particular, under certain
          assumptions about internally generated output voltage, the
          increase in input power when power was extracted from the
          generator over that measured due to frictional losses with the
          generator unexcited seemed to be either about 13% or 20% of
          the maximum computed generated power, depending on
          interpretation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The paper briefly
          reviews&nbsp; the homopolar generator, describes the tests on
          this particular machine, summarizes and presents tentative
          conclusions from the resulting data.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Sunburst Homopolar
            Generator</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In July, 1985, I became
          aware of and was invited to examine and test a so-called
          free-energy generator known as the Sunburst N Machine.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This device, shown&nbsp; in
          <b><a href="#f1">Figures 1a &amp; 1b</a></b>, was proposed by
          Bruce DePalma and constructed by Charya Bernard of the
          Sunburst Community in Santa Barbara, CA, about 1979.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The term "free-energy"
          refers to the claim by DePalma [1] (and others [2]) that it
          was capable of producing electrical output power that was not
          reflected as a mechanical load to the driving mechanism but
          derived from presumed latent spatial energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apart from mechanical
          frictional and electrical losses inherent in the particular
          construction,&nbsp; the&nbsp; technique employed was claimed
          to provide a basis for constructing a generator which could
          supply the energy to provide not only its own motive power but
          also additional energy for external use. From August 1985 to
          April 1986 I made a series of measurements on this particular
          machine to test these claims.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Generator Description</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Details of the generator
          construction are shown in <b><a href="#f2">Figure 2</a></b>
          and <b><a href="#f3">Figure 3</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It consists essentially of
          an electromagnet formed by a coil of 3605 turns of #10 copper
          wire around a soft iron core which can be rotated with the
          magnetic field parallel to and symmetrical around the axis of
          rotation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At each end of the magnet
          are conducting bronze cylindrical plates, on one of which are
          arranged (as shown in <b><a href="#f3">Figure 3</a></b>) one
          set of graphite brushes for extracting output current between
          the shaft and the outer circumference&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp;
          second&nbsp; set of metering brushes for independently
          measuring the induced voltage between these locations.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A third pair of brushes and
          slip rings supply the current for the electromagnet. A thick
          sheath of epoxy-impregnated fiberglass windings allow the
          magnet to be rotated at high speed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator may be
          recognized as a so-called homopolar, or acyclic machine, a
          device first investigated and described&nbsp; by&nbsp; Michael
          Faraday [3] in 1831 (<b><a href="#f4">Figure 4</a></b> &amp; <b><a
              href="#f4">Figure 5</a></b>) and shown schematically in <b><a
              href="#f6">Figure 6</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It consists of a cylindrical
          conducting&nbsp; disk&nbsp; immersed&nbsp; in an axial
          magnetic field, and can be operated as a generator with
          sliding brushes extracting current from the voltage induced
          between the inner and outer regions of the disk&nbsp;
          when&nbsp; the&nbsp; rotational energy is supplied by an
          external driving source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The magnitude of the
          incremental radial generated voltage is proportional to both
          the strength of the magnetic field and the tangential
          velocity, so that in a uniform&nbsp; magnetic field the total
          voltage is proportional to the product of speed times the
          difference between the squares of the inner and outer brush
          radii.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device may&nbsp;
          also&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; as a motor when an external
          voltage produces an radial current between the sliding
          brushes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There have been a number of
          commercial applications of homopolar motors and generators,
          particularly early in this century [4], and their operating
          principles are described in a number of texts [5].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The usual technique is to
          use a stationary magnet to produce the magnetic field in which
          the conducting disk (or cylinder) is rotated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Faraday found, however, (<b><a
              href="#f7">Figure 7</a></b>) that it does not matter
          whether the magnet itself is stationary or rotating with the
          disk as long as the conductor is moving in the field, but that
          rotating the magnet with the conducting disk stationary did
          not produce an induced voltage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He concluded that a magnetic
          field is a property of space itself, not attached to the
          magnet which serves to induce the field [6].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DePalma stated [7] that when
          the conducting disk is attached to a rotating magnet, the
          interaction of the primary magnetic field with that produced
          by the radial output current results in torque between the
          disk and the magnet structure which is not reflected back to
          the mechanical driving source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lenz's law therefore does
          not apply, and the extraction of output energy does not
          require additional driving power. This is the claimed basis
          for extracting "free" energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Discussions of the torque
          experienced by a rotating magnet are also discussed in the
          literature [8].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because the simple form
          shown in <b><a href="#f6">Figure 6</a></b> has essentially
          one conducting path, such a homopolar device is characterized
          by low voltage and high current requiring a large magnetic
          field for useful operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Various homopolar devices
          have been used for specialized applications [9] (such as
          generators&nbsp; for&nbsp; developing large currents for
          welding, ship degaussing, liquid metal magnetohydrodynamic
          pumps for nuclear reactor cooling, torque motors for
          propulsion, etc.), some involving quite high power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These have been extensively
          discussed in the literature, dealing with such problems as
          developing the&nbsp; high&nbsp; magnetic fields required
          (sometimes using superconducting&nbsp; magnets in air to avoid
          iron saturation effects), the development of brushes that can
          handle the very high currents and have low voltage drop
          because of the low output voltage generated, and with
          counteracting armature reaction which otherwise would reduce
          the output voltage because of the magnetic field distortion
          resulting from the high currents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the standpoint of prior
          art, the design of the Sunburst generator is inefficient and
          not suitable for power generation:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The magnetic field is
          concentrated near the axis where the tangential velocity is
          low, reducing the generated voltage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Approximately 4 kilowatts
          of power are required to energize the magnet, developing
          enough heat so that the device can only be operated for
          limited periods of time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. The graphite brushes used
          have a voltage drop almost equal to the total induced voltage,
          so that almost all of the generated power is consumed in
          heating the brushes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. The large contacting area
          (over 30 square inches) of&nbsp; the brushes needed for the
          high output current creates considerable friction loss.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since this machine was not
          intended as a practical generator but as a means for testing
          the free energy principle, however, from this point of view
          efficiency in producing external power was not required or
          relevant.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DePalma's Results with
            the Sunburst Homopolar Generator</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1980 DePalma conducted
          tests with the Sunburst&nbsp; generator, describing his
          measurement technique and results in an unpublished report
          [10].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator was driven by
          a 3 phase AC 40 horsepower motor by a belt coupling
          sufficiently long that magnetic fields of the motor and
          generator would not interact. A table from this report giving
          his data and results is shown in <b><a href="#f8">Figure 8</a></b>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a rotational speed of
          6000 rpm an output power of 7560 watts was claimed to require
          an increase of 268 watts of drive power over that required to
          supply losses due to friction, windage, etc., as measured with
          the output switch open.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If valid, this would mean
          that the output power was 28.2 times the incremental input
          power needed to produce it. Several assumptions were made in
          this analysis:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The drive motor input
          power was assumed to be the product of the line voltage and
          current times the appropriate factor for a three-phase machine
          and an assumed constant 70% power factor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was apparently no
          consideration of phase angle change as the motor load
          increased.&nbsp; This gives optimistic results, since
          consideration of phase angle is necessary for calculating
          power in an AC circuit, particularly with induction motors.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It might also be noted that
          the measured incremental line current increase of 0.5 ampere
          (3.3%) as obtained with the analog clamp-on&nbsp; AC ammeter
          that was used was of limited accuracy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. The output power of the
          generator was taken to be the product of the measured output
          current and the internally generated voltage in the disk less
          the voltage drop due only to internal disk resistance.
          Armature reaction was thus neglected or assumed not to be
          significant.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. The generated voltage
          which produced the current in the main output brushes was
          assumed to be the same as that measured at the metering
          brushes, and the decrease in metered voltage from 1.5 to 1.05
          volts when the output switch&nbsp; is closed was assumed to be
          due to the internal voltage drop resulting from the output
          current flowing through the internal disk resistance
          that&nbsp; is common to both sets of brushes and calculated to
          62.5 microohms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of these, the first
          assumption seems the most serious, and it is my opinion that
          the results of this particular test were inaccurate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tim Wilhelm of Stelle,
          Illinois, who witnessed tests of the Sunburst generator in
          1981, had a similar opinion [11].</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recent Tests of the
            Sunburst Generator</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Being intrigued by DePalma's
          hypothesis, I accepted the offer by Mr. Norman Paulsen,
          founder of the Sunburst Community, to conduct tests on the
          generator which apparently&nbsp; had not been used since the
          tests by DePalma and Bernard in 1979.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experimental Setup</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A schematic diagram of the
          test arrangement is shown in <b><a href="#f9">Figure 9</a></b>,
          with the physical equipment shown in <b><a href="#f10">Figure
              10a</a></b>. The generator&nbsp; is shown coupled by
          a&nbsp; long&nbsp; belt to the drive motor behind it, together
          with the power supplies and metering both&nbsp;
          contained&nbsp; within and external to the Sunburst power and
          metering cabinet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#f10">Figure 10b</a></b>
          shows the panel of the test cabinet which&nbsp; provided power
          for the generator magnet and motor field.&nbsp; The 4-1/2
          digit meters on the panel were&nbsp; not&nbsp;
          functional&nbsp; and&nbsp; were not used; external meters were
          supplied.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;I decided to use an
          available shunt-field DC drive motor to facilitate load tests
          at different speeds and to simplify accurate motor input power
          measurements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to <b><a
              href="#f9">Figure 9</a></b>, variacs and&nbsp; full-wave
          bridge rectifiers provided variable d-c supplies for&nbsp; the
          motor armature and field and the homopolar generator magnet.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Voltages and currents were
          measured with Micronta model 11-191 3-1/2 digit meters
          calibrated to better than 0.1% against&nbsp; a&nbsp; Hewlett
          Packard 740B Voltage Standard that by itself was accurate to
          better than .005%.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Standard meter shunts
          together with the digital voltmeters were used to measure the
          various currents. With this arrangement the generator speed
          could be varied smoothly from 0 to over 7000 rpm, with
          accurate measurement of motor input power, metered generator
          output voltage Vg and generator output current Ig.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Speed was measured with a
          General Radio model 1531 Strobotac which had a
          calibration&nbsp; accuracy of better than 2% (as&nbsp;
          verified with a frequency counter) and which allowed
          determination of relative speed changes of a few rpm of less.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Small changes in either load
          or input power were clearly evident because of the sensitivity
          of the Strobotac speed measurement, allowing the motor input
          power to be adjusted with the armature voltage variac to
          obtain the desired constant speed with no acceleration or
          deceleration before taking readings from the various meters.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Generator Tests</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Various tests were conducted
          with&nbsp; the output switch open to confirm that generated
          voltage at both the output brushes (Vbr) and metering brushes
          (Vg) were proportional to speed and magnetic field, with the
          polarity reversing when magnetic field or direction of
          rotation were reversed.</font> </p>

          probably due to core saturation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The more rapid departure of
          Vg from linearity may be due to the different brush locations

          the magnetic field at the different brush locations, or other
          causes not evident. An expanded plot of this voltage

          measurements shown in the upper curve of <b><a href="#f11">Figure





              11</a></b> resulted from the great sensitivity of the
          motor&nbsp; armature current to small fluctuations in power
          line voltage, since the large rotary inertia of&nbsp;
          the&nbsp; 400&nbsp; pound&nbsp; generator did not allow speed
          to rapidly follow line voltage changes).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first it was thought that
          this power loss might be due to the fact that the outer output
          brushes were arranged in a rectangular array as shown in <b><a
              href="#f3">Figure 3</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since they were connected in
          parallel but not equidistant from the axis the different
          generated voltages would presumably&nbsp; result&nbsp; in
          circulating currents and additional power dissipation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Measurement of the generated
          voltage as a function of radial distance from the axis as
          shown in <b><a href="#f13">Figure13</a></b>, however, showed
          that almost all of the voltage differential occurred between 5
          and 12 cm, presumably because this was the region of greatest
          magnetic field due to the centralized iron core.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The voltage in the region of
          the outer brushes was almost constant, with a measured
          variation of only 3.7% between the extremes, so that this did
          not seem to explain the increase in input power. The other
          likely explanation seems to be that there are internal losses
          in the core and other parts of the metal structure due to eddy
          currents, since these are also moving conductors in the field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In any event, the increase
          in drive power was only about 10% for the maximum magnet

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the generator output
          knife switch procedure was very stiff and difficult to operate
          the procedure used was to make a complete speed run from zero
          to the maximum speed and descending again to zero with the
          switch open, taking readings at each speed increment with the
          magnet power both off and on.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The procedure was then
          repeated with the switch closed. (It was noted that during the
          descending speed run the input power was a few percent lower
          than for the same speed&nbsp; during&nbsp; the earlier
          ascending speed run; this&nbsp; was&nbsp; presumably due to
          reduced friction as the brushes and/or bearings became
          heated.&nbsp; In plotting the data the losses for both runs
          were averaged which gave a conservative result since the
          losses shown in the figures exceed the minimum values
          measured).</font> </p>

          output&nbsp; power dissippation).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This component of power

          increased magnet current as shown in <b><a href="#f11">Figure
              11</a></b> as discussed above) might&nbsp; also be present
          whether or not the generator is producing output current and

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is certainly not zero or
          negligible but rises to a maximum of 802 watts at 6500 rpm.
          The total motor armature input power under these conditions is
          thus the sum of (a), (b), and (c) and reaches a maximum of
          6028 watts at 6500 rpm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The big question has to do
          with the generated output power. The measured output current
          at 6500 rpm was 4776 amperes; the voltage at the metering
          brushes was 1.07 volts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using a correction factor
          derived from <b><a href="#f12">Figure 12</a></b> and assuming
          a common internal voltage drop due to a calculated disk
          resistance of 38 microohms, a computed internal generated
          potential of 1.28 volts is obtained which if multiplied by the
          measured output current indicates a generated power of 6113
          watts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of this power is
          presumably dissipated in the internal and external circuit
          resistances, the brush loss due both to the brush resistance
          and the voltage drops at the contact surfaces between the
          brushes and the disk (essentially an arc discharge), and the
          power dissipated in the 31.25 microohm meter shunt.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It still represents power
          generated by the machine, however, and exceeds the 802 watts
          of increased motor drive power due&nbsp; solely to closing the
          generator output switch and causing output current to flow by
          a factor of 7.6 to 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the 444 watts of
          increased input power that resulted from energizing the magnet
          with the output switch open is assumed to have been converted
          to generated output power and hence should be included as part
          of the total increased drive motor power required to produce
          generated output, the computed 6113 watts of generated power
          still exceeds the total input power of 444&nbsp; watts plus
          802 watts by a factor of 4.9 to 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The computed output&nbsp;
          power even slightly exceeds the total motor armature input
          power including all&nbsp; frictional and windage losses of
          6028 watts under these conditions (although the total system
          effeciency is still less than 100% because of the generator
          magnet power of approximately 2300 watts and motor field power
          of about 144 watts which must be added to the motor armature
          power to obtain total system input power).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It would thus seem that if
          the above assumptions are valid that DePalma correctly
          predicted&nbsp; that much of the generated&nbsp; power with
          this kind of&nbsp; machine is not reflected back to the motive
          source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#f15">Figure 15</a></b>
          summarizes the data discussed above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To further examine the
          question of the equivalence between the internally generated
          voltage at the main output brushes and that measured at the
          metering brushes, a test was made of the metered voltage as a
          function of speed with the generator magnet energized with a
          current of 20 amperes both with the output switch open and
          closed. The resulting data is shown in <b><a href="#f16">Figure





              16</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The voltage rises to about
          1.32 volts at 6000 rpm with the switch open (which is&nbsp;
          close to that obtained by DePalma)&nbsp; and&nbsp; drops 0.14
          volts when the switch&nbsp; is closed and the measured output
          current is 3755 amperes, corresponding to an&nbsp;
          effective&nbsp; internal resistance of 37 microohms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even if this were due to
          other causes, such as armature reaction, it does not seem
          likely that there would be a large potential&nbsp; drop
          between the output and metering brushes because of&nbsp; the
          small distance, low magnetic field (and&nbsp; radial
          differential voltage), and large mass of conducting disk
          material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Internal currents many times
          the measured output current of almost 4000 amperes would be
          required for the voltage difference between the outer metering
          and output brushes to be significant and invalidate the
          conclusions reached above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further method of testing
          the validity of the assumed generated output potential
          involved an examination of the voltage drop across the
          graphite brushes themselves.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many texts on
          electrical&nbsp; machinery&nbsp; discuss the brush drop in
          machines with commutators or slip rings. All of those examined
          agree that graphite brushes typically have a voltage drop that
          is essentially constant at approximately one volt per brush
          contact when the current density rises above 10-15 amperes per
          square centimeter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To compare this with the
          Sunburst machine the total brush voltage was calculated by
          subtracting the IR drop due to the output current in the known
          (meter shunt) and calculated (disk, shaft, and brush lead)
          resistances from the assumed internally generated output
          voltage. The result in <b><a href="#f17">Figure17</a></b>
          shows that the brush drop obtained in this way is even less
          than that usually assumed, as typified by the superimposed
          curve taken from one text.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It thus seems probable that
          the generated voltage is not significantly less than that
          obtained from the metering brushes, and hence the
          appropriateness of the computed output power is supported.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are therefore faced with
          the apparent result that the output power obtained when the
          generator magnet is energized greatly exceeds the increase in
          drive power over that needed to supply losses with the magnet
          not energized. This is certainly anomalous in terms of
          convential theory. Possible explanations?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. There could be a large
          error in the measurements resulting from some factor such as
          noise which caused the digital meters to read incorrectly or
          grossly inaccurate current shunt resistances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the measured results had
          shown that the computed generated output power exceeded the
          input drive power by only a few percent this explanation would
          be reasonable and would suggest that more careful calibration
          and measurements might show that the results described above
          were due to measurement error.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the data showing such a
          large ratio of generated power to input power increase,
          however, in my opinion this explanation&nbsp; of the results
          seems unlikely.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(A later test showed that
          the digital meters are insensitive to a large AC ripple
          superimposed on the measured DC,&nbsp; but within their rated
          accuracy of 0.1% give a true average value).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. There could be a large
          difference between the measured voltage at the metering
          brushes and the actual generated voltage in&nbsp;&nbsp; the
          output brush circuit due to armature reaction, differences
          in&nbsp; the external metering and output circuit geometry, or
          other unexplained causes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As discussed above the
          various data do not seem to support this possibility.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. DePalma may have been
          right in that there is indeed a situation here whereby energy
          is being obtained from a previously unknown and unexplained
          source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is a conclusion that
          most scientists and engineers would reject out of hand as
          being a violation of accepted laws of physics, and if true has
          incredible implications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. Perhaps other
          possibilities will occur to the reader.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The data obtained so far
          seems to have shown that while DePalma's numbers were high,
          his basic premise has not been disproved. While the Sunburst
          generator does not produce useful output power because of the
          internal losses inherent in the&nbsp; design, a number of
          techniques could be used to reduce the friction losses,
          increase the total generated voltage and the&nbsp;&nbsp;
          fraction of generated power delivered to an external load.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DePalma's claim of&nbsp;
          free energy generation could perhaps then be examined.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I should mention, however,
          that the obvious application of using the output of a
          "free-energy" generator to provide its own motive power, and
          thus truly produce a source of free energy, has occurred to a
          number of people and several such machines have been built.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At least one of these known
          to me [13], using what seemed to be a good design techniques,
          was unsuccessful.</font> </p>

          cemented on the top of a cylinder magnet, paper intervening,
          the top being the marked pole; the magnet supported so as to
          rotate by means of string, and the wires of the galvanometer
          connected with the edge and the axis of the copper plate. When
          the magnet and disc together rotated unscrew the marked end of
          the needle went west. When the magnet and disc rotated screw
          the marked end of the needle went east.</font> </p>

          the same as that which would have resulted if the copper had
          moved and the magnet been still. Hence moving the magnet
          causes no difference provided the copper moves. A rotating and
          a stationary magnet cause the same effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">257.&nbsp; The disc was then
          loosed from the magnet and held still whilst the magnet itself
          was revolved; but now no effect upon the galvanometer. Hence
          it appears that, of the metal circuit in which the current is
          to be formed, different parts must move with different angular
          velocities. If with the same, no current is produced, i.e.
          when both parts are external to the magnet.</font> </p>
