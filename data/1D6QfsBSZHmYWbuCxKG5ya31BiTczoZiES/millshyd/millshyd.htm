                Tech That Defies Quantum Theory"</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By Erik Baard (NY) -- A
          researcher based in New Jersey is presenting to a gathering of
          chemists in Ontario, Calif., Wednesday the science that he
          says will underpin a multi-billion dollar energy and materials
          company.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The catch is that his theory
          - that hydrogen atoms can be shrunk in a stable form - is an
          impossibility in the established understanding of quantum
          physics. Still, Dr. Randell Mills, a Harvard
          University-trained medical doctor who has done postgraduate
          studies in physics and chemistry, isn't going it alone. His
          start-up, BlackLight Power Inc. of Cranbury, New Jersey, has
          received support and advice from utilities Conectiv (CIV) and
          PacifiCorp (PPW) and from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.
          (MWD). Other major companies are waiting in the wings, Dr.
          Mills claimed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We have stayed supportive
          of this in the face of fairly significant scientists saying it
          can't be," a senior executive with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
          who asked that he not be identified, told Dow Jones Newswires.
          Pending further verification and commercial commitments,
          Morgan Stanley Dean Witter plans to usher BlackLight Power to
          an initial public offering within two years, the executive
          said. The investment bank will be an underwriter and hasn't
          put its own money into the start-up, the executive said, but
          another source close to the situation said Morgan Stanley Dean
          Witter had made an overture to that end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Mills claimed the
          process of transforming hydrogen atoms into smaller "hydrinos"
          by chemical catalysis will provide "a virtually unlimited
          supply of energy" through distributed power turbines. The
          hydrinos themselves combine with other elements, he said, to
          make compounds that could be the basis for batteries to power
          cars 1,000 miles at highway speeds before recharging; a
          plastic that conducts electricity and shares magnetic
          qualities with iron; and super-strong coatings, among other
          things. There could be "potentially thousands, if not
          millions" of novel compounds, he said. He also said that
          compounds such as the ones BlackLight Power is creating
          account for the more than 90% of the mass of the universe that
          scientists say is so far unobservable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Mills hasn't made
          acceptance easy for himself or his sponsors by claiming he has
          found the holy grail of a grand unified theory of classical
          quantum mechanics and that the effect of his work on humanity
          will be "bigger than fire." Indeed, Steven Chu, a Nobel
          Prize-winning physicist at Stanford University, said in
          September "it's extremely unlikely that this is real, and I
          feel sorry for the funders, the people who are backing this."
          Dr. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist at City College of
          New York cited another time-honored law that might apply to
          BlackLight Power investors: "There's a sucker born every
          minute."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The American Chemical
          Society forum is the first open peer review of BlackLight
          Power's findings, while mainstream quantum mechanics,
          scientists point out, has evolved from decades of tests and
          analysis. BlackLight Power has sent its work out for numerous
          tests at independent laboratories over the past several years
          and has seen positive results, Dr. Mills said. Conectiv is
          "really on the optimistic side," albeit "cautiously" so, said
          David Blake, Conectiv vice president and BlackLight Power
          board member. "It's getting more and more difficult to argue
          with the results Dr. Mills is presenting and the validations
          he is starting to accrue," Blake said. Both Dr. Mills and
          Conectiv's Blake say "two major corporations" are currently
          testing crystals provided by the labs, but they declined to
          name them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"These folks are spending
          their time and energy, and the money it takes to pay technical
          people, on this. You don't do that unless you've got some</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">inclination that you'd better
          look at this," Blake said. But are Conectiv and PacifiCorp
          making a "Hail Mary pass" in a once stolid industry thrown</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">into turmoil by deregulation?
          "Utilities...especially on the second tier, like Conectiv and
          PacifiCorp, are really looking for edges because they don't
          have the size and scope" of mega-utilities that are forming
          through mergers all around them, said Robert Rubin, a
          utilities analyst with Bear Sterns Cos. in New York.
          Shareholders will forgive managers for making a few odd bets
          because "the payoff could be huge," Rubin said. Still,
          "there's a difference between investing $2.5 million and $250
          million".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Randy has had no trouble
          raising the funds he needs," the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
          executive said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Mills confirmed that the
          company had $10 million, largely from the two utilities, and
          equipment and property bringing its capital up to about</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">$30 million. BlackLight Power
          will present about 10 compounds to the American Chemical
          Society and "five papers that give explicit details and</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">is absolutely reproducible,"
          Dr. Mills said. "I have a unified field theory that's
          absolutely testable at every stage and on every item."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Thank God we're getting our
          day in court," Dr. Mills said. Also speaking at the meeting
          about the reported hydrogen energy release, in the form of</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">visible and ultra-violet
          light, is Dr. Johannes Conrads, who retired last week as the
          director of the Institute for Low Temperature Plasma Physics</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">at the Ernst Moritz Arndt
          University in Greifswald, Germany.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The BlackLight Power
          research done at the institute was funded by the company, but
          "my research was completely independent," said Dr. Conrads,</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">who has studied plasma since
          1959 and has worked for NASA and taught at Princeton
          University. Dr. Conrads has flown to the society's meeting in</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">California to report that
          he's seen "a few astonishing things" from the hydrino process,
          he said. "Something from the Mills cell is releasing</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">energy, and remarkably high
          energy, that is clear," Dr. Conrads said. Equally compelling
          is that energy in the Mills cell decays at a rate</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">independent of the removal of
          outside electricity, and the reaction works only with
          BlackLight Power's catalyst, he said. But Dr. Conrads stops</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">short of vindicating the
          hydrino theory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"None of my experiments so
          far is falsifying Randy's theory, but unfortunately none of my
          experiments is verifying it, either," Dr. Conrads said. Dr.
          Conrads said he's taking his time to examine Dr. Mills' theory
          because "this is not for sensation. I am an old professor in
          physics." Dr. Conrad, who emphasized his lack of credentials
          as a materials scientist, said he has sought Dr. Mill's
          permission to invite peers at DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) to
          examine the hydrino crystals. Dr. Conrads parts with Dr. Mills
          somewhat by standing with traditional quantum mechanics as it
          applies to the ground state that the Mills theory claims to
          breach. But Dr. Conrads says he could see Dr. Mills work as a
          chemical approach to the new science of non-ideal plasmas.
          This unusual plasma is composed of charged particles at low
          temperatures and as densely packed as a solid, he said.
          Indications are that in such an environment, conventional
          quantum rules might not apply, he said. With more sensitive
          equipment, however, he expects to find stronger evidence for
          "fractional" hydrogen, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Everyone was telling us
          that heat was too nebulous," Dr. Mills said. To put his work
          on more solid ground, he manufactured hydrino-based crystals</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">in mass, he said. "The
          hydride ion cracked the nut, right there, that did it," he
          said. BlackLight Power's laboratory cabinets are stacked with
          vials of crystals of varied colors and forms. Other scientists
          have been supportive. On the BlackLight Power board sits Dr.
          Shelby Brewer, a nuclear engineer and physicist who is also
          the former chief executive of ABB Combustion Engineering and
          an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Energy from
          1981 to 1984. Dr. Melvin H. Miles, an electro-chemist
          researching batteries at the U.S. Navy facility in China Lake,
          Calif., said the BlackLight crystals put Dr. Mills "way ahead
          of cold fusion in that he has a tangible product to show
          people."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Randy Mills impressed me
          that he may also be brilliant. He talks off the top of his
          head in a way that other scientists can't. But that doesn't
          mean he's right. I think his results are right, but doesn't
          mean his theory is right," Miles said.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>Methods and apparatus for releasing energy from hydrogen atoms
        (molecules) by stimulating their electrons to relax to quantized
        lower energy levels and smaller radii (smaller semimajor and
        semiminor axes) than the "ground state" by providing energy
        sinks or means to remove energy resonant with the hydrogen
        energy released to stimulate these transitions. An energy sink,
        energy hole, can be provided by the transfer of at least one
        electron between participating species including atoms, ions,
        molecules, and ionic and molecular compounds. In one embodiment,
        the energy hole comprises the transfer of t electrons from one
        or more donating species to one or more accepting species
        whereby the sum of the ionization energies and/or electron
        affinities of the electron donating species minus the sum of the
        ionization energies and/or electron affinities of the electron
        accepting species equals approximately mX27.21 eV (mX48.6 eV)
        for atomic (molecular) hydrogen below "ground state" transitions
        where m and t are integers. The present invention further
        comprises a hydrogen spillover catalyst, a multifunctionality
        material having a functionality which dissociates molecular
        hydrogen to provide free hydrogen atoms which spill over to a
        functionality which supports mobile free hydrogen atoms and a
        functionality which can be a source of the energy holes. The
        energy reactor includes one of an electrolytic cell, a
        pressurized hydrogen gas cell, and a hydrogen gas discharge
        cell. A preferred pressurized hydrogen gas energy reactor
        comprises a vessel; a source of hydrogen; a means to control the
        pressure and flow of hydrogen into the vessel; a material to
        dissociate the molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen, and a
        material which can be a source of energy holes in the gas phase.
        The gaseous source of energy holes includes those that sublime,
        boil, and/or are volatile at the elevated operating temperature
        of the gas energy reactor wherein the exothermic reaction of
        electronic transitions of hydrogen to lower energy states occurs
        in the gas phase. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to methods and apparatus for releasing
        energy from hydrogen atoms (molecules) as their electrons are
        stimulated to relax to lower energy levels and smaller radii
        (smaller semimajor and semiminor axes) than the "ground state"
        by providing a transition catalyst which acts as an energy sink
        or means to remove energy resonant with the electronic energy
        released to stimulate these transitions according to a novel
        atomic model. The transition catalyst should not be consumed in
        the reaction. It accepts energy from hydrogen and releases the
        energy to the surroundings. Thus, the transition catalyst
        returns to the origin state. Processes that require collisions
        are common. For example, the exothermic chemical reaction of H+H
        to form H.sub.2 requires a collision with a third body, M, to
        remove the bond energy-H+H+M.fwdarw.H.sub.2 +M. The third body
        distributes the energy from the exothermic reaction, and the end
        result is the H.sub.2 molecule and an increase in the
        temperature of the system. Similarly, the transition from the
        n=1 state of hydrogen to the ##EQU1## states of hydrogen is
        possible via a resonant collision, say n=1 to n=1/2. In these
        cases, during the collision the electron(s) couples to another
        electron transition or electron transfer reaction, for example,
        which can absorb the exact amount of energy that must be removed
        from the hydrogen atom (molecule), a resonant energy sink. The
        end result is a lower-energy state for the hydrogen and increase
        in temperature of the system. Each of such reactions is
        hereafter referred to as a shrinkage reaction: each transition
        is hereafter referred to as a shrinkage transition; each energy
        sink or means to remove energy resonant with the hydrogen
        electronic energy released to effect each transition is
        hereafter referred to as an energy hole, and the electronic
        energy removed by the energy hole to effect or stimulate the
        shrinkage transition is hereafter referred to as the resonance
        shrinkage energy. An energy hole comprising a reactant ion that
        is spontaneously regenerated following an endothermic electron
        ionization reaction of energy equal to the resonance shrinkage
        energy is hereafter referred to as an electrocatalytic ion. An
        energy hole comprising two reactants that are spontaneously
        regenerated following the an endothermic electron transfer
        reaction between the two species wherein the differences in
        their ionization energies is equal to the resonance shrinkage
        energy is hereafter referred to as an electrocatalytic couple. </p>
      <p>The present invention of an electrolytic cell energy reactor,
        pressurized gas energy reactor, and a gas discharge energy
        reactor, comprises: a source of hydrogen; one of a solid,
        molten, liquid, and gaseous source of energy holes; a vessel
        containing hydrogen and the source of energy holes wherein the
        shrinkage reaction occurs by contact of the hydrogen with the
        source of energy holes; and a means for removing, the
        (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen so as to prevent an exothermic
        shrinkage reaction from coming to equilibrium. The present
        invention further comprises methods and structures for repeating
        this shrinkage reaction to produce shrunken atoms (molecules) to
        provide new materials with novel properties such as high thermal
        stability. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>Existing atomic models and theories are unable to explain
        certain observed physical phenomena. The Schrodinger
        wavefunctions of the hydrogen atom, for example, do not explain
        the extreme ultraviolet emission spectrum of the interstellar
        medium or that of the Sun, as well as the phenomenon of
        anomalous heat release from hydrogen in certain electrolytic
        cells having a potassium carbonate electrolyte or certain gas
        energy cells having a hydrogen spillover catalyst comprising
        potassium nitrate with the production of lower-energy hydrogen
        atoms and molecules, which is part of the present invention.
        Thus, advances in energy production and materials have been
        largely limited to laboratory discoveries having limited or
        sub-optimal commercial application. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention comprises methods and apparatuses for
        releasing heat energy from hydrogen atoms (molecules) by
        stimulating their electrons to relax to quantized potential
        energy levels below that of the "ground state" via electron
        transfer reactions of reactants including electrochemical
        reactant(s) (electrocatalytic ion(s) or couple(s)) which remove
        energy from the hydrogen atoms (molecules) to stimulate these
        transitions. In addition, this application includes methods and
        apparatuses to enhance the power output by enhancing the
        reaction rate- the rate of the formation of the lower-energy
        hydrogen. The present invention further comprises a hydrogen
        spillover catalyst, a multifunctionality material having a
        functionality which dissociates molecular hydrogen to provide
        free hydrogen atoms which spill over to a functionality which
        supports mobile free hydrogen atoms and a functionality which
        can be a source of the energy holes. The energy reactor includes
        one of an electrolytic cell, a pressurized hydrogen gas cell,
        and a hydrogen gas discharge cell. </p>
      <p>A preferred pressurized hydrogen gas energy reactor comprises a
        vessel; a source of hydrogen; a means to control the pressure
        and flow of hydrogen into the vessel; a material to dissociate
        the molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen, and a material
        which can be a source of energy holes in the gas phase. The
        gaseous source of energy holes includes those that sublime,
        boil, and/or are volatile at the elevated operating temperature
        of the gas energy reactor wherein the shrinkage reaction occurs
        in the gas phase. </p>
      <p>The present invention further comprises methods and apparatuses
        for repeating a shrinkage reaction according to the present
        invention to cause energy release and to provide shrunken atoms

        stability, and low reactivity. The lower-energy state atoms and
        molecules are useful for heat transfer, cryogenic applications,

        engine or a turbine, as a general replacement for helium, and as
        a refrigerant by absorbing energy including heat energy as the
        electrons are excited back to a higher energy level. </p>

      <p><b>Fractional Quantum Energy Levels of Hydrogen ~</b> </p>
      <p>A number of experimental observations given in the Experimental
        Section below lead to the conclusion that atomic hydrogen can
        exist in fractional quantum states that are at lower energies
        than the traditional "ground" (n=1) state. For example,
        existence of fractional-quantum-energy-level hydrogen atoms,
        hereafter called hydrinos, provides an explanation for the soft
        X-ray emissions of the dark interstellar medium observed by
        Labov and Bowyer [S. Labov and S. Bowyer, Astrophysical Journal,
        371 (1991) 810] and an explanation for the soft X-ray emissions
        of the Sun [Thomas, R. J., Neupert, W., M., Astrophysical
        Journal Supplement Series, Vol. 91, (1994), pp. 461-482;

        Great Britain, (1992), pp. 118-119; 120-121; 144-145]. </p>
      <p>J. J. Balmer showed in 1885 that the frequencies for some of
        the lines observed in the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen
        could be expressed with a completely empirical relationship.
        This approach was later extended by J. R. Rydberg, who showed
        that all of the spectral lines of atomic hydrogen were given by
        the equation: ##EQU2## where R=109,677 cm.sup.-1, n.sub.f
        =1,2,3, . . . , n.sub.i =2,3,4, . . . , and n.sub.i &gt;n.sub.f.
        Niels Bohr, in 1913, developed a theory for atomic hydrogen that
        gave energy levels in agreement with Rydberg's equation. An
        identical equation, based on a totally different theory for the
        hydrogen atom, was developed by E. Schrodinger, and
        independently by W. Heisenberg, in 1926. ##EQU3## where a.sub.H
        is the Bohr radius for the hydrogen atom (52.947 pm), e is the
        magnitude of the charge of the electron, and .epsilon..sub.o is
        the vacuum permittivity. Mills' theory predicts that Eq. (2b),
        should be replaced by Eq. (2c). ##EQU4## </p>
      <p>The quantum number n=1 is routinely used to describe the
        "ground" electronic state of the hydrogen atom. Mills [Mills,
        R., <i>The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics</i>,
        (1995), Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa.] in a
        recent advancement of quantum mechanics has shown that the n=1
        state is the "ground" state for "pure" photon transitions (the
        n=1 state can absorb a photon and go to an excited electronic
        state, but it cannot release a photon and go to a lower-energy
        electronic state). However, an electron transition from the
        ground state to a lower-energy state is possible by a "resonant
        collision" mechanism. These lower-energy states have fractional
        quantum numbers, ##EQU5## Processes that occur without photons
        and that require collisions are common. For example, the
        exothermic chemical reaction of H+H to form H.sub.2 does not
        occur with the emission of a photon. Rather, the reaction
        requires a collision with a third body, M, to remove the bond
        energy-H+H+M.fwdarw.H.sub.2 +M. The third body distributes the
        energy from the exothermic reaction, and the end result is the
        H.sub.2 molecule and an increase in the temperature of the
        system. Similarly, the n=1 state of hydrogen and the ##EQU6##
        states of hydrogen are nonradiative, but a transition between
        two nonradiative states is possible via a resonant collision,
        say n=1 to n=1/2. In these cases, during the collision the
        electron couples to another electron transition or electron
        transfer reaction which can absorb the exact amount of energy
        that must be removed from the hydrogen atom, a resonant energy
        sink called an energy hole. The end result is a lower-energy
        state for the hydrogen and increase in temperature of the
        system. </p>
      <p><b>Wave Equation Solutions of the Hydrogen Atom ~</b> </p>
      <p>Recently, Mills [Mills, R., The Grand Unified Theory of
        Classical Quantum Mechanics, (1995), Technomic Publishing
        Company, Lancaster, Pa.] has built on the work generally known
        as quantum mechanics by deriving a new atomic theory based on
        first principles. The novel theory hereafter referred to as
        Mills' theory unifies Maxwell's Equations, Newton's Laws, and
        Einstein's General and Special Relativity. The central feature
        of this theory is that all particles (atomic-size and
        macroscopic particles) obey the same physical laws. Whereas
        Schrodinger postulated a boundary condition: .PSI..fwdarw.0 as
        r.fwdarw..infin., the boundary condition in Mills' theory was
        derived from Maxwell's equations [Haus, H. A., "On the radiation
        from point charges", American Journal of Physics, 54, (1986),
        pp. 1126-1129.]: </p>
      <p>For non-radiative states, the current-density function must not
        possess space-time Fourier components that are synchronous with
        waves traveling at the speed of light. </p>
      <p>Application of this boundary condition leads to a physical
        model of particles, atoms, molecules, and, in the final
        analysis, cosmology. The closed-form mathematical solutions
        contain fundamental constants only, and the calculated values
        for physical quantities agree with experimental observations. In
        addition, the theory predicts that Eq. (2b), should be replaced
        by Eq. (2c). </p>
      <p>Bound electrons are described by a charge-density
        (mass-density) function which is the product of a radial delta
        function (f(r)=.delta.(r-r.sub.n)), two angular functions
        (spherical harmonic functions), and a time harmonic function.
        Thus, an electron is a spinning, two-dimensional spherical
        surface, hereafter called an electron orbitsphere, that can
        exist in a bound state at only specified distances from the
        nucleus. More explicitly, the orbitsphere comprises a two
        dimensional spherical shell of moving charge. The corresponding
        current pattern of the orbitsphere comprises an infinite series
        of correlated orthogonal great circle current loops. The current
        pattern (shown in FIG. 1.4 of Mills [Mills, R., <i>The Grand
          Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics</i>, (1995),
        Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa.]) is generated over
        the surface by two orthogonal sets of an infinite series of
        nested rotations of two orthogonal great circle current loops
        where the coordinate axes rotate with the two orthogonal great
        circles. Each infinitesimal rotation of the infinite series is
        about the new x-axis and new y-axis which results from the
        preceding such rotation. For each of the two sets of nested
        rotations, the angular sum of the rotations about each rotating
        x-axis and y-axis totals .sqroot.2 .pi. radians. The current
        pattern gives rise to the phenomenon corresponding to the spin
        quantum number. </p>
      <p>The total function that describes the spinning motion of each
        electron orbitsphere is composed of two functions. One function,
        the spin function, is spatially uniform over the orbitsphere,
        spins with a quantized angular velocity, and gives rise to spin
        angular momentum. The other function, the modulation function,
        can be spatially uniform -- in which case there is no orbital
        angular momentum and the magnetic moment of the electron
        orbitsphere is one Bohr magneton -- or not spatially uniform --
        in which case there is orbital angular momentum. The modulation
        function also rotates with a quantized angular velocity.
        Numerical values for the angular velocity, radii of allowed
        orbitspheres. energies, and associated quantities are calculated
        by Mills. </p>
      <p>Orbitsphere radii are calculated by setting the centripetal
        force equal to the electric and magnetic forces. </p>
      <p>The orbitsphere is a resonator cavity which traps photons of
        discrete frequencies. The radius of an orbitsphere increases
        with the absorption of electromagnetic energy. The solutions to
        Maxwell's equations for modes that can be excited in the
        orbitsphere resonator cavity give rise to four quantum numbers,
        and the energies of the modes are the experimentally known
        hydrogen spectrum. </p>
      <p>Excited states are unstable because the charge-density function
        of the electron plus photon have a radial doublet function
        component which corresponds to an electric dipole. The doublet
        possesses spacetime Fourier components synchronous with waves
        traveling at the speed of light; thus it is radiative. The
        charge-density function of the electron plus photon for the n=1
        principle quantum state of the hydrogen atom as well as for each
        of the ##EQU7## states mathematically is purely a radial delta
        function. The delta function does not possess spacetime Fourier
        components synchronous with waves traveling at the speed of
        light; thus, each is nonradiative. </p>
      <p><b>Catalytic Lower-energy Hydrogen Electronic Transitions ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Comparing transitions between below "ground" (fractional
        quantum) energy states as opposed to transitions between excited
        (integer quantum) energy states, it can be appreciated that the
        former are not effected by photons; whereas, the latter are.
        Transitions are symmetric with respect to time. Current density
        functions which give rise to photons according to the
        nonradiative boundary condition of Mills [Mills, R., The Grand
        Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics, (1995), Technomic
        Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa.] are created by photons in
        the reverse process. Excited (integer quantum) energy states
        correspond to this case. And, current density functions which do
        not give rise to photons according to the nonradiative boundary
        condition are not created by photons in the reverse process.
        Below "ground" (fractional quantum) energy states correspond to
        this case. But, atomic collisions can cause a stable state to
        undergo a transition to the next stable state. The transition
        between two stable nonradiative states effected by a collision
        with an resonant energy sink is analogous to the reaction of two
        atoms to form a diatomic molecule which requires a third-body
        collision to remove the bond energy [N. V. Sidgwick, The
        Chemical Elements and Their Compounds, Volume I, Oxford,
        Clarendon Press, (1950), p. 17]. </p>
      <p><b>Energy Hole Concept</b> </p>
      <p>The nonradiative boundary condition of Mills and the
        relationship between the electron and the photon give the
        "allowed" hydrogen energy states which are quantized as a
        function of the parameter n. Each value of n corresponds to an
        allowed transition effected by a resonant photon which excites
        the electronic transition. In addition to the traditional
        integer values (1, 2, 3, . . . ,) of n, values of fractions are
        allowed which correspond to transitions with an increase in the
        central field (charge) and decrease in the size of the hydrogen
        atom. This occurs, for example, when the electron couples to
        another electronic transition or electron transfer reaction
        which can absorb energy, an energy sink. This is the absorption
        of an energy hole. The absorption of an energy hole destroys the
        balance between the centrifugal force and the increased central
        electric force. As a result, the electron undergoes a transition
        to a lower energy nonradiative state. </p>
      <p>From energy conservation, the resonance energy hole of a
        hydrogen atom which excites resonator modes of radial dimensions
        ##EQU8## is </p>
      <p>mX27.2 eV where m=1,2,3,4, . . . (3) </p>
      <p>After resonant absorption of the energy hole, the radius of the
        orbitsphere, a.sub.H, shrinks to ##EQU9## and after p cycles of
        resonant shrinkage, the radius is ##EQU10## In other words, the
        radial ground state field can be considered as the superposition
        of Fourier components. The removal of negative Fourier
        components of energy mX27.2 eV, where m is an integer increases
        the positive central electric field inside the spherical shell
        by m times the charge of a proton. The resultant electric field
        is a time-harmonic solution of Laplace's Equations in spherical
        coordinates. In this case, the radius at which force balance and
        nonradiation are achieved is ##EQU11## where m is an integer. In
        decaying to this radius from the "ground" state, a total energy
        of [(m+1).sup.2 -1.sup.2 ]X13.6 eV is released. The transition
        between two stable nonradiative states effected by a collision
        with an energy hole is analogous to the reaction of two atoms to
        form a diatomic molecule which requires a third body collision
        to remove the bond energy [N. V. Sidgwick, The Chemical Elements
        and Their Compounds, Volume I, Oxford, Clarendon Press, (1950),
        p. 17]. The total energy well of the hydrogen atom is shown in
        FIG. 1. The exothermic reaction involving transitions from one
        potential energy level to a lower level is hereafter referred to
        as HydroCatalysis. </p>
      <p>A hydrogen atom with its electron in a lower than "ground
        state" energy level corresponding to a fractional quantum number
        is hereafter referred to as a hydrino atom. The designation for
        a hydrino atom of radius ##EQU12## where p is an integer is
        ##EQU13## </p>
      <p>The size of the electron orbitsphere as a function of potential
        energy is given in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>An efficient catalytic system that hinges on the coupling of
        three resonator cavities involves potassium. For example, the
        second ionization energy of potassium is 31.63 eV. This energy
        hole is obviously too high for resonant absorption. However,
        K.sup.+ releases 4.34 eV when it is reduced to K. The
        combination of K.sup.+ to K.sup.2+ and K.sup.+ to K, then, has a
        net energy change of 27.28 eV. ##EQU14## And, the overall
        reaction is ##EQU15## Note that the energy given off as the atom
        shrinks is much greater than the energy lost to the energy hole.
        Also, the energy released is large compared to conventional
        chemical reactions. </p>
      <p><b>Disproportionation of Energy States</b> </p>
      <p>Lower-energy hydrogen atoms, hydrinos, can act as a source of
        energy holes that can cause resonant shrinkage because the
        excitation and/or ionization energies are mX27.2 eV (Eq. (3)).
        For example, the equation for the absorption of an energy hole
        of 27.21 eV, m=1 in Eq. (3), during the shrinkage cascade for
        the third cycle of the hydrogen-type atom, ##EQU16## with the
        hydrogen-type atom, ##EQU17## that is ionized as the source of
        energy holes that cause resonant shrinkage is represented by
        ##EQU18## And, the overall reaction is ##EQU19## The general
        equation for the absorption of an energy hole of 27.21 eV, m=1
        in Eq. (3), during the shrinkage cascade for the pth cycle of
        the hydrogen-type atom, ##EQU20## with the hydrogen-type atom,
        ##EQU21## that is ionized as the source of energy holes that
        cause resonant shrinkage is represented by ##EQU22## And, the
        overall reaction is ##EQU23## </p>
      <p>Transitions to nonconsecutive energy levels involving the
        absorption of an energy hole of an integer multiple of 27.21 eV
        are possible. Lower-energy hydrogen atoms, hydrinos, can act as
        a source of energy holes that can cause resonant shrinkage with
        the absorption of an energy hole of mX27.2 eV (Eq. (3)). Thus,
        the shrinkage cascade for the pth cycle of the hydrogen-type
        atom, ##EQU24## with the hydrogen-type atom, ##EQU25## that is
        ionized as the source of energy holes that cause resonant
        shrinkage is represented by ##EQU26## And, the overall reaction
        is ##EQU27## </p>
      <p>Hydrogen is a source of energy holes. The ionization energy of
        hydrogen is 13.6 eV. Disproportionation can occur between three
        hydrogen atoms whereby two atoms provide an energy hole of 27.21
        eV for the third hydrogen atom. Thus, the shrinkage cascade for
        the pth cycle of the hydrogen-type atom, ##EQU28## with two
        hydrogen atoms, ##EQU29## as the source of energy holes that
        cause resonant shrinkage is represented by ##EQU30## And, the
        overall reaction is ##EQU31## The spectral lines from dark
        interstellar medium and the majority of the solar power can be
        attributed to disproportionation reactions as given in the
        Spectral Data of Hydrinos from the Dark Interstellar Medium and
        from the Sun Section of Mills [Mills, R., <i>The Grand Unified
          Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics</i>, (1995), Technomic
        Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa.]. This assignment resolves
        the mystery of dark matter, the solar neutrino problem, and the
        mystery of the cause of sunspots and other solar activity and
        why the Sun emits X-rays. It also provides the reason for the
        abrupt change in the speed of sound and transition from
        "radiation zone" to "convection zone" at a radius of 0.7 the
        solar radius, 0.7 R.sub.s as summarized in Example 4 below. </p>
      <p><b>Energy Hole (Atomic Hydrogen)</b> </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, energy holes, each of approximately
        27.21 eV, are provided by electron transfer reactions of
        reactants including electrochemical reactant(s)
        (electrocatalytic ion(s) or couple(s)) which cause heat to be
        released from hydrogen atoms as their electrons are stimulated
        to relax to quantized potential energy levels below that of the
        "ground state". The energy removed by an electron transfer
        reaction, energy hole, is resonant with the hydrogen energy
        released to stimulate this transition. The source of hydrogen
        atoms can be the production on the surface of a cathode during
        electrolysis of water in the case of an electrolytic energy
        reactor and hydrogen gas or a hydride in the case of a
        pressurized gas energy reactor or gas discharge energy reactor.

      <p>The central force equation for hydrogen-type molecules has
        orbital solutions which are circular, elliptic, parabolic, or
        hyperbolic. The former two types of solutions are associated
        with atomic and molecular orbitals. These solutions are
        nonradiative if the boundary condition for nonradiation given in

        the Forces, Matter, and Energy, Mills, R., Technomic Publishing
        Company, Lancaster, Pa., (1992), is met. The mathematical
        formulation for zero radiation is that the function that
        describes the motion of the electron must not possess space-time
        Fourier components that are synchronous with waves traveling at
        the speed of light. The boundary condition for the orbitsphere
        is met when the angular frequencies are ##EQU34## As
        demonstrated in the One Electron Atom Section of <i>The
          Unification of Spacetime, the Forces, Matter, and Energy</i>,
        Mills, R., Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa., (1992),
        this condition is met for the product function of a radial Dirac
        delta function and a time harmonic function where the angular
        frequency, .omega., is constant and given by Eq. (21). ##EQU35##
        where L is the angular momentum and A is the area of the closed
        geodesic orbit. Consider the solution of the central force
        equation comprising the product of a two dimensional ellipsoid
        and a time harmonic function. The spatial part of the product
        function is the convolution of a radial Dirac delta function
        with the equation of an ellipsoid. The Fourier transform of the
        convolution of two functions is the product of the individual
        Fourier transforms of the functions: thus, the boundary
        condition is met for an ellipsoidal-time harmonic function when
        ##EQU36## where the area of an ellipse is </p>
      <p>A=.pi.ab (24) </p>
      <p>where 2b is the length of the semiminor axis and 2a is the
        length of the semimajor axis. The geometry of molecular hydrogen
        is elliptic with the internuclear axis as the principle axis;
        thus, the electron orbital is a two dimensional ellipsoidal-time
        harmonic function. The mass follows geodesics time harmonically
        as determined by the central field of the protons at the foci.
        Rotational symmetry about the internuclear axis further
        determines that the orbital is a prolate spheroid. In general,
        ellipsoidal orbits of molecular bonding, hereafter referred to
        as ellipsoidal molecular orbitals (M. O.'s), have the general
        equation ##EQU37## The semiprinciple axes of the ellipsoid are
        a, b, c. </p>
      <p>In ellipsoidal coordinates the Laplacian is ##EQU38## An
        ellipsoidal M. O. is equivalent to a charged conductor whose
        surface is given by Eq. (25). It carries a total charge q, and
        it's potential is a solution of the Laplacian in ellipsoidal
        coordinates, Eq. (26). </p>
      <p>Excited states of orbitspheres are discussed in the Excited
        States of the One Electron Atom (Quantization) Section of <i>The





          Unification of Spacetime, the Forces, Matter, and Energy</i>,
        Mills, R., Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa., (1992).
        In the case of ellipsoidal M. O.'s, excited electronic states
        are created when photons of discrete frequencies are trapped in
        the ellipsoidal resonator cavity of the M. O. The photon changes
        the effective charge at the M. O. surface where the central
        field is ellipsoidal. Force balance is achieved at a series of
        ellipsoidal equipotential two dimensional surfaces confocal with
        the ground state ellipsoid. The trapped photons are solutions of
        the Laplacian in ellipsoidal coordinates, Eq. (26). </p>
      <p>As is the case with the orbitsphere, higher and lower energy
        states are equally valid. The photon standing wave in both cases
        is a solution of the Laplacian in ellipsoidal coordinates. For
        an ellipsoidal resonator cavity, the relationship between an
        allowed circumference, 4aE, and the photon standing wavelength,
        .lambda., is </p>
      <p>4aE=n.lambda. (27) </p>
      <p>where n is an integer and where ##EQU39## is used in the
        elliptic integral E of Eq. (27). Applying Eqs. (27) and (28),
        the relationship between an allowed angular frequency given by
        Eq. (23) and the photon standing wave angular frequency,
        .omega., is: ##EQU40## where n=1,2,3,4, . . . ##EQU41##
        .omega..sub.1 is the allowed angular frequency for n=1 a.sub.1
        and b.sub.1 are the allowed semimajor and semiminor axes for n=1
      </p>
      <p>From Eq. (29), the magnitude of the elliptic field
        corresponding to a below "ground state" transition of the
        hydrogen molecule is an integer. The potential energy equations
        of hydrogen-type molecules are ##EQU42## where ##EQU43## and
        where p is an integer. From energy conservation, the resonance
        energy hole of a hydrogen-type molecule which causes the
        transition ##EQU44## where m and p are integers. During the
        transition, the elliptic field is increased from magnitude p to
        magnitude p+m. The corresponding potential energy change equals
        the energy absorbed by the energy hole. </p>
      <p>Energy hole=-V.sub.e -V.sub.p =mp.sup.2 X48.6 eV (37) </p>
      <p>Further energy is released by the hydrogen-type molecule as the
        internuclear distance "shrinks". The total energy, E.sub.T,
        released during the transition is ##EQU45## </p>
      <p>A schematic drawing of the total energy well of hydrogen-type
        molecules and molecular ions is given in FIG. 3. The exothermic
        reaction involving transitions from one potential energy level
        to a lower level below the "ground state" is also hereafter
        referred to as HydroCatalysis. </p>
      <p>A hydrogen-type molecule with its electrons in a lower than
        "ground state" energy level corresponding to a fractional
        quantum number is hereafter referred to as a dihydrino molecule.

        distance, ##EQU46## where p is an integer, is ##EQU47## A

      <p>The magnitude of the elliptic field corresponding to the first
        below "ground state" hydrogen-type molecule is 2. From energy
        conservation, the resonance energy hole of a hydrogen molecule
        which excites the transition of the hydrogen molecule with
        internuclear distance ##EQU48## to the first below "ground
        state" with internuclear distance ##EQU49## is given by Eqs.
        (30) and (31) where the elliptic field is increased from
        magnitude one to magnitude two: ##EQU50## </p>
      <p>In other words, the ellipsoidal "ground state" field of the

      <p>where m is an integer, increases the positive electric field
        inside the ellipsoidal shell by m times the charge of a proton
        at each focus. The resultant electric field is a time harmonic
        solution of the Laplacian in ellipsoidal coordinates. The
        hydrogen molecule with internuclear distance ##EQU51## is caused
        to undergo a transition to a below "ground state" level, and the
        internuclear distance for which force balance and nonradiation
        are achieved is ##EQU52## In decaying to this internuclear
        distance from the "ground state", a total energy of ##EQU53## is
        released. Energy Hole (Molecular Hydrogen) </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, energy holes, each of approximately
        mX48.6 eV, are provided by electron transfer reactions of
        reactants including electrochemical reactant(s)
        (electrocatalytic ion(s) or couple(s)) which cause heat to be
        released from hydrogen molecules as their electrons are
        stimulated to relax to quantized potential energy levels below
        that of the "ground state". The energy removed by an electron
        transfer reaction, energy hole, is resonant with the hydrogen
        energy released to stimulate this transition. The source of
        hydrogen molecules can be the production on the surface of a
        cathode during electrolysis of water in the case of an
        electrolytic energy reactor and hydrogen gas or a hydride in the
        case of a pressurized gas energy reactor or gas discharge energy
        reactor. </p>
      <p><b>Energy Reactor</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention of an electrolytic cell energy reactor,
        pressurized gas energy reactor, and a gas discharge energy
        reactor, comprises: a source of hydrogen; one of a solid,
        molten, liquid, and gaseous source of energy holes; a vessel
        containing hydrogen and the source of energy holes wherein the
        shrinkage reaction occurs by contact of the hydrogen with the
        source of energy holes; and a means for removing the (molecular)
        lower-energy hydrogen so as to prevent the exothermic shrinkage
        reaction from coming to equilibrium. The shrinkage reaction rate
        and net power output are increased by conforming the energy hole
        to match the resonance shrinkage energy. In general, power
        output can be optimized by controlling the temperature, pressure
        of the hydrogen gas, the source of the energy hole including the
        electrocatalytic ion or couple which provides the energy hole,
        the counterion of the electrocatalytic ion or couple, and the
        area of the surface on which the shrinkage reaction occurs. The
        present invention further comprises a hydrogen spillover
        catalyst, a multifunctionality material having a functionality
        which dissociates molecular hydrogen to provide free hydrogen
        atoms which spill over to a functionality which supports mobile
        free hydrogen atoms and a functionality which can be a source of
        the energy holes. </p>
      <p>A preferred pressurized hydrogen gas energy reactor comprises a
        vessel; a source of hydrogen; a means to control the pressure
        and flow of hydrogen into the vessel; a material to dissociate
        the molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen, and a material
        which can be a source of energy holes in the gas phase. The
        gaseous source of energy holes includes those that sublime,
        boil, and/or are volatile at the elevated operating temperature
        of the gas energy reactor wherein the shrinkage reaction occurs
        in the gas phase. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>CATALYTIC ENERGY HOLE STRUCTURE FOR ATOMS</b> </p>
      <p><b>Single Electron Excited State ~</b> </p>
      <p>An energy hole is provided by the transition of an electron of
        a species to an excited state species including a continuum
        excited state(s) of atoms, ions, molecules, and ionic and
        molecular compounds. In one embodiment, the energy hole
        comprises the excited state transition of an electron of one
        species whereby the transition energy of the accepting species
        equals approximately mX27.21 eV where m is an integer. </p>
      <p><b>Single Electron Transfer</b> </p>
      <p>An energy hole is provided by the transfer of an electron
        between participating species including atoms, ions, molecules,
        and ionic and molecular compounds. In one embodiment, the energy
        hole comprises the transfer of an electron from one species to
        another species whereby the sum of the ionization energy of the
        electron donating species minus the ionization energy or
        electron affinity of the electron accepting species equals
        approximately mX27.21 eV where m is an integer. </p>
      <p><b>Single Electron Transfer (Two Species)</b> </p>
      <p>An efficient catalytic system that hinges on the coupling of
        three resonator cavities involves potassium. For example, the
        second ionization energy of potassium is 31.63 eV. This energy
        hole is obviously too high for resonant absorption. However,
        K.sup.+ releases 4.34 eV when it is reduced to K. The
        combination of K.sup.+ to K.sup.2+ and K.sup.+ to K, then, has a
        net energy change of 27.28 eV; m=1 in Eq. (3). ##EQU56## And,
        the overall reaction is ##EQU57## Note that the energy given off
        as the atom shrinks is much greater than the energy lost to the
        energy hole. And, the energy released is large compared to
        conventional chemical reactions. </p>
      <p>For sodium or sodium ions no electrocatalytic reaction of
        approximately 27.21 eV is possible. For example, 42.15 eV of
        energy is absorbed by the reverse of the reaction given in Eq.
        (45) where Na.sup.+ replaces K.sup.+ : </p>
      <p>Na.sup.+ +Na.sup.+ +42.15 eV.fwdarw.Na+Na.sup.2+ (47) </p>
      <p>Other less efficient catalytic systems hinge on the coupling of
        three resonator cavities. For example, the third ionization
        energy of palladium is 32.93 eV. This energy hole is obviously
        too high for resonant absorption. However, Li.sup.+ releases
        5.392 eV when it is reduced to Li. The combination of Pd.sup.2+
        to Pd.sup.3+ and Li.sup.+ to Li, then, has a net energy change
        of 27.54 eV. ##EQU58## And, the overall reaction is ##EQU59##
        Single Electron Transfer (One Species) </p>
      <p>An energy hole is provided by the ionization of an electron
        from a participating species including an atom, an ion, a
        molecule, and an ionic or molecular compound to a vacuum energy
        level. In one embodiment, the energy hole comprises the
        ionization of an electron from one species to a vacuum energy
        level whereby the ionization energy of the electron donating
        species equals approximately mX27.21 eV where m is an integer. </p>
      <p>Titanium is one of the catalysts (electrocatalytic ion) that
        can cause resonant shrinkage because the third ionization energy
        is 27.49 eV, m=1 in Eq. (3). Thus, the shrinkage cascade for the
        pth cycle is represented by ##EQU60## And, the overall reaction
        is ##EQU61## </p>
      <p>Rubidium is also a catalyst (electrocatalytic ion). The second
        ionization energy is 27.28 eV. ##EQU62## And, the overall
        reaction is ##EQU63## </p>

      <p><b>Multiple Electron Transfer</b> </p>
      <p>An energy hole is provided by the transfer of multiple
        electrons between participating species including atoms, ions,
        molecules, and ionic and molecular compounds. In one embodiment,
        the energy hole comprises the transfer of t electrons from one
        or more species to one or more species whereby the sum of the
        ionization energies and/or electron affinities of the electron
        donating species minus the sum of the ionization energies and/or

      <p>In an embodiment, a catalytic system that provides an energy

        of the catalysts (electrocatalytic atom) that can cause resonant
        shrinkage because the sum of the first and second ionization
        energies is 27.358 eV, m=1 in Eq. (3). Thus, the shrinkage
        cascade for the p th cycle is represented by ##EQU64## And, the

        atom, ion, or molecule to another atom or molecule such that the
        sum of two ionization energies minus the sum of two electron
        affinities of the participating atoms, ions, and/or molecules is
        approximately 27.21 eV. A catalytic system that hinges on the

        palladium and oxygen. For example, the first and second
        ionization energies of palladium are 8.34 eV and 19.43 eV,
        respectively. And, the first and second electron affinities of
        the oxygen molecule are 0.45 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively. The

        that the sum of two ionization energies minus the sum of one
        ionization energy and one electron affinity of the participating
        atoms, ions, and/or molecules is approximately 27.21 eV. A

      <p><b>Electrolytic Energy Reactor</b> </p>
      <p>An electrolytic energy reactor is described in my previous U.S.
        patent applications entitled "Energy/Matter Conversion Methods
        and Structures", Ser. No. 08/467,051 filed on Jun. 6, 1995 which

        filed on Apr. 3, 1995 which is a continuation-in-part
        application of Ser. No. 08/107,357 filed on Aug. 16, 1993, which
        is a continuation-in-part application of Ser. No. 08/075,102
        (Dkt. 99437) filed on Jun. 11, 1993, which is a
        continuation-in-part application of Ser. No. 07/626,496 filed on
        Dec. 12, 1990 which is a continuation-in-part application of
        Ser. No. 07/345,628 filed Apr. 28, 1989 which is a

        Apr. 21, 1989 which are incorporated herein by reference. A
        preferred embodiment of the energy reactor of the present
        invention comprises an electrolytic cell forming the reaction
        vessel 52 of FIG. 5 including a molten electrolytic cell. The
        electrolytic cell 100 is shown generally in FIG. 6. An electric
        current is passed through the electrolytic solution 102 having a
        electrocatalytic ions or couples providing energy holes equal to
        the resonance shrinkage energy (including the electrocatalytic
        ions and couples described in my previous U.S. Patent
        Applications incorporated herein by reference) by the
        application of a voltage to an anode 104 and cathode 106 by the
        power controller 108 powered by the power supply 110. Ultrasonic
        or mechanical energy may also be imparted to the cathode 106 and
        electrolytic solution 102 by vibrating means 112. Heat can be
        supplied to the electrolytic solution 102 by heater 114. The
        pressure of the electrolytic cell 100 can be controlled by
        pressure regulator means 116 where the cell can be closed. The
        reactor further comprises a means 101 that removes the
        (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen such as a selective venting
        valve to prevent the exothermic shrinkage reaction from coming
        to equilibrium. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the electrolytic cell is operated at
        zero voltage gap by applying an overpressure of hydrogen with
        hydrogen source 121 where the overpressure can be controlled by
        pressure control means 122 and 116. Water can be reduced to
        hydrogen and hydroxide at the cathode 106, and the hydrogen can
        be oxidized to protons at the anode 104. An embodiment of the
        electrolytic cell energy reactor, comprises a reverse fuel cell
        geometry which removes the lower-energy hydrogen under vacuum. A
        preferred cathode 106 of this embodiment has a modified gas
        diffusion layer and comprises a gas route means including a
        first Teflon membrane filter and a second carbon paper/Teflon
        membrane filter composite layer. A further embodiment comprises
        a reaction vessel that can be closed except for a connection to
        a condensor 140 on the top of the vessel 100. The cell can be
        operated at a boil such that the steam evolving from the boiling
        electrolyte 102 can be condensed in the condenser 140, and the
        condensed water can be returned to the vessel 100. The
        lower-energy state hydrogen can be vented through the top of the
        condenser 140. In one embodiment, the condensor contains a
        hydrogen/oxygen recombiner 145 that contacts the evolving
        electrolytic gases. The hydrogen and oxygen are recombined, and
        the resulting water can be returned to the vessel 100. The heat
        released from the exothermic reaction whereby the electrons of
        the electrolytically produced hydrogen atoms (molecules) are
        induced to undergo transitions to energy levels below the
        "ground state" and the heat released due to the recombination of
        the electrolytically generated normal hydrogen and oxygen can be
        removed by a heat exchanger 60 of FIG. 5 which can be connected
        to the condensor 140. </p>
      <p>In vacuum, in the absence of external fields, the energy hole
        to stimulate a hydrogen atom (molecule) to undergo a shrinkage
        transition is mX27.21 eV (mX48.6 eV) where m is an integer. This
        resonance shrinkage energy can be altered when the atom
        (molecule) is in a media different from vacuum. An example is a
        hydrogen atom (molecule) absorbed to the cathode 106 present in
        the aqueous electrolytic solution 102 having an applied electric
        field and an intrinsic or applied magnetic field provided by
        external magnetic field generator 75. Under these conditions the
        energy hole required can be slightly different from mX27.21 eV
        (mX48.6 eV). Thus, a source of energy holes including
        electrocatalytic ion and couple reactants can be selected which
        has a redox (electron transfer) energy resonant with the
        resonance shrinkage energy when operating under these
        conditions. In the case where a nickel cathode 106 is used to
        electrolyze an aqueous solution 102 where the cell is operating
        within a voltage range of 1.4 to 5 volts, the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        and Rb.sup.+ (Fe.sup.3+ /Li.sup.+ and Sc.sup.3+ /Sc.sup.3+)
        electrocatalytic ions and couples are preferred embodiments to
        shrink hydrogen atoms (molecules). </p>
      <p>The cathode provides hydrogen atoms (molecules), and the
        shrinkage reaction occurs at the surface of the cathode where
        hydrogen atoms (molecules) and the source of energy holes
        (electrocatalytic ion or couple) are in contact. Thus, the
        shrinkage reaction can be dependent on the surface area of the
        cathode. For a constant current density, giving a constant
        concentration of hydrogen atoms (molecules) per unit area, an
        increase in surface area increases the reactants available to
        undergo the shrinkage reaction. Also. an increase in cathode
        surface area decreases the resistance of the electrolytic cell
        which improves the electrolysis efficiency. A preferred cathode
        of the electrolytic cell including a nickel cathode has the
        properties of a high surface area, a highly stressed and
        hardened surface such as a cold drawn or cold worked surface,
        and a large number of grain boundaries. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the electrolytic cell energy
        reactor, the source of energy holes can be incorporated into the
        cathode, mechanically by methods including cold working the
        source of energy holes into the surface of the cathode;
        thermally by methods including melting the source of energy
        holes into the surface of the cathode and evaporation of a
        solvent of a solution of the source of energy holes in contact
        with the surface of the cathode, and electrostatically by
        methods including electrolytic deposition, ion bombardment, and
        vacuum deposition. </p>
      <p>The shrinkage reaction rate can be dependent upon the
        composition of the cathode 106. Hydrogen atoms (molecules) are
        reactants to produce energy via the shrinkage reaction. Thus,
        the cathode must efficiently provide a high concentration of
        hydrogen atoms (molecules). The cathode 106 can be comprised of
        any element. compound, alloy, or mixture of a conductor or
        semiconductor including transition elements and compounds,
        actinide and lanthanide elements and compounds, and group IIIB
        and IVB elements and compounds. Transition metals dissociate
        hydrogen gas into atoms to a more or lesser extent depending on
        the metal. Nickel and titanium readily dissociate hydrogen
        molecules and are preferred embodiments for shrinking hydrogen
        atoms. The cathode can alter the energy of the absorbed hydrogen
        atoms (molecules) and affect the energy of the shrinkage
        reaction. A cathode material can be selected which provides
        resonance between the energy hole and the resonance shrinkage
        energy. In the case of the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic
        couple with carbonate as the counterion for catalyzing the
        shrinkage of hydrogen atoms, the relationship of the cathode
        material to the reaction rate can be: </p>
      <p>Pt&lt;Pd&lt;&lt;Ti,Fe&lt;Ni </p>
      <p>This can be the opposite order of the energy released when
        these materials absorb hydrogen atoms. Thus, for this
        electrocatalytic couple, the reaction rate can be increased by
        using a cathode which weakly absorbs the hydrogen atoms with
        little perturbation of their electronic energies. </p>
      <p>Also, coupling of resonator cavities and enhancement of the
        transfer of energy between them can be increased when the media
        is a nonlinear media such as a magnetized ferromagnetic media.
        Thus, a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic cathode, a nonlinear
        magnetized media, increases the reaction rate by increasing the
        coupling of the resonance shrinkage energy of the hydrogen atom
        and energy hole comprising an electrocatalytic ion or couple.
        Alternatively, a magnetic field can be applied with the magnetic
        field generator 75. Magnetic fields at the cathode alter the
        energy of absorbed hydrogen and concomitantly alter the
        resonance shrinkage energy. Magnetic fields also perturb the
        energy of the electrocatalytic reactions (energy hole) by
        altering the energy levels of the electrons involved in the
        reactions. The magnetic properties of the cathode are selected
        as well as the strength of the magnetic field which is applied
        by magnetic field generator 75 to optimize shrinkage reaction
        rate-the power output. A preferred ferromagnetic cathode is
        nickel. </p>
      <p>A preferred method to clean the cathode of the electrolytic
        cell including a nickel cathode is to anodize the cathode in a
        basic electrolytic solution including approximately 0.57 M
        X.sub.2 CO.sub.3 (X is the alkali cation of the electrolyte
        including K.sup.+) and to immerse the cathode in a dilute
        solution of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 such as approximately 3% H.sub.2
        O.sub.2. In a further embodiment of the cleaning method, cyclic
        voltametry with a second electrode of the same material as the
        first cathode is performed. The cathode can be then thoroughly
        rinsed with distilled water. Organic material on the surface of
        the cathode inhibits the catalytic reaction whereby the
        electrons of the electrolytically produced hydrogen atoms
        (molecules) are induced to undergo transitions to energy levels
        below the "ground state". Cleaning by this method removes the
        organic material from the cathode surface and adds oxygen atoms
        onto the cathode surface. Doping the metal surface, including a
        nickel surface, with oxygen atoms by anodizing the cathode and
        cleaning the cathode in H.sub.2 O.sub.2 increases the power
        output by decreasing hydrogen recombination to molecular
        hydrogen and by decreasing the bond energy between the metal and
        the hydrogen atoms (molecules) which conforms the resonance
        shrinkage energy of the absorbed hydrogen to the energy hole
        provided by the source of energy holes including the K.sup.+
        /K.sup.+ (Sc.sup.3+ /Sc.sup.3+) electrocatalytic couples. </p>
      <p>Different anode materials have different overpotentials for the
        oxidation of water, which can affect ohmic losses. An anode of
        low overpotential will increase the efficiency. Nickel,
        platinum, and dimensionally stable anodes including platinized
        titanium are preferred anodes. In the case of the K.sup.+
        /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic couple where carbonate is used as the
        counterion, nickel is a preferred anode. Nickel is also a
        preferred anode for use in basic solutions with a nickel
        cathode. Nickel is inexpensive relative to platinum, and fresh
        nickel can be electroplated onto the cathode during
        electrolysis. </p>
      <p>A preferred method to clean a dimensionally stable anode
        including a platinized titanium anode is to place the anode in
        approximately 3 M HCl for approximately 5 minutes and then to
        rinse it with distilled water. </p>
      <p>In the case of hydrogen atom shrinkage, hydrogen atoms at the
        surface of the cathode 106 form hydrogen gas which can form
        bubbles on the surface of the cathode. These bubbles act as an
        boundary layer between the hydrogen atoms and the
        electrocatalytic ion or couple. The boundary can be ameliorated
        by vibrating the cathode and/or the electrolytic solution 102 or
        by applying ultrasound with vibrating means 112; and by adding
        wetting agents to the electrolytic solution 102 to reduce the
        surface tension of the water and prevent bubble formation. The
        use of a cathode having a smooth surface or a wire cathode
        prevents gas adherence. And an intermittent current, provided by
        an on-off circuit of power controller 108 provides periodic
        replenishing of hydrogen atoms which are dissipated by hydrogen
        gas formation followed by diffusion into the solution while
        preventing excessive hydrogen gas formation which could form a
        boundary layer. </p>
      <p>The shrinkage reaction can be temperature dependent. Most
        chemical reactions double their rates for each 10.degree. C.
        rise in temperature. Increasing the temperature increases the
        collision rate between the hydrogen atoms (molecules) and the
        electrocatalytic ion or couple which will increase the shrinkage
        reaction rate. With large temperature excursions from room
        temperature, the kinetic energy distribution of the reactants
        can be sufficiently altered to cause the energy hole and the
        resonance shrinkage energy to conform to a more or lesser
        extent. The rate can be proportional to the extent of the
        conformation or resonance of these energies. The temperature can
        be adjusted to optimize the shrinkage reaction rate-energy
        production rate. In the case of the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        electrocatalytic couple, a preferred embodiment can be to run
        the reaction at a temperature above room temperature by applying
        heat with heater 114. </p>
      <p>The shrinkage reaction can be dependent on the current density.
        An increase in current density can be equivalent, in some
        aspects, to an increase in temperature. The collision rate
        increases, and the energy of the reactants increases with
        current density. Thus, the rate can be increased by increasing
        the collision rate of the reactants; however, the rate may be
        increased or decreased depending on the effect of the increased
        reactant energies on the conformation of the energy hole and the
        resonance shrinkage energy. Also, increased current dissipates
        more energy by ohmic heating and may cause hydrogen bubble
        formation, in the case of the shrinkage of hydrogen atoms. But,
        a high flow of gas may dislodge bubbles which diminishes any
        hydrogen gas boundary layer. The current density can be adjusted
        with power controller 108 to optimize the excess energy
        production. In a preferred embodiment, the current density can
        be in the range 1 to 1000 milliamps per square centimeter. </p>
      <p>The pH of the aqueous electrolytic solution 102 can affect the
        shrinkage reaction rate. In the case that the electrocatalytic
        ion or couple is positively charged, an increase in the pH will
        reduce the concentration of hydronium at the negative cathode;
        thus, the concentration of the electrocatalytic ion or couple
        cations will increase. An increase in reactant concentration
        increases the reaction rate. In the case of the Rb.sup.+ or
        K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ (Sc.sup.3+ /Sc.sup.3+) ion or couple, a
        preferred pH can be basic (7.1-14). </p>
      <p>The counterion of the electrocatalytic ion or couple of the
        electrolytic solution 102 can affect the shrinkage reaction rate
        by altering the energy of the transition state. For example, the
        transition state complex of the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        electrocatalytic couple with the hydrogen atom has a plus two
        charge and involves a three body collision which can be
        unfavorable. A negative two charged oxyanion can bind the two
        potassium ions; thus, it provides a neutral transition state
        complex of lower energy whose formation depends on a binary
        collision which can be greatly favored. The rate can be
        dependent on the separation distance of the potassium ions as
        part of the complex with the oxyanion. The greater the
        separation distance, the less favorable can be the transfer of
        an electron between them. A close juxtaposition of the potassium
        ions will increase the rate. The relationship of the reaction
        rate to the counterion in the case where the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        couple is used can be: </p>
      <p>OH.sup.-&lt;PO.sub.4.sup.3-, HPO.sub.3.sup.2-
        &lt;SO.sub.4.sup.2- &lt;&lt;CO.sub.3.sup.2- </p>
      <p>Thus, a planar negative two charge oxyanion including carbonate
        with at least two binding sites for K.sup.+ which provides close
        juxtaposition of the K.sup.+ ions can be preferred as the
        counterion of the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic couple. The
        carbonate counterion can be also a preferred counterion for the
        Rb.sup.+ electrocatalytic ion. </p>
      <p>A power controller 108 comprising an intermittent current,
        on-off, electrolysis circuit will increase the excess heat by
        providing optimization of the electric field as a function of
        time which provides maximum conformation of reactant energies,
        provides an optimal concentration of hydrogen atoms (molecules)
        while minimizing ohmic and electrolysis power losses and, in the
        case of the shrinkage of hydrogen atoms, minimizes the formation
        of a hydrogen gas boundary layer. The frequency, duty cycle,
        peak voltage, step waveform, peak current, and offset voltage
        are adjusted to achieve the optimal shrinkage reaction rate and
        shrinkage reaction power while minimizing ohmic and electrolysis
        power losses. In the case where the K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        electrocatalytic couple can be used with carbonate as the
        counterion; nickel as the cathode: and platinum as the anode, a
        preferred embodiment can be to use an intermittent square-wave
        having an offset voltage of approximately 1.4 volts to 2.2
        volts; a peak voltage of approximately 1.5 volts to 3.75 volts;
        a peak current of approximately 1 mA to 100 mA per square
        centimeter of cathode surface area; approximately a 5%-90% duty
        cycle; and a frequency in the range of 1 Hz to 1500 Hz. </p>
      <p>Further energy can be released by repeating the shrinkage
        reaction. The atoms (molecules) which have undergone shrinkage
        diffuse into the cathode lattice. A cathode 106 can be used
        which will facilitates multiple shrinkage reactions of hydrogen
        atoms (molecules). One embodiment is to use a cathode which can
        be fissured and porous to the electrocatalytic ion or couple
        such that it can contact shrunken atoms (molecules) which have
        diffused into a lattice, including a metal lattice. A further
        embodiment is to use a cathode of alternating layers of a
        material which provides hydrogen atoms (molecules) during
        electrolysis including a transition metal and an
        electrocatalytic ion or couple such that shrunken hydrogen atoms
        (molecules) periodically or repetitively diffuse into contact
        with the electrocatalytic ion or couple. </p>
      <p>The shrinkage reaction can be dependent on the dielectric
        constant of the media. The dielectric constant of the media
        alters the electric field at the cathode and concomitantly
        alters the energy of the reactants. Solvents of different
        dielectric constants have different solvation energies, and the
        dielectric constant of the solvent can also lower the
        overpotential for electrolysis and improve electrolysis
        efficiency. A solvent, including water, can be selected for the
        electrolytic solution 102 which optimizes the conformation of
        the energy hole and resonance shrinkage energy and maximizes the
        efficiency of electrolysis. </p>
      <p>The solubility of hydrogen in the reaction solution can be
        directly proportional to the pressure of hydrogen above the
        solution. Increasing the pressure increases the concentration of
        reactant hydrogen atoms (molecules) at the cathode 106 and
        thereby increases the rate. But, in the case of the shrinkage of
        hydrogen atoms this also favors the development of a hydrogen
        gas boundary layer. The hydrogen pressure can be controlled by
        pressure regulator means 116 to optimize the shrinkage reaction
        rate. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the cathode 106 of the electrolytic
        cell comprises the catalytic material including a hydrogen
        spillover catalyst described in the Pressurized Gas Energy
        Reactor Section below. In another embodiment, the cathode
        comprises multiple hollow vessels comprising a thin film
        conductive shell whereby lower-energy hydrogen diffuses through
        the thin film and collects inside each vessel and undergoes
        disproportionation reactions therein. </p>
      <p>The heat output can be monitored with thermocouples present in
        at least the vessel 100 and the condensor 140 of FIG. 6 and the
        heat exchanger 60 of FIG. 5. The output power can be controlled
        by a computerized monitoring and control system which monitors
        the thermistors and controls the means to alter the power
        output. </p>
      <p><b>Pressurized Gas Energy Reactor</b> </p>
      <p>A pressurized gas energy reactor comprises the first vessel 200
        of FIG. 7 containing a source of hydrogen including hydrogen
        from metal-hydrogen solutions, hydrogen from hydrides, hydrogen
        from the dissociation of water including thermal dissociation,
        hydrogen from the electrolysis of water, or hydrogen gas. In the
        case of a reactor which shrinks hydrogen atoms, the reactor
        further comprises a means to dissociate the molecular hydrogen
        into atomic hydrogen such as a dissociating material including
        an element, compound, alloy, or mixture of transition elements

        pressurized gas energy reactor further comprises a means 201 to
        remove the (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen such as a selective
        venting valve to prevent the exothermic shrinkage reaction from
        coming to equilibrium. One embodiment comprises heat pipes as
        heat exchanger 60 of FIG. 5 which have a lower-energy hydrogen
        venting valve at a cold spot. </p>
      <p>A preferred embodiment of the pressurized gas energy reactor of
        the present invention comprises a first reaction vessel 200 with
        inner surface 240 comprised of a material to dissociate the
        molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen including an element,
        compound, alloy, or mixture of transition elements and inner
        transition elements, iron, platinum, palladium, zirconium,
        vanadium, nickel, titanium, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Nb, Mo,
        Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, La, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Au, Hg, Ce, Pr,
        Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Th, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Vb, Lu, Th, Pa, U,
        activated charcoal (carbon), and intercalated Cs carbon
        (graphite). In a further embodiment, the inner surface 240 can
        be comprised of a proton conductor. The first reaction vessel
        200 can be sealed in a second reaction vessel 220 and receives
        hydrogen from source 221 under pressure which can be controlled
        by pressure measurement and control means 222 and 223. In a
        preferred embodiment the hydrogen pressure can be in the range
        of 10.sup.-3 atmospheres to 100 atmospheres. The wall 250 of the
        first vessel 200 can be permeable to hydrogen. The outer surface
        245 and/or outer vessel 220 has a source of energy holes equal
        to the resonance shrinkage energy. In one embodiment the source
        of energy holes can be a mixture or solution containing energy
        holes in the molten, liquid, or solid state. In another
        embodiment an electric current can be passed through the
        material having a source of energy holes. The reactor further
        comprises a means to control the reaction rate such as current
        source 225 and heating means 230 which heat the first reaction
        vessel 200 and the second reaction vessel 220. In a preferred
        embodiment the outer reaction vessel 220 contains oxygen, the
        inner surface 240 comprises one or more of a coat of nickel,
        platinum, or palladium. The outer surface 245 can be coated with
        one or more of copper, tellurium, arsenic, cesium, platinum, or
        palladium and an oxide such as CuO.sub.x, PtO.sub.x, PdO.sub.x,
        MnO.sub.x, AlO.sub.x, SiO.sub.x. The electrocatalytic ion or
        couple can be regenerated spontaneously or via a regeneration
        means including heating means 230 and current source 225. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the pressurized gas energy reactor
        comprises only a single reaction vessel 200 with a hydrogen
        impermeable wall 250. In the case of a reactor which shrinks
        hydrogen atoms, one or more of a hydrogen dissociating materials
        including transition elements and inner transition elements,
        iron, platinum, palladium, zirconium, vanadium, nickel,
        titanium, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd,
        La, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Au, Hg, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd,
        Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Vb, Lu, Th, Pa, U, activated charcoal
        (carbon), and intercalated Cs carbon (graphite) are coated on
        the inner surface 240 with a source of energy holes including
        one or more of copper, tellurium, arsenic, cesium, platinum, or
        palladium and an oxide such as CuO.sub.x, PtO.sub.x, PdO.sub.x,
        MnO.sub.x, AlO.sub.x, SiO.sub.x. In another embodiment, the
        source of energy hole can be one of a inelastic photon or
        particle scattering reaction(s). In a preferred embodiment the
        photon source 205 supplies the energy holes where the energy
        hole corresponds to stimulated emission by the photon. In the
        case of a reactor which shrinks hydrogen atoms the photon source
        205 dissociates hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms. The
        photon source producing photons of at least one energy of
        approximately mX27.21 eV, ##EQU95## or 40.8 eV causes stimulated
        emission of energy as the hydrogen atoms undergo the shrinkage
        reaction. In another preferred embodiment, a photon source 205
        producing photons of at least one energy of approximately mX48.6
        eV, 95.7 eV, or mX31.94 eV causes stimulated emission of energy
        as the hydrogen molecules undergo the shrinkage reaction. </p>
      <p>A preferred inner surface, 240, and outer surface, 245, of the
        pressurized gas energy reactor including a nickel surface has
        the properties of a high surface area, a highly stressed and
        hardened surface such as a cold drawn or cold worked surface,
        and a large number of grain boundaries. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment of the pressurized gas energy reactor, the
        source of energy holes can be incorporated into the inner
        surface, 240, and outer surface, 245, mechanically by methods
        including cold working the source of energy holes into the
        surface material and thermally by methods including melting the
        source of energy holes into the surface material (fusion).
        Further methods of incorporation include dry impregnation,
        evaporation of a solution of the source of energy holes in
        contact with the surface material (precipitation), ion
        bombardment, vacuum deposition, impregnation, leaching, and
        electrostatic incorporation including electrolytic deposition
        and electroplating. A preferred method to clean the inner
        surface 240 and the outer surface 245 including a nickel surface
        is to fill the inner vessel and the outer vessel with a basic
        electrolytic solution including approximately 0.57 M X.sub.2
        CO.sub.3 (X is the alkali cation of the electrolyte including
        K.sup.+) and to fill the inner vessel and the outer vessel with
        a dilute solution of H.sub.2 O.sub.2. Each of the inner vessel
        and the outer vessel can be then thoroughly rinsed with
        distilled water. In one embodiment, at least one of the vessel
        200 or the vessel 220 can be then filled with a solution of the
        energy hole including an approximately 0.57 M K.sub.2 CO.sub.3
        solution. </p>
      <p>In a further embodiment, textural and/or structural promoters
        are incorporated with the source of energy holes to increase the
        shrinkage reaction rate. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the method of operation of the pressurized
        gas energy reactor, hydrogen can be introduced inside of the
        first vessel from source 221 under pressure which can be
        controlled by pressure control means 222. In the case of a
        reactor which shrinks hydrogen atoms, the molecular hydrogen can
        be dissociated into atomic hydrogen by a dissociating material
        or electromagnetic radiation including UV light provided by
        photon source 205 such that the dissociated hydrogen atoms
        contact a source of energy holes including a molten, liquid,
        gaseous, or solid source of the energy holes. The atomic
        (molecular) hydrogen releases energy as its electrons are
        stimulated to undergo transitions to lower energy levels by the
        energy holes. Alternatively, the hydrogen dissociates on the
        inner surface 240, diffuses though the wall 250 of the first
        vessel 200 and contacts a source of energy holes on the outer
        surface 245 or contact a source of energy holes including a
        molten, liquid, gaseous, or solid source of the energy holes as
        hydrogen atoms or recombined hydrogen molecules. The atomic
        (molecular) hydrogen releases energy as its electrons are
        stimulated to undergo transitions to lower energy levels by the
        energy holes. The electrocatalytic ion or couple can be
        regenerated spontaneously or via a regeneration means including
        heating means 230 and current source 225. The (molecular)
        lower-energy hydrogen can be removed from vessel 200 and/or
        vessel 220 by a means to remove the (molecular) lower-energy
        hydrogen such as a selective venting valve means 201 which
        prevents the exothermic shrinkage reaction from coming to
        equilibrium. To control the reaction rate (the power output), an
        electric current can be passed through the material having a
        source of energy holes equal to the resonance shrinkage energy
        with current source 225, and/or the first reaction vessel 200
        and the second reaction vessel 220 are heated by heating means
        230. The heat output can be monitored with thermocouples present
        in at least the first vessel 200, the second vessel 220, and the
        heat exchanger 60 of FIG. 5. The output power can be controlled
        by a computerized monitoring and control system which monitors
        the thermistors and controls the means to alter the power
        output. The (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen can be removed by
        a means 201 to prevent the exothermic shrinkage reaction from
        coming to equilibrium. </p>

        The powder can be dried in an oven at 200.degree. C. If

      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the source of hydrogen atoms for the
        catalytic shrinkage reaction comprises a hydrogen spillover
        catalyst. </p>
      <p>A hydrogen spillover catalyst according to the present
        invention comprises: </p>
      <p>A hydrogen dissociation material or means which forms free
        hydrogen atoms or protons; </p>

      <p>A source of energy holes which catalyze the shrinkage reaction,
        and optionally </p>
      <p>A support material into which the former materials are embedded
        as a mixture, compound, or solution. </p>
      <p>Such hydrogen dissociation materials include surfaces or
        materials to dissociate hydrogen, deuterium, or tritium,
        comprise an element, compound, alloy, or mixture of transition
        elements and inner transition elements, iron, platinum,

        Ser. No. 07/341,733 filed Apr. 21, 1989, which are incorporated
        herein by reference. The counterion of the energy hole of the
        spillover catalyst includes those given in the Handbook of
        Chemistry and Physics, Robert C. Weast, Editor, 58th Edition,
        CRC Press, West Palm Beach, Fla., (1974) pp. B61-B178 which is
        incorporated by reference herein, organic ions including benzoic
        acid, phthalate, salicylate, aryl sulfonate, alky sulfate, alkyl
        sulfonate, and alkyl carboxylate, and the anion of an acid which

      <p>The functionalities of the hydrogen spillover catalyst are
        combined with the other functionalities as separate species or
        as combinations comprising a mixture, solution, compound, or

        contains one component. and these functionalities are mixed with
        the conduit material without a support material. Whereas, in
        another embodiment, the hydrogen dissociation material and the
        source of energy holes comprise heterogeneous crystals-each
        crystal contains both of the components, and the heterogeneous
        crystals are mixed with the conduit material which coats a
        support material. In a third exemplary embodiment, the source of
        energy holes can be embedded in the conduit material. and this
        combined species can be mixed with the hydrogen dissociation
        material which can be embedded in the same or a different
        conduit material without a support material. </p>
      <p>A method of preparation of the hydrogen spillover catalytic
        material of the present invention includes the steps of: </p>

        of incipient wetness impregnation. </p>
      <p>Thoroughly mixing the components by sintering. </p>
      <p>A further method of preparation of the hydrogen spillover
        catalytic material of the present invention includes the steps
        of: </p>
      <p>Dissolving or dispersing the components to be mixed in a
        suitable solvent such as water and drying the solution or
        mixture. </p>
      <p>Removing the solvent by drying, or the wet mixture, suspension,
        or solution can be frozen and the solvent can be sublimed. </p>
      <p>Thoroughly mixing the components by sintering. </p>

        required can be the desired amount, and the weight percent of
        the ionic salts of the cations in the final material can be
        determined by the desired weight of the ionic salts of the
        cations dissolved in the desired volume of solvent. </p>

        with further hydrogen dissociation material including a powder
        mixed with a conduit material and a support material. </p>
      <p><b>Example of a Ionic Hydrogen Spillover Catalytic Material:

      <p>To prepare one kilogram of the ionic hydrogen spillover
        catalytic material: 40% by weight potassium nitrate (KNO.sub.3)
        on 1%-Pd-on-graphitic carbon powder, 0.40 kg of KNO.sub.3 are
        dissolved in 1 liter of H.sub.2 O. Incipient wetness requires 1
        ml of H.sub.2 O per gram of -300 mesh graphite powder, and 0.67
        grams of KNO.sub.3 are required per gram of graphitic carbon
        powder to achieve a 40% by weight KNO.sub.3 content in the final
        material. The aqueous KNO.sub.3 solution can be slowly added to
        0.6 kg of 1%-Pd-on-300-mesh-graphitic carbon powder as the
        slurry can be mixed. The slurry can be then placed on an
        evaporation dish which can be inserted into an oven at
        150.degree. C. for one hour. Heating causes the water to
        evaporate from the slurry. The KNO.sub.3 coated

      <p>Example of a Ionic Hydrogen Spillover Catalytic Material: 40%
        by Weight Potassium Nitrate (KNO.sub.3) on Graphitic Carbon
        Powder with 5% by Weight 1%-Pd-on-Graphitic Carbon Powder </p>
      <p>To prepare one kilogram of the ionic hydrogen spillover
        catalytic material: 40% by weight potassium nitrate (KNO.sub.3)
        on graphitic carbon powder with 5% by weight 1%-Pd-on-graphitic
        carbon powder, 0.67 kg of KNO.sub.3 are dissolved in 1 liter of
        H.sub.2 O. Incipient wetness requires 1 ml of H.sub.2 O per gram
        of -300 mesh graphite powder, and 0.40 grams of KNO.sub.3 are
        required per gram of graphite powder to achieve a 40% by weight
        KNO.sub.3 content in the final material. The aqueous KNO.sub.3
        solution can be slowly added to 0.55 kg of graphite powder as
        the slurry can be mixed. The slurry can be then placed on an
        evaporation dish which can be inserted into an oven at
        150.degree. C. for one hour. Heating causes the water to
        evaporate from the slurry. The KNO.sub.3 coated graphite can be
        ground into a powder. The powder can be weighed. Approximately
        50 grams (5% of the weight of the KNO.sub.3 coated graphite) of
        1%-Pd-on--300-mesh graphitic carbon powder can be mixed into the
        KNO.sub.3 coated graphitic carbon powder. </p>
      <p><b>Example of the Mode of Operation of the Exemplary Catalytic
          Materials</b> </p>
      <p>The catalytic material can be placed into the pressurizable
        vessel 200. The vessel can be flushed with an inert gas such as
        He, Ar, or Ne to remove air contaminants in the vessel. The
        vessel and its contents are heated to the operational
        temperature, typically 100.degree. C. to 400.degree. C., before
        the vessel can be pressurized with hydrogen, typically 20 to 140
        PSIG. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment, the source of energy holes is potassium ions
        (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+) or rubidium ions (Rb.sup.+) intercalated into
        carbon. In another embodiment, the source of energy holes is an
        amalgam of the electrocatalytic ion or couple and its reduced
        metallic form such as rubidium ions (Rb.sup.+) and rubidium
        metal or potassium ions (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+) and potassium metal.
      </p>
      <p>In an embodiment, the source of hydrogen atoms is a hydrogen
        dissociation means including a hydrogen gas stream blown over a
        hot filament or grid such as a hot refractory metal including a
        filament or grid of Ti, Ni, Fe, W, Au, Pt, or Pd at an elevated
        temperature such as 1800.degree. C. The dissociation means
        provides hydrogen atoms as well as hydrogen ions, and the
        momentum of the atoms brings them in contact with the source of
        energy holes. Or, the hydrogen atoms and ions sputter onto the
        spillover catalyst. In one preferred embodiment of the
        pressurized gas reactor, a low pressure can be maintained by
        pressure regulator means 222 and a pump means 223 to minimize
        hydrogen atom recombination into molecular hydrogen and remove
        (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment the source of hydrogen atoms is water which
        dissociates to hydrogen atoms and oxygen on a water dissociation
        material such as an element, compound, alloy, or mixture of
        transition elements and inner transition elements, iron,
        platinum, palladium, zirconium, vanadium, nickel, titanium, Sc,
        Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, La, Hf, Ta,
        W, Re, Os, Ir, Au, Hg, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho,
        Er, Tm, Vb, Lu, Th, Pa, U, activated charcoal (carbon), and
        intercalated Cs carbon (graphite). In a further embodiment, the
        water dissociation material can be maintained at an elevated
        temperature by a heat source and temperature control means 230.
        In an embodiment including one comprising a hydrogen spillover
        catalyst, the source of hydrogen can be from hydrocarbons
        including natural gas which can be reformed on a reforming a
        material such as nickel, cobalt, iron, or a platinum-group metal
        to hydrogen atoms and carbon dioxide. In a further embodiment,
        the reforming material can be maintained at an elevated
        temperature by a heat source and a temperature control means
        230. In another embodiment, the source of hydrogen atoms can be
        from the decomposition of a metal hydride where the
        decomposition can be controlled by controlling the temperature
        of the metal hydride with the heat source and temperature
        control means 230. In another embodiment, the hydride can be
        coated by methods including electroplating with another material
        such as the hydrogen dissociation material. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment a product of the shrinkage reaction,
        (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen, can be removed to prevent
        product inhibition. Thus, the forward energy yielding reaction
        rate can be increased. One means to remove lower-energy
        (molecular) hydrogen is to supply the reaction mixture with a
        scavenger for lower-energy hydrogen. The scavenger absorbs or
        reacts with the product, lower-energy, hydrogen, and the
        resulting species can be removed from the reaction mixture. In
        another embodiment lower-energy hydrogen which is absorbed on
        the catalysts can be removed via displacement with an inert
        molecule or atom such as helium that flows through the vessel
        200. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features, and characteristics of the art of
        catalysis as well as the methods of preparation, operation and
        the functions of the related elements, as described by

        Industrial Practice, Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New
        York, (1991)] are applied to the present invention and are
        incorporated by reference herein. Application of the art of
        catalysis to the present invention of a pressurized gas energy
        reactor for the release of energy by the catalytic reaction
        wherein the electrons of hydrogen atoms undergo transitions to
        lower energy states include the use of an adiabatic reactor,
        fluidized-bed reactor, transport line reactor, multitube
        reactor, reverse multitube reactor having the heat exchange
        means including a fluid in the tubes and the catalytic material
        surrounding the tubes, and a multitube reactor or reverse
        multitube reactor comprising a fluidized bed of the catalytic
        material. Furthermore, in an embodiment comprising a solvated
        source of energy holes, a suspended hydrogen dissociation
        material including a hydrogen spillover catalyst, and hydrogen
        gas, the reactor comprises a trickle-bed reactor, a
        bubble-column reactor, or a slurry reactor. </p>
      <p>For example, in a preferred embodiment, the fluidized bed
        reactor 200 comprises the hydrogen spillover catalytic material:
        40% by weight potassium nitrate (KNO.sub.3) on graphitic carbon
        powder with 5% by weight 1%-Pd-on-graphitic carbon powder. The
        reacting hydrogen gas can be passed up through a bed of the
        finely divided solid catalytic material, preferably having a
        particle size in the range of about 20 to 100 .mu.m, which can
        be highly agitated and assumes many of the characteristics of a
        fluid. A cyclone separator 275 returns the fines to the bed. The
        hydrogen pressure and flow rate are controlled by pressure and
        flow rate control means 222. Preferably at atmospheric or
        slightly higher pressures, the corresponding maximum linear
        velocity can be less than 60 cm/s. </p>
      <p><b>Gaseous Source of Energy Holes</b> </p>
      <p>A preferred hydrogen gas energy reactor for the release of
        energy by an electrocatalytic and/or a disproportination
        reaction, wherein the electrons of hydrogen atoms undergo
        transitions to lower energy states in the gas phase, comprises a
        vessel 200 of FIG. 7 capable of containing a vacuum or pressures
        greater than atmospheric; a source of hydrogen 221; a means 222
        to control the pressure and flow of hydrogen into the vessel; a
        source of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase, and a source of
        energy holes in the gas phase. </p>
      <p>The reaction vessel 200 comprises a vacuum or pressure vessel
        comprised of a temperature resistance material such as ceramic,
        stainless steel, tungsten, alumina, Incoloy, and Inconel. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment, the source of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase
        is a hydrogen dissociation means including a hydrogen gas stream
        blown over a hot filament or grid 280 such as a hot refractory
        metal including a filament or grid of Ti, Ni, Fe, W, Au, Pt, or
        Pd at an elevated temperature such as 1800.degree. C. The
        dissociation means provides hydrogen atoms as well as hydrogen
        ions, and the momentum of the atoms brings them in contact with
        the source of energy holes. In a preferred embodiment of the
        gaseous-source-of-energy-holes gas reactor, a low pressure can
        be maintained by pressure regulator means 222 and a pressure
        measurement and pump means 223 to minimize hydrogen atom
        recombination into molecular hydrogen. The pressure can be
        measured by measuring the power dissipated in the hot filament
        or grid which can be operated at constant resistance by a servo
        loop 285 comprising a voltage and current measurement means, a
        power supply, and a voltage and current controller where the
        hydrogen pressure versus power dissipation of the filament or
        grid at the operating resistance has been calibrated. In another
        embodiment, the source of atomic hydrogen comprises one or more
        hydrogen dissociation materials which provide hydrogen atoms by
        dissociation of molecular hydrogen. Such hydrogen dissociation
        materials include surfaces or materials to dissociate hydrogen,
        deuterium, or tritium, including a hydrogen spillover material
        such as palladium or platinum on carbon and an element,
        compound, alloy, or mixture of transition elements and inner
        transition elements, iron, platinum, palladium, zirconium,

        activated charcoal (carbon), and intercalated Cs carbon
        (graphite). In one embodiment, nonequilibrium conditions of the
        hydrogen and hydride are maintained by controlling the
        temperature and hydrogen pressure to provide atomic hydrogen in
        the gas phase. In another embodiment, the source of atomic
        hydrogen comprises a tungsten capillary which on the outlet can
        be heated by electron bombardment to 1800-2000 K such as the
        atomic hydrogen source described by Bischler [Bischler, U.;
        Bertel, E., J. Vac. Sci. Technol., A. (1993), 11(2), 458-60]
        which is incorporated herein by reference. In a further
        embodiment, the tungsten capillary can be heated by the energy
        released by the hydrogen shrinkage reaction. In another
        embodiment, the source of atomic hydrogen comprises an
        inductively coupled plasma flow tube such as that described by
        Gardner [Gardner, W. L., J. Vac. Sci. Technol., A. (1995), 13(3,
        Pt. 1), 763-6] which is incorporated herein by reference, and
        the hydrogen dissociation fraction can be measured with the
        sensor of Gardner. </p>
      <p>The source of energy holes can be placed in a chemically
        resistant open container such as a ceramic boat 290 inside the
        reaction vessel. Or, the source of energy holes can be placed in
        a vessel which has a connection for the passage of the gaseous
        source of energy holes to the reaction vessel. </p>
      <p>The cell can have a boat or container, which is connected to

        boil, and/or are volatile at the elevated operating temperature
        of the gas energy reactor wherein the shrinkage reaction occurs
        in the gas phase. For example, RbNO.sub.3 and KNO.sub.3 are each
        volatile at a temperature much less than that at which each
        decomposes [C. J. Hardy, B. O. Field, J. Chem. Soc., (1963), pp.
        5130-5134]. In one embodiment, the ionic hydrogen spillover
        catalytic material: 40% by weight potassium or rubidium nitrate
        on graphitic carbon powder with 5% by weight 1%-Pd-on-graphitic
        carbon powder can be operated at a temperate at which the
        potassium or rubidium nitrate can be volatile. Further
        disproportionation reactions of the product, lower-energy
        hydrogen atoms, release additional heat energy. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the source of energy holes is a

        reduction and thermal decomposition and can be volatile at the
        operating temperature of the energy reactor. </p>
      <p>The catalyst may be an ionic compound which is resistant to
        hydrogen reduction. Moreover, the catalyst is adapted to provide
        gaseous atoms which may be ionized. </p>
      <p>The following compounds are preferred gaseous sources of energy
        holes in the gas energy reactor. Higher temperatures result in a
        higher vapor pressure of the source of energy holes which
        increases the reaction rate; however, the increase in total
        pressure increases the recombination rate of hydrogen atoms to
        hydrogen molecules. In each exemplary case that follows, the
        operating temperature of the energy reactor can be that which
        provides an optimal reaction rate. In an embodiment, the cell
        temperature can be about 50.degree. C. higher than the (highest)
        melting point of the source of energy holes (in the case that
        the source of energy holes comprises an electron transfer
        between two cations--an electrocatalytic couple). The hydrogen
        pressure can be maintained at about 200 millitorr, and molecular
        hydrogen can be dissociated with a hot filament or grid 280 of
        FIG. 7. </p>

      <p>In an embodiment wherein the anion can be reduced by hydrogen,
        the anion is chemically stabilized. For example, the product of
        the reduction is added to the gas cell to stabilize the anion.
        In a further embodiment, the anion can be replaced continuously
        or intermittently. In the case of the nitrate ion, the product
        ammonia can be removed from the vessel. oxidized to nitrate, and
        returned to the cell. In one embodiment, the product ammonia can
        be removed from the vessel by collection in a condenser and can
        be oxidized to nitrate on a platinum or iridium screen at
        elevated temperatures such as 912.degree. C. In a further
        embodiment, the nitrate ion to ammonia reaction can be minimized
        by decreasing the hydrogen pressure while optimizing the vapor
        phase catalytic hydrogen shrinkage reaction. In an embodiment, a
        low pressure of hydrogen atoms can be generated by dissociation
        of molecular hydrogen on a hot filament or grid 280 of FIG. 7. A
        low pressure of molecular hydrogen can be maintained via the
        hydrogen supply 221, the hydrogen flow control means 222, and
        the hydrogen pressure measurement and vacuum means 223. The
        hydrogen pressure can be maintained at a low pressure by
        adjusting the supply through the inlet with flow controller 222
        versus the amount pumped away at the outlet by the pressure
        measurement and pump means 223. The pressure can be adjusted to
        maximize the output power while minimizing the degradation of
        nitrate. The optimal hydrogen pressure can be less than about
        one torr. In an embodiment, the source of hydrogen atoms in the
        gas phase can be a hydrogen dissociation means including a
        hydrogen gas stream blown over a hot filament or grid 280 such
        as a hot refractory metal including a filament or grid of Ti,
        Ni, Fe, W, Au, Pt, or Pd at an elevated temperature such as
        1800.degree. C. The hydrogen molecular source can be directed
        over the filament or grid and onto the gaseous source of energy
        holes. The pressure and flow of the hydrogen atoms prohibits the
        collision of the counterion of the source of energy holes (such
        as the nitrate ion) from contacting the hot filament or grid.
        Thus, the thermal decomposition or reduction of the anion on the
        filament or grid can be prevented. In another embodiment, a
        negative potential can be maintained as a grid electrode 287
        surrounding the filament or grid. The grid electrode permits the
        passage of hydrogen atoms from the filament or grid and repels
        the anion from contacting the hot filament or grid. Thus, the
        thermal or chemical breakdown of the anion (couterion) can be
        prevented. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment, the source of energy holes is an
        electrocatalytic ion or electrocatalytic couple comprising
        cation-anion pairs in the gas phase wherein the cation-anion
        pairs are dissociated by external source means 75 of FIG. 5
        which includes, for example, a particle source 75b and/or photon
        source 75a and/or a source of heat, acoustic energy, electric
        fields, or magnetic fields. In a preferred embodiment, the
        cation-anion pairs are thermally dissociated by heat source 230
        or photodissociated by photon source 205 of FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the gas energy reactor having a
        gaseous source of energy holes, the source of energy holes is
        atomized with an atomizer means 295 to provide a gaseous source
        of energy holes. In a preferred embodiment of the atomizer,
        atoms are boiled, sublimed, or vaporized by a heating means such
        as the boat heating means 299, and the gaseous atoms are ionized
        to form a source of energy holes including the electrocatalytic
        ions or electrocatalytic couples of my previous patent
        applications incorporated herein by reference. In one
        embodiment, the atoms are thermally ionized by the heating means
        230, by the hydrogen atom source 280 including a hot filament or
        grid, or by an inductively coupled plasma flow tube. For
        example, the gas energy cell shown in FIG. 7 comprises rubidium
        or potassium metal in the boat 290 which has a vapor pressure
        that can be controlled by controlling the temperature of the
        boat by heating means 230 and or 299. Hydrogen molecules are
        dissociated to atoms on the hot filament or grid 280. The
        rubidium (potassium) metal in the gas phase can be ionized to
        Rb.sup.+ (K.sup.+) by the same or different hot filament or grid
        280. The Rb.sup.+ (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+) electrocatalytic ion
        (couple) serves as a source of energy holes to shrink the
        hydrogen atoms. In another embodiment, the hot filament or grid
        280 comprises a metal(s) or can be electroplated with a metal(s)
        which boils off as a cation(s) that are a source of energy
        holes. For example, Mo.sup.2+ ions (Mo.sup.2+ electrocatalytic
        ion) enter the gas phase of the energy cell 200 from the hot
        molybdenum filament or grid 280. The hot molybdenum filament or
        grid 280 also dissociates hydrogen molecules to hydrogen atoms.
        For a further example, Ni.sup.2+ and Cu.sup.+ ions (Ni.sup.2+
        /Cu.sup.+ electrocatalytic couple) enter the gas phase of the
        energy cell 200 from the hot nickel and hot copper or hot
        nickel-copper alloy filament or grid 280. In another embodiment,
        the photon source 75a and the particle source 75b of FIG. 5,
        including an electron beam, ionize species such as atoms in the
        gas phase to form the source of energy holes including the
        electrocatalytic ions or electrocatalytic couples of my previous
        patent applications incorporated herein by reference. In another
        embodiment, the atoms or ions are ionized chemically by a
        volatilized reactant such as an ionic species which oxidizes or
        reduces the atoms or ions to form a source of energy holes. </p>
      <p>The power of the gas energy reactor can be controlled by
        controlling the amount of the source of energy holes
        (electrocatalytic ion or couple) in the gas phase and/or by
        controlling the concentration of atomic or lower-energy
        hydrogen. The concentration of the gaseous source of energy
        holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) can be controlled by
        controlling the initial amount of the volatile source of energy
        holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) present in the reactor,
        and/or by controlling the temperature of the reactor with
        temperature control means 230 which determines the vapor
        pressure of the volatile source of energy holes
        (electrocatalytic ion or couple). The reactor temperature
        further controls the power by changing the rate of the catalytic
        hydrogen shrinkage reaction. The concentration of atomic
        hydrogen can be controlled by controlling the amount of atomic
        hydrogen provided by the atomic hydrogen source 280. For
        example, the amount of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase can be
        controlled by controlling the flow of hydrogen over or through
        the hot filament or grid, the tungsten capillary heated by
        electron bombardment, or the inductively coupled plasma flow
        tube; by controlling the power dissipated in the inductively
        coupled plasma flow tube; by controlling the temperature of the
        hot filament or grid, or the tungsten capillary heated by
        electron bombardment; by controlling the pressure of the
        hydrogen and temperature of the hydride maintained under
        nonequilibrium conditions, and by controlling the rate of
        removal of recombined hydrogen from the cell by pump means 223.
        Another means to control the shrinkage reaction rate can be by
        controlling the pressure of a non reactive gas with non reactive
        gas source 299, non reactive gas flow control means 232, and
        pressure measurement and pump means 223. The non reactive gas
        such as a noble gas competes with collisions between the source
        of energy holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) and hydrogen
        atoms or competes with collisions that yield lower-energy
        hydrogen disproportionation reactions. Noble gases include He,
        Ne, and Ar. Further such reaction non reactive "reaction
        quenching" gases include carbon dioxide and nitrogen. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen partial pressure can be further controlled by
        throttling hydrogen into the cell by a hydrogen value control
        means 222 while monitoring the pressure with a pressure
        measurement means 222 and 223. In a preferred embodiment, the
        hydrogen pressure can be controlled by controlling the
        temperature with heating means 230 of the gas energy reactor
        which further comprises a hydrogen storage means such as a metal
        hydride or other hydride including saline hydrides, titanium
        hydride, vanadium, niobium, and tantalum hydrides, zirconium and
        hafnium hydrides, rare earth hydrides, yttrium and scandium
        hydrides, transition element hydrides, intermetalic hydrides,
        and their alloys known in the art as given by W. M. Mueller, J.
        P. Blackledge, and G. G. Libowitz, Metal Hydrides, Academic
        Press, New York, (1968), Hydrogen in Intermetalic Compounds I,
        Edited by L. Schlapbach, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, and Hydrogen
        in Intermetalic Compounds II, Edited by L. Schlapbach,
        Springer-Verlag, Berlin, which are incorporated by reference
        herein. The temperature of the cell can be controlled by a
        temperature control and measurement means 230 such that the
        vapor pressure of the hydrogen in equilibrium with the hydrogen
        storage material can be the desired pressure. In one embodiment,
        nonequilibrium conditions of the hydrogen and hydride are
        maintained by controlling the temperature and hydrogen pressure
        to provide atomic hydrogen. In several embodiments, the hydrogen
        storage means can be a rare earth hydride with an operating
        temperature of about 800.degree. C.; lanthanum hydride with an
        operating temperature of about 700.degree. C.; gadolinium
        hydride with an operating temperature of about 750.degree. C.;
        neodymium hydride with an operating temperature of about
        750.degree. C.; yttrium hydride with an operating temperature of
        about 800.degree. C.; scandium hydride with an operating
        temperature of about 800.degree. C.; ytterbium hydride with an
        operating temperature of about 850-900.degree. C.; titanium
        hydride with an operating temperature of about 450.degree. C.;
        cerium hydride with an operating temperature of about
        950.degree. C.; praseodymium hydride with an operating
        temperature of about 700.degree. C.; zirconium-titanium
        (50%/50%) hydride with an operating temperature of about
        600.degree. C.; an alkali metal/alkali metal hydride mixture
        such as Rb/RbH or K/KH with an operating temperature of about
        450.degree. C., and an alkaline earth metal/alkaline earth
        hydride mixture such as Ba/BaH.sub.2 with an operating
        temperature of about 900-1000.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The heat output can be monitored with thermocouples present in
        at least the vessel 200 and the heat exchanger 60 of FIG. 5. The
        rate of the shrinkage reaction rate can be monitored by
        ultraviolet or electron spectroscopy of the photons or electrons
        emitted via lower-energy hydrogen transitions, by X-ray
        photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of lower-energy hydrogen, and
        by mass spectroscopy, Raman or infrared spectroscopy, and gas
        chromatography of the molecular lower-energy hydrogen
        (dihydrino). Lower-energy hydrogen atoms and molecules are
        identified by XPS as higher binding energy species than normal
        hydrogen. The dihydrino can be identified by mass spectroscopy
        as a species with a mass to charge ratio of two (m/e=2) that has
        a higher ionization potential than that of normal hydrogen by
        recording the ion current as a function of the electron gun
        energy. The dihydrino can be identified by gas chromatography at
        low temperature such as gas chromatography with an activated
        carbon (charcoal) column at liquid nitrogen temperature or with
        a column that will separate para from ortho hydrogen such as an
        Rt-Alumina column, or a HayeSep column at liquid nitrogen
        temperature wherein normal hydrogen can be retained to a greater
        extent than dihydrino. The dihydrino can be identified by Raman
        and infrared spectroscopy as a molecule with higher vibrational
        and rotational energy levels as compared to those of normal
        hydrogen. The output power can be controlled by a computerized
        monitoring and control system which monitors the thermistors,
        spectrometers, and gas chromatograph and controls the means to
        alter the power output. The (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen
        can be removed by a means 201 to prevent the exothermic
        shrinkage reaction from coming to equilibrium. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the gas energy reactor having a
        gaseous source of energy holes, hydrogen atoms are produced by a
        pyrolysis reaction such as the combustion of a hydrocarbon
        wherein the catalytic source of energy holes can be in the gas
        phase with the hydrogen atoms. In a preferred mode, the
        pyrolysis reaction occurs in an internal combustion engine
        whereby the hydrocarbon or hydrogen containing fuel comprises a
        source of energy holes that are vaporized (become gaseous)
        during the combustion. In a preferred mode, the source of energy
        holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) is a thermally stable
        salt of rubidium or potassium such as RbF, RbCl, RbBr, RbI,
        Rb.sub.2 S.sub.2, RbOH, Rb.sub.2 SO.sub.4, Rb.sub.2 CO.sub.3,
        Rb.sub.3 PO.sub.4, and KF, KCl, KBr, KI, K.sub.2 S.sub.2, KOH,
        K.sub.2 SO.sub.4, K.sub.2 CO.sub.3, K.sub.3 PO.sub.4, K.sub.2
        GeF.sub.4. Additional counterions of the electrocatalytic ion or
        couple include organic anions including wetting or emulsifying
        agents. In another embodiment, the hydrocarbon or hydrogen
        containing fuel further comprises water as a mixture and a
        solvated source of energy holes including emulsified
        electrocatalytic ions or couples. During the pyrolysis reaction,
        water serves as a further source of hydrogen atoms which undergo
        a shrinkage reaction catalyzed by the source of energy holes
        wherein the water can be dissociated to hydrogen atoms thermally
        or catalytically on a surface such as the cylinder or piston
        head which can be comprised of material which dissociates water
        to hydrogen and oxygen. The water dissociation material includes
        an element, compound, alloy, or mixture of transition elements
        and inner transition elements, iron, platinum, palladium,
        zirconium, vanadium, nickel, titanium, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn,
        Y, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, La, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Au,

      <p>Less efficient catalytic systems hinge on the coupling of three
        resonator cavities. For example, an electron transfer occurs
        between two cations which comprises an energy hole for a
        hydrogen or hydrino atom. The reaction rate is dependent on the
        collision rate between catalytic cations and hydrogen or hydrino
        atoms and the efficiency of resonant energy transfer with a
        concomitant electron transfer with each shrinkage reaction. The

        volume, ##EQU108## the volume, V, and the efficiency, E.sub.e,
        of resonant energy transfer given by Eq. (6.37) where r is given

        ##EQU109## The power, P.sub.m,p, is given by the product of the
        rate of the transition, Eq. (6.51), and the energy of the
        transition, Eq. (5.8). ##EQU110## A catalytic system that hinges
        on the coupling of three resonator cavities involves potassium.
        For example, the second ionization energy of potassium is 31.63
        eV. This energy hole is obviously too high for resonant
        absorption. However, K.sup.+ releases 4.34 eV when it is reduced
        to K. The combination of K.sup.+ to K.sup.2+ and K.sup.+ to K,
        then, has a net energy change of 27.28 eV. Consider the case of
        a gas phase catalytic shrinkage reaction of hydrogen or hydrino
        atoms by potassium ions as the electrocatalytic couple having an
        energy hole of 27.28 eV. The energy transfer efficiency is given

      <p>A gas discharge energy reactor comprises a hydrogen isotope gas
        filled glow discharge vacuum chamber 300 of FIG. 8 including an
        ozonizer-type capacitor, a hydrogen source 322 which supplies
        hydrogen to the chamber 300 through control valve 325, and a

        shrinking hydrogen atoms is a palladium cathode whereby a
        resonant energy hole can be provided by the ionization of
        electrons from palladium to the discharge current. A second
        preferred cathode 305 for shrinking hydrogen atoms comprises a
        source of energy holes via electron transfer to the discharge
        current including at least one of beryllium, copper, platinum,
        zinc, and tellurium and a hydrogen dissociating means such as a
        source of electromagnetic radiation including UV light provided
        by photon source 350 or a hydrogen dissociating material
        including the transition elements and inner transition elements,
        iron, platinum, palladium, zirconium, vanadium, nickel,
        titanium, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd,

        Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Vb, Lu, Th, Pa, U, activated charcoal
        (carbon), and intercalated Cs carbon (graphite). The reactor
        further comprises a means to control the energy dissipated in
        the discharge current when electrons are transferred from an
        electron donating species to provide an energy hole for hydrogen
        atoms (molecules) including pressure controller means 325 and
        current (voltage) source 330. The gas discharge energy reactor
        further comprises a means 301 to remove the (molecular)
        lower-energy hydrogen such as a selective venting valve to
        prevent the exothermic shrinkage reaction from coming to
        equilibrium. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the gas discharge energy reactor, the
        source of energy hole can be one of a inelastic photon or
        particle scattering reaction(s). In a preferred embodiment the
        photon source 350 supplies the energy holes where the energy
        hole corresponds to stimulated emission by the photon. In the
        case of a reactor which shrinks hydrogen atoms, the photon
        source 350 dissociates hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms.
        The photon source producing photons of at least one energy of
        approximately mX27.21 eV, ##EQU112## or 40.8 eV causes
        stimulated emission of energy as the hydrogen atoms undergo the
        shrinkage reaction. In another preferred embodiment, a photon
        source 350 producing photons of at least one energy of
        approximately mX48.6 eV, 95.7 eV, or mX31.94 eV causes
        stimulated emission of energy as the hydrogen molecules undergo
        the shrinkage reaction. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, a magnetic field can be applied by
        magnetic field generator 75 of FIG. 5 to produce a magnetized
        plasma of the gaseous ions which can be a nonlinear media.
        Coupling of resonator cavities and enhancement of the transfer
        of energy between them can be increased when the media is
        nonlinear. Thus, the reaction rate (transfer of the resonance
        shrinkage energy of the hydrogen atoms to the energy holes, the
        electrocatalytic ions or couples) can be increased and
        controlled by providing and adjusting the applied magnetic field
        strength. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the method of operation of the gas
        discharge energy reactor, hydrogen from source 322 can be
        introduced inside of the chamber 300 through control valve 325.
        A current source 330 causes current to pass between a cathode
        305 and an anode 320. The hydrogen contacts the cathode which
        comprises a source of energy holes of approximately mX27.21 eV
        to cause atomic hydrogen "shrinkage" and approximately mX48.6 eV
        to cause molecular hydrogen "shrinkage" where m is an integer.
        In a preferred embodiment, electrons are transferred from an
        electron donating species present on the cathode 305 to the
        discharge current to provide energy holes for hydrogen atoms
        (molecules). In the case of a reactor which shrinks hydrogen
        atoms, the molecular hydrogen can be dissociated into atomic
        hydrogen by a dissociating material on the cathode 305 or by a
        source of electromagnetic radiation including UV light provided
        by photon source 350 such that the dissociated hydrogen atoms
        contact a source of energy holes including a molten, liquid,
        gaseous, or solid source of the energy holes. The atomic
        (molecular) hydrogen releases energy as its electrons are
        stimulated to undergo transitions to lower energy levels by the
        energy holes. The energy dissipated in the discharge current
        when electrons are transferred from an electron donating species
        can be controlled to provide an energy hole equal to the
        resonance shrinkage energy for hydrogen atoms (molecules) by
        controlling the gas pressure from source 322 with pressure
        controller means 325 and the voltage with the current (voltage)
        source 330. The heat output can be monitored with thermocouples
        present in at least the cathode 305, the anode 320, and the heat
        exchanger 60 of FIG. 5. The output power can be controlled by a
        computerized monitoring and control system which monitors the
        thermistors and controls the means to alter the power output.
        The (molecular) lower-energy hydrogen can be removed by a means
        301 to prevent the exothermic shrinkage reaction from coming to
        equilibrium. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the gas discharge energy reactor, a
        preferred cathode 305 comprises the catalytic material including
        a spillover catalyst described in the Pressurized Gas Energy
        Reactor Section. </p>
      <p>Another embodiment of the gas discharge energy reactor
        comprises a gaseous source of energy holes wherein the shrinkage
        reaction occurs in the gas phase, and the gaseous hydrogen atoms
        are provided by a discharge of molecular hydrogen gas. In a
        further embodiment the gaseous source of energy holes can be
        provided by a discharge current which produces the gaseous
        source of energy holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) such as
        a discharge in potassium metal to form K.sup.+ /K.sup.+,
        rubidium metal to form Rb.sup.+, or titanium metal to form
        Ti.sup.2+. The embodiment comprises a hydrogen isotope gas
        filled glow discharge chamber 300. The glow discharge cell can
        be operated at an elevated temperature such this the source of
        energy holes (electrocatalytic ion or couple) can be sublimed,
        boiled, or volatilized into the gas phase. In an embodiment, the
        counterion of the source of energy holes (electrocatalytic ion
        or couple) can be the hydride anion (H.sup.-) such as rubidium
        hydride (Rb.sup.+ electrocatalytic ion) and/or potassium hydride
        (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic couple). </p>
      <p>In an embodiment, the source of energy holes can be an
        electrocatalytic ion or electrocatalytic couple comprising
        cation-anion pairs in the gas phase wherein the cation-anion
        pairs are dissociated by external source means 75 of FIG. 5
        which includes, for example, a particle source 75b and/or photon
        source 75a and/or a source of heat, acoustic energy, electric
        fields, or magnetic fields. In a preferred embodiment, the
        cation-anion pairs are thermally dissociated by heat source 75
        of FIG. 5 or photodissociated by photon source 350 of FIG. 8. </p>
      <p><b>Refrigeration Means</b> </p>
      <p>A further embodiment of the present invention comprises a
        refrigeration means which comprises the electrolytic cell of
        FIG. 6, the pressurized hydrogen gas cell of FIG. 7, and the
        hydrogen gas discharge cell of FIG. 8 of the present invention
        wherein a source of lower-energy atomic (molecular) hydrogen is
        supplied rather than a source of normal hydrogen. The
        lower-energy hydrogen atoms are reacted to a higher energy state
        with the absorption of heat energy according to the reverse of
        the catalytic shrinkage reaction such as those given by Eqs.
        (4-6); (7-9); (10-12); (13-15); (16-18); (48-50); (51-53);
        (54-56); (57-59); (60-62), (63-65), (66-68), (69-71), (72-74),
        and (75-77). The lower-energy hydrogen molecules are reacted to
        a higher energy state with the absorption of heat energy
        according to the reverse of the catalytic shrinkage reaction
        such as that given by Eqs. (78-80); (81-83); (84-86); (88-90),
        and (91-93). In this embodiment, means 101, 201 and 301 of FIGS.
        6, 7, and 8, respectively, serve to remove the normal hydrogen
        such as a selective venting valves to prevent the endothermic
        reaction from coming to equilibrium. </p>
      <p>Compositions of Matter Comprising at Least Lower-Energy
        Hydrogen Atom(s) and/or Lower-energy Hydrogen Molecule(s) </p>
      <p>The present invention further comprises molecules containing
        lower-energy hydrogen atoms. Lower-energy hydrogen can be
        reacted with any atom of the periodic chart or known organic or
        inorganic molecule or compound or metal, nonmetal, or
        semiconductor to form an organic or inorganic molecule or
        compound or metal, nonmetal, or semiconductor containing
        lower-energy hydrogen atoms and molecules. The reactants with
        lower-energy hydrogen include neutral atoms, negatively or
        positively charged atomic and molecular ions, and free radicals.
        For example, lower-energy hydrogen can be reacted with water or
        oxygen to form a molecule containing lower-energy hydrogen and
        oxygen, and lower-energy hydrogen can be reacted with singly
        ionized helium to form a molecule containing helium and
        lower-energy hydrogen. Lower-energy hydrogen can be also reacted
        with metals. In one embodiment of the electrolytic cell energy
        reactor, lower-energy hydrogen produced during operation at the
        cathode can be incorporated into the cathode by reacting with
        it; thus, a metal-lower-energy hydrogen material can be
        produced. In all such reactions, the reaction rate and product
        yield are increased by applying heat, and/or pressure. </p>
      <p>Lower-energy hydrogen molecules (dihydrinos) are purified from
        hydrogen gas by combustion of the normal hydrogen. Oxygen can be
        mixed with the sample to be purified, and the sample can be
        ignited. In a second embodiment of the method of dihydrino
        purification, the sample can be flowed over a hydrogen
        recombiner which reacts with the normal hydrogen in the gas
        stream to form water. In a third embodiment, lower-energy
        hydrogen molecules (dihydrinos) are collected in a cathode of an
        electrolytic energy reactor of the present invention such as a
        metal cathode including a nickel cathode or a carbon cathode.
        The cathode can be heated in a vessel to a first temperature
        which causes normal hydrogen to preferentially off gas by
        external heating or by flowing a current through the cathode.
        The normal hydrogen can be pumped off, then the cathode can be
        heated to a second higher temperature at which dihydrino gas can
        be released and collected. In a fourth embodiment, the gas
        sample is purified by cryofiltration including gas
        chromatography at low temperature such as gas chromatography
        with an activated carbon (charcoal) column at liquid nitrogen
        temperature and with a column which will separate para from
        ortho hydrogen such as an Rt-Alumina column, or a HayeSep column
        at liquid nitrogen temperature wherein normal hydrogen can be
        retained to a greater extent than dihydrino. In a fifth
        embodiment, the gas sample is purified by cryodistillation
        wherein normal hydrogen can be liquefied and separated from
        gaseous lower-energy hydrogen (dihydrino). The dihydrino can be
        concentrated by liquefaction in liquid helium. </p>

      <p><b>In Summary</b> </p>
      <p>The complete theory which predicts fractional quantum energy
        levels of hydrogen and the exothermic reaction whereby
        lower-energy hydrogen is produced is given elsewhere [Mills, R.,
        The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics, (1995),
        Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa., provided by
        HydroCatalysis Power Corporation, Great Valley Corporate Center,

        Unification of Spacetime, the Forces, Matter, and Energy
        (Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, Pa., 1992)]. </p>
      <p>Excess power and heat were observed during the electrolysis of
        aqueous potassium carbonate. Flow calorimetry of pulsed current
        electrolysis of aqueous potassium carbonate at a nickel cathode
        was performed in a single-cell dewar. The average power out of
        24.6 watts exceeded the average input power (voltage times
        current) of 4.73 watts by a factor greater than 5. The total
        input energy (integration of voltage times current) over the
        entire duration of the experiment was 5.72 MJ; whereas, the
        total output energy was 29.8 MJ. No excess heat was observed
        when the electrolyte was changed from potassium carbonate to
        sodium carbonate. The source of heat is assigned to the
        electrocatalytic, exothermic reaction whereby the electrons of
        hydrogen atoms are induced to undergo transitions to quantized
        energy levels below the conventional "ground state". These lower
        energy states correspond to fractional quantum numbers: n=1/2,
        1/3, 1/4, . . . . Transitions to these lower energy states are
        stimulated in the presence of pairs of potassium ions (K.sup.+
        /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic couple) which provide 27.2 eV energy
        sinks. </p>
      <p>The identification of the n=1/2 hydrogen atom , H(n=1/2) is
        reported. Samples of the nickel cathodes of aqueous potassium
        carbonate electrolytic cells and aqueous sodium carbonate
        electrolytic cells were analyzed by XPS. A broad peak centered
        at 54.6 eV was present only in the cases of the potassium
        carbonate cells. The binding energy (in vacuum) of H(n=1/2) is
        54.4 eV. Thus, the theoretical and measured binding energies for
        H(n=1/2) are in excellent agreement. </p>
      <p>Further experimental identification of hydrinos--down to
        H(n=1/8)--can be found in the alternative explanation by Mills
        et al. for the soft X-ray emissions of the dark interstellar
        medium observed by Labov and Bowyer [S. Labov and S. Bowyer,
        Astrophysical Journal, 371 (1991) 810] of the Extreme UV Center
        of the University of California, Berkeley. The agreement between
        the experimental spectrum and the energy values predicted for
        the proposed transitions is remarkable. </p>
      <p>The reaction product of two H(n=1/2) atoms, the dihydrino
        molecule, was identified by mass spectroscopy (Shrader
        Analytical &amp; Consulting Laboratories). The mass spectrum of
        the cryofiltered gases evolved during the electrolysis of a
        light water K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 electrolyte with a nickel cathode
        demonstrated that the dihydrino molecule, H.sub.2 (n=1/2), has a
        higher ionization energy, about 63 eV, than normal molecular
        hydrogen, H.sub.2 (n=1), 15.46 eV. The high resolution (0.001
        AMU) magnetic sector mass spectroscopic analysis of the
        postcombustion gases indicated the presence of two peaks of
        nominal mass two at 70 eV and one peak at 25 eV. The same
        analysis of molecular hydrogen indicates only one peak at 25 eV
        and one peak at 70 eV. In the case of the postcombustion sample
        at 70 eV, one peak was assigned as the hydrogen molecular ion
        peak, H.sub.2.sup.+ (n=1), and one peak was assigned as the
        dihydrino molecular peak, H.sub.2.sup.+ (n=1/2) which has a
        slightly larger magnetic moment. </p>

      <p>In the January 1994 edition of Fusion Technology, [Mills, R.,
        Good, W., Shaubach, R., "Dihydrino Molecule Identification",
        Fusion Technology, 25, 103 (1994)] Mills et al. review and
        present three sets of data of heat production and "ash"
        identification including the work of HydroCatalysis Power

        (Experiments #4-#14). </p>
      <p><b>In Summary</b> </p>
      <p>Mills et al. report the experimental evidence supporting the
        Mills theory that an exothermic reaction occurs wherein the
        electrons of hydrogen atoms and deuterium atoms are stimulated
        to relax to quantized potential energy levels below that of the
        "ground state" via electrochemical reactants K.sup.+ and K.sup.+
        ; Pd.sup.2+ and Li.sup.+, or Pd and O.sub.2 of redox energy
        resonant with the energy hole which stimulates this transition.
        Calorimetry of pulsed current and continuous electrolysis of
        aqueous potassium carbonate (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic
        couple) at a nickel cathode was performed. The excess power out
        of 41 watts exceeded the total input power given by the product
        of the electrolysis voltage and current by a factor greater than
        8. The "ash" of the exothermic reaction is atoms having
        electrons of energy below the "ground state" which are predicted
        to form molecules. The predicted molecules were identified by
        lack of reactivity with oxygen, by separation from molecular
        deuterium by cryofiltration, and by mass spectroscopic analysis.
      </p>
      <p>The combustion of the gases evolved during the electrolysis of
        a light water K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 electrolyte (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+
        electrocatalytic couple) with a nickel cathode was incomplete.
        The mass spectroscopic analysis (Air Products &amp; Chemicals,
        Inc.) of uncombusted gases demonstrated that the species
        predominantly giving rise to the m/e=2 peak must have a
        different m/e=1 to m/e=2 production efficiency than hydrogen.
        And, the further mass spectroscopic analysis of the m/e=2 peak
        of the uncombusted gas demonstrated that the dihydrino molecule,
        H.sub.2 (n=1/2), has a higher ionization energy than H.sub.2. </p>
      <p>According to the analysis by Mills et al. of the raw data,
        Miles of the China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons
        Division observed the dideutrino molecule as a species with a
        mass to charge ratio of four and having a higher ionization
        potential than normal molecular deuterium. Miles was using mass
        spectroscopy to analyze the cryofiltered gases evolved from
        excess power producing electrolysis cells (palladium cathode and
        a LiOD/D.sub.2 O electrolyte; an electrocatalytic couple of
        27.54 eV). [B. F. BUSH, J. J. LAGOWSKI, M. H. MILES, and G. S.

      <p>Pennsylvania State University has determined excess heat
        release from flowing hydrogen in the presence of nickel oxide
        powder containing strontium niobium oxide (Nb.sup.3+ /Sr.sup.2+
        electrocatalytic couple) by the very accurate and reliable
        method of heat measurement, thermopile conversion of heat into
        an electrical output signal [Phillips, J., "A Calorimetric
        Investigation of the Reaction of Hydrogen with Sample PSU #1",
        Sep. 11, 1994, A Confidential Report submitted to HydroCatalysis
        Power Corporation provided by HydroCatalysis Power Corporation,
        Great Valley Corporate Center, 41 Great Valley Parkway, Malvern,
        Pa. 19355]. Excess power and heat were observed with flowing
        hydrogen over the catalyst which increased with increasing flow
        rate. However, no excess power was observed with flowing helium
        over the catalyst/nickel oxide mixture or flowing hydrogen over
        nickel oxide alone. As shown in FIG. 9, approximately 10 cc of
        nickel oxide powder containing strontium niobium oxide
        immediately produced 0.55 W of steady state output power at
        523.degree. K. When the gas was switched from hydrogen to
        helium, the power immediately dropped. The switch back to
        hydrogen restored the excess power output which continued to
        increase until the hydrogen source cylinder emptied at about the
        40,000 second time point. With no hydrogen flow the output power
        fell to zero. </p>
      <p>The source of heat is assigned to the electrocatalytic,
        exothermic reaction whereby the electrons of hydrogen atoms are
        induced to undergo transitions to quantized energy levels below
        the conventional "ground state". These lower energy states
        correspond to fractional quantum numbers: n=1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . .
        . Transitions to these lower energy states are stimulated in the
        presence of pairs of niobium and strontium ions (Nb.sup.3+
        /Sr.sup.2+ electrocatalytic couple) which provide 27.2 eV energy
        sinks. </p>

        energies obtained by COBE for which no other satisfactory
        assignment exists. </p>
      <p><b>In Summary</b> </p>
      <p>As shown in Table 1 Mills [Mills, R., The Grand Unified Theory
        of Classical Quantum Mechanics, (1995), Technomic Publishing
        Company, Lancaster, Pa.], hydrogen transitions to electronic
        energy levels below the "ground" state corresponding to
        fractional quantum numbers predicted by Mills' theory match the
        spectral lines of the extreme ultraviolet background of
        interstellar space. And, hydrogen disproportionation reactions
        yield ionized hydrogen, energetic electrons, and hydrogen
        ionizing radiation. This assignment resolves the paradox of the
        identity of dark matter and accounts for many celestial
        observations such as: diffuse H.alpha. emission is ubiquitous
        throughout the Galaxy, and widespread sources of flux shortward
        of 912 .ANG. are required [Labov, S., Bowyer, S., "Spectral
        observations of the extreme ultraviolet background", The
        Astrophysical Journal, 371, (1991), pp. 810-819]. </p>
      <p>Further experimental identification of hydrinos-down to
        H(n=1/8)--can be found in the alternative explanation by Mills
        for the soft X-ray emissions of the dark interstellar medium
        observed by Labov and Bowyer [S. Labov and S. Bowyer,
        Astrophysical Journal, 371 (1991) 810] of the Extreme UV Center
        of the University of California, Berkeley. The agreement between
        the experimental spectrum and the energy values predicted for
        the proposed transitions is remarkable. </p>
      <p>The paradox of the paucity of solar neutrinos to account for
        the solar energy output by the pp chain is resolved by assigning
        a major portion of the solar output to lower-energy hydrogen
        transitions. The photosphere of the Sun is 6000 K; whereas, the
        temperature of the corona based on the assignment of the emitted
        X-rays to highly ionized heavy elements is in excess of 10.sup.6
        K. No satisfactory power transfer mechanism is known which
        explains the excessive temperature of the corona relative to
        that of the photosphere. The paradox is resolved by the
        existence of a power source associated with the corona. The
        energy which maintains the corona at a temperature in excess of
        10.sup.6 K is that released by disproportionation reactions of
        lower-energy hydrogen as given by Eqs. (13-15). In Table 2 of
        Mills, the energy released by the transition of the hydrino atom
        with the initial lower-energy state quantum number p and radius
        ##EQU113## to the state with lower-energy state quantum number
        (p+m) and radius ##EQU114## catalyzed by a hydrino atom with the
        initial lower-energy state quantum number m', initial radius
        ##EQU115## and final radius a.sub.H are given in consecutive
        order of energy from the 1.fwdarw.1/2 H transition to the
        1/9.fwdarw.1/10 H transition. The agreement between the
        calculated and the experimental values is remarkable.
        Furthermore, many of the lines of Table 2 had no previous
        assignment, or the assignment was unsatisfactory [Thomas, R. J.,
        Neupert. W., M., Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, Vol.
        91, (1994), pp. 461-482; Malinovsky, M., Heroux, L.,

        University Press, Cambridge, Great Britain, (1992), pp. 118-119;
        120-121; 144-145]. The calculated power of 4.times.10.sup.26 W
        matches the observed power output of 4.times.10.sup.26 W. </p>
      <p>The broadening of the solar HI911.8 .ANG. line (911.8 .ANG. to
        .apprxeq.600 .ANG.) is six times that predicted based on the
        thermal electron energy at the surface of the photosphere
        (T=6,000 K) where the HI 911.8 .ANG. continuum originates, and
        based on the relative width of the helium continuum lines, He I
        504.3 .ANG. (He I 504.3 .ANG. to .apprxeq.530 .ANG.) and He II
        227.9 .ANG. (He II 227.9 .ANG. to .apprxeq.225 .ANG.) [Thomas,
        R. J., Neupert, W., M., Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series,
        Vol. 91, (1994), pp. 461-482; Stix, M., The Sun,
        Springer-Verlag, Berlin, (1991), pp. 351-356; Malinovsky, M.,
        Heroux, L.. Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 181, (1973), pp.
        1009-1030; Noyes, R., The Sun, Our Star, Harvard University
        Press, Cambridge, Ma., (1982), p. 172; Phillips, J. H., Guide to
        the Sun, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Great Britain,
        (1992), pp. 118-119; 120-121; 144-145]. The latter lines are
        proportionally much narrower; yet, the corresponding
        temperatures of origin must be higher because the transitions
        are more energetic. Furthermore, the H 911.8 .ANG. continuum
        line of the spectrum of a prominence is about one half the width
        of the same line of the quiet Sun spectrum. Yet, the temperature
        rises to greater than 10,000 K in a prominence. The problem of
        the anomalous spectral feature of the excessive broadening of
        the continuum line of hydrogen to higher energies can be
        resolved by assignment of the broadening mechanism to energetic
        disproportionation reactions involving hydrogen atoms as
        reactants. </p>
      <p>The reaction product, lower-energy hydrogen, can be reionized
        as it is diffuses towards the center of the Sun. The abrupt
        change in the speed of sound and transition from "radiation
        zone" to "convection zone" at a radius of 0.7 the solar radius,
        0.7 R.sub.s, with a temperature of 2.times.10.sup.6 K matches
        the ionization temperature of lower-energy hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Another spectroscopic mystery concerns an infrared absorption
        band of the chromosphere at a wavelength of 4.7 .mu.m which was
        previously assigned to carbon monoxide despite the
        implausibility of its existence in the observed region which has
        a temperature above that at which carbon monoxide would break up
        into its constituent carbon and oxygen atoms. This problem can
        be resolved by assignment of the broad 4.7 .mu.m feature to a
        temperature broadened rotational transition of a molecular ion
        of lower-energy hydrogen. The assignment of the 4.7 .mu.m
        absorption line to the J=0 to J=1 transition rotational
        transition of H.sub.2.sup.* [2c'=3a.sub.o ].sup.+ provides a
        resolution of the problem of cool carbon monoxide clouds. </p>
      <p>Modeling how stars evolve leads to age estimates for some stars
        that are greater than the age of the universe. Mills' theory
        predicts that presently, stars exist which are older than the
        elapsed time of the present expansion as stellar evolution
        occurred during the contraction phase. </p>
      <p>General Relativity provides a resolution to the problem of the
        loss of angular momentum of the core which is in agreement with
        the current Solar models and helioseismology data. The photon
        transfer of momentum to expanding spacetime mechanism provides a
        resolution to the solar rotation problem of the slowly rotating
        Solar core. </p>
      <p>Further stellar evidence of disproportionation reactions is the
        emission of extreme ultraviolet radiation by young stars called
        A stars. They appear to have energetic, ultraviolet-emitting
        upper atmospheres, or coronas, even though astronomers believe
        such stars lack the ability to heat these regions. </p>
      <p>Numerous late-type stars, particularly dM stars, are known to
        flare from time to time at visible and X-ray wavelengths. An
        extremely pronounced flare was observed by the Extreme
        Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) Deep Survey telescope on the star AU
        Microscopii at a count of 20 times greater than that at
        quiescence [Bowyer, S., Science, Vol. 263, (1994), pp. 55-59].
        Emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet were observed for
        which there is no satisfactory assignment. These spectral lines
        match hydrogen transitions to electronic energy levels below the
        "ground" state corresponding to fractional quantum numbers as
        shown in Table 3 of Mills. The lines assigned to lower-energy
        hydrogen transitions increased significantly in intensity during
        the flare event. The data is consistent with disproportionation
        reactions of lower-energy hydrogen as the mechanism of solar
        flare activity. </p>
      <p>Planetary evidence of disproportionation reactions is the
        emission of energy by Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus in excess of
        that absorbed from the Sun. Jupiter is gigantic ball of gaseous
        hydrogen. Saturn and Uranus are also largely comprised of
        hydrogen. H.sub.3.sup.+ is detected from all three planets by
        infrared emission spectroscopy [J. Tennyson, Physics World,
        July, (1995), pp. 33-36]. Disproportionation reactions of
        hydrogen yield ionizing electrons, energy, and ionized hydrogen
        atoms. Ionizing electrons and protons can both react with
        molecular hydrogen to produce H.sub.3.sup.+. </p>
      <p>The spin/nuclear hyperfine structure transition energies of
        lower-energy hydrogen match closely certain spectral lines
        obtained by COBE [E. L. Wright, et. al., The Astrophysical
        Journal, 381, (1991), pp. 200-209; J. C. Mather, et. al., The
        Astrophysical Journal, 420, (1994), pp. 439-444] for which no
        other satisfactory assignment exists. </p>

        spillover catalytic material: 40% by weight potassium nitrate
        (KNO.sub.3) on graphitic carbon powder with 5% by weight
        1%-Pd-on-graphitic carbon (K.sup.+ /K.sup.+ electrocatalytic
        couple) by the very accurate and reliable method of heat
        measurement, thermopile conversion of heat into an electrical
        output signal [Phillips, J., Shim, H., "Additional Calorimetric
        Examples of Anomalous Heat from Physical Mixtures of K/Carbon
        and Pd/Carbon", Jan. 1, 1996, A Confidential Report submitted to
        HydroCatalysis Power Corporation provided by HydroCatalysis
        Power Corporation, Great Valley Corporate Center, 41 Great
        Valley Parkway, Malvern, Pa. 19355]. Excess power and heat were
        observed with flowing hydrogen over the catalyst. However, no
        excess power was observed with flowing helium over the catalyst
        mixture. Rates of heat production were reproducibly observed
        which were higher than that expected from the conversion of all
        the hydrogen entering the cell to water, and the total energy
        observed was over four times larger than that expected if all
        the catalytic material in the cell were converted to the lowest
        energy state by "known" chemical reactions. Thus, "anomalous"
        heat, heat of a magnitude and duration which could not be
        explained by conventional chemistry, was reproducibly observed.

      <p><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
      <p>Excess heat from a pressurized gas energy cell having a gaseous
        source of energy holes has been observed by HydroCatalysis Power
        Corporation [manuscript in progress] with low pressure hydrogen
        in the presence of molybdenum iodide (MoI.sub.2) (Mo.sup.2+
        electrocatalytic ion) which was volatilized at the operating
        temperature of the cell, 210.degree. C. The calorimeter was
        placed inside a large convection oven that maintained the
        ambient temperature of the cell at the operating temperature.
        The cell comprised a 40 cc stainless steel pressure vessel that
        was surrounded by a 2 inch thick molded ceramic thermal
        insulator. The cell was sealed with a vacuum tight flange that
        had a two hole Buffalo gland for a tungsten wire to dissociate
        molecular hydrogen, a perforation for a Type K thermocouple, a
        1/16 inch inlet for hydrogen which was connected to a 1/4 inch
        stainless steel tube which connected to the hydrogen supply. The
        flange was sealed with a copper gasket. The bottom of the vessel
        had a 1/4" vacuum port connected to a stainless steel tube with
        a valve between the cell and a vacuum pump and vacuum gauge.
        Less than one gram of MoI.sub.2 catalyst was placed in a ceramic
        boat inside the vessel. The vapor pressure of the catalyst was
        estimated to be about 50 millitorr at the operating temperature
        210.degree. C. The hydrogen pressure of about 200 to 250
        millitorr was controlled manually by adjusting the supply
        through the inlet versus the amount pumped away at the outlet
        where the pressure was monitored in the outlet tube by the
        vacuum gauge. For each run, the total pressure was made
        (including the MoI.sub.2 pressue in the case of the experimental
        run) precisely 250 millitorr. </p>
      <p>The output power was determined by measuring difference between
        the cell temperature and the ambient oven temperature and
        comparing the result to a calibration curve generated by
        applying power to the inside of the cell with the tungsten
        filament. Excess power of 0.3 watts was observed from the 40 cc
        stainless steel reaction vessel containing less than 1 g of
        MoI.sub.2 when hydrogen was flowed over the hot tungsten wire
        (.apprxeq.2000.degree. C.). However, no excess power was
        observed when helium was flowed over the hot tungsten wire or
        when hydrogen was flowed over the hot tungsten wire with no
        MoI.sub.2 present in the cell. Rates of heat production were
        reproducibly observed which were higher than that expected from
        the conversion of all the hydrogen inside the cell to water, and
        the total energy observed was over 30 times larger than that
        expected if all the catalytic material in the cell were
        converted to the lowest energy state by "known" chemical
        reactions. Thus, "anomalous" heat, heat of a magnitude and
        duration which could not be explained by conventional chemistry,
        was reproducibly observed. </p>
      <p>The gaseous contents of the reactor were monitored with a mass
        spectrometer. At the time that excess energy was produced
        corresponding to the case wherein hydrogen was flowed over the
        hot filament, a higher ionizing mass two species was observable;
        whereas, during the control run wherein hydrogen was flowed over
        the hot tungsten wire with no MoI.sub.2 present in the cell, a
        higher ionizing mass two species was not observed. The higher
        ionizing mass two species is was assigned to the dihydrino
        molecule, ##EQU116##. </p>
