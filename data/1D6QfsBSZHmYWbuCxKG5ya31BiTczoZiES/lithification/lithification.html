      <br>
      They're often rutted and dangerous, but a Santa Fe business owner
      has a new technology that could forever change how road crews
      repair and maintain dirt roads.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, there's a certain beauty found in taking a road less
      traveled in New Mexico, but there's also a certain headache -- a
      teeth-ratting reminder why most dirt roads should be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      On the back roads of the Navajo Nation, that's almost always true.<br>
      <br>
      "There are a lot of struggles," Benjamin Bennett, the deputy
      director of the Navajo Nation Division of Transportation said in
      an interview with 4 Investigates.<br>
      <br>
      The Navajo Nation is almost entirely rural and sparsely
      populated.&nbsp; Because of that, there are hundreds of miles of
      dirt roads.&nbsp; Crews try to maintain them, but it's often
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      After the snow melts every winter, it's especially tough.<br>
      <br>
      "[We] try to make sure that we can keep everybody out of the mud,"
      Bennett said.<br>
      <br>
      He said some of the roads develop ruts that are up to one foot
      deep.&nbsp; He said some people never leave their homes for fear
      of becoming stranded.<br>
      <br>
      They're often too far out of reach of emergency responders as
      well, he said.<br>
      <br>
      However, Bennett hopes those are problems of the past.&nbsp; The
      Navajo Nation recently bought into a new technology called bionic
      soil, which puts Mother Nature's biological clock into overdrive.<br>
      <br>
      "The product technology is called lithification, and lithification
      is the definition of transforming soil into rock," Bob Sherwin,
      founder of Bionic Soil Solutions said.<br>
      <br>
      He had the help of an inventor in Brisbane, Australia in
      developing a "secret sauce" -- a non-toxic, proprietary liquid
      that exponentially accelerates the breakdown of oxygen, silicon,
      and aluminum found naturally in soil to turn it into stone.<br>
      <br>
      "It's what Mother Nature does over hundreds of thousands of
      years," Sherwin said.<br>
      <br>
      In order for the product to work properly, he said crews first
      till a dirt road with a machine called a reclaimer.&nbsp; Then,
      they spray the fluffed dirt with water to make it pack well.&nbsp;
      After that, they apply the "sauce," smooth the dirt with road
      rollers, then wait for it to harden overnight.<br>
      <br>
      The next morning, 4 Investigates found it to be as hard as
      concrete and as smooth as a freshly-paved interstate.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin said the bionic soil is scientifically proven to be harder
      than concrete, water repellent, and nearly indestructible.<br>
      <br>
      He demonstrated how the bionic soil remains intact, like a rock,
      when submerged in water.&nbsp; He said he's had some samples
      soaking for months which haven't changed a bit.<br>
      <br>
      The Navajo Nation is confident the product is environmentally
      friendly to their sacred land.&nbsp; Bennett said the Navajo DOT
      has more stringent environmental standards than the rest of the
      country.<br>
      <br>
      He also believes the bionic soil is a permanent solution along a
      particularly problematic, six-mile stretch of road through a
      mountain pass.<br>
      <br>
      "This [project] was on the books since 1998," Bennett said.<br>
      <br>
      He said the $1.3 million project is costing them the same, or
      less, than what they would have spent on a traditional road made
      of gravel and sand.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin said traditional gravel and sand roads last about three or
      four years, whereas the bionic soil could last for 20 or 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      "Its going to open a lot of doors," Bennett said.&nbsp; "It's
      going to sell itself.&nbsp; And I think that if we can do that
      across the Navajo Nation, we could put a lot of people out of the
      mud."<br>
      <br>
      Bionic Soil Solutions has completed roughly a dozen other projects
      elsewhere across New Mexico, including a road near Edgewood and on
      pads that surround pump jacks in the oil fields.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the company expects to apply the product to the
      construction of homes.&nbsp; Ultimately, it plans to donate the
      product to the making of dirt bricks in underdeveloped countries.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin, along with more than a dozen investors scattered across
      the western U.S., recently secured licensing rights for their
      product nationwide.&nbsp; They have plans to expand worldwide. <br>

      Bob Sherwin Former real estate agent Bob Sherwin has been working
      for years on a long-lasting, eco-friendly solution to the problems
      of maintaining hundreds of miles of rutted dirt roads in rural New
      Mexico and elsewhere. He thought he had the answer several years
      ago with a product called RoadPacker, which he used to treat Spur
      Ranch Road in a private subdivision off U.S. 285 south of
      Eldorado.<br>
      <br>
      Today the road is “1,000 percent” better, but it isn’t water
      resistant, and there have been some problems after heavy rains.
      The product, which has a high acid content, had worked well in
      China, Australia, Mexico and Canada. But it turned out that it
      didn’t work as well in the Southwest, where the pH content of
      soils is much higher, he said. He went back to the inventor, Alan
      Sonnenburg of Brisbane, Australia, who, it turned out, was
      developing a new formula designed to work in all soil conditions.
      And now Sherwin thinks he’s really found the solution to the
      problem. The new product turns dirt to stone overnight through a
      process called lithification in nature, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin pointed out that a French materials scientists — Joseph
      Davidovits— believes this type of technology, not cut stone, was
      used to build the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Sherwin’s
      company, Bionic Soil Solutions LLC, has recently completed work on
      11 miles of rural roads on the Navajo Nation, where the ruts after
      a snowmelt are as deep as 18 inches in places. “So far we are very
      pleased,” said Benjamin Bennett, deputy director of the Navajo
      Nation Division of Transportation. Soils, Sherwin said, have three
      common elements: oxygen, silicon and aluminum. They combine to
      form aluminosilicate. Bionic Soil turns the aluminosilicates into
      a gel that hardens and becomes impermeable to water. Sonnenburg
      added accelerators to make this process happen in 24 hours rather
      than over many thousands of years, the time it would take to occur
      naturally.<br>
      <br>
      Bionic Soil Solutions partners with Univar USA, an international
      company that blends the product and sends it to the job site in
      tankers. The application process involves scarifying or tilling
      the soil with a grader or, for bigger projects, a reclaimer. The
      formula is mixed with water and the top 6 inches of soil. Then the
      surface is shaped and rolled. “You can drive on it immediately,”
      Sherwin said. The process is cheaper than laying down base course,
      the sand and gravel mixture used on many county roads. Sherwin
      said a mile of base course 6 inches deep and 24 feet wide takes 95
      to 99 truckloads of gravel. Bionic Soil applications require 1 1/2
      tankers of solution (at 3,500 gallons per tanker).<br>
      <br>
      The overall cost depends on how far the materials have to be
      hauled. Because the Navajo Nation roads were so remote, the job is
      costing the tribe about $230,000 per mile, Bennett said. Paving
      the road could cost up to $2 million a mile, he added. Sherwin
      estimates the cost could be as low as $75,000 a mile for less
      remote stretches of road. In the case of Bionic Soil, the treated
      road will last longer and with a lot less maintenance, Sherwin
      said. If the product catches on, it could reduce the amount of
      gravel mining here and elsewhere. According to Sherwin, 300
      million tons of virgin aggregate are mined annually in the U.S.,
      taking down hills and leaving behind big, empty pits.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin is Bionic Soil’s founder and managing partner and owns 50
      percent of the company. The other half is owned by about 35
      investors, some of whom invested in RoadPacker, an entity that has
      been dissolved. Bionic Soil Solutions bought licensing and
      distribution rights for the U.S. and its protectorates and pays
      inventor Sonneburg money for every gallon sold. The company is
      currently looking for potential customers in the private sector —
      gas, oil, wind and solar energy firms, ranchers, farmers and
      Native communities — who can act more quickly than the public
      sector, although Sherwin said he met with the New Mexico
      Department of Transportation last week.<br>
      <br>
      The new road technology has other applications as well. The
      company built a parking lot and 11 battery pads for an oil company
      in Carlsbad to reduce the chance of chemical spills reaching
      groundwater. “We’re hoping to spread the word to other oil
      companies,” Sherwin said. The product also can be adapted for
      making adobe earth blocks for homebuilding. Bennett said he thinks
      Bionic Soil speaks for itself. White Clay Road and Blue Canyon
      Road near Sawmill, Ariz., on the Navajo Reservation were virtually
      impassable, especially after hard rains and snow. They are also
      school bus routes, and the buses that are able to get through
      “tend to have high maintenance costs,” he said. Because of the
      conditions of the roads, Bionic Soil Solutions had to strip the
      roads down to the bottom of the ruts, at least a foot, and then
      build them back up. After the product was applied and the road was
      shaped and smoothed, the crew did a test drive. Sherwin said they
      were able to reach a speed of 87 mph on roads where the previous
      limit was about 5 mph.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid compromising the surface, however, crews removing snow
      and debris will use a rubber-edged blade positioned a half-inch
      above the surface. But Bennett said “there’s no maintenance
      required,” and from the cost savings, “we could move on and do
      other roads.” What we’re shooting for,” Sherwin said, “is a green
      road technology that reduces the carbon footprint. One and
      one-half truckloads [of product] versus 98 [trucks of
      gravel].Businessman seeking green roadbuilding solution sees

      </b><b>Soil Stabilization Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bionic Road Solution (BRS): Binds the native soil, base course,
      gravel and even caliche tightly together to form a water
      resistant, long lasting road or subgrade.&nbsp; This application
      reduces dust by 80-90% (Decreased liability associated with heavy
      dust in the oilfield or any high traffic caliche road).
      Environmentally friendly!<br>
      <br>
      Bionic Pond Liners (BEL): Transforms native soil into an
      impermeable soil layer.&nbsp; Excellent for Frac Pond applications
      due to the reduction in materials needed to construct the pond, as
      well as reducing the amount of leaks due to animals or heavy
      equipment piercing the pond liner.&nbsp; Environmentally friendly!<br>

      <b>Why Bionic Soil?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Road Maintenance is EXPENSIVE!<br>
      Deferred Maintenance – drives up long term costs, shortens
      rehabilitation cycle, increases costs by as much as 400%!<br>
      Deferred Rehabilitation – compounds the problem at hand, leads to
      road failure, reconstruction of road bed results in 1000% increase
      in cost!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Environmentally Friendly</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The United States currently mines 300,000,000 tons of aggregate
      each year to create base course for construction of roads<br>
      Building one mile of two lane road creates 7,000 tons of carbon
      dioxide emissions!!<br>
      Concrete, asphalt, and base course are among the TOP contributors
      to green house gas emissions today!<br>
      The current road building methods are not sustainable for the end
      users or for our planet.<br>

      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a lithification reinforcing structure and
      a lithification reinforcing method thereof. The lithification
      reinforcing structure is a support structure formed in stages in
      accordance with different underground spaces, and is formed by
      combining lithifed soil and grouted bars by hole drilling and
      grouting and integrally molding with concrete reinforcements. The
      lithification reinforcing method comprises the following steps: 1.
      drilling holes, 2. grouting, 3. reinforcing, and 4. carrying out
      space support construction. By pressing mud and seeping mud to
      carry out lithification processing on a loose stratum, the
      invention lithifies the muddy soil stratum which is not applicable
      to undermining originally and facilitates the undermining, thereby
      reducing dismantlement of surface buildings; by the support of the
      concrete reinforcements to the inner wall of a tunneling space,
      the invention enhances the support strength of the foundation
      work, can be used as a permanent stressing support, an early
      support before undermining or tunneling construction, a support in
      front of a tunneling surface, a support after a tunneling surface,
      a gross section transition support and a temporary support,
      provides reliable operating space for construction and improves
      the operating safety. Besides, the invention has the advantages of
      high strength, low project cost, high construction speed,
      convenience and feasibility, and solves the construction problems
      of wide-span ultra shallow-buried underground buildings.<br>
