        <div align="left"> Imagine a fuel-efficient, clean-burning
          diesel engine that costs $1,000 to $5,000 less than those
          built today. That's the possibility raised by research
          published this week in the journal Science, from chemical
          engineers at GM who've found a way to substitute a cheap
          mineral for wedding-ring-quality metals in catalytic
          converters.<br>
          <br>
          The GM chemists found a way to use a mineral called
          perovskite, doped with strontium, in place of the expensive
          precious metals. It's something of a holy grail in the
          industry, which many groups have been working on for the past
          15 years. While the GM scientists were focusing on diesel
          engines, their technology should also work in gasoline
          engines.<br>
          <br>
          "It's an order of magnitude cheaper," says Chang Hwan Kim, a
          chemical engineer at GM's technology center in Warren, Mich.
          and the senior author on the paper.<br>
          <br>
          "It's a really significant step forward," says Charles Peden,
          a chemist and director of the Institute for Interfacial
          Catalysis at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
          Richland, Wash. "The high cost of platinum is really causing
          problems for these new emissions control technologies."<br>
          <br>
          Getting cars today to be both fuel efficient and low-emission
          is a difficult trade-off.<br>
          <br>
          To make a car fuel efficient, you want to get a mix of air and
          fuel that burns as much of the fuel as possible. But to put
          out few pollutants, the current catalyst technology requires
          that not all the fuel is burned. "The catalytic converter
          doesn't work if it doesn't have enough unburnt fuel," says
          Peden.<br>
          <br>
          The catalytic converter changes the smog-creating chemicals
          nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide put out by the engine into
          harmless nitrogen.<br>
          <br>
          To cut down on smog car companies began adding catalytic
          converters to their products in the 1970s.&nbsp; Those
          catalytic converters used precious metals such as platinum,
          palladium and rhodium as catalysts, to speed up the conversion
          of the nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide into plain
          nitrogen.&nbsp; It's this technology that's decreased air
          pollution from cars tremendously over the past 15 years. But
          it's also raised their price.<br>
          <br>
          Newer catalytic converters require less unburnt fuel to work,
          but in order to do so they require a lot more platinum or
          other precious metals. And with prices going up, that's been a
          huge headache for auto manufacturers.<br>
          <br>
          "There are still a few things we have to work on to develop
          this as a commercial product, but we were very excited," says
          Kim.<br>

        Researchers from the General Motors Global Research and
        Development, Chemical Sciences and Materials Systems Lab have
        developed and demonstrated the use of strontium-doped perovskite
        oxides as efficient platinum substitutes in diesel oxidation
        (DOC) and lean NOx trap (LNT) catalysts. Their work may help to
        lower the cost of NOx treatments and thus ultimately make diesel
        a more cost-effective automotive fuel. A paper on the work was
        published in the 26 March issue of the journal Science.<br>
        <br>
        One of the obstacles to the more widespread adoption of diesel
        engines—especially in the face of increasingly stringent
        emissions requirements—is the requirement for a lean NOx
        aftertreatment system. The aftertreatment system is a key
        contributor to the cost premium for diesel vehicles.<br>
        <br>
        A typical diesel aftertreatment system will include a diesel
        oxidation catalyst to oxidizes hydrocarbons, CO, and NO,
        followed by NOx reduction. The two leading technologies for NOx
        reduction in the oxygen-rich environment are ammonia selective
        catalytic reduction (SCR) and a lean NOx trap (LNT).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many reports have suggested that NO oxidation
        to NO2 is an important step in lean NOx reduction, because NO2
        enhances the activities of ammonia SCR and LNT. For SCR
        catalysts, a NO:NO2 ratio of 1:1 is most effective for NOx
        reduction at lower temperatures (&lt;250 °C). For LNT catalysts,
        NO must be oxidized to NO2 before adsorption on the storage
        components. Because NO2 constitutes less than 10% of NOx in the
        diesel engine-out exhaust, an oxidation catalyst is required to
        increase the NO2 fraction. Platinum has been found to be
        especially active for NO oxidation; thus, Pt-based diesel
        oxidation (DOC) and LNT catalysts have been widely used for
        diesel exhaust aftertreatment. However, they suffer from issues
        such as high cost and poor thermal durability. Consequently,
        there is substantial interest in the development of
        better-performing, low-cost, and more durable NO oxidation
        catalysts.<br>

        <br>
        The catalysts developed by the GM team are based on perovskite
        oxides, La1–xSrxCoO3 and La1–xSrxMnO3. Under realistic
        conditions, La1-xSrxCoO3 catalysts achieved higher NO-to-NO2
        conversions than a commercial platinum-based DOC catalyst.
        Similarly, a La0.9Sr0.1MnO3-based LNT catalyst achieved NOx
        reduction performance comparable to that of a commercial
        platinum-based counterpart.<br>
        <br>
        These perovskite catalysts are prone to deactivation by sulfur,
        a contaminant present in fuel. However, the oxidation activity
        of the catalyst can be improved in the presence of sulfur by
        adding palladium.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential use of perovskites for
        automotive applications is hindered by the fact that the
        perovskites alone are susceptible to deactivation by S. However,
        the NOx-treating performance of Pd/perovskite-based DOC and LNT
        catalysts in simulated diesel exhaust demonstrated the potential
        of Pd/perovskite catalysts as a viable substitute for Pt in
        diesel aftertreatment catalysts. This substitution could
        drastically reduce the cost of diesel aftertreatment systems for
        mobile applications. Lean-burn gasoline engines will also
        benefit from this technology.<br>

        In an accompanying Perspective in Science, James E. Parks, II
        from Oak Ridge National Laboratory noted that:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The catalyst developed by Kim et al. greatly
        reduces the amount of PGM in LNTs while still maintaining their
        effectiveness for NOx reduction from lean engines. This
        alternative technology will allow engineers greater flexibility
        as they work to develop better catalysts in a market where
        volatile PGM prices have made commercial introduction of
        fuel-efficient lean vehicles challenging. It is possible that
        these catalysts may allow lean-burn technology to be used with
        minimal added cost compared to conventional engines.<br>
