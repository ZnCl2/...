            Power as Efficiently as Solar Panels<br>
            <br>

      <br>
      Nov. 7, 2013 â€” Using inexpensive materials configured and tuned to
      capture microwave signals, researchers at Duke University's Pratt
      School of Engineering have designed a power-harvesting device with
      efficiency similar to that of modern solar panels.<br>
      <br>
      The device wirelessly converts the microwave signal to direct
      current voltage capable of recharging a cell phone battery or
      other small electronic device, according to a report appearing in
      the journal Applied Physics Letters in December 2013.<br>
      <br>
      It operates on a similar principle to solar panels, which convert
      light energy into electrical current. But this versatile energy
      harvester could be tuned to harvest the signal from other energy
      sources, including satellite signals, sound signals or Wi-Fi
      signals, the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the power harvester lies in its application of
      metamaterials, engineered structures that can capture various
      forms of wave energy and tune them for useful applications.<br>
      <br>
      Undergraduate engineering student Allen Hawkes, working with
      graduate student Alexander Katko and lead investigator Steven
      Cummer, professor of electrical and computer engineering, designed
      an electrical circuit capable of harvesting microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      They used a series of five fiberglass and copper energy conductors
      wired together on a circuit board to convert microwaves into 7.3V
      of electrical energy. By comparison, Universal Serial Bus (USB)
      chargers for small electronic devices provide about 5V of power.<br>
      <br>
      "We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could
      achieve," said Hawkes. "We had been getting energy efficiency
      around 6 to 10 percent, but with this design we were able to
      dramatically improve energy conversion to 37 percent, which is
      comparable to what is achieved in solar cells."<br>
      <br>
      "It's possible to use this design for a lot of different
      frequencies and types of energy, including vibration and sound
      energy harvesting," Katko said. "Until now, a lot of work with
      metamaterials has been theoretical. We are showing that with a
      little work, these materials can be useful for consumer
      applications."<br>
      <br>
      For instance, a metamaterial coating could be applied to the
      ceiling of a room to redirect and recover a Wi-Fi signal that
      would otherwise be lost, Katko said. Another application could be
      to improve the energy efficiency of appliances by wirelessly
      recovering power that is now lost during use.<br>
      <br>
      "The properties of metamaterials allow for design flexibility not
      possible with ordinary devices like antennas," said Katko. "When
      traditional antennas are close to each other in space they talk to
      each other and interfere with each other's operation. The design
      process used to create our metamaterial array takes these effects
      into account, allowing the cells to work together."<br>
      <br>
      With additional modifications, the researchers said the
      power-harvesting metamaterial could potentially be built into a
      cell phone, allowing the phone to recharge wirelessly while not in
      use. This feature could, in principle, allow people living in
      locations without ready access to a conventional power outlet to
      harvest energy from a nearby cell phone tower instead.<br>
      <br>
      "Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to
      electromagnetic power harvesting," said Cummer. "The beauty of the
      design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and
      additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the
      scavenged power."<br>
      <br>
      For example, a series of power-harvesting blocks could be
      assembled to capture the signal from a known set of satellites
      passing overhead, the researchers explained. The small amount of
      energy generated from these signals might power a sensor network
      in a remote location such as a mountaintop or desert, allowing
      data collection for a long-term study that takes infrequent
      measurements.<br>

      </b>We present the design and experimental implementation of a
      power harvesting metamaterial. A maximum of 36.8% of the incident
      power from a 900 MHz signal is experimentally rectified by an
      array of metamaterial unit cells. We demonstrate that the maximum
      harvested power occurs for a resistive load close to 70 ohms in
      both simulation and experiment. The power harvesting metamaterial
      is an example of a functional metamaterial that may be suitable
      for a wide variety of applications that require power delivery to
      any active components integrated into the metamaterial.<br>

      Metamaterial particles having active electronic components are
      disclosed. According to one aspect, a metamaterial particle in
      accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein can include a
      field sensing element adapted to sense a first field and adapted
      to produce a sensed field signal representative of the first field
      in response to sensing the first field. Further, the metamaterial
      particle can include an active electronic component adapted to
      receive the sensed field signal and adapted to produce a drive
      signal based on the sensed field signal. A field generating
      element can be adapted to receive the drive signal and adapted to
      produce a second field based on the drive signal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The subject matter disclosed herein generally relates to
      metamaterials. More particularly, the subject matter disclosed
      herein relates to metamaterial particles having active electronic
      components and related methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Metamaterials are a new class of ordered composites that
      exhibit exceptional properties not readily observed in nature.
      These properties arise from qualitatively new response functions
      that are not observed in the constituent materials and result from
      the inclusion of artificially fabricated, extrinsic, low
      dimensional inhomogeneities, which may be referred to as
      "metamaterial particles". These artificial composites can achieve
      material performance beyond the limitations of conventional
      composites. To date, most of the scientific activity with regard
      to metamaterials has centered on their electromagnetic properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Metamaterials can be used to engineer electromagnetic
      properties of a material by embedding numerous small metamaterial
      particles in a host matrix. These particles can produce an
      electric or magnetic dipole moment in response to an applied
      field. Metamaterials have properties that could potentially be
      used to fabricate super lenses, miniaturized antennas, enhanced
      tunneling effect devices, and invisibility cloaks. Electric and
      magnetic metamaterials have been extensively analyzed
      theoretically, in simulations, and tested experimentally, and are
      currently built by putting together arrays of passive
      subwavelength resonant particles, such as split-ring-resonators
      (SRRs), omega particles, electric-field-coupled resonators (ELCs),
      and cut-wires.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The currents and charges in these passive, self-resonant
      circuits created in response to an applied electric or magnetic
      field near the resonant frequency are great enough to generate
      electric or magnetic dipole moments that are in turn great enough
      to substantially alter the effective permittivity or permeability
      of a medium composed of these particles. However, exploiting this
      strong response close to resonance usually means significant
      losses and strongly frequency dependent properties, two
      consequences undesirable in many potential metamaterial
      applications. For example, it has been shown both theoretically
      and experimentally that the smallest amount of loss could
      significantly influence the effectiveness of the evanescent wave
      enhancement property responsible for the super lens and enhanced
      tunneling effects. On the other hand, it has been shown that even
      modest loss tangents of 0.01 can rarely be achieved in these
      metamaterials. Also, due to their resonant nature, the inherent
      high dispersion of current metamaterials makes them useful only
      for narrow bandwidth applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, it is
      desirable to provide metamaterial particles having reduced loss,
      lower dispersion, and higher bandwidth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] According to one aspect, metamaterial particles having
      active electronic components are disclosed herein. A metamaterial
      particle can include a field sensing element adapted to sense a
      first field and adapted to produce a sensed field signal
      representative of the first field in response to sensing the first
      field. Further, the metamaterial particle can include an active
      electronic component adapted to receive the sensed field signal
      and adapted to produce a drive signal based on the sensed field
      signal. A field generating element can be adapted to receive the
      drive signal and adapted to produce a second field based on the
      drive signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to another aspect, methods for providing a field
      in response to sensing another field are disclosed herein. A
      method in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein can
      include providing a metamaterial particle comprising a field
      sensing element, an active electronic component, and a field
      generating element. At the field sensing element, a first field
      can be sensed, and a sensed field signal representative of the
      first field can be produced. At the active electronic component,
      the sensed field signal can be received, and a drive signal based
      on the sensed field signal can be produced. Further, at the field
      generating element, a second field can be produced based on the
      drive signal.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] Metamaterial particles are disclosed that employ active
      electronic components, field sensing elements and field generating
      elements. These metamaterial particles can overcome the inherent
      limitations of metamaterial particles employing only passive
      elements, such as loss, dispersion, and narrow bandwidth. The
      metamaterial particles described herein can reduce or control with
      greater flexibility limitations on loss and dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A metamaterial particle in accordance with the subject
      matter disclosed herein can include a field sensing element
      adapted to sense an applied field and adapted to produce a sensed
      field signal representative of the field in response to sensing
      the applied field. For example, the field sensing element can
      sense a magnetic or electric field and produce an electrical
      signal representative of the sensed field. The representative
      signal can be proportional to a magnitude and phase of the sensed
      field. Further, the metamaterial particle can include an active
      electronic component for receiving the sensed field signal and for
      producing a drive signal based on the sensed field signal. For
      example, the active electronic component can be an amplifier
      operable to produce a drive signal that is a function of the
      sensed field signal. A field generating element can receive the
      drive signal and produce another field based on the drive signal.
      For example, the field generating element can produce a magnetic
      or electric field in response to receiving the drive signal.
      Additional embodiments and examples of the metamaterial particles
      in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein are
      provided hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As used herein, the term "active electronic component"
      refers to an electronic element having gain or directionality.
      Examples of active electronic components include any suitable
      semiconductor and any suitable signal or power amplifying
      component having an external power source such as a transistor, an
      operational amplifier, a parametric amplifier, a voltage
      amplifier, and a power amplifier. An active electronic component
      can be packaged in a discrete form with two or more connecting
      leads or metallic pads. Further, for example, an active electronic
      component can include at least one input and at least one output.
      The active electronic component can receive an input signal at an
      input terminal and can produce an output signal at its output
      terminal that is a function of the input signal. A power source
      can be operably connected to the active electronic component for
      providing power for input gain. In contrast to an active
      electronic component, a "passive electronic component" has neither
      gain nor directionality.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As used herein, the term "field" refers to one of or both a
      magnetic field and an electric field. A magnetic field is a field
      that permeates space and which exerts a magnetic force on moving
      electric charges and magnetic dipoles. Magnetic fields surround
      electric currents, magnetic dipoles, and changing electric fields.
      An electric field is a property that can be referred to as the
      space surrounding an electric charge or in the presence of a
      time-varying magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As used herein, the term "field sensing element" refers to
      an element operable to sense a magnetic field and/or an electrical
      field and operable to generate a signal representative of the
      sensed field. Examples of a field sensing element include a
      magnetic dipole, such as a metallic loop, and an electric dipole,
      such as a pair of wires. In one example, in the presence of a
      magnetic field, a metallic loop can generate a current through the
      loop. The generated current can indicate the presence of the
      magnetic field. In another example, in the presence of an
      electrical field, a wire pair can generate a voltage difference
      between the wires. The generated voltage difference can indicate
      the presence of the electrical field.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As used herein, the term "field generating element" refers
      to an element operable to receive an input signal and operable to
      generate a magnetic field and/or an electrical field in response
      to the received input signal. Examples of a field generating
      element include a magnetic dipole, such as a metallic loop, and an
      electric dipole, such as a pair of wires. In one example, in
      response to receiving an input signal, a metallic loop can
      generate a magnetic field. The input to the metallic loop can be
      application of a voltage difference between ends of the loop. In
      another example, a wire pair can generate an electric field in
      response to receiving an input signal. The input to the wire pair
      can be application of a voltage difference between the wires. The
      generated field can be proportional to the input signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As used herein, the term "magnetic dipole" refers to a
      component having a closed circuit of electric current. For
      example, a magnetic dipole can be a wire loop. Application of
      current in the wire loop can produce a magnetic dipole moment that
      points through the loop. Thus, a magnetic field can be generated
      by application of the current. The magnitude of the magnetic
      dipole moment is equal to the current in the loop times the area
      of the loop. Conversely, application of a magnetic field through
      the loop can generate current in the loop. Therefore, a magnetic
      dipole can be used for sensing the presence of a magnetic field by
      detection of generated current.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As used herein, the term "electric dipole" refers to refer
      to a component having a spatial separation of positive and
      negative charge. For example, an electric dipole can be a pair of
      wires that are spatially separated. Application of a voltage
      difference to the wires can produce an electric dipole moment that
      points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and
      has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the
      separation between the charges. Conversely, application of an
      electric field between the wires can generate a voltage.
      Therefore, an electric dipole can be used for sensing the presence
      of an electric field by detection of generated voltage difference.<br>

      <b>Examples of Metamaterial Particles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] In one embodiment, a metamaterial particle in accordance
      with the subject matter disclosed herein can include an active
      electronic component, and a field sensing element and a field
      generating element in the form of magnetic dipoles. FIG. 1 is a
      schematic diagram of an exemplary metamaterial particle generally
      designated 100 including an active electronic component 102 and
      magnetic dipoles 104 and 106 in accordance with an embodiment of
      the subject matter disclosed herein. Referring to FIG. 1, magnetic
      dipole 104 can function as a field sensing element adapted for
      sensing a magnetic field. Magnetic dipole 104 can sense a magnetic
      field 108 propagating in the direction of magnetic dipole 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In this example, magnetic dipole 104 is a metallic loop
      sized smaller than the magnetic field wavelength. On application
      of magnetic field 108 through the loop, a current is produced in
      the loop that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic
      field. The produced current results in a voltage difference at the
      ends of the loop. The voltage difference is referred to herein as
      a sensed field signal because it represents the sensed magnetic
      field and can be received by active electronic component 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Active electronic component 102 can include an input for
      receiving the voltage difference present at the ends of the loop
      of magnetic dipole 104. Particularly, active electronic component
      102 can receive as input the voltage difference produced in the
      loop of magnetic dipole 104. Thus, active electronic component 102
      can receive a signal representative of magnetic field 108. In
      response to receiving the sensed field signal, active electronic
      component 102 can produce a drive signal that is a function of the
      received signal. In this example, active electronic component 102
      is an amplifier configured to amplify the sensed field signal by
      gain G and to output a drive signal, which is the sensed field
      signal multiplied by gain G. Thus, in this example, the output of
      the active electronic component is the gain G times the input
      sensed field signal. Alternatively, the output of the active
      electronic component can be any predetermined function of the
      input sensed field signal. Active electronic component 102 can be
      powered by any suitable power source 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The predetermined function can include current
      amplification by a predetermined gain G. Alternatively, the
      predetermined function can include power amplification. Further,
      for example, the function can provide the features of a nonlinear
      device. In a linear active electronic component for example, the
      function can be represented by the equation Vout=GVin, where Vin
      is the voltage input into the active electronic component, Vout is
      the voltage output by the active electronic component, and G is
      the gain. In a nonlinear active electronic component for example,
      the function can be represented by the equation
      Vout=GVin&lt;2&gt;, where Vin, is the voltage input into the
      active electronic component, Vout is the voltage output by the
      active electronic component, and G is the gain. An active
      electronic component may be any suitable function that alters Vout
      with the aide of an external power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The following equations can apply to active electronic
      component 102 with regard to gain. An input voltage from magnetic
      dipole element 104 can be represented by Vsense=j[omega]AsenseB,
      wherein B is the propagation constant through transmission lines.
      The output voltage to magnetic dipole element 106 can be
      represented by Vout=j[omega]AsenseBG. The field produced by
      magnetic dipole element can be represented by the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where m is the magnetic moment generated by metamaterial
      particle, j is the square root of -1 and represents a 90 degree
      phase shift, [omega] is 2[pi]* the signal frequency, B is the
      input magnetic field strength, Asense is the area enclosed by the
      sensing loop, Adriven is the area enclosed by the driven loop, and
      Zdriven is the total electrical impedance of the driven loop.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Magnetic dipole 106 is operable to receive the drive signal
      from active electronic component 102 and to produce another field
      based on the drive signal. In this example, magnetic dipole 106 is
      a metallic loop connected at its two ends to the output of
      component 102 for receiving a drive voltage difference. The drive
      voltage causes the flow of current through the loop for generating
      another magnetic field or magnetic dipole moment 112. The voltage
      at the ends of the loop of magnetic dipole 106 can be proportional
      to the current at the ends of the loop of magnetic dipole 104 by a
      gain factor of G due to active electronic component 102. Thus,
      active electronic component 102 can control the relation of the
      input magnetic field 108 to the output magnetic field 112 such
      that the output field is a function of the input field.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The provision of an active electronic component in a
      metamaterial particle as described herein can provide a number of
      benefits. For example, loss and dispersion can be controlled by
      controlling the phase delay through the metamaterial particles
      disclosed herein. Further, for example, a wide bandwidth of
      responses to sensed fields can be provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment of the subject matter disclosed
      herein, a metamaterial particle can include an active electronic
      component, and field sensing and a field generating elements in
      the form of electric dipoles. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an
      exemplary metamaterial particle generally designated 200 including
      active electronic component 102 and electric dipoles 202 and 204
      in accordance with an embodiment of the subject matter disclosed
      herein. Referring to FIG. 2, electric dipole 202 can function as a
      field sensing element for sensing an electric field 206. Electric
      dipole 202 can sense an electric field 204 present in the space of
      electric dipole 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In this example, electric dipole 202 is a wire pair sized
      smaller than the electric field wavelength. On application of
      electric field 206 in the space of electric dipole 202, a voltage
      difference between the wires of the wire pair can be produced that
      is proportional to the strength of the electric field. The
      produced voltage difference is referred to herein as a sensed
      field signal because it is representative of the sensed electric
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Active electronic component 102 can include an input for
      receiving the sensed field signal from electric dipole 202.
      Particularly, active electronic component 102 can receive as input
      the voltage produced in the wire pair of electric dipole 202.
      Thus, active electronic component 102 can receive a signal
      representative of electric field 206. In response to receiving the
      sensed field signal, active electronic component 102 can produce a
      drive signal that is a function of the received signal. In this
      example, active electronic component 102 is an amplifier
      configured to amplify the sensed field signal by gain G and to
      output a drive signal, which is the sensed field signal multiplied
      by gain G. Thus, in this example, the output of the active
      electronic component is the gain G times the input sensed field
      signal. Alternatively, the output of the active electronic
      component can be any predetermined function of the input sensed
      field signal. Active electronic component 102 can be powered by
      power source 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Electric dipole 204 is operable to receive the drive signal
      from active electronic component 102 and to produce another field
      based on the drive signal. In this example, electric dipole 204 is
      a wire pair connected to component 102 for receiving a drive
      voltage. The drive voltage can be applied to the wire pair of
      electric dipole 204 for generating another electric field or
      electric dipole moment 208. The voltage difference between the
      wire pair of electric dipole 202 can be proportional to the
      voltage difference between the wire pair of electric dipole 204 by
      a gain factor of G due to active electronic component 102. Thus,
      active electronic component 102 can control the relation of the
      input electric field 206 to the output electric field 208 such
      that the output field is a function of the input field.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In yet another embodiment of the subject matter disclosed
      herein, a metamaterial particle can include an active electronic
      component, and a field sensing element and a field generating
      element in the form of a magnetic dipole and an electric dipole,
      respectively. FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary
      metamaterial particle generally designated 300 including active
      electronic component 102, magnetic dipole 104, and electric dipole
      204 in accordance with an embodiment of the subject matter
      disclosed herein. Referring to FIG. 3, magnetic dipole 104 can
      function as a field sensing element for sensing magnetic field
      108, which is propagating through the metallic loop of magnetic
      dipole 104. On application of magnetic field 108 through the
      metallic loop, a current is produced in the loop that is
      proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. The produced
      current results in a voltage difference at the ends of the loop.
      The voltage difference is referred to herein as a sensed field
      signal because it represents the sensed magnetic field and can be
      received by active electronic component 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Active electronic component 102 can include an input for
      receiving the voltage difference present at the ends of the loop
      of magnetic dipole 104. The input voltage difference is a signal
      representative of magnetic field 108. In response to receiving the
      sensed field signal, active electronic component 102 can produce a
      drive voltage signal that is a function of the received current
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Electric dipole 204 is operable to receive the drive signal
      from active electronic component 102 and to produce electric field
      208 based on the drive signal. Active electronic component 102 can
      control the relation of the input magnetic field 108 to the output
      electric field 208 such that the output electric field is a
      function of the input magnetic field. As a result, metamaterial
      particle 300 can sense a magnetic field and can generate an
      electric field as a function of the sensed magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In yet another embodiment of the subject matter disclosed
      herein, a metamaterial particle can include an active electronic
      component, and a field sensing element and a field generating
      element in the form of a magnetic dipole and an electric dipole,
      respectively. FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary
      metamaterial particle generally designated 400 including active
      electronic component 102, electric dipole 202, and magnetic dipole
      106 in accordance with an embodiment of the subject matter
      disclosed herein. Referring to FIG. 4, electric dipole 202 can
      sense electric field 206, which is present in the space of
      electric dipole 202. On application of electric field 206, a
      voltage different is produced between the wires of electric dipole
      202.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Active electronic component 102 can include an input for
      receiving the sensed field signal in the form of voltage input
      from electric dipole 206. The input voltage is a signal
      representative of electric field 108. In response to receiving the
      sensed field signal, active electronic component 102 can produce a
      drive voltage signal that is a function of the received voltage
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Magnetic dipole 106 is operable to receive the drive
      voltage signal from active electronic component 102 and to produce
      magnetic field 112 based on the drive signal. In particular,
      active electronic component 102 applies a voltage difference at
      the ends of the wire loop of magnetic dipole 106 to produce the
      magnetic field. Active electronic component 102 can control the
      relation of the input electric field 206 to the output magnetic
      field 112 such that the output magnetic field is a function of the
      input electric field. As a result, metamaterial particle 400 can
      sense an electric field and can generate a magnetic field as a
      function of the sensed electric field.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The metamaterial particles described herein can be used to
      as a polarizing element. For example, a metamaterial particle as
      described herein can be used as a cross-polarizing element.
      Referring to FIG. 1 for example, the loops of magnetic dipoles 104
      and 106 can be oriented in different directions with respect to
      one another such that the generated magnetic field 106 propagates
      in a different direction than the sensed magnetic field 108.
      Similarly, referring to FIG. 2 for example, the wire pairs of
      electric dipoles 202 and 204 can be oriented in different
      directions with respect to one another such that the generated
      electric field 206 propagates in a different direction than the
      sensed electric field 208. Further, the sensing dipoles can be
      oriented in different directions for sensing fields oriented in
      different directions. In addition, the field generating dipoles
      can be oriented in different directions for generating fields
      oriented in different directions.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In another embodiment of the subject matter disclosed
      herein, a metamaterial particle can include an active electronic
      component, a field sensing element, a field generating element,
      and elements for resonantly amplifying a sensed field and a
      produced field. FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary
      metamaterial particle generally designated 500 including active
      electronic component 102, magnetic dipoles 104 and 106, and field
      amplifying elements 502 and 504 in accordance with the subject
      matter disclosed herein. Referring to FIG. 5, magnetic dipole 104
      can sense magnetic field 108. Field amplifying element 502 can be
      a magnetic loop having ends connected to a capacitor and
      positioned for resonantly amplifying magnetic field 108. Further,
      active electronic component 102 can amplify the signal and output
      an amplified signal at magnetic dipole 106 for producing magnetic
      field 112. Field amplifying element 504 can be a magnetic loop
      having ends connected to a capacitor and positioned for resonantly
      amplifying magnetic field 112. Thus, field amplifying elements 502
      and 504 can provide amplification of the magnetic fields for
      supporting the amplification provided by active electronic
      component 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Metamaterial particles as disclosed herein can be utilized
      in a process for providing a field in response to sensing another
      field. FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of
      providing a field in response to sensing another field according
      to an embodiment of the subject matter disclosed herein. In this
      example, reference is made to metamaterial particle 100 shown in
      FIG. 1, although the process may be conducted using any of the
      exemplary metamaterial particles described herein. Referring to
      FIG. 6, a metamaterial particle comprising a field sensing
      element, an active electronic component, and a field generating
      element is provided (block 600). For example, metamaterial
      particle 100 shown in FIG. 1 can be provided. At the field sensing
      element, a first field is sensed, and a sensed field signal
      representative of the first field is produced (block 602). For
      example, referring to FIG. 1, the metallic loop of magnetic dipole
      104 can sense a magnetic field and a voltage difference
      representative of the sensed field can be generated in response to
      the sensed magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] At block 604, the active electronic component can received
      the sensed field signal and can produce a drive signal based on
      the sensed field signal. In FIG. 1 for example, active electronic
      component 102 can receive the voltage difference from the metallic
      loop of magnetic dipole 104. Further, active electronic component
      102 can generate a drive signal that is an amplification of the
      received voltage difference signal. The drive signal can be output
      to the field generating element for producing a second field based
      on the drive signal (block 606). For example, active electronic
      component 102 can output the drive signal voltage difference to
      the metallic loop of magnetic dipole 106 for producing another
      magnetic field. The active electronic component can thereby
      generate a field based on another field that has been sensed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mathematical Analysis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0055] In a mathematical analysis of the subject matter disclosed
      herein, a plane wave propagating in free space in the direction of
      a metamaterial particle is considered. In this analysis, reference
      is made to FIG. 7 where a metamaterial particle generally
      designated 700 having a field sensing element 702 and a field
      generating element 704 in accordance with the subject matter
      disclosed herein is shown. Field sensing element 702 and field
      generating element 704 are operably connected to an active
      electronic component (an amplifier in this example) 706 as
      described in further detail herein. Further, field sensing element
      702 and field generating element 704 include metallic loops that
      are parallel to each other and are both perpendicular to an
      applied magnetic field (indicated by direction arrow 708) having a
      propagation direction (indicated by direction arrow 710) towards
      the field sensing and field generating elements. This arrangement
      makes the metamaterial particle anisotropic with a non-unity
      component on the diagonal of the permeability tensor in the
      direction perpendicular to the loops.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of the magnetic particle shown
      in FIG. 7. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, to control the phase delay
      through the system, the metallic loops of field sensing element
      702 and field generating element 704 are connected to active
      electronic component 706 through transmission lines of
      characteristic impedance Z0 and lengths I1 and I2, respectively.
      Amplifier 706 has input impedance Zin, output impedance Zout, and
      gain G. The metallic loop of field sensing element 702 has an
      interior area Ai and inductance L. The voltage picked up by the
      sensing loop of area Ai and inductance Li satisfies the following
      equation (1):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Vin=-j[omega][mu]0HAi (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where H is the externally applied magnetic field, and the
      loop is substantially smaller than the wavelength of magnetic
      field 708. It is noted that in equation (1), the magnetic coupling
      between the metallic loops is neglected. However, this is
      justified by the experimental data discussed in the Experimental
      Results section below. Given these parameters, it can be shown
      that, assuming no magnetic coupling between the metallic loops,
      the voltage Vout across the driven loop of area Ao and inductance
      Lo is given by the following equation (2):<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [beta]1 and [beta]2 are the propagation constants
      through the two transmission lines, and where<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0057] From these equations, it follows that the currents through
      the field sensing and field generating loops are
      iin=Vin/j[omega]Li (this expression is valid when the inductive
      impedance is larger than the transformed input impedance) and
      iout=Vout/j[omega]L0, respectively. Therefore, the magnetic moment
      generated in metamaterial particle is m=iinAi+ioutA0, and assuming
      that the metamaterial particle has volume Vuc, it follows that the
      effective relative permeability of a metamaterial made of arrays
      of such metamaterial particles is provided by the following
      equation (5):<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where Geff is the equivalent gain of the system defined as
      Geff=[nu]out/[nu]in.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Equations (2)-(5) can be used as design equations for the
      metamaterial particle shown in FIG. 1. In the following
      discussion, [mu]r' and [mu]r'' are the real and imaginary parts of
      [mu]r. If zero losses are needed in a metamaterial made of such
      metamaterial particles, [mu]r'' should equal 0, which means, from
      equation (5), that Geff must be real, or, equivalently, Vout and
      Vin must be either in phase or 180 degrees out of phase. A closer
      look at equation (2) reveals that this occurs periodically in
      frequency because Vout varies periodically with frequency due to
      the delay in the transmission lines and the phase distortions of
      the amplifier. Moreover, if the amplitude Â¦GÂ¦ is approximately
      constant with frequency in the band of interest, as it usually
      happens in practice with most amplifiers, then the amplitude
      Â¦VoutÂ¦ varies slowly with frequency, which means that [mu]r'
      oscillates around 1 with minima and maxima at frequencies where,
      again, Vout and Vin are in phase or 180 degrees out of phase, and
      where [mu]r'' 0. This feature is demonstrated by experiments
      described in the following Experimental Results section.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Results</b><b><br>

      particular, experiments were conducted on a metamaterial particle
      in accordance with the embodiment shown in FIG. 7. Referring to
      FIG. 7 for illustrative purposes, a microstrip transmission line
      was used to excite transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes to below
      900 MHz inside it. Two circular metallic loops 702 and 704 of
      radius 1.8 cm oriented parallel to each other and the axis of the
      microstrip are placed inside a waveguide 712. The distance between
      loops 702 and 704 was 6 cm. Subminiature version A (SMA) cables 1
      m long entering the microstrip through two holes drilled through
      the waveguide walls were used to connect the two loops to an AR
      1W1000 microwave amplifier (active electronic component 706)
      placed outside waveguide 712. The amplifier has a 30+-1.5 dB gain
      between 1 MHz and 1 GHz, 50[Omega] input and output impedances,
      has linear phase distortions, and can handle purely inductive
      loads. Since frequencies below 900 MHz are of interest, the
      sensing and driven loops are smaller than [lambda]/8, and the
      effective medium approximation assumed here holds. An AGILENT(R)
      8720A network analyzer (commercially available from Agilent
      Technologies, Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif.) was used to measure
      the reflected and transmitted waves through the waveguide. A
      single field sensing/field generating loop configuration was
      provided in the experiments so only one metamaterial particle is
      considered to fill the transverse section of the waveguide. Under
      these assumptions, the procedure described in the article
      "Determination of Effective Permittivity and Permeability of
      Metamaterials From Reflection and Transmission Coefficients,"
      Smith et al., Phys. Rev., B 65, 195104 (2002), the disclosure of
      which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, was
      used to retrieve the effective permeability of such a medium. The
      result is plotted in the solid lines shown in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 9 is a graph showing effective permeability versus
      frequency for this experiment. The frequencies with almost no
      dispersion and zero loss are identified by the shadowed regions in
      FIG. 9. The permeability follows closely the expected theoretical
      predictions (indicated by dotted lines), which validates equations
      (1)-(5). Moreover, it is noted that the important features
      expected theoretically, namely, [mu]r' oscillates around 1, with
      maxima and minima occurring at frequencies where [mu]r'' is
      approximately zero. Thus, for example, at around 602 MHz, the
      dispersion is almost zero (d[mu]r'/d[omega] 0) as well as the loss
      ([mu]r'' 0). Notice that, according to the design equations, in
      the regions where the amplifier is linear, the response of the
      active cell is also linear, therefore, the Kramers-Kronig
      relations must apply. As a result, at the frequencies where there
      is anomalous dispersion (i.e. d[mu]r'/d[omega]&lt;0)), there must
      be either loss, or gain, which is in agreement with the retrieved
      permeability. FIG. 10 is another graph showing measured effective
      permeability versus frequency in experimental results obtained
      with a metamaterial particle in accordance with the subject matter
      disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Another experiment was conducted with a different amplifier
      to ensure a good match between the theoretical and experimentally
      retrieved permeability is not a coincidence. The AR 1W1000
      amplifier was replaced with a MINI-CIRCUITS(R) ZHL2010 microwave
      amplifier (commercially available from Scientific Components
      Corporation, of Brooklyn, N.Y.) in series with a MAXIM(R) MAX2472
      voltage buffer (commercially available from Maxim Integrated
      Products, Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif.). Another exemplary amplifier
      that may be used is the MINI-CIRCUITS(R) high directivity
      monolithic amplifier VNA-28 (0.5-2.5 GHz) available from
      Scientific Components Corporation. The gain of this system was,
      again, about 30 dB. The output impedance given in the datasheets
      and measured with the network analyzer was (91-j182) [Omega], and
      was slowly varying with frequency, thus it was approximated as
      being constant throughout the frequency band of interest. The
      capacitive component of this impedance together with the
      inductance of the driven loop was expected to create resonant
      features in the retrieved permeability. Moreover, these features
      were expected to be periodic because of the linear phase
      distortions of the amplifier and buffer, and the length of the
      cables, as discussed above. Indeed, the experimentally retrieved
      permeability presented in FIG. 11 clearly shows these features.
      FIG. 11 is a graph showing effective permeability versus frequency
      for this experiment. Moreover, the good agreement between the
      experiment and the theoretical predictions further verify the
      validity of equations (2)-(5).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] These equations facilitate the design of a metamaterial
      particle that could be used to generate a metamaterial having
      negative effective permeability. Thus, assuming that the field
      sensing and field generating loops are kept unchanged, in order to
      increase the magnetic moment generated in response to an applied
      magnetic field, it follows from equation (5) that either the
      concentration of unit cells is increased by decreasing Vuc, or
      increasing Vout. From equation (2), the latter can be achieved by
      increasing the amplifier gain, G, its input impedance, Zin, or by
      decreasing the output impedance, Zout. Thus, assuming a unit cell
      occupying a volume three times smaller than in the previous
      experiments, and a miniature amplifier placed inside the cell next
      to the two loops and having a gain of 40 dB, 200[Omega] input
      impedance, 50[Omega] output impedance, and same linear phase
      distortions as AR 1W1000, it follows from equation (5) that the
      relative permeability shown in FIG. 12 can be achieved. It is
      noted that the oscillatory behavior in this case is caused only by
      the phase distortions of the amplifier which explains the bigger
      period. It follows from equations (2) and (5) that the frequency
      at which zero losses and essentially no dispersion is achieved can
      be tuned by changing the phase delay through the amplifier (i.e.,
      the phase of G) to bring Vout and Vin in phase at the desired
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Further, experiments were conducted on metamaterial
      particles in accordance with the diagram shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 13
      is a graph showing the effective magnetic susceptibility of one
      particle with the power to the amplifier off. The FIG. 13 graph is
      thus the response of the passive elements of the system and shows
      the type of material response that can be obtained with passive
      particles. FIG. 14 is a graph showing the effective magnetic
      permeability with the power on when the particle acts as an active
      metamaterial. In FIG. 14, the permeability variation with
      frequency is completely different, showing that a different class
      of response can be obtained with active metamaterials. Moreover,
      the FIG. 14 graph shows that a magnetic permeability much smaller
      than 1 can be achieved at a frequency where the losses (i.e., the
      imaginary part of the permeability) is zero. This type of response
      can be obtained by use of active metamaterials.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein, an
      array of metamaterial particles may be arranged together. In one
      experiment, five identical metamaterial particles, each containing
      field sensing elements and an active component were arranged in an
      array. These particular particles contained magnetic field sensing
      elements and electric field driven elements as shown in FIG. 3.
      FIG. 15 is a graph showing the transmission amplitude of a signal
      passing through this array in both directions. The transmitted
      signal is strongly attenuated and the array is effectively opaque.
      This demonstrates another way in which active metamaterials can be
      engineered to have properties different than those that can be
      obtained with passive metamaterials.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In conclusion, an architecture for active metamaterial
      particles are disclosed that employ a field sensing element, an
      active electronic component, and a field generating element that
      produces the electric or magnetic dipole moment material response.
      Full design equations for the specific case of an active magnetic
      metamaterial are disclosed herein that were derived and validated
      through single metamaterial particle experimental measurements.
      This active magnetic metamaterial particle exhibits dispersion and
      loss characteristics that are dramatically different from those
      found in passive resonant metamaterials, including frequencies
      where the permeability is less than unity yet with zero loss and
      near zero dispersion. By controlling the amplifier
      characteristics, most importantly the phase, a very wide set of
      metamaterial characteristics can be achieved through this active
      cell approach.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one application, numerous metamaterial particles
      disclosed herein can be embedded in a host matrix for controlling
      the electromagnetic properties of the material. The metamaterial
      particles can produce an electric and/or magnetic dipole moment in
      response to an applied field and, therefore, produce engineered
      permittivity or permeability, respectively, of the material. The
      metamaterial particles can be smaller than a wavelength of the
      applied field.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The subject matter and the experimental results disclosed
      herein demonstrate a metamaterial particle including an active
      electronic component and related methods. As described herein, a
      field sensing element (e.g., a metallic loop to sense a magnetic
      field, and a wire to sense an electric field) can generate a
      voltage proportional to a local electric or magnetic field. An
      active electronic component (e.g. an amplifier), which can be
      contained inside or outside a metamaterial, amplifies this voltage
      and controls its phase. The amplifier can driver a field
      generating element (e.g. a metallic loop to generate a magnetic
      dipole moment, and a wire to generate an electric dipole moment),
      which collectively produces an electromagnetic response in the
      metamaterial. Combinations of different field sensing and field
      generating elements can enable the production of almost any class
      of electromagnetic material response, including anisotropic
      response, off-diagonal response (if the sensing and driven
      elements are not oriented in the same way), and magnetoelectric
      response (if the field sensing and field generating elements are
      of different types).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Because the metamaterial particles described herein are not
      limited to the specific electromagnetic response of passive
      components, the metamaterial particles described herein can yield
      a metamaterial whose properties are essentially constant over a
      significant band of frequencies. The active electronic component
      enables the phase difference between the sensed field and the
      generated field to be controlled, thereby enabling easy design of
      metamaterials with lossless and strong response or negative
      response, or metamaterials with significant gain or loss in
      specific frequency ranges. In contrast, resonator-based passive
      metamaterials are unavoidably lossy and must have properties that
      change strongly with frequency (i.e. narrowband). Removing these
      limitations improves the prospect of functional metamaterial
      applications significantly.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Further, hybrid active-passive metamaterials can be
      provided in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein.
      Such hybrid metamaterials can include both active and passive
      components. Passive metamaterials can generate a strong material
      response very efficiently, but they can be very lossy. This loss
      can be offset by embedding active elements along with resonant
      passive elements. Modest power is needed to produce a net magnetic
      or electric dipole moment to cancel the phase-quadrature response
      of the passive element without significantly modifying its
      in-phase response (which is responsible for the real part of the
      effective permittivity or permeability). Such a hybrid
      metamaterial can be lossless and also suitable for applications
      not possible with passive, lossy metamaterials.<br>

      <b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to antennas, antenna arrays
      and the like, and more particularly to wide angle impedance
      matching (WAIM) using metamaterials in a phased array antenna
      system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Currently existing phased array antenna systems when
      scanned at wide elevation angles, such as past sixty degrees from
      an angle normal or perpendicular to the face of the array,
      experience severe reflections that can prevent detectable signals
      from being transmitted or received. Isotropic dielectric materials
      have been used for impedance matching of phased array antennas in
      attempts to improve at large scan angles but improvements have
      been limited.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention,
      a phased array antenna system may include a sheet of conductive
      material with a plurality of aperture antenna elements formed in
      the sheet of conductive material. Each of the plurality of
      aperture antenna elements is capable of sending and receiving
      electromagnetic energy. The phased array antenna system may also
      include a wide angle impedance match (WAIM) layer of material
      disposed over the plurality of aperture antenna elements formed in
      the sheet of conductive material. The WAIM layer of material
      includes a plurality of metamaterial particles. The plurality of
      metamaterial particles are selected and arranged to minimize
      return loss and to optimize an impedance match between the phased
      array antenna system and free space to permit scanning of the
      phased array antenna system up to a predetermined angle in
      elevation and all azimuthal angles.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention, a communications system may include a transceiver to
      transmit and receive electromagnetic signals and a tracking and
      scanning module coupled to the transceiver. A phased array antenna
      system may be coupled to the tracking and scanning module. The
      phased array antenna system may include a sheet of conductive
      material with a plurality of aperture antenna elements formed in
      the conductive sheet. Each of the plurality of aperture antenna
      elements may be capable of sending and receiving electromagnetic
      energy. The phased array antenna system may also include a wide
      angle impedance match (WAIM) layer of material disposed over the
      plurality of aperture antenna elements formed in the sheet of
      conductive material. The WAIM layer of material includes a
      plurality of metamaterial particles. The plurality of metamaterial
      particles are selected and arranged to minimize return loss and to
      optimize an impedance match between the phased array antenna
      system and free space to permit scanning of the phased array
      antenna system up to a predetermined angle in elevation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention, a method for widening an angular scanning range of a
      phased array antenna system may include forming a wide angle
      impedance match (WAIM) layer of material. Forming the WAIM layer
      of material may include selecting and arranging a plurality of
      metamaterial particles to minimize return loss and to optimize an
      impedance match between the phased array antenna system and free
      space to permit scanning of the phased array antenna system up to
      a predetermined angle in elevation. The method may further include
      disposing the WAIM layer of material on a plurality of aperture
      antenna elements formed in a sheet of conductive material to form
      the phased array antenna system.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] The following detailed description of embodiments refers to
      the accompanying drawings, which illustrate specific embodiments
      of the invention. Other embodiments having different structures
      and operations do not depart from the scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an example of a phased
      array antenna system 100 with a wide angle impedance match (WAIM)
      feature 102 using metamaterials in accordance with an aspect of
      the present invention. The phased array antenna system 100 may
      include a sheet of conductive material 104. A plurality of
      aperture antenna elements 106 or radiating apertures may be formed
      in the conductive sheet 104. The aperture antenna elements 106 may
      collectively send and/or receive electromagnetic energy and, as
      described herein, may be controlled to scan to a large angle
      [theta] of radiation propagation relative to a normal or
      perpendicular angle relative to a front face 108 of the phased
      array antenna system 100 as illustrated by the dashed or broken
      line 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The aperture antenna elements 106 may be uniformly arranged
      to form the phased array antenna system 100. The aperture antenna
      elements 106 may be uniformly spaced from one another by a
      distance X and may have a predetermined opening size or diameter
      D. The distance X and opening size D will be a function of the
      operating parameters of the phased array antenna system 100, such
      as operating frequency and wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Each of the plurality of aperture antenna elements 106 may
      be fed by a waveguide 112. The aperture antenna elements 106 may
      be substantially circular in shape or may be formed in other
      shapes depending upon the desired radiation characteristics or
      other properties. Each of the waveguides 112 may have a
      cross-section corresponding to the shape of the aperture antenna
      elements 106. The waveguides 112 may couple the apertures elements
      106 to a communications system (not shown in FIG. 1) similar to
      that described with reference to FIG. 5 to transmit and receive
      electromagnetic signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] One or more wide angle impedance match (WAIM) layers 114
      and 116 of material may be disposed over the plurality of aperture
      antenna elements 106 formed in the sheet 104 of conductive
      material. Each of the WAIM layers 114 and 116 may include a
      plurality of metamaterial particles 120. The plurality of
      metamaterial particles 120 may be selected and arranged in a
      predetermined order or pattern substantially completely across
      each of the WAIM layers 114 and 116 similar to that illustrated in
      FIG. 2 to optimize an impedance match between the phased array
      antenna system 100 and free space 122 beyond the antenna array
      system 100 and to substantially minimize reflection or return loss
      of electromagnetic signals to permit scanning the phased array
      antenna system up to a predetermined angle in elevation. The dots
      represent additional metamaterial particles. As described herein
      properties of the WAIM layer or layers 114 and 116 may be
      selected, adjusted or tuned to provide substantially minimized
      return loss at an angle of scan [theta] of at least about 80
      degrees to the normal 110 of the front face 108 of the phased
      array antenna system 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Also referring to FIG. 2, FIG. 2 is an example of a wide
      angle impedance match (WAIM) layer 200 of material using
      metamaterials 202 in accordance with an aspect of the present
      invention. The metamaterials 202 are arranged in a predetermined
      uniform pattern to minimize return loss and to optimize an
      impedance match between the phased array antenna system, such as
      system 100 in FIG. 1 and free space 122, to permit scanning a
      radiating wave or electromagnetic signal in the wide angle of at
      least about 80 degrees from the normal 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As determined by the geometry, orientation, topology and
      physical parameters of the metamaterial elements, the
      metamaterials 120 (FIG. 1) or 202 (FIG. 2) may be selected to have
      different electrical and magnetic properties. The plurality of
      metamaterials 120 and 202 may include magnetic metamaterials
      particles and electric metamaterial particles. The magnetic
      metamaterial particles provide or elicit a predetermined magnetic
      response when energized or when radiating or receiving
      electromagnetic energy. The electric metamaterial particles
      provide or elicit a predetermined electrical response when
      energized or when radiating or receiving electromagnetic energy.
      Referring also to FIGS. 3 and 4, FIG. 3 is an example of a
      magnetic metamaterial particle 300 in accordance with an aspect of
      the present invention, and FIG. 4 is an example of an electric
      metamaterial particle 400 in accordance with an aspect of the
      present invention. The exemplary magnetic metamaterial particle
      300 illustrated in FIG. 3 is a split ring resonator (SRR). The
      exemplary electric metamaterial particle 400 illustrated in FIG. 4
      is an electric inductor-capacitor resonator (ELC). The
      configurations or structures of the metamaterial particles 300 and
      400 in FIGS. 3 and 4 are merely examples and other forms of
      magnetic and electric metamaterial particles or other
      subwavelength particles that elicit a specific magnetic and
      electric response as described herein to provide impedance
      matching and a large scan angel [theta] may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The magnetic metamaterial particles 300 and the electric
      metamaterial particles 400 may be periodically arranged in a
      predetermined pattern or order relative to one another similar to
      that illustrated in FIG. 2 to provide the optimum impedance match
      between the phased array antenna system 100 and free space 122 for
      wide angle scanning of the radiation wave or beam. For example,
      the magnetic metamaterial particles 300 and the electric
      metamaterial particles 400 may be interwoven to optimize the
      impedance match and provide the wide angle scanning. In another
      embodiment, a combination of interwoven arrays of two disparate
      magnetic particles may be co-arranged with interwoven arrays of
      two disparate electric particles in order to achieve at least two
      independent magnetic permeabilities and two independent electric
      permittivities in perpendicular directions of three-dimensional
      space. A material without the same magnetic permeability or
      electric permittivity in all three spatial dimensions is known as
      anisotropic. This invention refers to an anisotropic WAIM layer
      made up of subwavelength metamaterial elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The metamaterial particles 300 and 400 may be arranged in
      different patterns in the plurality of WAIM layers 114 and 116 to
      provide different operating characteristics and wide angle
      scanning. The WAIM layers 114, 116 and 200 may also have varying
      thicknesses "T" as illustrated in FIG. 2 which may be adjusted to
      providing varying operating characteristics. The metamaterial
      particles 300 and 400 may be formed on the surface 204 of the WAIM
      layer 200 or may be embedded within the WAIM layer 200 and may be
      arranged in a selected orientation to provide the desired
      operating characteristics of optimum impedance matching and wide
      angle scanning. The WAIM layer 200 may be formed from a dielectric
      material and the metamaterial particles 202 from a conductive
      material, such as copper, aluminum or other conductive material.
      The metamaterials may be formed or embedded in the WAIM layer 200
      using similar techniques to that used in forming semiconductor
      materials, such as photolithography, chemical vapor deposition,
      chemical etching or similar methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The selection and arrangement of the metamaterials 300 and
      400 permit formation of an anisotropic WAIM layer of material
      wherein the material parameters may be different in different
      directions with the layer of material to provide optimum impedance
      matching and minimum return loss or reflection of the
      electromagnetic signal. In accordance with an aspect of the
      present invention, the selection and arrangement of the
      metamaterial particles 300 and 400 permit the permittivity in
      different directions ([epsilon]x, [epsilon]y, [epsilon]z) with the
      WAIM layer and the permeability in different directions ([mu]x,
      [mu]y, [mu]z) to be controlled to optimize the impedance match
      between the phased array antenna system 100 and the free space 122
      and thereby to permit wider angle scanning of the phased array 100
      of at least about 80 degrees than has been previously been
      achievable with other material layers, such as isotropic
      dielectric layers and the like. The geometry and dimensions of the
      elements in the WAIM layer 200 or layers 114 and 116 may also be
      varied to adjust or tune the material characteristics, such as
      permittivity and permeability. There is no limit to the number of
      metamaterial WAIM layers used to provide optimum matching for the
      antenna.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the
      permittivities ([epsilon]x, [epsilon]y, [epsilon]z) in different
      directions or orientation and the permeabilities ([mu]x, [mu]y,
      [mu]z) in different directions or orientations in the WAIM layer
      may be determined by calculating the active element admittance
      that provide the minimum amount of reflected power or in other
      words, provides the maximum ratio of radiated (transmitted) power
      (PT) to input power (PI) at all scan angles theta ([theta]). This
      ratio may be expressed as equation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      PT/PI=(1-[Gamma]([theta]&lt;2&gt;)cos [theta] Eq. 1<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The permittivity and permeability of each element array in
      the WAIM can be determined by quantitatively observing its
      response to an incoming plane wave of light at the design
      frequencies. The process is typically done using commercially
      available software that solve for electromagnetic scattering
      parameters, such as Ansoft HFSS (High Frequency Structure Solver)
      available from Ansoft of Pittsburgh, Pa., CST Microwave Studio
      available from Computer Simulation Technology of Framingham,
      Mass., or similar software. The electromagnetic scattering matrix
      retrieved from a simulation of the physical model of the element
      array is mathematically processed using an "inverse-problem"
      approach so as to extract the permittivity (electric) or
      permeability (magnetic) parameters that would elicit the response
      indicated in the scattering matrix of the element array. This
      process can also be done experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 5 is an example of a communications system 500
      including a phased array antenna system 502 with a WAIM feature
      504 using metamaterials in accordance with an aspect of the
      present invention. The phased array antenna system 502 and WAIM
      feature 504 may be similar to the phased array antenna system 100
      in FIG. 1 and may include a sheet of conductive material 505 with
      a plurality of aperture antenna elements formed therein and WAIM
      feature or layer 504. Similar to that previously described, the
      WAIM feature or layer 504 may include a plurality of metamaterial
      particles similar to those shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. The
      metamaterial particles may be selected and arranged to optimize
      the impedance match between the phase array antenna system 502 and
      free space 506 to permit scanning of a radiation wave 508 to a
      wide angle [theta] relative to a norm (illustrated by broken or
      dashed line 510) from a face 512 of the phased array 502. The wide
      angle [theta] may be at least about 80 degrees relative to the
      norm 510.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The communication system 500 may also include a tracking
      and scanning module 514 to control operation of the phased array
      antenna elements for scanning the radiation beam 508. The tracking
      and scanning module 514 may control phase shifters associated with
      feed waveguides (not shown in FIG. 5) similar to waveguides 112
      illustrated in FIG. 1 to control the scanning of the radiation
      beam 508 through the wide angle [theta] between about 0 degrees
      normal to the array face 512 and about 80 degrees or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The communications system 500 may also include a
      transceiver 516 to generate communications signals for
      transmission by the phased array antenna system 502 to a remote
      station 518 or other object and to receive communications signals
      received by the phased array antenna system 502.<br>
