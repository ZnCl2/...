                "Entirely New Kind Of Generator Invented"</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          ( 1-26-2003 ) TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (UPI) -- An Uzbek inventor
          said he has created a type of electrical generator that does
          not rely on the principle of electromagnetic induction -- on
          which all existing generators are based.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new generator employs a
          concept called magnetic conductivity modulation and it has
          potential applications in industry, communications, households
          and even the military, explained Vladimir Matveev, the
          inventor, a specialist in electronics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matveev said he is convinced
          he has created a fundamentally different machine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"All electrical machines I
          know are based on the principle of interaction between the
          magnetic fluxes (lines of force) of their rotor (rotating
          member) and stator (portion that remains fixed)," he
          explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such machines, Matveev said,
          are based on electromagnetic induction, a property of energy
          discovered by Michael Faraday, an English physicist and
          chemist, in the 19th century. The machines produce electrical
          current either by moving a conductor across a magnetic field
          or by regulating the flux of that field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"My machine has a principal
          difference," Matveev told United Press International. "The
          magnetic field of its stator does not interact with the
          magnetic field of the rotor (because) its rotor is not a
          magnet -- the rotor only changes the magnetic resistance of
          the stator," he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The stator in Matveev's
          generator contains a magnetic core with a permanent magnet and
          a detachable winding. A rotor with changeable magnetic
          resistance is placed at a cutoff point in the core's magnetic
          field. It is composed of alternating magnetic and air parts
          and can operate in either linear or rotary form.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the rotor is set in
          motion, its alternating components pass through the magnetic
          core's cutoff point. When the magnetic part passes through the
          cutoff point its magnetic resistance decreases. When the air
          part passes through, its resistance increases.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This pulsing of resistance
          results in changing the magnetic conductivity of the magnetic
          core, which in turn produces an alternating electrical current
          in the core's winding. The frequency of the winding's current
          can be controlled by regulating the rotor's speed or by
          changing certain qualities of its magnetic or air parts. Also,
          the generator's electrical output -- its voltage -- can be
          controlled by changing the configuration of the rotor's
          components, Matveev explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matveev said his generator
          is different from an invention by Howard Johnson of the United
          States. Johnson discovered how to build motors that can run
          without input of electricity or any other kind of external
          energy. He obtained a patent in 1973 for describing electrical
          generation using only the energy contained in the atoms of
          permanent magnets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matveev also said some
          Russian inventors have experimented with a generator similar
          to his. Their generator changes its magnetic conductivity by
          changing temperature. However, the machine requires a lot of
          time to be heated and cooled alternately and results in a
          current frequency much lower than what generally is used in
          industry. Moreover, the Russian generator requires high steel
          density and greater mass.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matveev's machine generates
          electric energy of industrial frequency. Furthermore, he said
          his machine is simple, reliable and requires less steel and
          mass than conventional generators. It also can be adapted to
          flows of low speeds, such as weak water or wind streams.
          Matveev tested the generator in his former household in
          Kazakhstan before he patented it in Uzbekistan.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I want to pass the invention
          on to all mankind," he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Boris Abdurakhmanov,
          director of the Uzbek Koinot (Cosmos) design office and head
          of the laboratory of semiconductors and photoelectricity of
          the Institute of Electronics of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences,
          told UPI: "Matveev has offered a fundamentally new approach to
          a problem of the creation of electric power generators."</font>
