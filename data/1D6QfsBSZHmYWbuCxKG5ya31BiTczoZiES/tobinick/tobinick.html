      </b><b>METHODS FOR TREATMENT OF BRAIN INJURY UTILIZING BIOLOGICS</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US8900583</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A method of using biologies to treat chronic brain injury or
      spasticity due to stroke, trauma and other causes. Preferred
      embodiments include perispinal, parenteral, transepidermal or
      intranasal use of TNF antagonists. The TNF antagonists include TN
      F receptor fusion proteins, TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
      humanized TNF mAbs, fully human TNF mAbs, chimeric TNF mAbs,
      domain TNF antibodies, mAB fragments, anti-TNF nanobodies,
      dominant negative TNF constructs and TNF inhibitory single chain
      antibody fragments. One of the preferred embodiments of this
      invention is the perispinal administration of etanercept for
      treatment of mammals following stroke. The use of Trendelenburg
      positioning, catheters, pumps, or depot formulations are included.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The use of biologics for treatment of humans with brain injury and
      other forms of neurological injury, including injury due to
      stroke, thrombosis, embolus, ischemia, hemorrhage, trauma,
      cerebral hypoxia or anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, drowning,
      or cardiac arrest.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Lack of adequate oxygenation of brain tissue causes brain injury.
      A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is
      suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts,
      spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells, or when
      the brain or a portion of the brain is deprived of oxygen or
      oxygenation is impaired by exogenous substances such as carbon
      monoxide, hemorrhage, or hypoperfusion. Brain cells die when they
      no longer receive adequate oxygen and nutrients from the blood or
      there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The symptoms of
      a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one
      side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or
      understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;
      sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or
      coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. There
      are several forms of stroke, including: ischemic—blockage of a
      blood vessel supplying the brain, due to thrombosis or embolus,
      and hemorrhagic—bleeding into the brain tissue (intracerebral
      hemorrhage), or into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid
      hemorrhage). Brain injury can also occur from subdural or epidural
      hematoma. Stroke involving the spinal cord can also occur due to
      the same or similar causes of stroke involving the brain
      (ischemia, hemorrhage, hypoperfusion, etc.). Traumatic brain
      injury (TBI), a form of acquired brain injury, occurs when a
      sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the
      head suddenly and violently hits an object, or when an object
      pierces the skull and enters brain tissue. Symptoms of a TBI can
      be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the extent of the
      damage to the brain. A person with a mild TBI may remain conscious
      or may experience a loss of consciousness for a few seconds or
      minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, confusion,
      lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing
      in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, a change
      in sleep patterns, behavioral or mood changes, and trouble with
      memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. A person with a
      moderate or severe TBI may show these same symptoms, but may also
      have a headache that gets worse or does not go away, repeated
      vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, an inability to
      awaken from sleep, dilation of one or both pupils of the eyes,
      slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the extremities, loss of
      coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation.
      Adverse residual neurological and brain effects from TBI occurring
      years before can continue. These chronic adverse effects can
      include difficulties with attention, concentration, planning,
      calculation, reading, vision, hearing, balance and motor
      activities such as walking or use of hands or limbs. Traumatic
      brain injury can occur from repeated trauma to the head, such as
      occurs in contact sports such as football, boxing, or soccer, or
      repeated concussions of any origin.<br>
      <br>
      Cerebral hypoxia refers to a condition in which there is a
      decrease of oxygen supply to the brain even though there is
      adequate blood flow. Drowning, strangling, choking, suffocation,
      cardiac arrest, head trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, and
      complications of general anesthesia can create conditions that can
      lead to cerebral hypoxia. Symptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia
      include inattentiveness, poor judgment, memory loss, and a
      decrease in motor coordination. Brain cells are extremely
      sensitive to oxygen deprivation and can begin to die within five
      minutes after oxygen supply has been cut off. When hypoxia lasts
      for longer periods of time, it can cause coma, seizures, and even
      brain death. Brain injury can also occur due to radiation exposure
      or chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Spasticity is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase
      in muscle tone or stiffness of muscle, which might interfere with
      movement, speech, or be associated with discomfort or pain.
      Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways within
      the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement. It may
      occur in association with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis,
      cerebral palsy, stroke, brain or head trauma, amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegias, and metabolic diseases
      such as adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, and Krabbe disease.
      Symptoms may include hypertonicity (increased muscle tone), clonus
      (a series of rapid muscle contractions), exaggerated deep tendon
      reflexes, muscle spasms, scissoring (involuntary crossing of the
      legs), and fixed joints (contractures). The degree of spasticity
      varies from mild muscle stiffness to severe, painful, and
      uncontrollable muscle spasms. Spasticity can interfere with
      rehabilitation in patients with certain disorders, and often
      interferes with daily activities. (From the National Institute of
      Neurological Disorders and Stroke Spasticity Information webpage).<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention are designed to treat
      mammals, including humans, following stroke or other forms of
      neurological or brain injury (BI). Causes of BI include, but are
      not limited to stroke, automobile accident, anesthesia accident,
      near-drowning, or cerebral hemorrhage. The most common causes of
      BI are stroke, trauma (falls, automobile accidents, or firearm
      accidents); birth injuries or cerebral hypoxia. BI causes
      widespread, unmet medical needs, producing chronic motor deficits,
      spasticity, sensory deficits, cognitive deficits, deficits in
      attention, and alterations in mood and behavior for which current
      medical treatment is inadequate. Cerebral palsy is caused by brain
      injury prior to birth, at birth, or within the first two years of
      life.<br>
      <br>
      Following brain injury various neuropsychiatric disorders may
      develop, including depression, anxiety, agitation, and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD symptoms include
      flashbacks or bad dreams, emotional numbness, intense guilt or
      worry, angry outbursts, feeling “on edge,” or avoiding thoughts
      and situations that remind them of the trauma. In PTSD, these
      symptoms last at least one month (National Institute of Mental
      Health). Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include military
      combat, natural disasters, and violent crime. The methods of the
      present invention may be used to treat the neuropsychiatric
      disorders enumerated above that occur following brain injury.<br>
      <br>
      Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) (the term “TNF” is equivalent to
      and used interchangeably herein with the term “TNF-alpha”) is an
      endogenous molecule that modulates neuronal communication and the
      immune response. TNF plays a key role in the inflammatory
      response, in the immune response, and in the response to
      infection. TNF is formed by the cleavage of a precursor
      transmembrane protein, forming soluble molecules which aggregate
      in vivo to form trimolecular complexes. These complexes then bind
      to receptors found on a variety of cells. Binding produces an
      array of pro-inflammatory effects, including release of other
      inflammatory molecules, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and
      IL-1; release of matrix metalloproteinases; and up-regulation of
      the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, further
      amplifying the inflammatory and immune cascade by attracting
      leukocytes into extravascular tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Interleukins are another group of molecules that modulate the
      immune response. Both TNF and interleukins are cytokines Cytokines
      are a group of endogenous signaling molecules. Therapeutic
      molecules that directly interfere with the biologic effects of
      cytokines (termed “cytokine antagonists”, or, interchangeably
      “cytokine inhibitors”) can be manufactured using biotechnology
      (e.g. recombinant DNA technology), or can be harvested from living
      organisms. Therapeutic molecules created by biologic processes
      derived from a living source are termed “biologics”, in contrast
      to drugs that are chemically synthesized. The living sources may
      include humans, other animals, or microorganisms. Biologics are
      regulated through a specific division of the FDA. Cytokine
      antagonists have been developed for therapeutic human use,
      including biologic TNF antagonists and interleukin antagonists
      that take various forms, such as monoclonal antibodies, domain
      antibodies, antibody fragments, and fusion proteins. “TNF
      antagonist” and “TNF inhibitor” are terms used herein
      interchangeably.<br>
      <br>
      Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are proteins produced by one class of
      lymphocytes (B cells) in response to specific exogenous foreign
      molecules (antigens). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb), identical
      immunoglobulin copies which recognize a single antigen, are
      derived from clones (identical copies) of a single B cell. This
      technology enables large quantities of an immunoglobulin with a
      specific target to be mass produced.<br>
      <br>
      Monoclonal antibodies with a high affinity for a specific cytokine
      will tend to reduce the biological activity of that cytokine
      Substances which reduce the biological effect of a cytokine can be
      described in any of the following ways: as a cytokine blocker; as
      a cytokine inhibitor; or as a cytokine antagonist. In this patent,
      the terms “blocker”, “inhibitor”, and “antagonist” are used
      interchangeably with respect to cytokines. Domain Antibodies
      (dAbs) are the smallest functional binding units of antibodies,
      corresponding to the variable regions of either the heavy (VH) or
      light (VL) chains of human antibodies, and are effective cytokine
      antagonists. Domain antibodies are antibody fragments. Other types
      of antibody fragments, such as pegylated antibody fragments (e.g.
      certolizumab pegol) are effective cytokine antagonists.<br>

      Clemens (Clemens H J. Die Venensysteme der menschlichen
      Wirbsèaule; Morphologie und funktionelle Bedeutung (De Gruyter,
      Berlin, 1961) demonstrated that the internal and external
      vertebral venous plexuses freely intercommunicate. But Clemens did
      not discuss the use of the vertebral venous system (VVS) to
      facilitate delivery of large molecules to the brain, nor did he
      discuss the use of the VVS for therapeutic purposes. Groen (Groen
      R J, Groenewegen H J, van Alphen H A, Hoogland P V. Morphology of
      the human internal vertebral venous plexus: a cadaver study after
      intravenous Araldite CY 221 injection. Anat Rec, 249(2), 285-294
      (1997) confirmed the fact that all three divisions of the VVS
      (internal and external plexuses, and the basivertebral veins)
      freely intercommunicated, and that all divisions of this system
      lacked valves. But Groen did not discuss the use of the VVS to
      facilitate delivery of large molecules to the brain, nor did he
      discuss the use of the VVS for therapeutic purposes. Batson in
      1940 (Batson O V. The Function of the Vertebral Veins and their
      role in the spread of metastases. Annals of Surgery, 112, 138-149)
      published information regarding the vertebral venous system.
      Experimentally he demonstrated a connection between the pelvic
      venous system and the vertebral venous system, and proposed that
      this was a route whereby carcinoma originating in the pelvis could
      metastasize to the spine. His work did not propose the use of the
      VVS for therapeutic purposes, nor did it discuss or imply this
      possiblity. His work did not suggest delivery of biologics to the
      brain. Gisolf (Gisolf J, van Lieshout J J, van Heusden K, Pott F,
      Stok W J, Karemaker J M. Human cerebral venous outflow pathway
      depends on posture and central venous pressure. J Physiol, 560(Pt
      1), 317-327 (2004)) discussed the vertebral venous system and its
      connections to the cranial venous system, but did not discuss the
      potential use of this system as a route of administration of
      biologics to the brain. Retrograde cerebral perfusion has been
      previously demonstrated to deliver dye to the surface of the brain
      in pigs after superior vena caval injection (Ye J, Yang L, Del
      Bigio, et. al. Retrograde cerebral perfusion provides limited
      distribution of blood flow to the brain: a study in pigs. J Thorac
      Cardiovasc Surg. 1997 October; 114 (4):660-5) but the authors did
      not propose the use of this route to deliver biologics to the
      brain. Groen (Groen R, du Toit D, Phillips F, et. al. Anatomical
      and Pathological Considerations in Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and
      Kyphoplasty: A reappraisal of the vertebral venous system. Spine
      29(13): 1465-1471 (2004)) discussed the anatomy and function of
      the vertebral venous system but did not propose the use of the
      vertebral venous system as a route of delivery of biologics to the
      brain. Byrod discussed a mechanism whereby substances applied
      epidurally can cross into the endoneurial space (Byrod G, Rydevik

      horseradish peroxidase to the endoneurial space of dorsal root
      ganglia: a light and electron microscopic study. J Peripher Nerv
      Syst, 5(4), 218-226 (2000)), but does not discuss the perispinal
      use of a biologic for delivery to the brain. Robinson (Robinson W

      antagonism: by what mechanisms could tumor necrosis factor alpha
      antagonists improve rheumatoid arthritis but exacerbate multiple
      sclerosis? Arthritis Rheum, 44(9), 1977-1983 (2001)) states the
      prevailing view that systemic administration of etanercept does
      not lead to therapeutic concentrations of etanercept in the brain,
      because systemically administered etanercept does not cross the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB). Olmarker has filed applications
      regarding the use of anti-TNF molecules for treatment of spinal
      disorders, including US20010027175, 20010055594, 20030176332,
      20050220791, 20010027199, and 20030039651, which have led to U.S.
      Pat. Nos. 6,635,250, 6,649,589, and 7,115,557 and others. None of
      these documents teaches perispinal administration of a biologic
      for delivery to the brain.<br>
      <br>
      The in vivo distribution of radiolabeled etanercept delivered by
      perispinal etanercept in a mammal has been investigated.
      Perispinal administration resulted in more selective delivery of
      etanercept into the cerebrospinal fluid within the cerebral
      ventricles than did systemic (ventral tail vein) administration.

      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the applicable
      protocols by the Stanford Animal Care Committee. Etanercept
      (Immmunex, Amgen) was commercially purchased in powder form.
      Preparation of 64Cu-DOTA
      (1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N?,N'?-tetraacetic acid
      (DOTA)-etanercept was as previously described (Cao Q, Cai W, Li Z
      B et al. PET imaging of acute and chronic inflammation in living
      mice. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging, 34(11), 1832-1842 (2007)). 150
      microliters of 64Cu-DOTA-etanercept solution (ca. 1 mCi) was
      injected overlying the cervical spine of a 250 g Sprague-Dawley
      rat at the C 6-7 level using a 30 gauge needle at a depth of 6 mm
      while the rat was anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane inhalation
      anesthesia. The rat was then placed in the head down position by
      tail suspension for three minutes, immediately followed by
      placement horizontally in the bed of a microPET imaging scanner
      (microPET R4 rodent model scanner, Siemens Medical Solutions USA,
      Inc.) designed for 5-min static scans; the scan was initiated two
      minutes after placement in the scanner bed and was performed from
      five to ten minutes after etanercept administration. The rationale
      for this method of peripheral administration is to deliver
      etanercept into the cerebrospinal venous system. The images were
      reconstructed by a 2-dimensional ordered-subsets expectation
      maximum (OSEM) algorithm, and no correction was necessary for
      attenuation or scatter correction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      MicroPET imaging revealed accumulation of 64Cu-DOTA etanercept
      within the lateral and third cerebral ventricles within minutes of
      peripheral perispinal administration, with concentration within
      the choroid plexus and into the CSF suggested by the microPET
      images.<br>
      <br>
      PET (Positron Emission Tomographic) image, transverse section, of
      a living rat brain following perispinal extrathecal administration
      of 64Cu-DOTA-etanercept, imaged 5 to 10 minutes following
      etanercept administration, gave a pattern consistent with
      penetration of 64Cu-DOTA-etanercept into the cerebrospinal fluid
      in the lateral and third ventricles. A horizontal linear
      enhancement within the lateral ventricles was noted, which is
      suggestive of accumulation of tracer within the choroid plexus.<br>

      The prior art fails to disclose or teach the use of perispinal
      administration without direct intrathecal or epidural injection of
      biologics, as a way of treating brain injury where said biologic
      is delivered via the vertebral venous system, and provides the
      patient with a better opportunity to heal, slows disease
      progression, improves brain function or otherwise improves the
      patient's health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the present invention to provide a method for
      treating a mammal having brain injury with a cytokine antagonist.
      Another object is to administer macromolecules via the vertebral
      venous system for providing suppression or inhibition of specific
      cytokines in a human, to improve neurological function following
      BI. Another object is to administer a biologic into the perispinal
      area, outside of the intrathecal space, via the CSVS, to improve
      neurological function following BI. Another object is to provide a
      biologic delivered via the vertebral venous system so that it
      reaches the brain, retina, cranial nerves, or auditory apparatus
      in a therapeutically effective dose and thereby improves
      neurological function following BI. Another object is to provide
      macromolecules which produce biological effects by inhibiting the
      inflammatory cascade in the human body for the immediate, short
      term (acute conditions) and long term (chronic conditions), such
      that these biological effects will produce clinical improvement in
      the patient and will give the patient a better opportunity to heal
      or otherwise improve neurological function following BI. Another
      object of the invention is to provide novel and improved routes of
      administration for the selected TNF antagonist so that it enters
      the CSVS in a therapeutically effective amount for the treatment
      of a human following BI, such that the use of such antagonist by
      this method results in delay of disease progression in a manner
      that is both safe, effective, and economical. Another object is to
      provide novel and improved routes of administration for the
      selected biologic so that it enters the CSVS in a therapeutically
      effective amount for the treatment of a human following BI such
      that the use of this biologic with this method results in improved
      health in a manner that is both safe, effective, and economical.
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide
      an anti-TNF biologic administered through the perispinal route as
      a new method so that the use of the anti-TNF biologic will improve
      neurological function following BI. Another object of the present
      invention is to provide a method to deliver etanercept across the
      blood-brain barrier so that it is delivered to the brain in a
      therapeutically effective dose and thereby improve neurological
      function following BI.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      biologic administered through the perispinal route as a new method
      of use of such molecules so that the use of these molecules will
      improve neurological function following BI. Another object of the
      present invention is to provide a method to deliver an anti-TNF
      biologic so that it is delivered to the brain or the cerebrospinal
      fluid in a therapeutically effective dose and thereby improve
      neurological function following BI. Another object is to provide
      inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, inhibitors of spleen tyrosine
      kinase, and inhibitors of Jak3 kinase, for treatment of a mammal
      following BI.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      The insult to the brain from each of the mechanisms enumerated
      (including hypoxia, acute deprivation of blood flow, radiation,
      chemotherapy and trauma, etc.) produces an inflammatory response
      that results in chronic glial activation and chronic
      overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF. These
      consequences of brain injury may result in chronic neurological
      and neuropsychological deficits. For the purposes of this patent
      neurological deficits lasting three months or longer after the
      acute brain injury (trauma, stroke, etc.) are considered chronic,
      and are defined as “chronic brain injury.” Chronic sequelae of
      brain injury includes patients who remain comatose or
      semi-comatose for prolonged periods of time.<br>
      <br>
      This invention concerns the use of biologics for treatment of
      humans and other mammals following brain injury (BI), including
      treatment of chronic brain injury. The experimental data developed
      by the inventor has demonstrated, surprisingly, that the methods
      of the current invention may successfully treat mammals that have
      suffered brain injury in the remote past, i.e. months or years
      after the acute event. Preferred embodiments of the present
      invention include treatment of a human or other mammal long after
      initial healing from the acute event, such as more than three
      months, more than six months, more than one year, more than
      eighteen months, more than two years, more than three years or
      more than four years after the acute event. The methods of the
      present invention may also be used to treat sub-acute brain injury
      in the time period of two weeks to three months after the acute
      event. Sub-acute brain injury includes patients who are comatose
      or semi-comatose. The methods of the present invention may be used
      to treat acute brain injury in the time period of less than two
      weeks after the acute event.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention to treat brain injury are to
      be considered distinct from methods to treat well-known and
      characterized neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's
      disease, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease,
      Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Lewy Body disease,
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. The methods of the present
      invention are designed to treat a mammal that has suffered brain
      injury that has generally been the result of discrete events
      (including single discrete events, such as an automobile accident,
      drowning, cardiac arrest, etc.), although a minority of humans
      will have suffered multiple discrete events, such as multiple
      concussions or multiple infusions of chemotherapy).<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention have repeatedly and
      consistently produced unprecedented clinical results which are
      unexplained by established physiology. In other words, the
      clinical results produced by the methods of the present invention
      establish the presence of pathophysiologic mechanisms whose
      existence was previously unknown. These unexpected results
      include, but are not limited to, not only the rapid clinical
      response, beginning within minutes, but also the fact that there
      was any clinical response at all after such long intervals after
      the acute brain injury.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the standard concepts regarding stroke are that it is
      a condition that occurs suddenly due to interruption of blood
      supply to an area of the brain, causing damage to the brain within
      minutes, with rapid death of brain cells (acute stroke). Less
      commonly a stroke can continue to worsen over a period of hours to
      a day or two as a steadily enlarging area of the brain dies
      (“stroke in evolution”). Once the neurological deficits remain
      stable, normally within hours or at most a day or two, the stroke
      is considered completed (“completed stroke”). The inventor's
      concept that a completed and neurologically stable deficit, static
      for months or years, can be reversed, even partially, is a
      significant departure from standard medical and scientific
      conceptions. The inventor's concepts, proven by the clinical
      results produced by the methods of the present invention, that one
      can successfully intervene months or years after the acute event
      is a radical and unexpected departure from the existing paradigms
      of the brain research and medical community. A person of ordinary
      skill in the art would not choose the methods of the present
      invention and, moreover, would not even think to consider their
      use at such a lengthy interval after the injury. A person of
      ordinary skill in the art would consider neurological damage that
      remained fixed for two years or more following an acute brain
      injury (due to a stroke, etc.) to be permanent and irreversible.<br>
      <br>
      Reversal of static neurological deficits beginning within minutes
      as a result of a single perispinal extrathecal injection of a
      biologic (a TNF antagonist, an interleukin antagonist, etc.)
      external to the ligamentum flavum, performed years after an acute
      brain injury, would be considered to be an impossible result by a
      person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of treatment of mammals following BI herein utilize a
      variety of biologics, including, but not limited to biologic TNF
      antagonists; biologic antagonists of inflammatory interleukins,
      such as IL-1 (including, but not limited to, anakinra (Kineret®,
      (Biovitrum) and IL-1 Trap), IL-6, and IL-12 antagonists; GM-CSF;
      EPO; immune globulin (including intravenous immune globulin (IVIG,
      such as Gammagard®)); and other biologics. TNF antagonists used in
      the present invention include, but are not limited to, TNF
      receptor fusion proteins such as etanercept and biosimilar or
      “biobetter” versions of etanercept, or those based upon
      etanercept; chimeric TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as
      infliximab; fully human TNF mAbs such as adalimumab and golimumab;
      TNF mAb fragments, such as certolizumab pegol; domain TNF
      antibodies; anti-TNF nanobodies; humanized TNF mAbs or mAb
      fragments, etc. Methods of administration include, but are not
      limited to, parenteral, perispinal, epidural, transepidermal,
      intranasal, intravenous and intramuscular routes. These methods
      include perispinal administration of a biologic without direct
      intrathecal injection. Perispinal administration is defined as
      administration into the anatomic area within 10 cm. of the spine.
      Perispinal administration results in absorption into the CSVS. In
      preferred embodiments, the method utilizes the CSVS to transport
      biologics to the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid via
      retrograde venous flow, thereby bypassing the blood-brain barrier.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, this invention includes the oral, topical,
      intranasal, perispinal, or parenteral use of inhibitors of p38 MAP
      kinase, inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase, and inhibitors of
      Jak3 kinase to treat BI.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to human use, these methods may be used to treat other
      mammals, including horses, dogs, and cats with conditions
      analagous to BI in humans.<br>
      <br>
      One preferred embodiment is the perispinal extrathecal
      administration of etanercept, or a biosimilar or biobetter form of
      etanercept, for the treatment of a human or other mammal following
      stroke or other forms of BI. This invention also includes other
      preferred embodiments, including but not limited to other methods
      of administration of etanercept to a human with BI, including but
      not limited to parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous,
      transepidermal, and intranasal. Additionally this invention
      includes the parenteral, transepidermal or intranasal use of other
      TNF antagonists to treat BI. These TNF antagonists include, but
      are not limited to: TNF receptor fusion proteins, modified soluble
      TNF receptors, soluble TNF receptor constructs, TNF monoclonal
      antibodies (mAbs), humanized TNF mAbs, fully human TNF mAbs,
      chimeric TNF mAbs, domain TNF antibodies, anti-TNF nanobodies
      (including, but not limited to, ATN-103 and PF-05230905, Ablynx
      and Pfizer), mAB fragments, dominant negative TNF constructs and
      TNF inhibitory single chain antibody fragments. The use of
      catheters, pumps, or depot formulations are included as methods of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred embodiment is the perispinal extrathecal
      administration of etanercept, or a biosimilar or biobetter form
      thereof, for the treatment of spasticity due to brain injury.<br>
      <br>
      One preferred embodiment is the perispinal extrathecal
      administration of etanercept, or a biosimilar or biobetter form,
      for the treatment of spasticity due to spinal cord injury.<br>
      <br>
      Biologic inhibitors of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      can be divided into two broad categories: monoclonal antibodies
      and their derivatives; and TNF antagonists which are not
      antibody-based. In the category of monoclonal antibodies and their
      derivatives belong golimumab, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab
      pegol, and domain antibodies against TNF, such as
      CEP-37247(Cephalon); and biosimilars and “biobetters” of these
      molecules. The category of non-antibody TNF antagonists includes,
      but is not limited to etanercept, pegylated soluble TNF receptor
      type 1 (Amgen) and biosimilars and “biobetters” of these
      molecules. Etanercept has a serum half life of approximately 4.8
      days when administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis on a
      chronic basis. Of the FDA-approved TNF antagonists, etanercept is
      unique because, in addition to being a TNF antagonist, etanercept
      also binds and antagonizes the effect of another cytokine,
      lymphotoxin. Lymphotoxin is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is an
      immune modulator.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal administration of etanercept, or another suitable
      biologic, may be performed more than one time, separated by
      intervals of day(s), week(s), or month(s). A preferred embodiment
      is two doses, separated by an interval of two weeks or one month;
      or three doses each separated by an interval of two weeks to one
      month; or monthly dosing.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred embodiment includes Trendelenburg positioning
      following perispinal administration. However perispinal
      administration without Trendelenburg positioning is also
      effective.<br>
      <br>
      Advances in biotechnology have resulted in improved molecules as
      compared to simply using monoclonal antibodies. One such molecule
      is certolizumab pegol which, rather than being a monoclonal
      antibody is a new type of molecule, that being an antibody
      fragment. By removing part of the antibody structure, the function
      of this molecule is changed so that it acts differently in the
      human body. Another new type of molecule, distinct from monoclonal
      antibodies and soluble receptors, is a fusion protein. One such
      example is etanercept. This molecule has a distinct function which
      acts differently in the human body than a simple soluble receptor
      or receptors.<br>
      <br>
      Cytokine antagonists can take several forms. They may be
      monoclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibody fragments. They may
      also take the form of a molecule derived from a soluble receptor
      to a cytokine, e.g., pegylated soluble TNF receptor type 1.
      Endogenous soluble cytokine receptors circulate freely in the
      body. When they encounter their target cytokine they bind to it,
      effectively inactivating the cytokine, since the cytokine is then
      no longer able to bind with its biologic target in the body.
      However, these endogenous molecules are not generally useful as
      therapeutics without modification, because the half-life is too
      short. For instance, a potent antagonist consists of two soluble
      receptors fused together to a specific portion of an
      immunoglobulin molecule (Fc fragment). This produces a dimer
      composed of two soluble receptors which has a high affinity for
      the target, and a prolonged half-life. This kind of molecule is
      called a fusion protein. An example of such a fusion protein is
      etanercept (Enbrel®).<br>
      <br>
      Golimumab (Simponi®, Centocor) has been FDA-approved for treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis. It may be described as a immunoglobulin
      G1, anti-(human tumor necrosis factor a) (human monoclonal CNTO
      148?l-chain), disulfide with human monoclonal CNTO 148 ?-chain),
      dimer, and has CAS Registry number 476181-74-5. It is a fully
      human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody.<br>
      <br>
      Etanercept (Enbrel®, Amgen/Immunex), golimumab, infliximab
      (Remicade®, Centocor), adalimumab (Humira®, Abbott), and
      certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®, UCB) are potent and selective
      inhibitors of TNF. Etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab
      pegol and infliximab are FDA approved for chronic systemic use to
      treat rheumatoid arthritis and certain other chronic inflammatory
      disorders. Etanercept has a molecular weight of approximately
      150,000 daltons. Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting
      of two soluble TNF receptors fused to a Fc portion of an
      immunoglobulin molecule. This fusion protein functions in a manner
      quite distinct from a simple soluble TNF receptor. Soluble TNF
      receptors are normally present in the human body. But the use of
      these soluble TNF receptors as therapeutic agents for the
      treatment of the conditions of consideration in this patent is
      made impractical by their extremely short half-life and therefore
      their limited biologic activity. The present invention utilizing
      etanercept is therefore distinguished from the use of an
      endogenous soluble TNF receptor. It is incorrect and imprecise to
      describe etanercept as a soluble TNF receptor in view of its
      complex structure and omits characteristics of etanercept which
      are essential to its function. This is further underscored by the
      developmental history of etanercept. In its first iteration the
      precursor molecule to etanercept was produced with a single TNF
      receptor fused to an immunoglobulin fragment. The biologic
      activity of this molecule was poor. Therefore not only is
      etanercept distinguished from an endogenous soluble TNF receptor,
      it is also distinguished from a TNF-binding fusion protein which
      contains the recombinant DNA sequence of only a single soluble TNF
      receptor. The unique structure of etanercept, containing a dimer
      (two) soluble TNF receptors fused to an Fc portion of an
      immunoglobulin molecule, is necessary for the proper performance
      of one embodiment of the present invention. Since etanercept has
      the molecular structure of a fusion protein it is quite distinct
      from soluble TNF receptor type 1. However, use of pegylated
      soluble TNF receptor type 1 to treat BI is also an embodiment of
      the present invention. Unmodified endogenous soluble TNF receptors
      are not suitable as therapeutic agents because their half-lives
      are too short, on the order of seconds. Biosimilar or “biobetter”
      versions of etanercept are in clinical development; their use as a
      substitute for etanercept is a method of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Physiologic barriers which separate the brain from the blood
      include the so-called “blood-brain barrier” (BBB) and the
      “blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier” (BCSFB). These barriers
      consist of a layers of cells that comprise the cerebral capillary
      endothelium (the BBB), and the choroid plexus epithelium (the
      BCSFB). These cellular barriers contain cells that are connected
      by tight junctions (zonulae occludens) that may be 100 times
      tighter than junctions of other capillary endothelium. These tight
      junctions prevent molecules larger than about 600 daltons in
      molecular weight (MW) from traversing the BBB when the molecule is
      administered systemically i.e. by conventional subcutaneous,
      intramuscular, or intravenous injection at an anatomic site remote
      from the spine.<br>
      <br>
      The vertebral venous system (VVS) is an interconnected plexus of
      veins which surrounds the spinal cord and extends the entire
      length of the spine. This venous system provides a vascular route
      from the pelvis to the cranium that is functionally distinct from
      the systemic venous system. First described by Willis in 1663, the
      functional significance of the vertebral venous system was largely
      unappreciated until the work of Batson, who in 1940 proposed that
      this venous plexus provided the route by which prostate cancer
      metastasizes to the vertebral column. The spinal vertebral venous
      system has been termed Batson's Plexus. Because of their anatomic
      and functional continuity, the veins, venous sinuses, and venous
      plexuses of the brain and spine taken together are termed the
      CSVS.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal administration involves anatomically localized delivery
      performed so as to place the therapeutic molecule directly in the
      vicinity of the spine at the time of initial administration. For
      the purposes of this patent, “in the vicinity of” is defined as
      within 10 centimeters of. Perispinal administration includes, but
      is not limited to, the following types of administration within 10
      cm of the spine: parenteral; subcutaneous; intramuscular;
      epidural; transforaminal epidural; interlaminar; or interspinous;
      and specifically includes the use of interspinous injection
      carried through the skin in the midline of the neck or back,
      directly overlying the spine. For the purposes of this patent
      perispinal administration excludes intrathecal administration,
      which carries additional risks of infection and hemorrhage.
      Therefore in this patent “perispinal” is more exactly defined as
      “perispinal (extrathecal)”, but for the purposes of brevity shall
      be designated throughout simply as “perispinal”. Perispinal
      administration leads to enhanced delivery of large molecules to
      the brain and the head and the structures therein in a
      therapeutically effective amount. The conventional systemic modes
      of delivery of these molecules for clinical applications (e.g.
      subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thighs, or arms;
      intravenous; or intramuscular) result in greatly reduced CSF
      delivery and all of the aforementioned systemic modes of
      administration are therefore distinguished from the perispinal
      methods of administration described in this invention. Perispinal
      administration superficial to the ligamentum flavum is
      distinguished from epidural administration, as epidural
      administration requires penetration of the ligamentum flavum.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal administration superficial to the ligamentum flavum
      results in delivery of the therapeutic molecule into the external
      vertebral venous plexus and subsequent delivery into the
      intracerebral portions of the cerebrospinal venous system.<br>
      <br>
      This application concerns methods of use of biologics for
      effective treatment of BI. In one preferred embodiment, these
      methods involve perispinal administration of a biologic without
      direct intrathecal injection. Perispinal administration is defined
      as administration of the molecule into the anatomic area within 10
      cm of the spine.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention may utilize a wide variety of
      biologics, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies,
      fusion proteins, monoclonal antibody fragments, hormones,
      cytokines, and anti-cytokines. In addition to the use of TNF
      antagonists, this invention includes the use of antagonists of
      other inflammatory cytokines, such as antagonists to inflammatory
      interleukins. Inflammatory interleukins include, but are not
      limited to, interleukins 1, 6 and 12. In addition to human use,
      these methods may be used to treat other mammals, including
      horses, dogs, and cats with conditions analagous to BI in humans.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred embodiments include, but are not limited to, the
      perispinal administration of TNF antagonists for treatment of BI.
      Preferred embodiments include but are not limited to the use of
      etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and
      golimumab. Preferred embodiments include but are not limited to
      the use of TNF receptor fusion proteins, modified soluble TNF
      receptors, soluble TNF receptor constructs, TNF mAbs, humanized
      TNF mAbs, anti-TNF nanobodies (including, but not limited to,
      ATN-103 and PF-05230905, Ablynx and Pfizer), fully human TNF mAbs,
      chimeric TNF mAbs, domain TNF antibodies, mAB fragments, dominant
      negative TNF constructs (including, but not limited to Xpro
      1595(Xencor)), and TNF inhibitory single chain antibody fragments
      (including, but not limited to ESBA105). Preferred perispinal
      embodiments include, but are not limited to, epidural,
      transforaminal, interlaminar, and interspinous methods of
      administration, by injection or by catheter. Perispinal
      administration followed by Trendelenburg positioning, or by other
      forms of positioning of the body so that the head is maintained
      below horizontal following administration are additions to the
      preferred embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      One preferred embodiment is the perispinal extrathecal
      administration of etanercept for the treatment of PTSD. This
      invention also includes other preferred embodiments, including but
      not limited to other methods of administration of etanercept to a
      human with PTSD, including but not limited to parenteral,
      subcutaneous, intravenous, transepidermal, and intranasal.
      Additionally this invention includes the parenteral,
      transepidermal or intranasal use of other TNF antagonists to treat
      PTSD. These TNF antagonists include, but are not limited to: TNF
      receptor fusion proteins, modified soluble TNF receptors, soluble
      TNF receptor constructs, TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
      humanized TNF mAbs, fully human TNF mAbs, chimeric TNF mAbs,
      domain TNF antibodies, mAB fragments, dominant negative TNF
      constructs and TNF inhibitory single chain antibody fragments. The
      use of catheters, pumps, or depot formulations are included as
      methods of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Utilization of the vertebral venous system to deliver a biologic
      into the cerebral venous system is one of the preferred
      embodiments. “Cerebrospinal Venous System” (CSVS) is a term coined
      by the inventor in 2006 to describe the confluence of the spinal
      and cerebral venous systems because of their functional and
      anatomic continuity. Utilization of the CSVS to deliver a biologic
      into the cerebrospinal fluid or the brain or spinal cord is a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal administration of a molecule when compared to systemic
      administration carries with it one or more of the following
      advantages for the present invention:<br>
      1) greatly improved efficacy due to improved delivery of the
      therapeutic molecule to the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid.<br>
      2) greater efficacy due to the achievement of higher local
      concentration in the interspinous space, leading to improved
      delivery to the VVS and the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid.<br>
      3) greater efficacy due to the ability of the administered
      therapeutic molecule to reach the brain and cerebrospinal fluid,
      without degradation caused by hepatic or systemic circulation;<br>
      4) more rapid onset of action;<br>
      5) longer duration of action; and<br>
      6) Potentially fewer side effects, due to lower required dosage.<br>
      <br>
      The VVS consists of an interconnected and richly anastomosed
      system of veins which run along the entire length of the vertebral
      canal. The vertebral venous plexus, for descriptive purposes, has
      been separated into three intercommunicating divisions: the
      internal vertebral venous plexuses (anterior and posterior) lying
      within the spinal canal, but external to the dura; the external
      vertebral venous plexuses (anterior and posterior) which surround
      the vertebral column; and the basivertebral veins which run
      horizontally within the vertebrae (see accompanying FIGS. 1, 2,
      2A, 3A, 3B, and 3C). Both the internal and external vertebral
      venous plexus course longitudinally along the entire length of the
      spine, from the sacrum to the cranial vault. Perispinal
      administration of a large molecule will result in efficient
      delivery of the large molecule to the VVS, with only a small
      amount of delivery of the large molecule into the caval venous
      system. Delivery of the same large molecule by intravenous
      infusion into an arm vein, for example, will deliver the large
      molecule to the caval venous system, expose the large molecule to
      dilution throughout the body, and fail to deliver the large
      molecule to the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, or the head as
      efficiently as perispinal administration.<br>
      <br>
      The VVS may be used to introduce a variety of therapeutic
      molecules to the brain, retina, cranial nerves, and head via
      retrograde venous flow from the VVS into the cranial venous
      sinuses and the intracranial venous system. This method bypasses
      the well known barrier which prevents large molecules introduced
      into the systemic circulation from efficiently reaching the brain
      (the BBB). The BBB prevents molecules larger than approximately
      600 daltons from entering the brain via the systemic circulation.
      Virtually all biopharmaceuticals are larger than this. For
      example, etanercept has a molecular weight of 149,000 daltons, and
      insulin has a MW of 5,000 (compared with water which has a MW of
      18). This method is particularly useful, therefore, for the
      administration of macro-molecules (MW larger than 600 daltons),
      such as etanercept, TNF monoclonal antibodies, etc., whose size
      when delivered systemically prevents their efficient passage into
      the brain, but whose potency, because of their biologic origin, is
      extremely high. Effective delivery of these molecules to the brain
      using the methods of the present invention thereby enables
      treatment of BI.<br>
      <br>
      The vertebral venous system is both anatomically and
      physiologically distinct from the venous system which drains the
      abdomen and thorax, which has been designated by others as the
      intracavitary (caval) venous system, with the vertebral venous
      system designated as the extracavitary venous system.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention, in several preferred
      embodiments, include the perispinal administration of the
      biologics of consideration herein which can be accomplished in
      various ways, including transcutaneous interspinous injection, or
      catheter delivery into the epidural or interspinous space, which
      results in the biologics being delivered into the VVS and thence
      into the brain, retina, cranial nerves, spinal cord and auditory
      apparatus in a therapeutic amount.<br>
      <br>
      This invention, in several preferred embodiments, involves the use
      of biologics delivered via the vertebral venous system either
      alone, as monotherapy, or combined with the use of other
      therapeutics delivered orally or otherwise for treatment of the
      conditions of consideration herein.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal extrathecal administration is distinguished from
      intrathecal administration because extrathecal administration is
      both safer (no dural puncture, therefore no risk of CSF leak; less
      risk of hemorrhage; no risk of spinal cord traumatic injury; less
      risk of hemorrhage and infection) and is more effective at
      delivering the therapeutic molecule into the VVS. The dural
      barrier, once crossed, will contain the therapeutic molecule
      within the CSF. CSF flow from the spinal cord to the brain is
      slow. In contrast retrograde flow to the brain via the CSVS is
      much more rapid.<br>
      <br>
      Perispinal administration may be used to deliver biologics other
      than TNF antagonists to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. These
      biologics include cytokine antagonists, and growth factors which
      affect neuronal function, or the immune response impacting
      neuronal function, including, but not limited to: interleukin 1
      antagonists, such as IL-1 RA (Kineret®, Amgen) and IL-1 Trap;
      fusion proteins; BDNF; erythropoietin; GM-CSF; NGF, or other
      compounds with central nervous system (CNS), vascular or immune
      therapeutic activity. Perispinal delivery is particularly
      advantageous when biologics, such as etanercept, which profoundly
      affect neuronal function, are administered because of their
      efficacy at extremely low concentration (high biologic potency).<br>
      <br>
      Localized administration for the treatment of brain disorders has
      many clinical advantages over the use of conventional systemic
      treatment. Local administration of a biologic results in its
      diffusion through local capillary, venous, arterial, and lymphatic
      action to reach the therapeutic target. In addition local
      administration of a macromolecule in the vicinity of the spine
      (perispinal administration) without direct intrathecal injection
      has the key advantage of improved delivery of the molecule to the
      brain via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), thereby bypassing the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB). Delivery into the CSF is enhanced by
      transport via the CSVS. Intrathecal injection also delivers the
      molecule into the CSF, but carries with it the disadvantages of
      possible infection, hemorrhage, and CSF leak through a tear in the
      dura.<br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of this patent “perispinal” is to be considered
      as referring to “perispinal extrathecal”; therefore direct
      intrathecal administration is excluded from the methods discussed.
      Perispinal includes, but is not limited to, interspinous,
      interlaminar, epidural, and epidural transforaminal
      administration. Administration may be by injection or may involve
      the use of an indwelling catheter that reaches the perispinal
      space (epidural, interspinous, etc.). Additionally, perispinal
      administration may involve the use of an implanted pump or
      reservoir, or the use of a depot formulation, including, but not
      limited to a polymer depot formulation used to release a biologic
      TNF antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      The term “treatment” as used herein in the context of treating a
      condition refers to treatment and therapy, whether a human or an
      animal, in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for
      example the inhibition of the progression of the condition or
      illness, and includes the reduction in the rate of progress, a
      halt in the progression of an illness, amelioration of the adverse
      condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic
      measure, as well as combination treatments and therapies are also
      included. As used herein, “therapeutically effective” refers to
      the material or amount of material which is effective to prevent,
      alleviate, or ameliorate one or more symptoms or signs of a
      disease or medical condition, produce clinical improvement, delay
      clinical deterioration, and/or prolong survival of the subject
      being treated. As used herein, “subject” refers to animals,
      including mammals, such as human beings, domesticated animals, and
      animals of commercial value. As used herein, “perispinal
      administration without direct intrathecal injection” refers to an
      administration method that utilizes a needle or catheter to
      deliver the therapeutic molecule within 10 cm of the spine,
      performed so that the needle or catheter does not penetrate the
      dura mater that surrounds the spinal cord. As used herein,
      “chronic brain injury of long standing” refers to a subject who
      has suffered a brain injury at least 12 months previously yet
      continues to present symptoms of brain injury. Preferred methods
      of the present invention also include, but are not limited to, a
      brain injury suffered at least 24 months, 30 months, 36 months, or
      48 months previously. As used herein, “an initial dose containing
      a therapeutically effective amount” of therapeutic means that the
      subject was not treated with that therapeutic before. For the
      purposes of this patent, “spasticity of long standing” is defined
      as spasticity present for at least 24 months.<br>

      </b><b>Clinical Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Case 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A 61 y.o. man presented to the clinic three years after a major
      left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. 36 months earlier,
      following sudden onset of profound aphasia, confusion, and motor
      weakness the patient was taken to a local emergency room (ER). In
      the ER there was right hemiplegia and complete aphasia. Computed
      tomographic (CT) brain scan did not show bleeding. The patient was
      transferred to a regional hospital for consideration of
      intra-arterial treatment because the three-hour cutoff for
      initiation of intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment was missed.
      Arteriography demonstrated occlusion of the anterior branch of the
      left MCA. Intra-arterial reteplase infusion resulted in partial
      resolution of thrombus and partial reperfusion. Repeat CT scans
      demonstrated acute cerebral infarction in the distribution of the
      left middle cerebral artery with edema in the left frontal,
      temporal and parietal lobes and midline shift. Maximal midline
      shift was 11 mm six days following the stroke. The patient
      required 10 days of intensive care and one month of inpatient
      rehabilitation. While in the intensive care unit (ICU) he could
      not talk and had no purposeful movement in his arms or legs. After
      three weeks in the hospital he began to be able to move his legs.
      At time of discharge home there was movement in the right leg but
      none in the right arm and profound expressive aphasia persisted.
      There was also cognitive impairment: for example, he could not
      comprehend how to use a television remote control. Two months
      after the stroke he could still not speak intelligible words. With
      time right leg motor abilities recovered substantially, but motor
      function of the right upper extremity and speech remained severely
      limited. The patient had a previous history of hypertension,
      hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease,
      and myocardial infarction. Diabetes was well controlled. Current
      medications included aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole,
      extended release niacin, escitalopram, metformin, pravastatin,
      glipizide, and zolpidem.<br>
      <br>
      At presentation to the clinic three years after the stroke, the
      subject's wife reported that his speech and language abilities
      remained severely limited; useful function of the right hand was
      absent and of the right upper extremity was extremely limited;
      there were limitations in gait including a chronic limp and
      inability to run; and there were persistent cognitive limitations.
      Included in the cognitive limitations were the inability to tell
      time, whether from a wristwatch or a wall clock; to dial a
      telephone, even when the phone number to dial was prominently
      displayed next to the telephone; to enter a series of four numbers
      into a numeric keypad, such as for a gate entry; to type a
      sentence on a computer keyboard, despite multiple attempts by
      family members to so instruct; and the inability to select the
      appropriate utensil for eating (he persisted in choosing a fork
      for sipping soup; and when using a fork or a knife would often
      attempt to use it oriented incorrectly, e.g. upside down). His
      wife reported that despite suffering repeated burns on his hands
      he continued to remove hot dishes from the oven without using
      insulated hand protection.<br>
      <br>
      On examination there was severe non-fluent expressive aphasia.
      Motor speech was characterized by severe oral and verbal apraxia
      with deficits in articulatory agility and moderately impaired
      suprasegmental features of speech. The patient had difficulty
      verbalizing more than one word at a time and difficulty with
      correct pronunciation of single words and multiple consonants.
      There was a right hemiparesis involving the face, upper extremity
      and leg, with right hemi-anesthesia involving the face, lips,
      upper extremity and leg. There was spasticity of the right upper
      extremity. The right hand was held in a persistent flexor position
      with inability to extend or use the fingers. Range of motion of
      the right upper extremity was limited; he could not bring his
      right arm behind his back and could not elevate his upper arm
      above his head without difficulty. Raising his right arm took
      concentrated mental effort. He walked with a decided limp and
      could not ambulate quickly. Neurocognitive testing was performed.
      The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score was 26/30 and the Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score was 23/30 indicating mild
      cognitive impairment. An activities of daily living (ADL)
      inventory (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of
      Daily Living Scale) documented functional difficulty with daily
      tasks with a score of 61/78. Time to walk a measured 20-meter
      distance down the office corridor was 19.8 seconds and 23.0
      seconds returning. When asked to walk quickly the times were 16.5
      seconds and 17.0 returning.<br>
      <br>
      Following informed consent, perispinal etanercept 25 mg was
      administered in aqueous solution (time zero) followed immediately
      by Trendelenburg positioning. Within two minutes, while still
      inclined on the treatment table, his speech was more distinct.
      Upon resuming the sitting position at five minutes he used his
      right arm to help reposition his body when arising from the
      Trendelenburg position, something that he had not been able to do
      in the three years since his stroke, and he stated “I woke up”. At
      nine minutes he recited the alphabet with improved clarity of
      speech: the letters were more distinct and recited more quickly.
      At ten minutes he noted sensation in his right arm and improved
      mobility in his right arm. At 16 minutes he indicated that he had
      sensation in his right cheek; at 20 minutes sensation was present
      in his right ear and he was able to place a cotton swab into his
      right ear canal with his left hand. At 20 minutes sensation was
      present in his right oral cavity and in his right upper lip. At 25
      minutes there was sensation in the right leg. At 27 minutes he was
      able to squat without difficulty. At 28 minutes he was able to
      walk down the hallway corridor noticeably faster than he had been
      able to walk before perispinal etanercept. Within 30 minutes there
      was reduction in right arm spasticity. At 45 minutes he was able
      to correctly dial a telephone number for the first time since his
      stroke. He spoke with his daughter, and then dialed his son's
      telephone number and spoke with him. Several minutes later he
      demonstrated that he was able to sit and arise from a deep sofa
      without difficulty and without assistance. He danced with his wife
      and demonstrated a golf swing. His standing balance was improved.
      At one hour a lunch break was taken. During the break his wife
      observed the following, all notable improvements when compared
      with his pre-treatment function: He chose and used a spoon
      correctly for sipping soup. He placed a soda glass correctly on
      the table in relation to the dishes in a single attempt. The
      liquid in the glass was not spilled when moved. Soda was obtained
      from the self-service dispenser without difficulty. The lunch menu
      was read correctly without difficulty with correct recitation of
      “sandwich” and “quesadilla”. He ordered his own lunch from the
      server and his wife did not have to help with translation. He was
      able to read a clock in the cafeteria and recite the correct time
      for the first time since his stroke. He returned to the clinic. At
      two hours he was able to walk 20 meters in 10.1 seconds and return
      in 11.6 seconds. He and his wife returned to their hotel. At 46
      hours they returned to the clinic. His wife reported that in the
      hotel two hours before (at 44 hours), for the first time since the
      stroke, he was able to recognize the letters on a computer
      keyboard and slowly type a sentence. His improvements in motor
      function, sensation, cognition, and behavior had all continued
      without diminution. Motor function had further improved: he had
      better physical endurance, was able to match his wife's normal
      walking pace and was able to run for the first time since his
      stroke. Sensation had further improved, returning in the right
      leg, ankle, and back of heel and to his right frontal scalp.
      Speech was less effortful, with improved clarity. He was able to
      count to 50 rapidly and without difficulty. He was able to
      consistently tell time by looking at a clock or a watch, and his
      wife observed that he was more conscious of time.<br>
      <br>
      The patient and his wife returned home. At home he was able to
      shave his entire face with a manual razor for the first time since
      the stroke, and did so every day. His wife attributed this to a
      combination of his renewed ability to feel the right side of his
      face, improved spatial control of his left hand, and improved
      dexterity of his left hand. His wife noted that he had begun
      speaking with others during their everyday life, and that family
      members noted that his speech was more distinct and more easily
      understood. He remembered to use an insulated hot pad when
      removing dishes from the oven.<br>
      <br>
      He returned to the clinic 22 days later. All clinical improvements
      had been maintained. A repeat ADL inventory score improved to
      65/78. Repeat neurocognitive testing was performed. MMSE improved
      to 28/30, and MOCA improved to 27/30. The patient requested
      another dose of etanercept. After obtaining written consent, 25 mg
      perispinal etanercept in aqueous solution was administered
      followed by five minutes of Trendelenburg positioning as before.
      Within ten minutes of this second etanercept dose his speech
      appeared to be more distinct with improved articulation of sounds.
      Eight hours later he was able to dorsiflex his right wrist for the
      first time since the stroke. The following day in the clinic
      volitional right wrist dorsiflexion and visible activation of the
      right hand second dorsal interosseous muscle were observed. Speech
      was more distinct.<br>
      <br>
      One month after the first dose there was further improvement in
      strength of his right arm and in clarity of speech. He was able to
      remove the twist-off tops of bottles for the first time since the
      stroke. At five weeks he was able to correctly drive a manual
      transmission automobile. He had previously attempted this prior to
      etanercept administration but was unsuccessful, as he was unable
      to co-ordinate the clutch/accelerator and shift activities. At
      seven weeks, clinical improvement was maintained and no adverse
      effects had been experienced. Clinical improvement has persisted
      for more than 10 months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 2</b><br>
      <br>
      A 49 y.o. man presented to the clinic 35 months after a brainstem
      stroke. Three years earlier he had awoken with paresthesia in the
      left arm and leg, followed by increasing weakness of the left arm
      and leg. In the ER his symptoms worsened. MRI of the brain
      revealed a right medullary infarction (FIG. 2). The patient
      required eight days of acute hospitalization and one month of
      inpatient rehabilitation. Left leg motor recovery began after one
      to two weeks but the patient was left with a severe residual gait
      disturbance and severe paresis of the left upper extremity.
      Initially there was also transient left facial paresthesia and
      speech difficulty, both of which resolved within two weeks. At
      time of discharge home walking was only possible with the
      assistance of a walker or a quad cane, and there was hypoesthesia
      in the left upper and lower extremities, with painful paresthesia
      in the left upper extremity. At presentation to the clinic all of
      these neurological deficits had been stable for at least one year
      without change. The patient had a history of hypertension and type
      2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes was well controlled. Current
      medications included amlodipine, metformin, metoprolol, losartan,
      simvastatin, clonidine, gabapentin, glipizide, aspirin and
      extended-release dipyridamole and liraglutide.<br>
      <br>
      On examination he had difficulty maintaining his balance upon
      standing without using his right arm for assistance. He had a left
      hemiparesis, with severe weakness of his left upper extremity,
      moderate weakness of the left lower extremity, and hypoesthesia of
      his left extremities. Speech and cognition appeared normal.
      Walking was slow, requiring 1:56 minutes going and 2:03 minutes
      returning to walk the 20 m office corridor distance using a
      standard walker for assistance.<br>
      <br>
      Following informed consent perispinal etanercept 25 mg was
      administered in aqueous solution, followed immediately by five
      minutes of Trendelenburg positioning. At 9 minutes following the
      etanercept dose the patient stood up from the exam table. His
      standing balance was notably improved and was accomplished without
      difficulty and without use of the right arm for stabilization.<br>
      <br>
      At 30 minutes he again walked the 20 m office corridor distance
      with a standard walker for assistance. Times to complete were 1:20
      minutes going, 1:21 returning. Walking required visibly less
      effort. The patient returned at 10 days. He walked the 20 m office
      corridor using a standard walker for assistance. Times to complete
      were 1:06 minutes going, 1:11 returning. At 17 days the patient
      returned to the clinic. He reported maintenance of his clinical
      improvement, with walking continuing to be faster and to require
      less effort than prior to etanercept. He also said that he felt
      that he was able to incorporate his left arm in normal daily
      activities (to the extent possible) with less effort. On
      examination his stride was longer and his gait more fluid than
      prior to perispinal etanercept administration. Improved walking
      speed was maintained, with time to walk 20 m with a standard
      walker measured at 1:13 down the corridor and 1:10 back. At the
      end of three weeks the clinical improvements were maintained. At
      24 days, after written informed consent, a second 25 mg dose of
      perispinal etanercept was administered. At 10 minutes after the
      dose, time to walk 20 m with a standard walker was measured at
      1:03 down the corridor and 1:03 back. At one month after the first
      dose clinical improvement was maintained, including improvement in
      walking ability and subtle improvements in motor control of his
      left upper extremity. No adverse effects of etanercept were noted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 3</b><br>
      <br>
      A 58 y.o. man presented to the clinic 13 months after a right MCA
      territory stroke. On the day of the stroke left-sided weakness
      began in the morning abruptly. In the ER he had a left
      hemiparesis, no spontaneous movement in the left upper extremity,
      2/5 movement of the left lower extremity, a left facial droop, and
      was unable to move his eyes to the left. Brain CT initially showed
      no bleed and CT angiogram showed a 1 to 1.5 cm clot in the right
      MCA. Subsequent brain CT showed acute infarction in the territory
      of the right MCA. Acute thrombolytic therapy utilizing intravenous
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given followed by
      increasing mental confusion but improved vision and control of the
      left lower extremity. He was transferred into the ICU. Repeat CT
      showed a 0.75 square centimeter bleed in the pons in addition to
      the right hemispheric stroke, with a subsequent CT at six days
      showing a stroke in the distribution of the right MCA with a mass
      effect from cerebral edema compressing the right lateral ventricle
      (FIG. 3). He was managed in the ICU for seven days and then
      transferred to inpatient rehabilitation. After 10 days he was able
      to walk with some assistance. He was discharged home after five
      weeks. At the time of discharge home he had a persistent left
      hemiparesis, with left facial droop, clumsiness of his left upper
      extremity and severe functional difficulty using his left hand,
      mild weakness of the left leg, hypoesthesia of the left upper
      extremity, left leg and foot, and constant pain in his left arm
      and hand that was exacerbated by firm gripping with the left hand.
      The patient had a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
      and coronary artery disease.<br>
      <br>
      Upon presentation to the clinic the patient reported no
      improvement in his neurological symptoms for at least the past six
      months, with persistence of all listed neurologic deficits. He
      reported severe difficulties using his left hand: inability to
      perform fine movements, such as stuffing envelopes; difficulty
      dressing, with inability to buckle his belt or unbutton buttons,
      and difficulty preparing food, with a tendency to burn his hand.
      He reported difficulty in placing postage stamps on an envelope in
      the correct orientation. He noted that he could not correctly
      gauge the spatial location of his hand with his eyes closed: he
      could not tell if it was up, down, in front, or in back of his
      body. Since his stroke he had been unable to place his hand in his
      pants pockets, either front or back due to both his inability to
      direct his hand in space accurately and also the fact that his
      first remained clenched. He was able to hold objects in his left
      hand but could not maintain the grip without constant attention:
      when he held liquid in a cup he would spill or drop it. He could
      not control the pressure of the grip of his left hand. His current
      medications were lisinopril, simvastatin, aspirin, gabapentin, and
      venlafaxine.<br>
      <br>
      On examination there was a left facial droop, increased tone and
      spasticity in the left upper extremity, a mild left hemiparesis,
      and resting closed flexion of the left hand. The left hand was
      clumsy, with dysdiadochokinesis. Left hand tapping rate was slow
      (measured at 2.8 Hz). There was marked difficulty with two-handed
      handling and folding of letter paper. There was left
      hemi-hypoesthesia with inability to sense pinprick. Seated with
      his eyes closed with both arms held out the left arm drifted
      upward. There was dysdiadochokinesis of the left hand. Hand grip
      strength was left/right=32/36. The left hand grip strength test
      produced marked discomfort in the left hand. There was balance
      difficulty while standing with the eyes closed. The patient walked
      with a persistent clenched first and with a slight limp. Times for
      walking 20 m in the office corridor were 13 seconds out and 14
      seconds back. On neurocognitive testing, MMSE was 26/30 and MOCA
      was 23/30, indicating borderline impairment.<br>
      <br>
      Following informed consent perispinal etanercept 25 mg was
      administered in aqueous solution (time zero) followed immediately
      by five minutes of Trendelenburg positioning. Following etanercept
      the following improvements were noted: beginning at seven minutes
      his left facial droop had improved; at eight to ten minutes his
      left hand exhibited improved dexterity, tapping speed was faster
      (left hand tapping speed was videotaped and measured at 5.5 Hz),
      left hand diadochokinesis was faster and left hand finger-to-nose
      was faster; at 11 to 15 minutes sensation in the left cheek, hand,
      arm, and shin were improved; there was increased strength in the
      left knee extensors and the hands, with hand grip strength
      left/right=36/40, and he was able to correctly perceive the
      spatial location of his left hand. Firm gripping during the left
      hand grip strength test did not produce pain. At 16 minutes he was
      able to place his left hand in both his left front and left back
      pants pockets for the first time since his stroke and his gait was
      more fluid. At 20 minutes he was able to buckle his belt with his
      left hand. Within 45 minutes he was able to open a water bottle,
      hold a water bottle without dropping it and page through a
      magazine, all with his left hand, all tasks he could not similarly
      accomplish prior to etanercept, and the pathological upward drift
      of his left arm with his eyes closed present prior to etanercept
      administration was markedly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      At 48 hours he reported maintenance of all clinical improvements.
      He was no longer spilling his coffee cup when held in his left
      hand and had less pain in this left arm and hand. He reported that
      his sense of balance while walking was improved. At seven days all
      previous clinical improvements were maintained. In addition he
      reported improvement in memory and conversational abilities, was
      able to buckle and unbuckle his belt and button and unbutton
      buttons and reported improved ability to use his left hand in
      everyday tasks. Hand grip strength was left/right: 40/40. At 13
      days his previous clinical improvements were maintained, and there
      was evidence of additional improvement. His gait was more fluid
      and he noted his balance while walking was better. Times for
      walking 20 m were 10 seconds out and 10 seconds back. During
      conversation there was notably more expressive movement with the
      left arm and hand. The patient's partner said that at home his
      improved abilities to use his left arm and hand were remarkable,
      and that one week after the dose of etanercept he was able to pick
      up single playing cards and deal cards with his left hand, tasks
      he had been unable to perform with that hand prior to receiving
      etanercept. On repeat neurocognitive testing MMSE was stable at
      26/30, MOCA was significantly improved at 29/30, and on
      examination he was able to deal playing cards with his left hand
      and pick up single playing cards with his left hand as his partner
      had reported. At 20 days the patient reported that the clinical
      improvement in his left hand had begun to diminish. At 26 days he
      returned to the clinic. He was able to manipulate shoe laces with
      his left hand with some difficulty, a task he was unable to
      perform prior to etanercept, but he reported that motor control of
      his left hand was not as good as it had been ten days earlier.
      After written informed consent a repeat 25 mg dose of perispinal
      etanercept was administered. Following the dose within thirty
      minutes he was able to lace his own shoes using his left and right
      hands together more easily than prior to the dose and improvement
      in his left facial droop was noted. At one month clinical
      improvement from baseline continued with no adverse effects noted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 4:</b><br>
      <br>
      A 37-year-old right-handed male who had sustained a severe
      traumatic brain injury with residual deficits 20 years previously,
      at the age of 17, when he was involved in an automobile accident.
      At the time he was hospitalized and comatose for three months, and
      after regaining consciousness required further hospitalization for
      rehabilitation for an additional six months. He suffered a right
      hemiparesis, severe memory impairments and motor and co-ordination
      difficulties bilaterally. He was able to finish high school two
      years later in a wheelchair. Prior to treatment he complained of
      difficultly with motor control, with loss of dexterity more
      prominent on the right than on the left side, and having
      difficultly completing simple tasks because of motor deficits as
      well as being dependent on a wheelchair.<br>
      <br>
      Neurological examination revealed speech that was articulated with
      normal amplitude in a hypo-productive, indistinct, slowed and
      slurred quality with mild dysarthria. He was tested with a
      standarized, normed test of letter verbal fluency, the FAS test.
      He listed nine words starting with the letter F, four words
      starting with the letter A and eight words starting with the
      letter S in a 60 second trial period for each letter. It took the
      patient 16 seconds to read a list of ten words of increasing
      complexity. His affect was labile, fluctuating from a euthymic
      relaxed jocular state to becoming easily angered and irritable. He
      had mildly impaired simple attention performing serial three
      subtraction, subtracting down from 100 to 29 in 105 seconds but
      then stopping making one error. It took over 10 seconds to attempt
      to spell the word “world” backwards making one error. He could not
      perform serial sevens. He was able to list the days of the week in
      reverse order but took 10 seconds to perform this task, below
      expectation. He was not able to list the months of the year in
      reverse order. Abstractions: the patient was able to tell me how a
      watch and ruler, or train and bicycle were similar, but could not
      tell me how honesty and charity were similar. Memory: The patient
      took three repetitions to retain three memoranda but after five
      minutes the patient could not retrieve any of the memoranda. He
      could not remember his examiner's name despite four repetitions
      throughout the examination. Cranial nerves: pupils were 3 mm and
      one plus reactive directly and consensually to light. His visual
      fields were full to confrontation and extra ocular motions were
      conjugate and full. Bell's phenomena deviated to the right. There
      was full facial sensation but facial asymmetry was noted with a
      wider palpebral fissure and flattening of the nasolabial fold
      appreciated on the left side. He had normal palate, normal
      sternocleidomastoid, normal trapezius and normal tongue
      functioning. Motor: He maintained his right upper extremity in
      somewhat of a flexed abducted posture with intermittent ataxic and
      dystonic axial motion i.e., slow-moving in a seated position. He
      had loss of fine motor control of his right hand with slowed
      finger to finger and incomplete grasp of the right upper
      extremity. He had marked clasp knife tone of his right upper
      extremity and a right sided pronater drift and Hoffman sign more
      prominent on the right but also present on the left. There was an
      extensor toe response more prominent on the right but also present
      on the left. There was marked slowing of rapid alternating
      movement in the right upper extremity, moderate slowing of the
      left with mirror movement. He had full strength of his proximal
      upper extremities, both lower extremities and his left hand. He
      had impaired heel to knee and heel to shin more prominent on the
      right but also on the left. There was equinus posturing of his
      right lower extremity with a subtalar Charcot joint. He was able
      to walk with impaired balance using a walker taking 174 seconds to
      walk 20 meters. Joint position, pinprick, vibration and light
      touch was intact.<br>
      <br>
      Following written informed consent, 25 mg aqueous etanercept was
      administered by perispinal injection without direct intrathecal
      injection. More specifically, etanercept was administered by
      perispinal injection overlying the posterior cervical spine within
      five centimeters of the spinal cord but external to the ligamentum
      flavum, in the interspinous space. The injection was extrathecal.
      The injection was followed by brief prone positioning for 30
      seconds and then the examination table was tilted with the head
      below horizontal, in the Trendelenburg position. Repeat
      neurological examination was performed 15 minutes after perispinal
      etanercept administration.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The patient appeared more relaxed with less anatalgic
      shifting. His speech pattern was markedly improved with a decrease
      in the dysarthric indistinct quality and an increase in the speed
      of production that was apparent to all observers. His ability to
      read a simple story and abstract concepts was compared in a pre-
      and post-administration form where the speed of reading increased
      from 89 seconds before perispinal etanercept to 64 seconds after
      perispinal etanercept administration. He was unable to initially
      abstract the concept of a short story prior to perispinal
      etanercept but after use perispinal etanercept was able to
      abstract the concept. His ability to read a list of increasing
      complex words was objectively improved, in both clarity and the
      time to completion of task was decreased, taking ten seconds to
      read the identical word list, a significant improvement. Following
      perispinal etanercept his FAS score improved by a total of eight
      words, (-1) words beginning with F, (+8) words beginning with A,
      and (+3) words beginning with S. He used six identical words in
      the pre- and post-test scores.<br>
      <br>
      His ability to move appeared more fluid with a noticeable and
      significant decrease of his ataxic spasticity. The clasp knife
      tone of his right upper extremity was improved as well as his
      ability to perform rapid alternating movements. His gait although
      still impaired and slowed appeared more fluid and less patterned.
      His posture appeared less ataxic and less anatalgic. His time to
      walk 20 meters was significantly faster, 134 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory data: A three Tesla MRI examination of the brain was
      performed which revealed bilateral lateral ventricular dilatation
      more marked posteriorly with cortical atrophy, a dilated right
      anterior temporal horn and atrophy of the head of the hippocampus.
      There was atrophy of the entire corpus callosum. Hemosiderin
      deposition was noted in the left posterior paraventricular white
      matter extending to the left posterior centrum semiovale with a
      discrete small focus in the left putamen and right posterior limb
      of the internal capsule. Diffusion tensor imaging showed white
      matter track loss bifrontally and biparietally, more prominent on
      the left than the right.<br>
      <br>
      The patient was examined weekly for one month following the single
      initial perispinal etanercept dose. He remained significantly
      clinically improved for the entire one month period, with improved
      balance, clarity of speech, decreased spasticity, more fluid gait,
      improved attention, and improved mood. He reported that it was
      easier for him to perform motor tasks including walking and
      dressing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 5:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 23 y.o. man sustained a mild traumatic brain injury two years
      previously due to immediate proximity to an explosion while in
      military combat. Two years earlier in Iraq he was hit by a blast
      from an IED (improvised explosive device). The explosion knocked
      him down. He could not move or talk for a brief period of time. At
      the time his MACE (Military Acute Concussion Evaluation) score was
      21/30. Two years after the explosion he exhibited trouble
      calculating, spelling, reading; difficulty sleeping; headaches;
      light sensitivity, easy arousal and startle responses, and change
      in personality (more anger, irritability and frustration). He
      demonstrated irritability and outbursts of anger at work and at
      home. He reported nightmares, avoidance of situations that would
      remind him of his blast injury, being constantly on guard,
      watchful, and easily startled. Following the explosion he
      developed bilateral upper extremity dysmetria resulting in
      bilateral intention tremor, difficulty arising from a sitting
      position, impairment in immediate memory and cognition, and
      adverse changes in mood and affect all of which persisted and were
      found to be present upon his presentation to the clinic.<br>
      <br>
      Examination revealed reduced attention, concentration, reading
      abilities, and abnormal scores on standarized cognitive testing.
      He seemed irritable and somewhat withdrawn. Mini-mental state
      examination score was 22/30; Montreal Cognitive Assessment score
      was 20/30. MACE score before treatment was 24/30. The patient
      fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria for PTSD.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was read as normal. After
      neurologic examination written informed consent for the perispinal
      administration of etanercept was obtained. Etanercept in sterile
      water as administered by perispinal injection in the interspinous
      space superficial to the ligamentum flavum between the sixth and
      seventh cervical spinous processes while the patient was sitting
      on the examination table. The injection was extrathecal. The
      patient was then placed supine on the table, and then turned into
      the prone position. While he was turning he reported the onset of
      a euphoric-like sensation (which persisted for approximately 18
      hours). He was then placed in the Trendelenburg position for five
      minutes, with the examination table tilted with the head below
      horizontal, and then returned to the sitting position.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The patient had onset of clinical improvement within two
      minutes of perispinal etanercept injection, even before assuming
      the Trendelenburg position. At ten minutes following injection
      there were significant and noticeable improvements in posture,
      range of motion, ability to arise from the sitting position,
      improvement in bilateral intention tremor, and improvement in
      immediate memory and cognition. His mood was improved, and his
      personality had changed. He was more affable and the irritability
      was gone. MMSE improved by two points to 24/30; there was
      improvement in reading and number span. At two weeks after a
      single 25 mg perispinal dose of etanercept there were continued
      and marked improvements in multiple PTSD symptoms, including those
      associated with intrusive recollection and hyper-arousal.
      Interactions with co-workers improved. The improvements were
      clinically significant and prolonged. There were improvements in
      PTSD symptoms and signs, including improvements in mood,
      cognition, and behavior as a result of etanercept administration.
      The patient was followed as an outpatient. He had persistent
      clinical improvement in motor function, cognitive abilities,
      irritability, mood, and work performance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 6:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 46 y.o. man had suffered a head injury secondary to a car
      accident in 1988 that left him comatose for six weeks. The
      accident has left him with persistent left hemiplegia, dysarthria,
      visual disturbances (diplopia and nystagmus), cognitive
      weaknesses, and difficulties with memory and attention.<br>
      <br>
      Six days prior to the patient's visit to the clinic
      neuropsychological testing was performed documenting a lowered
      neurocognitive profile suggestive of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
      Category verbal fluency (animal naming) was borderline to low
      average, with a score of 15 (8-10 percentile) (normal mean=21.9
      SD=5.4). Visual recognition of the slope of lines (Judgement of
      Line Orientation (JLO)) was low average with a score of 22/30 (22
      percentile). Six days following neurocognitive testing the patient
      presented for examination. This clinic visit was 22 years after
      the automobile accident that had caused severe traumatic brain
      injury. He came to the clinic in a wheelchair with an obvious left
      hemiplegia, slurred speech, diplopia, nystagmus, and inability to
      walk without assistance.<br>
      <br>
      Motor skills of his left extremities were examined. Movement of
      his left extremities required extreme mental effort. There was
      increased tone (spasticity) of left arm, hand, fingers, and left
      leg. Movement of the fingers was severely impaired. Movement of
      the left wrist was impaired. Movement of the left upper arm was
      greatly impaired. Movement of the left heel down the left shin
      appeared to require extreme mental effort and was impaired. The
      patient was unable to ambulate with a quad cane without
      substantial physical assistance. Ambulation required extreme
      mental and physical effort. The patient was unable to transfer
      into or out of his wheelchair without substantial physical aid.<br>
      <br>
      Reading skills were carefully examined. The patient was given
      multiple short stories to read aloud prior to etanercept
      administration. The patient exhibited dysarthria, slurred and
      indistinct speech, and impairments in reading comprehension,
      cadence, content (skipped words and phrases) and intonation.
      Reading speed was substantially impaired. While speaking there was
      asymmetry of the face.<br>
      <br>
      Following written informed consent, aqueous etanercept 25 mg was
      administered by perispinal injection without direct intrathecal
      injection. More specifically, etanercept was administered by
      perispinal injection overlying the posterior cervical spine within
      five centimeters of the spinal cord but external to the ligamentum
      flavum. The injection was extrathecal. The injection was followed
      by brief prone positioning for 30 seconds and then the examination
      table was tilted with the head below horizontal, in the
      Trendelenburg position.<br>
      <br>
      There was clinical improvement noted within two minutes of
      injection, with his speech being clearer. After resuming the
      sitting position there was improvement in the patient's facial
      symmetry. The patient was able to transfer to his wheelchair with
      much less difficulty. Finger movements on the left hand were
      improved. Spasticity of the left upper extremity was decreased.
      There were multiple improvements in motor function. One to two
      hours after etanercept administration the patient was re-examined.
      There were noticeable and significant improvements in distinctness
      of speech, motor abilities of the left extremities, including
      increased range of motion of the left arm, wrist, hand, and
      fingers; decreased spasticity of both left extremities, and the
      patient was able to walk with a single quad cane with minimal
      assistance, for the first time in twenty two years. Reading
      abilities were re-tested. There was improved reading
      comprehension; speech was less slurred and more distinct; cadence
      and intonation and phrasing were improved; and reading speed was
      improved more than 30%. Mood, affect and irritability were
      improved. On the day following perispinal etanercept
      administration repeat neurocognitive testing was performed.
      Category verbal fluency (animal naming) was improved, with a score
      of 19 (27-29 percentile), within the normal range. Visual
      recognition of the slope of lines (Judgement of Line Orientation
      (JLO)) was improved, with a score of 28/30 (72 percentile), within
      the normal range. The patient was followed as an outpatient. He
      had persistent clinical improvement in motor function, cognitive
      abilities, affect, and mood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Case 7:</b><br>
      <br>
      An 85 y.o. man developed acute onset of nausea, vomiting,
      headache, vertigo, and inability to walk without falling over. He
      had polycythemia vera, atrial fibrillation, and a history of a
      recent vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack and a myocardial
      infarction twenty years earlier. His medications included
      propranolol, aspirin, warfarin, and hydroxyurea. He was taken to
      the emergency room where a CAT, MRI and MRI scans revealed a
      posterior cerebellar stroke on the left with a congenital absence
      of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The patient had
      persistent severe vertigo, nystagmus, and inability to ambulate
      without assistance. Three days following the stroke, following
      written informed consent, etanercept 25 mg was administered by
      perispinal injection without direct intrathecal injection. More
      specifically, etanercept 25 mg was administered by perispinal
      injection overlying the posterior cervical spine within five
      centimeters of the spinal cord but external to the ligamentum
      flavum. The injection was extrathecal. The injection was followed
      by brief prone positioning for 30 seconds and then the head was
      tilted down below horizontal with the upper body inclined downward
      for five minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The patient resumed the supine position. Within five minutes the
      patient was clinically improved. His vertigo largely resolved, his
      nystagmus was less marked, and he was able to ambulate without
      assistance. He was discharged home the next day. The patient had
      lasting clinical improvement, although he had balance difficulties
      that lasted for several months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Additional Clinical Experience</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Three of the clinical cases described above have been published by
      the inventor (Tobinick E., CNS Drugs. 2011 February;
      25(2):145-155). There is now clinical experience utilizing
      perispinal etanercept for more than 250 individuals who had
      persistent neurological dysfunction following brain injury due to
      stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, anoxia,
      cardiac arrest and other forms of brain injury. The majority of
      patients treated have exhibited rapid improvement in neurological
      function. Rapid and sustained reduction in spasticity, beginning
      within minutes of the first dose of perispinal etanercept is
      characteristic. Improvements in cognition, attention, speech,
      dysarthria, aphasia, motor function, sensation, hearing, taste,
      swallowing, vision, gait, depression, anxiety and behavior have
      been observed in multiple patients. The patients have been treated
      typically months or years following their stroke or other form of
      brain injury, with persistent stable neurological deficits for
      months or years prior to perispinal etanercept administration.
      They therefore typically have had a stable chronic baseline of
      neurological disability and dysfunction that facilitated detection
      of a treatment effect. Most often these patients had strokes that
      were 2 to 10 years earlier, but clinical improvement has been
      noted in patients with strokes as much as 35 years earlier.<br>
      <br>
      Discussion of the clinical results: A single dose of perispinal
      etanercept led to immediate and sustained clinical improvement in
      patients with brain injury, including stroke and traumatic brain
      injury. Prior to these clinical results the scientific community
      would consider it implausible that these results could be
      possible; that they could occur so rapidly; or that they could be
      sustained from a single dose.<br>
      <br>
      The most surprising aspect of these clinical results, however, is
      the fact that they occurred at a time so remote from the injury.
      The scientific community, and a person of ordinary skill in the
      art, would not have expected that patients who had brain injury
      months earlier would respond to anti-cytokine treatment; and they
      certainly would not have expected that patients who had brain
      injury years earlier would respond to anti-cytokine treatment.
      There is no precedent for this type of result and no clinical or
      basic science data of which one of ordinary skill in the art would
      be aware to suggest that there should be clinical response two
      years or more after a brain injury. The clinical results
      documented are scientifically unprecedented and surprising.
      Nevertheless they have been reproducible and consistent following
      perispinal etanercept administration.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts the anastomoses between the cranial and vertebral
      venous systems. Perispinal administration for delivery to the
      brain and other structures of the head is preferably performed by
      a percutaneous injection into an interspinous space in the
      posterior cervical area (12 in FIG. 2). As shown in more detail in
      FIG. 2A, hollow needle (26) containing etanercept (or other
      therapeutic molecule of this invention) in solution (30) is
      injected through the skin 18 into the interspinous space 24. If
      the needle were carried further it could penetrate the ligamentum
      flavum (22), delivering the therapeutic molecule into the epidural
      space (28) surrounding the spinal cord (36), although in this
      invention in several preferred embodiments the ligamentum flavum
      is not penetrated by the needle, and the therapeutic molecule is
      deposited into the interspinous space more superficially, without
      penetration of the ligamentum flavum. The therapeutic molecule in
      the interspinous space drains into the vertebral venous system,
      and is then carried to the brain and other structures of the head;
      (34) is a spinal nerve root.<br>
      <br>
      The interspinous space (24) is defined as the space between two
      adjacent spinous processes (20). FIG. 3A shows the interspinous
      space (24) having veins (38) (FIG. 3A) which collect the
      therapeutic molecule, e.g. etanercept, which reaches the
      interspinous space after percutaneous interspinous injection and
      which veins drain the therapeutic molecule into the VVS, so that
      using the physical maneuvers of the present invention, the
      therapeutic molecule is transported via retrograde venous flow
      into the intracranial veins via the anastomoses shown in FIG. 1,
      and then to the brain or other structures of the head.<br>
      <br>
      The vertebral venous system is used in a non-obvious way for the
      present inventions because a venous system is routinely
      conceptualized as a system that drains blood from a target area or
      organ. For example the venous system which drains the kidneys is
      widely acknowledged to be a vascular system that drains blood from
      the kidneys, not as a way of delivering a therapeutic molecule to
      the kidneys. Likewise the venous system of the brain is widely
      medically recognized as a system which functions to drain blood
      from the brain. It would be counter-intuitive to propose using the
      CSVS to deliver a therapeutic molecule to the brain, by
      conventional thinking. Likewise the use of the CSVS to achieve
      delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain is not obvious,
      because conventional thinking is that this venous system functions
      to drain venous blood away from these anatomic sites. Therefore
      the inventions of consideration here are in this way
      counter-intuitive, because they rely on the vertebral venous
      system to deliver therapeutic molecules (including specifically
      large molecules) to the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, or the head.
      This delivery is accomplished by retrograde venous flow (opposite
      from the usual direction), that is facilitated by the proper use
      of gravity and positioning of the patient so that venous flow in
      the desired direction is accomplished. The rich connections
      between the cranial venous system and the vertebral venous system
      were beautifully depicted by Breschet (Breschet G. Recherches
      anatomiques physiologiques et pathologiques sur le systáeme
      veineux (Rouen fráeres, Paris, 1829), but this anatomic route
      still remains largely unrecognized by the medical community.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dosages and Routes of Administration</b><br>
      <br>
      The therapeutically effective dosage of a biologic used for
      perispinal administration superficial to the ligamentum flavum
      (such as interspinous injection) will in general be 10% to 100% of
      the dosage used as a single dose for systemic administration. The
      therapeutically effective dosage of a biologic used for epidural
      administration will in general be 2% to 100% of the dosage used as
      a single dose for systemic administration The dosage used for
      systemic administration is well known by those skilled in the art
      as it is specified in the FDA approved literature which
      accompanies each of these biologics. For example, if the usual
      dose when administered systemically is 50 mg, then the dose used
      for interspinous administration will usually be between 5 mg and
      50 mg.<br>
      <br>
      Etanercept may be administered to the perispinal area by
      interspinous injection at a dose of 5 mg to 100 mg given from once
      per week to once per 3 months. It will be appreciated by one of
      skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the compounds, and
      compositions comprising the compounds, can vary from patient to
      patient. The determination of the optimal dosage will generally
      involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against
      any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level
      will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to,
      the activity of the particular compound, the route of
      administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion
      of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs,
      compounds, and/or materials used in combination, the severity of
      the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition,
      general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The
      amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be
      at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician,
      although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local
      concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired
      effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious
      side-effects.<br>

      <br>
      An advantage of the present invention is that it identifies and
      selects the use of biologics as effective therapeutic agents for
      treatment of BI. More specifically an advantage of the present
      invention is that it identifies and selects the use of TNF
      antagonists as effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of a
      mammal after BI, even long after the initial BI event, such as
      long after completion of a stroke. Accordingly, an advantage of
      the present invention is that it provides for the delivery of a
      biologic to the CSVS and thenceforth delivery of a therapeutically
      effective dose of the biologic to the brain, as a new biologic
      treatment of a human with BI; such that the use of the biologic
      will result in clinical improvement, or will slow progression of
      the underlying pathologic process. Accordingly, an advantage of
      the present invention is that it provides for the delivery of
      etanercept to the vertebral venous system and thenceforth to the
      brain of a human with BI; such that the use of etanercept will
      result in clinical improvement, or will slow progression of the
      underlying pathologic process. Another advantage of the present
      invention is that it provides for a biologic delivered by
      perispinal administration, thereby delivering the biologic into
      the vertebral venous system and thenceforth the brain of a human
      with BI, which, when compared to systemic administration, produces
      one or more of the following: greater efficacy; more rapid onset;
      longer duration of action; improved delivery to the CNS; or fewer
      side effects. Another advantage of the present invention is that
      it provides for one of a group of biologics, as specified herein,
      which affect neuronal or immune function, delivered by retrograde
      venous flow in the CSVS (through the vertebral venous system into
      the cranial venous system), thereby facilitating delivery of the
      biologic to the brain of a human following BI for therapeutic
      purposes.<br>

      Unless the Supreme Court decides to weigh in on this long-running
      SLAPP lawsuit (highly unlikely -- and unlikely to be appealed to
      that level), it looks like it's finally the end of the line for
      Dr. Edward Tobinick and his quest to silence a critic of his
      questionable medical practices.<br>
      <br>
      Quick recap: Dr. Tobinick claimed he could treat Alzheimer's,
      strokes, and other neurological maladies by repurposing an
      immunosuppressant drug. Dr. Steven Novella disagreed with
      Tobinick's unsubstantiated claims and wrote a few blog posts
      detailing his problems with Tobinick's treatments. <br>
      <br>
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobinick is not a neurologist, and yet he
      feels it is appropriate for him to treat multiple neurological
      conditions with an experimental treatment. It is generally
      considered unethical for physicians to practice outside of their
      area of competence and expertise. He is trained in internal
      medicine and dermatology and is certified in those specialties. He
      has never completed a neurology residency nor is he board
      certified in neurology.<br>
      <br>
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite his lack of formal training and
      certification, he feels he has ushered in a “paradigm shift” in
      the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease – a disease that has proved
      challenging for actual neurologists for decades."<br>
      <br>
      Novella is not alone in his criticism of Tobinick's untested
      treatment methods. Early on in the case, Marc Randazza summarized
      the general medical community mood.<br>
      <br>
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Novella’s critical opinions of the
      Plaintiffs are not outlier views. In fact, the prevailing view
      seems to be that Dr. Tobnick is, at best, irresponsible. On the
      first page of Google alone, there are numerous other articles
      written by other authors, entirely unrelated to the article at
      hand, that also express critical and unflattering opinions of
      Tobinick and Plaintiffs’ “medical” practice."<br>

          Disorder Patent Invalid</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By John T. Aquino</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dec. 17 — A physician/inventor's patent application claims for
      methods of inhibiting a molecule called TNF-a to achieve
      therapeutic results in patients with nerve disorders are invalid,
      a federal appeals court affirmed Dec. 16.<br>
      <br>
      Edward Tobinick is known for his promotion of Enbrel (etanercept),
      described in his application as a TNF-a inhibitor, for treating
      back problems, Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Parkinson's
      disease. His Institute for Neurological Recovery in Boca Raton,
      Fla., was the focus of an Australia 60 Minutes segment in 2010 for
      its approach to treating Alzheimer's.<br>
      <br>
      The Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeals Board
      found his claims invalid, and he appealed that decision to the
      U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals court
      had previously reversed and remanded the case because, contrary to
      the PTAB's holding, the court found that Tobinick's application
      included adequate written description support under 35 U.S.C. §112
      (8 LSLR 510, 5/30/14).<br>
      <br>
      On remand, the PTAB still found Tobinick's patent claims invalid
      as lacking in novelty under 35 U.S.C. §102 and as obvious and
      anticipated under 35 U.S.C. §103 because of a prior patent
      application by Kjell Olmarker and an article on a research study
      Olmarker co-authored.<br>

      <b>Etanercept</b> (trade name Enbrel) is a biopharmaceutical that
      treats autoimmune diseases by interfering with tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF, a soluble inflammatory cytokine) by acting as a TNF
      inhibitor. It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat rheumatoid
      arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis,
      plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNF-alpha is the
      "master regulator" of the inflammatory (immune) response in many
      organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive
      immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these
      diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Etanercept is a fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA. It
      fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody.
      First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the
      human gene for soluble TNF receptor 2, which is a receptor that
      binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the
      DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the Fc end of
      immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF
      receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the
      linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF
      receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc. The prototypic fusion
      protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and
      unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the
      early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler, an academic researcher then at
      the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and
      his colleagues.[2][3]<br>
      <br>
      These investigators also patented the protein,[4] selling all
      rights to its use to Immunex, a biotechnology company that was
      acquired by Amgen in 2002.[5]<br>
      <br>
      It is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of 150 kDa., that
      binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess
      inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune
      diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis,[6] juvenile rheumatoid
      arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      and, potentially, in a variety of other disorders mediated by
      excess TNFα.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medical uses</b><br>
      <br>
      In the U.S. the FDA has licensed Enbrel for :<br>
      <br>
      Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) (Nov 1998)[7]<br>
      Moderate to Severe Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (May 1999)[8]<br>
      Psoriatic Arthritis (Jan 2002)[9]<br>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) (July 2003)[10][11]<br>
      Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis (April 2004)[12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Safety</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On May 2, 2008, the FDA placed a black box warning on etanercept
      due to a number of serious infections associated with the
      drug.[13] Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities,
      have been reported with the use of etanercept including
      reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B
      infections.[14][15]<br>
      <br>
      There has also been a report of strongyloides hyperinfection after
      use of etanercept.[16]<br>
      Mechanism of action<br>
      <br>
      It reduces the effect of naturally present TNF, and hence is a TNF
      inhibitor, functioning as a decoy receptor that binds to TNF.[17]<br>
      <br>
      Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine produced by
      lymphocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cells. It
      mediates the immune response by attracting additional white blood
      cells to sites of inflammation, and through additional molecular
      mechanisms which initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of
      its action by etanercept reduces the inflammatory response which
      is especially useful for treating autoimmune diseases.<br>
      <br>
      There are two types of TNF receptors: those found embedded in
      white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other
      cytokines, and soluble TNF receptors which are used to deactivate
      TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are
      found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood
      cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on
      their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of
      naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being
      that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a
      simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the
      bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting
      biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF
      receptor.[18]<br>
      Structure<br>
      <br>
      Etanercept is made from the combination of two naturally occurring
      soluble human 75-kilodalton TNF receptors linked to an Fc portion
      of an IgG1.[19] The effect is an artificially engineered dimeric
      fusion protein.[19] Etanercept is a complex molecules containing 6
      N-glycans, up to 14 O-glycans and 29 disulfide bridge
      structures.[20][21][22]<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><br>
      <br>
      Etanercept was developed by researchers at Immunex, and was
      released for commercial use in late 1998, soon after the release
      of infliximab (Remicade), which was the first chimeric monoclonal
      antibody against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.<br>
      <br>
      Etanercept is a dimeric molecule,[23] and this dimeric structure
      is necessary for its proper therapeutic activity. During its
      development at Immunex Corporation an earlier monomeric version
      did not have sufficient biologic activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marketing</b><br>
      <br>
      In North America, etanercept is marketed by Amgen under the trade
      name Enbrel in two separate formulations, one in powder form, the
      other as a pre-mixed liquid. Wyeth (now part of Pfizer) was the
      sole marketer of Enbrel outside North America excluding Japan
      where Takeda Pharmaceuticals markets the drug...<br>
