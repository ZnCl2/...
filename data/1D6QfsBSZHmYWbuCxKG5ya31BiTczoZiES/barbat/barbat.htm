                Electrical Energy</b><br>
            </big><b>by William Barbat, <br>
              President and Chief Scientist, Levitronics, Inc.</b><br>

          <br>
          Low Mass Electrons (LMEs) produce greater inductive energy
          output than their kinetic energy input, and most conduction
          electrons of semiconductors and superconductors possess this
          subnormal mass. Physicists prefer to assume an unforgivable
          reversal of entropy (which violates a Law of Physics) so they
          can claim that this extra energy comes from lattice
          vibrations. With the lattice vibration excuse, the
          less-than-normal mass of these special conduction electrons
          can be treated as imaginary, so it is referred to as effective
          mass, meaning it looks like a lower mass.<br>
          <br>
          Because LMEs accelerate faster than normal electrons, they
          radiate extra energy from any acceleration they receive.
          Larmor (1) showed that photon energy radiates from a moving
          charge in proportion to the square of its acceleration.
          Superconductors, with an electron mass 1/10,000 that of normal
          electrons (2) are accelerated 10,000 times faster than normal,
          so the centripetal acceleration of a supercurrent around a
          closed superconducting coil gives off a calculated 10,000 X
          10,000 = 100,000,000 times more energy (acceleration squared)
          than is used to charge up the supercurrent .<br>
          <br>
          This calculation accurately predicts the magnitude of the
          energy magnification obtained in an astounding experiment at
          Princeton University (3). A supercurrent that took about 4
          hours to charge up was projected by computer to take 130,000
          years to decline exponentially from a calculated 46 amps to 16
          amps. As expected, this discharge is about 100,000,000 times
          longer than the charging time. Left to discharge completely
          without any other energy needed to sustain cryogenic
          temperatures (as in outer space), the supercurrent would
          radiate a calculated 2.8 billion joules from a 4-hour
          charging.<br>
          <br>
          Levitronics recognizes this as newly created energy, not
          energy from lattice vibrations. The Berlin Physical Society
          had rejected the 18th-century law of conservation of energy
          (4) as metaphysics when it was misapplied to inductive and
          magnetic energy. But two important principles had been clearly
          described and then violated by that author, Hermann Helmholtz:<br>
          <br>
          If a resulting force is not not directly opposed to its
          causative force, then force can be gained ad infinitum under
          proper conditions (p. 12 of translation);<br>
          <br>
          When more force is produced in one direction than another, a
          portion of that force can be used to sustain the original
          force and the remainder can be put to useful purposes
          perpetually (p. 7 of translation).<br>
          An unlimited source of cheap electric energy can be developed
          by these established principles, but mankind has been kept in
          the Dark Ages by later scientists who were not familiar with
          the whole treatise. A careful reading of Helmholtz's paper
          shows he mistakenly included inductive and magnetic energy
          with faulty assumptions and a disregard for works by Ampere
          and Faraday.<br>
          <br>
          This overlooked energy source can be harnessed by knowing that
          inductive energy is not conveyed by magnetic lines of force
          but by directional photon energy, as in radio broadcasting and
          receiving. If the Princeton experiment had produced an
          oscillating output, it could have been transformed directly
          into electric power, as in a common transformer. The practical
          conversion of oscillating LME energy had been discovered
          serendipitously nearly a century ago, but no one could explain
          why it worked before Levitronics.<br>
          <br>
          German engineer, E.Leimer (5), discovered that he could
          magnify the energy of an oscillating electric current in his
          crystal radio receiver by ionizing LMEs in a cupric oxide
          coating on wire with alpha radiation from radium. By feeding
          back a portion of the magnified electrical output from that
          experiment, a Seattle youth produced a continuous oscilllating
          electric current in a small fuelless generating device with no
          moving parts that lit a 20-watt light bulb in 1919 (6). A
          Physics Professor from Seattle College confirmed that this was
          not a hoax or a storage device, but he did not know why it
          worked (7).<br>
          <br>
          The generator had certain flat wire coils that could be
          insulated only with enamel, which would have allowed alpha
          radiation to pass through. The central coil acted as a sending
          antenna, the flat-wire windings of the surrounding eight coils
          were irradiated to magnify the inductive energy as in Leimers
          receiving antenna, and the coils nested inside the wide-wire
          coils acted as a secondary of a transformer to convert the
          magnified oscillating electric energy into an output of more
          energy than the input.<br>
          <br>
          In 1920 by an astounding continuous electrical power output
          from a 1.0 cubic foot fuelless generator ran a 35-hp electric
          motor boat at 8-10 knots. The event was reliably witnessed,
          photographed, and published in a respected newspaper (8).The
          generator output meaured 330 amps at 125 volts (25 kWe),
          enough current to overheat the wires and cause shut-downs for
          cooling. The boat demonstration lasted several hours and
          created a sensation (9). In comparison the 300 kg of lithium
          ion cells in the the $57,000 Tesla Model-S auto would have run
          down in only 100 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          The Seattle Post Intelligencer (10) editorialized:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The energy produced could have driven an
          automobile at moderate speed; it could have illuminated an
          office building; furnished heat and light for a large
          residence, or it could have heated seven two-room apartments.
          And so far as anybody could see the energy came from the air,
          or the earth.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The possibility that the current came from
          storage batteries or from an existing power circuit appeared
          to be out of the question, since the observers prudently
          looked into that phase of the matter. There were no hidden
          wires or any indication that the energy came from a source
          other than the Hubbard coil."<br>
          <br>
          Due to high cost and scarcity of radium, the generator
          technology was abandoned in 1922 . Ten milligrams of radium
          cost more than a new automobile in the 1920s, and the world's
          entire 250 gram supply of radium would have supplied only a
          fraction of a year's auto production.<br>
          <br>
          In 1928, Lester Hendershot of Pittsburgh duplicated Hubbard's
          generator and flew a model airplane (11), which impressed
          William B Stout, designer of the Ford Trimotor airplane. Col.
          Chas. A. Lindbergh of the U.S. Air Corps was also convinced of
          this fuelless generator (12), but the technology was abandoned
          again because it was too expensive. Later, when the price of
          radium dropped, copper wire was produced shiny without the CuO
          coating. Since no one realized that CuO had been essential to
          the energy magnification, attempts in 1963 to replicate the
          generator were doomed to failure.<br>
          Levitronics Energy Technology<br>
          <br>
          Today no radionuclide provider will sell a radium source large
          enough to retest Hubbard's device because the radon emanations
          from radium-226, which carry all the alpha energy, are
          considered too hazardous. Levitronics' technology utilizes
          semiconductors and superconductors as a source of LMEs so no
          radioactive source is needed. The inductive energy magnifying
          factor is the same for semiconductors as for a superconductor,<br>
          <br>
          (Inductive Energy Magnification Factor) = 1/(electron mass)².<br>
          <br>
          A high power-to-weight ratio similar to the 1920 boat
          demonstration is indicated for LME generators made with a
          semiconductor having a high Energy Magnification Factor. Such
          a generator could outcompete petroleum for all forms of
          transportation including propellor aircraft. A self-generator
          utilizing Lead Sulfide, with electron mass 0.16 times normal
          and a calculated inductive energy magnification factor of 39X,
          could theoretically power the world's one billion autos using
          less lead than is found in lead-acid batteries.
          Self-generators employing silicon might power all the world's
          homes and industries, and offer low-cost desalinization.<br>
          <br>
          A self-generator is relatively simple in design, but it
          requires special laboratory facilities to make polycrystalline
          coatings of desired semiconductors. that can conduct large
          currents of LMEs. Levitronics seeks both laboratories and
          capital to test a relatively simple self-sustaining generator
          powered by the common photoconductor, cadmium sulfide, which
          has a calculated inductive energy magnification factor of 37X.<br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Electrical oscillations in a metallic "sending coil" radiate
        inductive photons toward one or more "energy-magnifying coils"
        comprised of a photoconductor or doped semiconductor coating a
        metallic conductor, or comprised of a superconductor. Electrons
        of low inertial mass in the energy-magnifying coil(s) receive
        from the sending coil a transverse force having no in-line
        backforce, which exempts this force from the energy-conservation
        rule. The low-mass electrons in the energy-magnifying coil(s)
        receive increased acceleration proportional to normal electron
        mass divided by the lesser mass. Secondarily radiated
        inductive-photon energy is magnified proportionally to the
        electrons' greater acceleration, squared. E.g., the
        inductive-energy-magnification factor of CdSe photoelectrons
        with 0.13.times. normal electron mass is 59.times.. Magnified
        inductive-photon energy from the energy-magnifying coil(s)
        induces oscillating electric energy in one or more metallic
        "output coil(s)." The electric energy output exceeds energy
        input if more of the magnified photon-induction energy is
        directed toward the output coil(s) than is directed as a counter
        force to the sending coil. After an external energy source
        initiates the oscillations, feedback from the generated surplus
        energy makes the device a self-sustaining generator of electric
        power for useful purposes. </p>

      <p>[0001] This application corresponds to, and claims the benefit
        under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119(e), of U.S. Provisional application
        No. 60/697,729, filed on Jul. 8, 2005, incorporated herein by
        reference in its entirety. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] This disclosure introduces a technical field in which
        practical electrical energy is created in accordance with the
        overlooked exception to the energy-conservation rule that Herman
        von Helmholtz described in his 1847 doctrine on energy
        conservation: "If . . . bodies possess forces which depend upon
        time and velocity, or which act in directions other than lines
        which unite each pair of material points, . . . then
        combinations of such bodies are possible in which force may be
        either lost or gained ad infinitum." A transverse inductive
        force qualifies for Helmholtz's ad infinitum rule, but this
        force is not sufficient of itself to cause a greater energy
        output than input when applied to electrons of normal mass due
        to their unique charge-to-mass ratio. However, the increased
        acceleration of conduction electrons of less-than-normal
        inertial mass, as occurs in photoconductors, doped
        semiconductors, and superconductors, is proportional to the
        normal electron mass divided by the low electron mass, and the
        magnification of harnessable inductive energy is proportional to
        the greater relative acceleration, squared. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Magnetic force also satisfies Helmholtz's exemption to
        the energy-conservation rule because magnetic force is
        transverse to the force that causes it, and magnetic force is
        determined by the "relative velocity" (i.e., perpendicular to
        the connecting line) between electric charges. Magnification of
        magnetic force and energy was demonstrated by E. Leimer (1915)
        in the coil of a speaker phone and in the coil of a galvanometer
        when he irradiated a radio antenna-wire with radium. A
        10-milligram, linear radium source produced a measured 2.6-fold
        increase in electrical current in the antenna-wire in comparing
        inaudible radio reception without radium to audible reception
        with radium. This represented a (2.6).sup.2=7.times. increase in
        electrical energy flowing through the respective wire coils. The
        possibility of this enhanced reception being attributed to a
        person's body holding the unit of radium to the wire was
        eliminated by Leimer's additional observation that, whenever the
        orientation of the small radium unit was changed to
        approximately 30 degrees relative to the wire, the energy
        enhancement ceased. </p>
      <p>[0004] Applicant has deduced that Leimer's energy magnification
        most likely was due to low-mass electrons that were liberated
        and made conductive in the antenna by alpha radiation, which
        allowed these special electrons to be given a
        greater-than-normal acceleration by the received radio-broadcast
        photons. Applicant has further deduced that such low-mass
        electrons must have originated in a thin-film coating of cupric
        oxide (CuO) on the antenna wire. CuO is a dull-black,
        polycrystalline, semiconducting compound that develops in situ
        on copper and bronze wire in the course of annealing the wire in
        the presence of air. Such CuO coatings have been observed by
        Applicant on historical laboratory wire at the Science Museum at
        Oxford University, U.K., and on copper house wire of that era in
        the U.S., indicating that CuO coatings were commonplace. In
        later years, annealing has taken place under conditions that
        prevent most oxidation. This is followed by acid treatment to
        remove any remaining oxides, leaving shiny wire. </p>
      <p>[0005] The same year that the English translation of Leimer's
        paper appeared in Scientific American, 16-year old Alfred M.
        Hubbard of Seattle, Wash., reportedly invented a fuelless
        generator, which he later admitted employed radium. Applicant
        interprets this as implying that Leimer's energy-magnification
        was utilized by Hubbard with feedback to make it
        self-sustaining. Three years later Hubbard publicly demonstrated
        a relatively advanced fuelless generator that illuminated a
        20-watt incandescent bulb (Anon. 1919a). A reputable physics
        professor from Seattle College, who was intimately familiar with
        Hubbard's device (but not at liberty to disclose its
        construction details), vouched for the integrity of the fuelless
        generator and declared that it was not a storage device, but he
        did not know why it worked (Anon. 1919b). Because Hubbard
        initially had no financial means of his own, it is likely the
        professor had provided Hubbard with the use of the expensive
        radium initially and thereby witnessed the inventing process in
        his own laboratory. </p>
      <p>[0006] Newspaper photos (Anon. 1920a) of a more impressive
        demonstration of Hubbard's fuelless generator show a device
        described as 14 inches (36 cm) long and 11 inches (28 cm) in
        diameter connected by four heavy electrical cables to a
        35-horsepower (26 kW) electric motor. The motor reportedly
        propelled an 18-foot open launch around a lake at a speed of 8
        to 10 knots (Anon. 1920b). The event was witnessed by a cautious
        news reporter who claims to have checked thoroughly for any
        wires that might have been connected to hidden batteries by
        lifting the device and motor from the boat. Radioactive-decay
        energy can be eliminated as the main power source because about
        10.sup.8 times more radium than the entire world's supply would
        have been needed to equal Hubbard's reported electric energy
        output of 330 amperes and 124 volts. </p>
      <p>[0007] Lester J. Hendershot of Pittsburgh, Pa., reportedly
        demonstrated a fuelless generator in 1928 that was claimed by
        Hubbard to be a copy of his own device (1928h). The president of
        Stout Air Services, William B. Stout, who also designed the Ford
        Trimotor airplane, reported (1928b): "The demonstration was very
        impressive. It was actually uncanny . . . . The small model
        appeared to operate exactly as Hendershot explained it did."
        Also reportedly attesting to the operability of Hendershot's
        fuelless generator were Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh and Major
        Thomas Lanphier of the U.S. Air Corps (1928a, et seq.), and
        Lanphier's troops reportedly assembled a working model of the
        device. </p>
      <p>[0008] To the Applicant's best knowledge, the only depiction
        that was made public of the interior components of any of these
        reported generators consists of a sketchy drawing (Bermann
        1928h) of Hubbard's apparatus similar in size to the device
        shown in his 1919 demonstration. It depicts a complex set of
        parallel coils measuring 6 inches (15 cm) in length and 4.5
        inches (11.4 cm) overall in diameter. Four leads of insulated
        wire with the insulation peeled back are shown coming out of the
        end of the device. What those four wires were connected to
        internally was not shown. Hubbard's description of the internal
        arrangement of coils in the device generally matches the drawing
        (Anon. 1920a): "It is made up of a group of eight
        electro-magnets, each with primary and secondary windings of
        copper wire, which are arranged around a large steel core. The
        core likewise has a single winding. About the entire group of
        cells is a secondary winding." Nothing was reported or depicted
        about how components functioned with each other, or how much
        radium was used and where the radium was positioned. The only
        connectors visible on the drawing were between the outer
        windings of the eight electromagnet coils. Theses connectors
        show that the direction of the windings alternated between
        clockwise and counterclockwise on adjacent coils, so that the
        polarity of each electromagnet would have been opposite to that
        of its adjacent neighbors. </p>
      <p>[0009] If the Hubbard and Hendershot devices actually operated
        as reported, they apparently never attained acceptance or
        commercial success. Assuming the devices actually worked, their
        lack of success may have largely been financially based or
        supply-based, or both, compounded with skepticism from believers
        in the universal energy-conservation doctrine. How much radium
        was employed by Hubbard in his larger generator can only be
        guessed at, but assuming a typical laboratory radium needle
        containing 10 milligrams of radium was used, this amount would
        have cost $900 in 1920, dropping to $500 in 1929. That much
        radium in a fuelless generator would have cost as much as an
        inexpensive automobile in the 1920s. Possibly much more radium
        was used than 10 milligrams. </p>
      <p>[0010] In 1922, when the Radium Company of America of
        Pittsburgh, Pa., reportedly discontinued its work with Hubbard
        on his invention (1928h), the entire world's supply of radium
        was only about 250 grams. With the extreme assumption that only
        1 milligram of radium was needed per generator, less than 10
        percent of a single year's production of autos in the U.S. in
        the mid-1920s could have been supplied with such generators.
        Apparently Hendershot had tried to revive the technology by
        showing that the fuelless generator could extend the range of
        air flight indefinitely, but his technology never attracted a
        sponsor from any private, public or philanthropic entity. </p>
      <p>[0011] U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,433 to Brown superficially resembles
        the drawing of Hubbard's device. Brown's device appears to have
        the same number and essentially the same general arrangement of
        wire coils as Hubbard's generator, as nearly as can be
        understood from the newspaper articles depicting that device.
        Apparently no information concerning either the Hubbard or
        Hendershot devices was considered during prosecution of the '433
        patent. Brown discusses the conversion of energy of radioactive
        decay products, principally alpha emissions, to electrical
        energy by amplifying electrical oscillations in a high-Q L-C
        circuit irradiated by radioactive materials. "During the
        absorption process, each alpha particle will collide with one or
        more atoms in the conductor knocking electrons from their orbits
        and imparting some kinetic energy to the electrons in the
        conductor thereby increasing its conductivity." (Col. 3, line 68
        to col. 4, line 5.) No claim was made by Brown that the device
        employed a semiconductor or photoconductor that could have
        provided low-mass electrons for energy magnification. </p>
      <p>[0012] Brown claimed an output of 23 amps at 400 volts, which
        is vastly greater than all the decay-energy represented by his
        reported radioactive content of 1 milligram of radium that was
        surrounded by weakly radioactive uranium rods and thorium
        powder. Powdered thorium is highly pyrophoric, so it is
        typically sealed in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent spontaneous
        combustion. In his device Brown reportedly confined the thorium
        in cardboard without any mention of sealing out air. This
        condition would have invited a meltdown that could have been
        misinterpreted as massive out-of-control electrical production.
      </p>
      <p>[0013] To the best of the Applicant's knowledge, and as noted,
        none of the devices summarized above ever was commercially
        accepted or exploited for any of various possible reasons. To
        the Applicant's best knowledge, no person other than the
        Applicant has ever indicated that the presence of cupric oxide
        on their wires could have provided energy magnification. If
        Hubbard's device actually did work, certain characteristics of
        its design are unexplainable by the Applicant, namely the use of
        four rather than two large electrical cables to connect his
        device to an electric motor, and the use of alternating polarity
        instead of single-direction polarity in the orientation of the
        multiple coils surrounding a central coil. Applicant therefore
        believes that the specification herein sets forth original
        configurations of electrical-energy generators that have no
        known precedent. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY</b> </p>
      <p>[0014] To address the needs for electrical generators that are
        capable of self-generating substantial amounts of electrical
        power in various environments, and that are portable as well as
        stationary, apparatus and methods are provided for magnifying an
        electrical input, and (with feedback) for generating usable
        electrical power indefinitely without fuel or other external
        energy source except for starting. The apparatus utilize
        electrons of low effective mass, which receive greater
        acceleration than normal electrons in an amount that is
        inversely proportional to the effective mass. Applicant has
        determined that effective mass is the same as the electron's
        true inertial mass. The photon energy that is radiated when an
        electron is accelerated is proportional the square of the
        acceleration, so the increase in radiated photon energy from an
        accelerated low-mass electron over the energy from a normal
        electron is equal to the inverse square of the effective mass.
        E.g., the calculated energy magnification provided by
        photoconducting electrons in cadmium selenide, with an electron
        effective mass of 0.13, is 59.times.. The use of a transverse
        force, that lacks a direct back-force, to accelerate low-mass
        electrons in an oscillating manner circumvents any
        equal-and-opposite force that would invoke the application of
        the energy-conservation law of kinetics and thermodynamics. </p>
      <p>[0015] The various embodiments of the apparatus, which are
        configured either to magnify continuously an input of
        oscillating electric energy, or to serve as a self-sustaining
        electric generator, employ three principal components: at least
        one sending coil; at least one energy-magnifying coil comprising
        a material that produces, in a "condition," low-mass electrons;
        and at least one output coil. The apparatus desirably also
        includes means for establishing the condition with respect to
        the energy-magnifying coil(s). Except where otherwise indicated
        in the remainder of this text, where the number of coils of a
        particular type is referred to in the singular, it will be
        understood that a plurality of coils of the respective type
        alternatively can be utilized. </p>
      <p>[0016] Electrical oscillation in the sending coil, which is
        comprised of a metallic conductor, causes radiation of inductive
        photons from the sending coil. The energy-magnifying coil is
        situated relative to the sending coil to receive inductive
        photons from the sending coil. The inductive photons radiating
        from electrical oscillations in the sending coil convey a
        transverse force to the low-mass electrons in the
        energy-magnifying coil with no direct back-force on the sending
        coil. The greater-than-normal accelerations that are produced in
        the low-mass electrons of the energy-magnifying coil produce
        greater irradiation energy of inductive photons than normal. </p>
      <p>[0017] The output coil is situated to receive the magnified
        inductive-photon energy from the energy-magnifying coil. The
        inductive-photon energy received by the output coil, which is
        comprised of a metallic conductor, is converted into an
        oscillating electrical current of normal electrons. In order for
        the electrical output to exceed the electrical input, the output
        coil is situated in such a manner that it receives more of the
        magnified inductive-photon energy than that which is directed
        back against the sending coil to act as a back-force. This
        "energy leverage" causes the electrical energy output to exceed
        the input. </p>
      <p>[0018] By way of example, the energy-magnifying coil can
        comprise a superconducting material, wherein the "condition" is
        a temperature (e.g., a cryogenic temperature) at which the
        superconducting material exhibits superconducting behavior
        characterized by production of low-mass electrons. By way of
        another example, the energy-magnifying coil can comprise a
        photoconductive material, wherein the "condition" is a situation
        in which the photoconductive material is illuminated by a
        wavelength of photon radiation sufficient to cause the
        photoconductive material of the energy-magnifying coil to
        produce conduction electrons having low effective mass. In this
        latter example, the means for establishing the condition can
        comprise a photoconduction exciter (e.g., one or more LEDs)
        situated and configured to illuminate the photoconductive
        material of the energy-magnifying coil with the wavelength of
        photon radiation. By way of yet another example, the "condition"
        is the presence of a particular dopant in a semiconductor that
        provides a low-mass electron as a charge carrier. Also by way of
        example, the energy-magnifying coil can comprise a
        semiconductive element or compound that has been doped with a
        particular element or compound that makes it conductive of
        low-mass electrons without illumination by photon radiation
        other than by ambient photons. </p>
      <p>[0019] Various apparatus embodiments comprise different
        respective numbers and arrangements of the principal components.
        The various embodiments additionally can comprise one or more of
        circuitry, energizers, shielding, and other components to
        fulfill the object of providing a self-sustaining source of
        electrical power for useful purposes. </p>
      <p>[0020] Also provided are methods for generating an electrical
        current. In an embodiment of such a method a first coil is
        energized with an electrical oscillation sufficient to cause the
        first coil to radiate inductive photons. At least some of the
        radiated inductive photons from the first coil, called a sending
        coil, are received by a second coil, called the
        energy-magnifying coil, comprising a material that produces
        low-mass electrons. The received inductive photons impart
        respective transverse forces to the low-mass electrons that
        cause the low-mass electrons to experience accelerations in the
        material that are greater than accelerations that otherwise
        would be experienced by normal free electrons experiencing the
        transverse forces. Conduction of the accelerated low-mass
        electrons in the second coil causes the second coil to produce a
        magnified inductive force. The magnified inductive force is
        received by a third coil so as to cause the third coil to
        produce an oscillating electrical output of normal conduction
        electrons that has greater energy than the initial oscillation.
        A portion of the oscillating electrical output is directed as
        feed-back from the third coil to the sending coil so as to
        provide the electrical oscillation to the sending coil. This
        portion of the oscillating electrical current directed to the
        sending coil desirably is sufficient to cause self-sustaining
        generation of inductive photons by the first coil without an
        external energy source. The surplus oscillating electrical
        output from the third coil can be directed to a work loop. </p>
      <p>[0021] The method further can comprise the step of starting the
        energization of the first coil to commence generation of the
        oscillating electrical output. This "starting" step can comprise
        momentarily exposing the first coil to an external oscillating
        inductive force or to an external magnetic force that initiates
        an electrical pulse, for example. </p>
      <p>[0022] The foregoing and additional features and advantages of
        the invention will be more readily apparent from the following
        detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the
        accompanying drawings. </p>

        is disposed coaxially around the sending coil. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>General Technical Considerations</i></b> </p>
      <p>[0038] An understanding of how infinite energy mistakenly came
        to be rejected by the scientific community clarifies the basis
        of this invention. The electrodynamic function described in the
        embodiments described later below conforms to Helmholtz's
        alternate energy rule, which states that a force that is not
        in-line with its causative force "may be either lost or gained
        ad infinitum." This rule was included in "Uber die Erhaltung der
        Kraft" ("On the Conservation of Force") that Hermann Helmholtz
        delivered to the Physical Society of Berlin in 1847. But,
        Helmholtz mistakenly believed that "all actions in nature are
        reducible to forces of attraction and repulsion, the intensity
        of forces depending solely upon the distances between points
        involved . . . [so i]t is impossible to obtain an unlimited
        amount of force capable of doing work as the result of any
        combination whatsoever of natural objects." </p>
      <p>[0039] Helmholtz refused to accept the idea that magnetic
        energy qualifies for ad infinitum status despite the fact that
        Ampere's (1820) magnetic force on parallel straight conductors
        is obviously transverse to the direction of the electric
        currents rather than being in-line with the currents. He omitted
        mention that the magnetic force in Ampere's (1825) important
        invention, the solenoidal electromagnet, is caused by currents
        in the loops of his coils, which are transverse to the direction
        of magnetic force. Also, he failed to mention that Ampere
        considered the magnetic force of a permanent magnet to be caused
        by minute transverse circular currents, which are now recognized
        as electrons that spin and orbit transversely. </p>
      <p>[0040] Helmholtz, who was educated as a military medical doctor
        without any formal study of physics, relied instead on an
        obsolete metaphysical explanation of magnetic force: "Magnetic
        attraction may be deduced completely from the assumption of two
        fluids which attract or repel in the inverse ratio of the square
        of their distance . . . . It is known that the external effects
        of a magnet can always be represented by a certain distribution
        of the magnetic fluids on its surface." Without departing from
        this belief in magnetic fluids, Helmholtz cited Wilhelm Weber's
        (1846) similarly wrong interpretation that magnetic and
        inductive forces are directed in the same line as that between
        the moving electric charges that cause the forces. </p>
      <p>[0041] Weber had thought that he could unify Coulombic,
        magnetic, and inductive forces in a single, simple equation, but
        Weber's flawed magnetic-force term leads to the absurd
        conclusion that a steady current in a straight wire induces a
        steady electric current in a parallel wire. Also, a changing
        current does not induce an electromotive force in-line with the
        current, as Weber's equation showed. The induced force is offset
        instead, which becomes more apparent the further that two
        nested, coaxial coils are separated. What appears to be a
        directly opposing backforce is actually a reciprocal inductive
        force. </p>
      <p>[0042] Helmholtz's assertion that the total sum of the energy
        in the universe is a fixed amount that is immutable in quantity
        from eternity to eternity appealed to his young friends. But,
        the elder scientists of the Physical Society of Berlin declared
        his paper to be "fantastical speculation" and a "hazardous leap
        into very speculative metaphysics," so it was rejected for
        publication in Annalen der Physik. Rather than accept this
        rejection constructively, Helmholtz found a printer willing to
        help him self-publish his work. Helmholtz headed the publication
        with a statement that his paper had been read before the
        Society, but he disingenuously withheld mention of its outright
        rejection. Unwary readers have since received the wrong
        impression that his universal energy-conservation rule had
        received the Society's endorsement rather than its censure. </p>
      <p>[0043] Helmholtz (1862, 1863) publicized his concept thusly:
        "[W]e have been led up to a universal natural law, which . . .
        expresses a perfectly general and particularly characteristic
        property of all natural forces, and which . . . is to be placed
        by the side of the laws of the unalterability of mass and the
        unalterability of the chemical elements." Helmholtz (1881)
        declared that any force that did not conserve energy would be
        "in contradiction to Newton's axiom, which established the
        equality of action and reaction for all natural forces" [sic].
        With this deceitful misrepresentation of Newton's strictly
        mechanical principle, Helmholtz had craftily succeeded in
        commuting the profound respect for Newton's laws to his
        unscientific doctrine. Subsequently, the Grand Cross was
        conferred on Helmholtz by the kings of Sweden and Italy and the
        President of the French Republic, and he was welcomed by the
        German Emperor into nobility with the title of "von" added to
        his name. These prestigious awards made his doctrine virtually
        unassailable in the scientific community. </p>
      <p>[0044] Ampere's principle of transverse magnetic attraction and
        repulsion between electric currents had been made into an
        equation for the magnetic force between moving electric charges
        by Carl Frederick Gauss (written in 1835, published posthumously
        in 1865). The critical part of Gauss's equation shows, and modem
        physics texts agree, that magnetic force is transverse to the
        force that imparts a relative velocity (i.e., perpendicular to a
        connecting line) between charges. Lacking a direct backforce, a
        transverse magnetic force can produce a greater force than the
        force that causes it. </p>
      <p>[0045] The only physicist to recognize in print the profound
        significance of Gauss's work was James Clerk Maxwell (1873), who
        stated, "[If Gauss's formula is correct,] energy might be
        generated indefinitely in a finite system by physical means."
        Prepossessed with Helmholtz's "law," Maxwell chose not to
        believe Gauss's transverse magnetic-force equation and accepted
        Wilhelm Weber's (1846) erroneous in-line formula instead.
        Maxwell even admitted knowing of Gauss's (1845) rebuke of Weber
        for his mistaken direction of magnetic force as "a complete
        overthrow of Ampere's fundamental formula and the adoption of
        essentially a different one." </p>
      <p>[0046] In 1893 the critical part of Ampere's formula for
        magnetic force, which Weber and Maxwell rejected, and which
        Helmholtz had replaced with his contrary metaphysical
        explanation, was proposed for the basis for the international
        measure of electric current, the Ampere (or amp), to be defined
        in terms of the transverse magnetic force that the current
        produces. But Helmholtz's doctrine had become so impervious to
        facts that anyone who challenged this "law" faced defamation and
        ridicule. </p>
      <p>[0047] The first recognition of unlimited energy came from Sir
        Joseph Larmor who reported in 1897, "[A] single ion e,
        describing an elliptic orbit under an attraction to a fixed
        center . . . must rapidly lose its energy by radiation . . .
        [but] in the cases of steady motion it is just this amount that
        is needed to maintain the permanency of motion in the aether."
        Apparently to mollify critics of his heretical concept, Larmor
        offered a half-hearted recantation in 1900: "[T]he energy of
        orbital groups . . . would be through time sensibly dissipated
        by radiation, so that such groups could not be permanent." </p>
      <p>[0048] In 1911 Rutherford found that an atom resembles a small
        solar system with negative ions moving like planets around a
        small, positively charged nucleus. These endlessly orbiting
        electrons were a source of the perpetual radiation that had been
        aptly described by Larmor, and these orbiting electrons were
        also Planck's (1911) "harmonic oscillators" that he used to
        explain Zero-Point Energy (ZPE). ZPE was shown by the fact that
        helium remains liquid under atmospheric pressure at absolute
        zero, so that helium must be pressurized to become solid at that
        temperature. Planck believed that harmonic oscillators derived
        "dark energy" from the aether to sustain their oscillations,
        thereby admitting that an infinite source of energy exists.
        However, he assigned an occult origin to this infinite energy
        rather than a conventional source that had not met with
        Helmholtz's approval. </p>
      <p>[0049] Niels Bohr (1924) was bothered by the notion that
        radiation from an orbiting electron would quickly drain its
        energy so that the electron should spiral into the nucleus.
        Whittaker (1951) states, "[Bohr and associates] abandoned the
        principle . . . that an atom which is emitting or absorbing
        radiation must be losing or gaining energy. In its place they
        introduced the notion of virtual radiation, which was propagated
        in . . . waves but which does not transmit energy or momentum."
        Subsequently the entire scientific community dismissed Larmor
        radiation as a source of real energy because it failed to
        conform to Helmholtz's universally accepted doctrine. </p>
      <p>[0050] Helmholtz's constraining idea that the vast amount of
        light and heat radiating from the many billions of stars in the
        universe can only come from previously stored energy has led
        scientists to concur that fusion of pre-existing hydrogen to
        helium supplies nearly all the energy that causes light and heat
        to radiate from the sun and other stars. If so, then the entire
        universe will become completely dark after the present hydrogen
        supply in stars is consumed in about 20 billion years. William
        A. Fowler (1965) believed that essentially all the hydrogen in
        the universe "emerged from the first few minutes of the early
        high temperature, high density stage of the expanding Universe,
        the so-called `big bang`. . . ." Moreover, the background energy
        of the universe was thought by some to be "relic" radiation from
        the "Big Bang." </p>
      <p>[0051] To accept the Big Bang idea that all the stars in the
        universe originated at the same time, it was necessary to
        disregard the fact that most stars are much younger or older
        than the supposed age of the one-time event, which indicates
        that their energy must have come from a recurring source. The
        Big Bang is entirely dependent on the idea that the whole
        universe is expanding, which stemmed from the interpretation
        that Hubble's red-shift with distance from the light source
        represents a Doppler shift of receding stars and galaxies. This
        expanding-universe interpretation was shattered by William G.
        Tifft (1976, 1977), who found that observed red-shifts are not
        spread randomly and smoothly over a range of values, as would be
        expected from the Doppler shifts of a vast number of receding
        stars and galaxies. Instead, the observed red-shifts all fall on
        evenly spaced, quantized values. </p>
      <p>[0052] Moreover, Shpenkov and Kreidik (2002) determined that
        the radiation temperature corresponding to the fundamental
        period of the orbital electron motion in the hydrogen atom of
        2.7289.degree. K. matches the measured temperature of cosmic
        background radiation of 2.725.degree..+-.0.002.degree. K. This
        represents perpetual zero-level Larmor radiation from
        interstellar hydrogen atoms dispersed in the universe. So,
        Helmholtz's idea that "the energy in the universe is a fixed
        amount immutable in quantity from eternity to eternity" does not
        stand up to known facts. </p>
      <p>[0053] The large aggregate quantity of heat-photons that are
        generated continually by Larmor radiation can account for the
        illumination of stars and for the enormous heat and pressure in
        active galactic centers. Based on the fact that photons exhibit
        momentum, photons must possess mass because, as Newton
        explained, momentum is mass times velocity, which in this case
        is "c". Consequently the creation of photons by induction or by
        Larmor radiation also creates new mass. The conditions that
        Fowler was seeking for hydrogen nucleosynthesis are apparently
        being supplied indefinitely in active galaxies and possibly in
        the sun and other stars above a certain size. This invention
        utilizes a similar unlimited energy source. </p>
      <p>[0054] Another principle that is important to this
        specification is that the transfer of energy by electrical
        induction was found by the Applicant to work in the same manner
        as the transfer of energy by the broadcast and reception of
        oscillating radio signals. A transverse force is communicated in
        both cases, the force declines similarly with distance, and the
        effects of shielding and reflection are identical. Since radio
        signals are communicated by photons, Applicant considers that
        inductive force is also communicated by photons. The radiation
        of newly formed inductive photons results when an accelerated
        charge experiences a change in direction of acceleration.
        Inductive radiation occurs when the acceleration of electric
        charges is reversed, as in Rontgen's bremsstrahlung, in Hertz's
        linear oscillator (plus all other radio-broadcasting antennas),
        and in all coils that carry an alternating current. </p>
      <p>[0055] In a similar case, when electric charges move in a
        curving motion due to a continually changing centripetal
        acceleration, inductive photons are steadily radiated. This
        includes the radiation from electrons orbiting atomic nuclei
        (Larmor radiation) and from conduction electrons flowing in a
        wire coil, whether the current is steady or not. Circularly
        produced inductive photons induce a circular motion
        (diamagnetism) in mobile electrons located near the axis of the
        electron's circular movement. </p>
      <p>[0056] In both the reverse-acceleration and
        centripetal-acceleration cases, inductive photons convey a force
        to mobile electrons that is transverse to the photon's
        propagation path. As Lapp and Andrews (1954) reported,
        "Low-energy photons produce photoelectrons at right angles to
        their path . . . ." This same right-angle force without a direct
        backforce applies to all conduction electrons that are
        accelerated by low-energy photons as well. Hence, inductive
        energy qualifies for exemption from the energy-conservation law
        by Helmholtz's same ad infinitum principle that exempts magnetic
        energy. </p>
      <p>[0057] The transverse force that inductively produced photons
        deliver to mobile electrons is opposite in direction to the
        simultaneous movement of the primary charge that produces the
        radiation. This is shown by Faraday's induced current opposite
        to the inducing current and by the diamagnetically induced
        circular motion that is opposite in a rotational sense to the
        circular electron motion in the coil producing it. An
        oscillating flow of electrons within a loop of a wire coil
        induces a force in the opposite direction on the conduction
        electrons in adjacent loops of the same wire, resulting in
        self-induction. </p>
      <p>[0058] Important to this specification is the realization that
        the energy transmitted by photons is kinetic rather than
        electromagnetic. Inductively radiated photons of low energy, and
        light rays, and X-rays cannot be deflected by an electric or
        magnetic field due to the photons' neutral charge. Neither do
        neutral photons carry with them an electric or magnetic field.
        Photon radiation is produced by a change in the acceleration of
        an electric charge, so it has an electrokinetic origin that
        involves a magnetic force only in special cases. To honor these
        facts, Applicant uses the term "electrokinetic" spectrum in
        place of "electromagnetic" spectrum. </p>
      <p>[0059] Another principle that is important to this
        specification is the realization that, although the charge on
        the electron has a constant value under all conditions, the mass
        of an electron is not a fixed, unchanging amount. All free
        electrons, as in cathode rays, have exactly the same amount of
        mass at subrelativistic velocities, which is called "normal"
        mass and is denoted by m.sub.e. Free electrons have a unique
        charge-to-mass ratio that makes the magnetic force resulting
        from a sub-relativistic velocity imparted to such an electron
        exactly equal to the force that imparts the velocity, so
        magnetic energy output is always equal to the energy input with
        "normal" electrons. </p>
      <p>[0060] Also, when a normal electron is given a subrelativistic
        acceleration, the inductive force it produces is equal to the
        force it receives. The mass of highly conductive electrons of
        metals is apparently very close to normal, but any very slight
        inductive-energy gains would be masked by inefficiencies. The
        ubiquity of free electrons and the conduction electrons of
        metals has led to the view that electron mass is a never-varying
        figure that would allow the energy-conservation law to apply to
        magnetic energy and inductive energy. </p>
      <p>[0061] Accurate determinations of electron mass in solid
        materials have been made possible by cyclotron resonance, which
        is also called diamagnetic resonance. The diamagnetic force
        produced by the flow of electrons steadily in a wire coil
        induces the mobile electrons of a semiconductor to move in a
        circular orbit of indefinite radius but at a definite angular
        frequency. This frequency is related only to the inductive force
        and the electron's mass. At the same time, a repulsive magnetic
        force is developed by the relative velocity between the electron
        flow in the coil and the conduction electrons, causing the
        mobile electrons of the semiconductor to move in a helical path
        away from the coil rather than in planar circles. Only two
        measurements are needed to determine the mass of such an
        electron, the cyclotron frequency that resonates with the
        frequency of the electron's circular motion and the strength of
        the inductive force, which is determined by the current and
        dimensions of the coil. Since the co-produced magnetic field is
        related to the same parameters, its measurement serves as a
        surrogate for inductive force. </p>
      <p>[0062] Because the measured mass of conduction electrons in
        semiconductors is less than normal, a complicated explanation
        has been adopted to defend the constancy of electron mass in
        order to support Helmholtz's energy doctrine. An extra force is
        supposedly received from the vibrational lattice-wave energy of
        the crystal (in what would have to be an act of
        self-refrigeration) to make normal-mass electrons move faster
        than expected around a circular path, thereby giving the
        appearance that the electron has less mass than normal. In this
        explanation the electron is considered to be a smeared-out wave
        rather than a particle, which is contradicted by the
        billiard-ball-like recoil of an electron when it is bumped by a
        quantum of radiation, as described by Arthur Compton and Samuel
        Allison (1935). </p>
      <p>[0063] The fallacy that borrowed energy can provide a boost in
        velocity to an electron is more apparent in the case of linear
        motion. The effective-mass theory considers that the greater
        linear velocity is caused by a boost given to normal-mass
        electrons by a "longitudinal wave" in the same direction as the
        electron motion that is imparted by an externally applied force.
        Since this longitudinal wave also is considered to have a source
        in crystal-lattice vibrations, the effective-mass theory relies
        upon a reversal of entropy in violation of the Second Law of
        Thermodynamics. </p>
      <p>[0064] No reasonable contribution of direction directional
        energy can be invoked from any source to impart abnormally great
        velocity to the conduction electrons in semiconductors. So, the
        operation of apparatus embodiments described herein relies upon
        electrons having particle properties and upon electrons having
        less-than-normal inertial mass without invoking any special
        forces. This is supported by Brennan's (1999) statement that
        "the complicated problem of an electron moving within a crystal
        under the interaction of a periodic but complicated potential
        can be reduced to that of a simple free particle but with a
        modified mass." The term "effective mass" (denoted by m*) was
        bestowed on sub-normal electron mass to indicate that it is not
        considered to be true mass. The term "effective" is herein
        considered redundant in referring to truly inertial mass, but
        "effective mass" still has relevance in referring to the net
        movement of orbital vacancies or "holes" in the opposite
        direction of low-mass electrons. </p>
      <p>[0065] By F=ma, a low-mass electron receives greater
        acceleration and greater velocity from a given force than an
        electron of normal mass. The velocity and kinetic energy
        imparted by a force to an electrically charged body are
        determined by the inertial mass of the body without regard to
        the charge. In contrast, the magnetic force and magnetic energy
        produced transversely from the velocity are determined by the
        electric charge without regard to the body's mass. A smaller
        amount of mass allows a body to attain greater velocity with a
        given force. Hence, the magnetic force produced by the charge at
        this higher velocity will be greater than it would normally be
        for that same amount of force. This allows low-mass electrons to
        produce a magnetic force that is greater than the applied force.
      </p>
      <p>[0066] Also, the amount of inductive radiation energy from
        accelerated electrons is related to an electron's charge without
        regard to its mass. The energy of inductive radiation increases
        with the square of the electron's acceleration according to
        Larmor's (1900) equation, while the acceleration is inversely
        proportional to the lesser electron mass relative to normal
        electron mass. Therefore, the greater-than-normal acceleration
        of low-mass electrons allows the re-radiation of magnified
        inductive-photon energy at a magnification factor that is
        proportional to the inverse square of the electron's mass. E.g.,
        the inductive-energy magnification factor of cadmium selenide
        photoelectrons with 0.13 times normal electron mass is
        (0.13).sup.2=59.times.. </p>
      <p>[0067] Electrons appear to acquire or shed mass from photons in
        order to fit the constraints of particular orbits around nuclei,
        because each orbit dictates a very specific electron mass. In
        metals where the conduction electrons seem to move as a gas, one
        might think that they would assume the normal mass of free
        electrons. But, the largest mean free path of electrons in the
        most conductive metals is reportedly about 100 atomic spacings
        between collisions (Pops, 1997), so the conduction electrons
        apparently fall back into orbit from time to time and thereby
        regain their metal-specific mass values. </p>
      <p>[0068] As conduction electrons pass from one metal type to
        another, they either lose or gain heat-photons to adjust their
        mass to different orbital constraints. In a circuit comprising
        two different metallic conductors placed in series contact with
        each other, the flow of conduction electrons in one direction
        will cause the emission of heat-photons at the junction, while
        an electron flow in the reverse direction causes cooling as the
        result of ambient heat-photons being absorbed by the conduction
        electrons at the junction (Peltier cooling effect). When a metal
        is joined with a semiconductor whose conductive electrons have
        much lower mass than in metals, much greater heating or cooling
        occurs at their junction. </p>
      <p>[0069] John Bardeen (1941) reported that the (effective) mass
        of superconducting electrons in low-temperature superconductors
        is only 10.sup.-4 as great as the mass of normal electrons. This
        is demonstrated when superconducting electrons are accelerated
        to a much faster circular velocity than normal in
        diamagnetically induced eddy currents, which results in enormous
        magnetic forces that are capable of levitating heavy magnetic
        objects. Electrons with 10.sup.-4 times normal mass are
        apparently devoid of (or nearly devoid of) included photon mass,
        so normal electrons are deduced to possess about 10.sup.4 times
        more included photon mass than the bare electron's own mass. </p>
      <p>[0070] The means by which photon mass may be incorporated
        within, or ejected from, electrons can be deduced from known
        information. Based on the Thomson scattering cross-section, the
        classical radius of a normal electron is 2.8.times.10.sup.-15
        cm. If the electron has uniform charge throughout a sphere of
        that radius, the peripheral velocity would greatly exceed the
        velocity of light in order to provide the observed magnetic
        moment. Dehmelt (1989) determined that the radius of the
        spinning charge that creates an electron's magnetism is
        approximately 10.sup.-20 cm. This apparent incongruity can be
        explained if the electron is considered to be a hollow shell
        (which is commensurate with the bare electron's tiny mass in
        comparison to the very large radius) and if the negative charge
        of the shell is not the source of the magnetic moment. </p>
      <p>[0071] It has long been known that a photon can be split into a
        negative ion (electron) and a positive ion (positron), each
        having the same amount of charge but of opposite sign. Electrons
        and positrons can recombine into electrically neutral photons,
        so it is apparent that photons are composed of a positive and a
        negative ion. Two ions spinning around each other could produce
        the photon's wave nature. The only size of photon ion that can
        exist as a separate entity has a charge of exactly plus one or
        minus one, whereas the ions can have very much larger or very
        much smaller charge and mass when combined in photons, as long
        as the two ions are equal in charge and mass. Combined in a
        photon, the two ions are apparently attracted together so
        strongly that their individual volumes are very much smaller
        than as separate entities. </p>
      <p>[0072] When a dipole photon enters an electron shell, its
        negative-ion portion is expected to be forced toward the shell's
        center by Coulombic repulsion, while the photon's positive ion
        would be attracted by the negative charge of the shell equally
        in all directions. The negative photon ions would likely merge
        into a single body at the electron's center while the
        positive-ion portion would orbit around the centralized negative
        ion to retain the photon's angular momentum. The high peripheral
        velocity of this orbiting photon mass would enable portions of
        photon material to spin off and exit the electron shell at the
        same velocity that they entered the electron, i.e., the speed of
        light. The orbiting of the positive photon charge at Dehmelt's
        small radius most likely accounts for the magnetic moment that
        is observed in electrons of normal mass. </p>
      <p>[0073] Liberated low-mass conduction electrons within intrinsic
        semiconductors (which are also photoconductors by their nature)
        and within doped semiconductors are mostly protected against
        acquiring mass from ambient-heat photons by the heat-insulative
        properties of the semiconductors. In contrast, low-mass
        electrons injected into heat-conducting metals rapidly acquire
        mass from ambient-heat photons. Superconducting low-mass
        electrons of extremely low mass are protected against acquiring
        mass from ambient-heat photons by the existence of cryogenic
        conditions, but they are vulnerable to internal heat-photons
        created by excessive induction. </p>
      <p>[0074] Conduction electrons of metals typically move as a group
        at drift velocities of less than one millimeter per second,
        although the velocity of the electrical effects approaches the
        velocity of light. (Photons are probably involved in the
        movement of electrical energy in metallic conductors.) In
        contrast, conductive low-mass electrons can move individually at
        great velocities in superconductors and semiconductors. Brennan
        (1999, p. 631) reports the drift velocity of a particular
        electron moving in a semiconductor to be one micrometer in about
        10 picoseconds, which is equivalent to 100 kilometers per
        second. </p>
      <p>[0075] The concentration of the conduction electrons in metals
        is the same as the number of atoms, whereas in semiconductors
        the mobile low-mass electrons that are free to move can vary
        greatly with the amount of certain photon radiation received.
        Since the magnitude of an electric current is a summation of the
        number of electrons involved times their respective drift
        velocities, the current developed by a small ensemble of
        photoconducting electrons moving at high speed can exceed the
        current of a much greater number of conduction electrons moving
        at a very low speed in a metal. </p>
      <p>[0076] A general feature of intrinsic semiconductors is that
        they become photoconductive in proportion to the amount of
        bombardment by some particular electron-liberating frequency (or
        band of frequencies) of photon energy up to some limit. The
        amount of bombardment by the particular wavelength (or,
        equivalently, the frequency) increases along with all other
        photon wavelengths as the ambient temperature rises, that is, as
        the area increases under Planck's black-body radiation curve.
        Consequently, the conductivity of semiconductors continues to
        increase with temperature, while the conductivity drops almost
        to zero at low temperature unless superconductivity occurs. </p>
      <p>[0077] A single high-energy alpha particle can liberate a great
        number of low-mass electrons in a thin-film semiconductor, as
        Leimer's (1915) energy-magnifying experiment appears to show.
        Leimer's alpha radiation was situated near the distant end of a
        suspended antenna wire of unreported length when he experienced
        the maximum magnetic energy increase in the coil of the ammeter
        in the receiver. The low-mass electrons had to have traveled the
        entire length of the suspended antenna wire and the connecting
        line to his receiving apparatus without encountering any
        trapping holes. Assuming these electrons traversed a distance of
        1 to 10 meters in less than one-half cycle of the radio
        frequency (that is, less than 4 microseconds at 128 kHz) at
        which time the low-mass electrons' direction would have been
        reversed this would be equivalent to velocities of 25 to 250
        km/sec. </p>
      <p>[0078] A great number of superconducting electrons can be set
        in motion by inductive photon radiation. In contrast, inductive
        photon radiation can pass mostly through photoconductors that
        have low concentrations of mobile, low-mass electrons.
        Applicant's interpretation of Leimer's experiment is that the
        liberated low-mass electrons of the semiconductor-coating of the
        antenna wire were not directly accelerated by the inductive
        photons of the radio signal, but rather were accelerated to high
        velocities by an oscillating electric field created in the
        metallic wire by the radio photons. </p>
      <p>[0079] A review of an experiment performed by File and Mills
        (1963) shows that the very low mass of superconducting electrons
        is responsible for causing supercurrents to differ from normal
        electric currents. A superconducting solenoidal coil (comprising
        a Nb-25% Zr alloy wire below 4.3.degree. K.) with the terminals
        spot-welded together to make a continuous conductor, was
        employed. Extremely slow declines of induced supercurrents were
        observed, which can be attributed to an enormous increase in the
        coil's self-induction. Because a supercurrent approaches its
        maximum charge asymptotically when charging up, or approaches
        zero current asymptotically when discharging, a convenient
        measure of the coil's charging or discharging rate is the
        "time-constant." The time-constant has the same value for both
        charging and discharging, and it is defined as (a) the time
        needed for charging the coil to 63% of the maximum amount of
        current inducible in the coil by a given diamagnetic force, or
        (b) the time needed to discharge 63% of the coil's induced
        current. </p>
      <p>[0080] In normal conductors, the inductive time-constant is
        calculated by the inductance of the coil divided by the
        resistance of the coil. By use of an empirical equation, the
        inductance of the coil in its non-superconducting state is
        calculated to be 0.34 Henry based on a double-layered solenoid
        of 384 turns that measured 4 inches (10 cm) diameter and 10
        inches (25 cm) long. The resistance of the 0.020-inch diameter
        (0.51 mm) wire at T=5.degree. K. (just above T.sub.c) is
        estimated, by using data for Zr alone, to be 4.times.10.sup.2
        ohms. (Resistivity data were not available for Nb or the subject
        alloy.) Under non-superconducting conditions, the time-constant
        for charging and discharging this coil is thereby calculated to
        be approximately 8.times.10.sup.-5 sec. </p>
      <p>[0081] The time it took to charge up a supercurrent in the coil
        in the experiment was not reported. But, based on the reported
        50 re-energizings and magnetic determinations performed in 200
        hours, the measured charging time in the superconducting state
        is computed to be no more than 4 hours on average. </p>
      <p>[0082] Using Bardeen's (1941) m*.apprxeq.(10.sup.-4)m.sub.e for
        the order of magnitude of the low-T.sub.c superconducting
        electron's mass, and using Larmor's equation (1900), which
        relates inductive radiation power to the square of the
        acceleration of the charge, the inductance of the coil is
        expected to increase by (10.sup.4).sup.2=10.sup.8 times in the
        superconducting state. Thus, the calculated increase in the
        time-constant of charging up the supercurrent is
        (8.times.10.sup.-5)(10.sup.8)=8.times.10.sup.3 seconds, or 2.2
        hours, which is the same order of magnitude as the maximum
        actual charging time. The self-induction increased by that
        amount because the low-mass electrons are accelerated 10.sup.4
        times faster. </p>
      <p>[0083] In the case of discharging, the time constant of the
        supercurrent was projected by File and Mills from measured
        declines observed over periods of 21 and 37 days. The
        projections of the two 63% declines agreed closely at
        4.times.10.sup.12 sec (=1.3.times.10.sup.5 years). Therefore,
        the time-constant of supercurrent discharge, based on projecting
        actual measurements, had increased by 5.times.10.sup.16 times
        over the time-constant for electrons of normal mass. </p>
      <p>[0084] The driving force during charging had been the applied
        inductive force, whereas the driving force during discharging
        was the supercurrent that had been magnified 10.sup.8 times.
        Therefore, during the discharging of the supercurrent, the
        time-constant is increased again by 10.sup.8 times, so the
        calculated total increase in the time-constant of discharge is
        10.sup.8.times.10.sup.8=10.sup.16 times greater than the normal
        time-constant. This calculated value of the non-superconducting
        time-constant, based solely on the increase of inductive
        radiation due to extremely low electron mass, compares favorably
        in magnitude with the actually observed value of
        5.times.10.sup.16 times the normal time-constant. </p>
      <p>[0085] The superconducting coil required no more than four
        hours to charge up the supercurrent, yet during subsequent
        discharge the superconducting coil was projected to radiate
        inductive photon energy from the centripetal acceleration of the
        superconducting electrons for 130,000 years before declining by
        63%. If this experiment could take place where no energy would
        be needed to sustain critical cryogenic conditions, as in outer
        space, the lengthy discharge of this energized coil would
        clearly demonstrate the creation of energy in the form of newly
        created photons inductively radiating from the superconducting
        low-mass electrons that circulate around the coils' loops.
        Applicant interprets this as showing that low-mass electrons are
        capable of inductive-energy-magnification based solely on their
        mass relative to that of normal electrons. </p>
      <p>[0086] In the embodiments described below, the magnified
        inductive energy of low-mass electrons is utilized in coils for
        electric-energy generation by employing a flow of inductively
        accelerated photons that alternates in direction. This, in turn,
        drives low-mass electrons in an oscillating manner, so this
        forced reversal involves only a single stage of inductive-energy
        magnification rather than the two stages (charging and naturally
        discharging) in the foregoing experiment. </p>
      <p><b><i>Mode of Operation</i></b> </p>
      <p>[0087] Inductive photons radiating from an oscillating electric
        current in a sending conductor (e.g., from a
        radio-wave-broadcasting antenna) convey a force, on conduction
        electrons in a receiving conductor, that is transverse to the
        incidence direction of the incident inductive photons on the
        receiving conductor. As a result, no back-force is transferred
        directly back to the sending conductor. Applicant has discovered
        that the action of this transverse force on low-mass electrons
        in a receiving conductor is analogous to the action of Gauss's
        transverse magnetic force on free electrons in a conductor,
        which is not subject to the kinetics law of conservation of
        energy. If the receiving conductor has low-mass conduction
        electrons, then this transverse force would impart greater
        acceleration to the low-mass electrons than imparted by the
        force to normal free electrons. The resulting greater drift
        velocities of low-mass electrons than normal free electrons in
        the receiving conductor would yield an increased magnitude of
        inductive force produced by the low-mass electrons in the
        receiving conductor and hence produce a magnification of the
        irradiation energy of inductive photons. </p>
      <p>[0088] The direction of the transverse force imparted by the
        radiated inductive photons on conduction electrons in the
        receiving conductor is opposite the direction of the
        corresponding electron flow in the sending conductor. This
        relationship is similar to the inductive force on electrons in
        the secondary coil of a transformer, which also is opposite to
        the direction of flow of electrons in the primary coil. </p>
      <p>[0089] Various embodiments of Applicant's electrical generator
        employ inductive photons radiated from electrical oscillations
        in a "sending coil." Inductive photons are radiated from the
        sending coil toward an inductive-photon-receiving coil, termed
        an "energy-magnifying coil," that comprises a photoconductive or
        superconductive material, or other suitable material as
        described later below. The energy-magnifying coil is placed in a
        condition favorable for the production of low-mass electrons
        that participate in electrical conduction in the
        energy-magnifying coil. For example, if the energy-magnifying
        coil is made of photoconductive material, the coil is provided
        with a photoconduction exciter. Alternatively, if the
        energy-magnifying coil is made of a superconductor, the
        energy-magnifying coil is placed in an environment at a
        temperature (T) no greater than the critical temperature
        (T.sub.c); i.e., T&lt;T.sub.c. In the former example, the
        photoconduction exciter can be a source of illumination that
        produces an appropriate wavelength of excitive electrokinetic
        radiation. If the energy-magnifying coil is comprised of a doped
        semiconductor, the condition that provides mobile low-mass
        electrons already exists. </p>
      <p>[0090] In the energy-magnifying coil, the greater-than-normal
        acceleration of the low-mass electrons produces
        greater-than-normal inductive forces in the form of
        greater-than-normal radiation of inductive photons from the
        coil. The resulting increased inductive-photon energy from the
        photoconductor or superconductor is converted into useful
        electrical energy in an output coil inductively coupled to the
        energy-magnifying coil. The output coil can be made of insulated
        metallic wire. An exemplary output coil is situated coaxially
        with and nested within the energy-magnification coil; such an
        output coil is termed herein an "internal output coil." </p>
      <p>[0091] The ability of the subject apparatus to produce more
        energy output than energy input is based on the output coil
        receiving more of the magnified energy from the
        energy-magnifying coil than is returned as a back-force from the
        output coil to the energy-magnifying coil. This principle is
        termed herein "energy leverage." </p>
      <p>[0092] The oscillations in the energy-magnifying coil are
        initiated by an external energy-input source that provides an
        initiating impulse of electron flow in the sending coil. For
        example, the external energy-input source can be an adjacent
        independent electromagnet or an adjacent permanent magnet moved
        rapidly relative to the sending coil. The initiating impulse
        commences an oscillation in the sending coil that stimulates
        radiation of inductive photons from the sending coil to the
        energy-magnifying coil. Energy from the external energy-input
        source is magnified by the apparatus so long as the
        energy-magnifying coil does not act as an independent oscillator
        at a different frequency. Independent oscillation is desirably
        avoided by connecting the ends or terminals of the
        energy-magnifying coil to each other in such a way that it
        results in one continuous coil, or a continuous multiple-coil
        system or systems, connected together in such a way that
        continuity exists for the conduction of low-mass electrons
        throughout the entire coil system. The energy-magnifying coil
        inductively creates more energy in the output coil than the
        energy of the initial impulse. The resulting magnified output of
        electrical energy produced by the apparatus is available for
        useful purposes in a work loop. </p>
      <p>[0093] After initiation the apparatus is made self-sustaining
        using a feed-back loop arranged in parallel with the work loop
        that includes the sending coil, and with a capacitor located in
        the feed-back loop to make it an L-C circuit. I.e., after
        start-up of the apparatus using the external energy-input
        source, the apparatus becomes self-resonating, which allows the
        external energy-input source to be decoupled from the apparatus
        without causing the apparatus to cease production of electrical
        energy. </p>
      <p>[0094] During normal self-sustained operation, a portion of the
        output electrical energy is returned to the sending coil by the
        feed-back loop, thereby obviating the need to use the external
        energy-input source for sustaining the oscillations in the
        sending coil. In other words, after startup the external energy
        that was used by the sending coil to excite the photoconductive
        material or the superconducting material in the
        energy-magnifying coil is replaced by a portion of the output
        energy produced by the apparatus itself. The remainder of the
        output electrical energy is available in the work loop for
        useful purposes. </p>
      <p>[0095] Initiating the generation of electrical energy by the
        apparatus takes advantage of the fact that the inductive
        back-force sent from the output coil to the energy-magnifying
        coil (and hence ultimately back to the sending coil) arrives at
        the sending coil one cycle behind the corresponding pulse that
        initiated the flow of electrons. This one-cycle lag of the
        back-force, as well as a corresponding one-cycle lag in the
        feed-back, enables small starting pulses produced in the sending
        coil to produce progressively greater electrical outputs each
        successive cycle. Consequently, assuming the electrical load is
        not excessive during startup, only a relatively few initiating
        cycles from the external energy-input source typically are
        needed for achieving production by the apparatus of an amount of
        output power sufficient for driving the load as well as
        providing sufficient energy feedback to the sending coil in a
        sustained manner. </p>
      <p>[0096] A half-cycle of the one-cycle lag occurs between an
        initial acceleration of electrons in the sending coil and a
        corresponding initial oscillation in the energy-magnifying coil.
        This half-cycle lag occurs because induction photons are not
        radiated from the initial acceleration of electrons in the
        sending coil but rather are radiated when the electrons are
        reverse-accelerated. (Kramers, 1923, and Compton and Allison,
        1935, p. 106.) As the newly formed photons are being radiated by
        the respective deceleration of electrons in the sending coil,
        even more new photons are being formed simultaneously by the new
        direction (i.e., reverse direction) of acceleration under
        oscillating conditions. Thus, the radiation of photons from
        electrons alternatingly accelerated in the opposite direction
        from the conveyed force continues each half-cycle after the
        initial half-cycle. </p>
      <p>[0097] Applicant also discovered that a half-cycle lag also
        occurs between the initial flow of electrons in the primary coil
        of a certain type of transformer, which is comprised simply of
        coils nested coaxially rather than being inductively coupled by
        an iron core, and the resulting electron flow induced in the
        secondary coil. Applied to the instant apparatus, these findings
        indicate that a second half-cycle lag occurs between the
        acceleration of low-mass electrons in the energy-magnifying coil
        and the corresponding electron flow induced in the output coil.
        The feed-back from the output coil boosts the electron flow in
        the sending coil one whole cycle after the initial pulse. </p>
      <p>[0098] As discussed above, the energy-magnifying coil comprises
        either a photoconductor, a doped semiconductor, or a
        superconductor as a source of, and as a conductor of, low-mass
        electrons. The general configuration of the coil is similar in
        either case. The coil including a photoconductor or doped
        semiconductor has an operational advantage at normal
        temperatures, and the coil including a superconductor has an
        operational advantage at subcritical temperatures
        (T&lt;T.sub.c), such as in outer space. </p>

        1(A)-1(B), electrical oscillations from the source 21 and
        conducted to the sending coil 20 cause inductive photons 22 to
        radiate from the sending coil. The radiated photons 22 convey
        transverse forces in the same manner that a radio-broadcasting
        antenna transmits oscillating energy. The sending coil 20 can
        comprise a single layer or multiple layers of insulated metal
        wire (e.g., insulated copper wire) forming the coil. One layer
        is sufficient, but an additional layer or layers may increase
        operational efficiency. If necessary or desired, the turns of
        wire can be formed on a cylindrical substrate made of a suitable
        dielectric. </p>
      <p>[0100] The inductive photons 22 radiating from the sending coil
        20 propagate to an energy-magnifying coil 24 that desirably has
        a cylindrical profile extending parallel to the sending coil. In
        the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B), the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 does not terminate at the ends, but
        rather it is constructed with a connector 30 to form a
        continuous conductor. The energy-magnifying coil 24 desirably is
        a helical coil made of a material comprising a photoconductive
        or superconductive material, or other suitable material. If
        necessary or desired, the energy-magnifying coil can be formed
        on a substrate that, if used, desirably is transmissive to the
        inductive-photon radiation produced by the coil. </p>
      <p>[0101] In an energy-magnifying coil 24 made of a
        superconducting material, a large population of conductive
        low-mass electrons is produced in the coil by lowering the
        temperature of the coil to T&lt;T.sub.c, wherein T.sub.c is the
        critical temperature of the particular superconducting material.
        By way of example, subcritical temperatures are readily
        available in outer space or are produced under cryogenic
        conditions. </p>
      <p>[0102] In an energy-magnifying coil 24 made of a photoconductor
        material, a large population of conductive low-mass electrons is
        produced in the coil by illuminating the coil with photons of an
        appropriate wavelength, such as photons produced by a
        photoconduction exciter 26. The photoconduction exciter 26
        desirably is situated and configured to illuminate substantially
        at least the same side of the energy-magnifying coil 24 that
        receives inductive photons 22 radiating directly from the
        sending coil 20. Alternatively, the photoconduction exciter 26
        can be situated and configured to illuminate all sides of the
        energy-magnifying coil 24. In the depicted embodiment the
        photoconduction exciter 26 can be at least one incandescent lamp
        (as shown) energized by conventional circuitry (not shown).
        Alternatively, the photoconduction exciter 26 can be at least
        one gas-discharge lamp or one or more light-emitting diodes
        (LEDs). The wavelength produced by the photoconduction exciter
        26 can be, for example, in the infrared (IR), visible,
        ultraviolet (UV), or X-ray range as required by the particular
        photoconductive material in the energy-magnifying coil 24.
        Another possible form of the photoconduction exciter 26 is a
        source of photons in the gigahertz or the terahertz portion of
        the electrokinetic spectrum. Other photoconduction exciters are
        configured, as required, to produce a suitable wavelength from
        the radio-wave portion of the electrokinetic spectrum. The
        illumination can be either direct from the photoconduction
        exciter 26 to the energy-magnifying coil 24 or conveyed from a
        remotely located photoconduction exciter 26 to the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 via optical fibers, light pipes, or
        the like. </p>
      <p>[0103] FIGS. 1(B) and 1(C) are respective orthogonal end views
        of the sending coil 20 and energy-magnifying coil 24 shown in
        FIG. 1(A). The radiation of inductive photons 22 from the
        sending coil 20 is indicated schematically in FIGS. 1(A)-1(C) by
        small, jagged arrows. The forces delivered by the photons 22 to
        the conductive low-mass electrons in the energy-magnifying coil
        24 alternate in directions that are opposite the respective
        directions of simultaneous electron flow in the sending coil 20.
        Whenever the particular oscillation phase of electron flow in
        the sending coil 20 is in the direction of the curved arrow 25a
        adjacent the sending coil 20 in FIG. 1(B), the resulting
        transverse photon force causes a flow of low-mass electrons in
        the energy-magnifying coil 24 depicted by the curved arrow 27a
        adjacent the energy-magnifying coil 24. </p>
      <p>[0104] The shaded sector 29 shown in FIG. 1(B) denotes the
        proportion of inductive-photon radiation 22 from the sending
        coil 20 actually received by the single energy-magnifying coil
        24 shown, compared to the entire 360-degree radiation of
        inductive photons 22 from the sending coil 20. Aside from a
        small amount of inductive-photon radiation lost from the ends of
        the sending coil 20, the relative amount of the total energy of
        inductive-photon radiation received by the energy-magnifying
        coil 24 is determined by the angle subtended by the
        energy-magnifying coil 24, relative to the entire 360 degrees of
        inductive-photon radiation from the sending coil 20. </p>
      <p>[0105] In FIG. 1(C) the low-mass conduction electrons of the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 are accelerated to a higher drift
        velocity than normal free electrons in the energy-magnifying
        coil 24 would be. As noted above, the sending coil 20 is
        energized by alternating electron flow, which causes a periodic
        reversal of direction of electron flow in the sending coil 20
        (compare the direction of the arrow 25b in FIG. 1(C) with the
        direction of the arrow 25a in FIG. 1(B)). Each reversal of
        direction of electron flow in the sending coil 20 causes a
        corresponding reversal in the direction of acceleration of the
        low-mass electrons in the energy-magnifying coil 24 (compare the
        direction of the arrow 27b in FIG. 1(C) with the direction of
        the arrow 27a in FIG. 1(B)). Each such reversal in direction of
        acceleration causes a corresponding radiation of inductive
        photons (jagged arrows 18a, 18b) radially outwardly and radially
        inwardly, respectively, from the energy-magnifying coil 24. Note
        that the arrows 18a, 18b are larger than the arrows denoting the
        inductive photons 22, indicating the greater energy associated
        with the photons (arrows 18a, 18b) from the energy-magnifying
        coil 24 compared to the energy associated with the inductive
        photons (arrows 22) from the sending coil 20. This symbolically
        denotes energy magnification.) Note also that, of the magnified
        inductive-photon energy radiating from the energy-magnifying
        coil 24, substantially half is directed inwardly (arrows 18b),
        and substantially the other half is radiated outwardly (arrows
        18a). </p>
      <p>[0106] Turning now to FIG. 2(A), the sending coil 20 and
        energy-magnifying coil 24 are shown. The energy-magnifying coil
        24 in FIG. 2(A) includes an internal output coil 28a that
        desirably is situated coaxially inwardly of, and coextensively
        with, the energy-magnifying coil 24. A work loop 48 can be
        connected to the ends of the internal output coil 28a, thereby
        forming an electrical circuit in which a load 49 is indicated
        symbolically as a resistor. The internal output coil 28a and the
        conductors of the work loop 48 desirably are made of insulated
        metallic (e.g., copper) wire. </p>
      <p>[0107] FIG. 2(B) depicts a transverse section of the coils
        shown in FIG. 2(A). In FIG. 2(B) the magnified inductive-photon
        energy (shaded area 19) produced by the energy-magnifying coil
        24 and directed radially inwardly toward the internal output
        coil 28a induces a corresponding oscillating electron flow in
        the internal output coil 28a. Thus, the work loop 48 connected
        across the internal output coil 28a is provided with greater
        energy than was received by the energy-magnifying coil 24 from
        the sending coil 20. The direction of the electron flow (arrow
        17) in the internal output coil 28a is opposite to the direction
        of flow (arrow 27b) in the energy-magnifying coil 24, which in
        turn is opposite to the direction of electron flow 25b in the
        sending coil 20. </p>
      <p>[0108] In FIG. 2(B) the annular-shaped shaded area 19 between
        the energy-magnifying coil 24 and the internal output coil 28a
        indicates that substantially all the internally directed
        magnified inductive-photon energy (i.e., approximately half of
        the total radiation energy) from the energy-magnifying coil 24
        is directed to and captured by the internal output coil 28a. In
        contrast, the shaded sector 16 extending from the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 to the sending coil 20 indicates that
        a relatively small proportion of the outwardly directed
        magnified radiation 18a from the energy-magnifying coil 24 is
        directed to the sending coil 20 where the radiation provides a
        corresponding back-force. Aside from the small amount of
        inductive-photon radiation lost from the ends of the
        energy-magnifying coil 24, the relative amount of the magnified
        inductive-photon radiation (sector 16) providing the back-force
        on the sending coil 20 is a function of the angle subtended by
        the sector 16, compared to the 360-degree radiation from the
        energy-magnifying coil 24. </p>
      <p>[0109] The ratio of magnified energy 18b, from the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 and received by the internal output
        coil 28a, to the magnified energy 18a received as a back-force
        by the sending coil 20 denotes the energy "leverage" achieved by
        the subject apparatus. If this ratio is greater than unity, then
        the energy output from the internal output coil 28a exceeds the
        energy input to the energy-magnifying coil 24. This energy
        leverage is key to the self-sustained operation of the
        apparatus, especially whenever the apparatus is being used to
        drive a load. In other words, with a sufficiently large
        energy-magnification factor achieved by the energy-magnifying
        coil 24, the electrical energy available in the work loop 48
        exceeds the input energy that produces the oscillations in the
        sending coil 20. The electric power input to the sending coil 20
        thereby produces magnified electric power in the internal output
        coil 28a that can perform useful work in the work loop 48 while
        self-powering continued operation of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0110] Reference is now made to FIG. 3, which schematically
        depicts aspects of the apparatus 15 responsible for
        self-generation of electric power by employing a feed-back loop
        46. The conductors of the feed-back loop 46 can be made of
        insulated metallic wire. (In FIG. 3 the dotted lines 47a and
        dotted arrow 47b indicate that the internal output coil 28a
        actually is disposed coaxially inside the energy-magnifying coil
        24, as described above, but is depicted in the figure outside
        the energy-magnifying coil for ease of illustration.) The
        feed-back loop 46 conducts a portion of the electric power from
        the internal output coil 28a back to the sending coil 20. The
        remaining portion of the electric power from the internal output
        coil 28a is directed to the work loop 48 where the power is
        utilized for useful work 51 (e.g., an electrical resistor). The
        relative proportions of output power delivered to the feed-back
        loop 46 and to the work loop 48 can be varied by adjusting a
        variable resistor 50. </p>
      <p>[0111] As noted above, an initial source of electrical energy
        is used for "starting" the apparatus 15 by initiating an
        oscillation in the sending coil 20. After starting, under usual
        operating conditions the apparatus 15 is self-resonant and no
        longer requires input of energy from the initial source. The
        particular inductance and distributed capacitance of the sending
        coil 20 plus all other capacitances and inductances in the
        apparatus provide a certain corresponding frequency of
        self-resonating oscillation. In the feed-back loop 46 is a
        capacitor 77 that makes the apparatus an L-C circuit that
        oscillates at its own frequency. The frequency can be changed by
        altering the capacitance or the inductance of the apparatus, or
        both. The capacitor 77 can be a variable capacitor by which the
        frequency can be adjusted. </p>
      <p>[0112] As shown in FIG. 3, the initial source of oscillating
        electrical energy can be an impulse from an external
        electromagnet 52 powered by its own energy source (e.g., a
        battery 53 as shown or other dc or ac source). For example, the
        electromagnet 52 can be placed near the sending coil 20 or other
        portion of the feed-back loop 46 and energized by a momentary
        discharge delivered from the battery 53 by a switch 57. The
        resulting pulse generated in the electromagnet 52 initiates a
        corresponding electrical pulse in the sending coil 20 that
        initiates self-sustaining oscillations in the apparatus 15. In
        another embodiment, the electromagnet 52 can be energized
        briefly by an ac source (not shown). In yet another embodiment,
        the initial source can be a permanent magnet that is moved
        rapidly (either mechanically or manually) near the sending coil
        20 or other portion of the feed-back circuitry. In any event,
        the pulse provided by the initial source initiates electrical
        oscillations in the sending coil 20 that produce corresponding
        oscillating inductive-photon radiation 22 from the sending coil
        20, as shown schematically in FIG. 3 by thin, jagged arrows. The
        inductive-photon radiation 22 from the sending coil 20 causes,
        in turn, re-radiation of magnified inductive-photon energy 18b
        from low-mass electrons in the energy-magnifying coil 24, as
        shown schematically in FIG. 3 by thick, jagged arrows. FIG. 3
        depicts a photoconductive energy-magnifying coil 24 that is
        illuminated meanwhile by an incandescent photoconduction exciter
        26 energized by a respective power source 55 (e.g., an
        externally connected battery as shown). </p>
      <p>[0113] A sufficiently high energy-magnification factor of the
        apparatus 15 allows the magnified energy from the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 to induce greater energy in the
        internal output coil 28a than the energy of the corresponding
        initial impulse. A portion of the magnified electrical energy is
        returned to the sending coil 20 via the feed-back loop 46 to
        sustain the oscillations. </p>
      <p>[0114] The remaining, surplus energy from the internal output
        coil 28a is available for application to useful work via the
        work loop 48. In one embodiment some of this useful work can be
        used for illuminating the photoconduction exciter 26 (circuitry
        not shown) in an apparatus configuration in which the
        energy-magnifying coil 24 comprises a photoconductor. In another
        embodiment some of this useful work can be used for maintaining
        cryogenic (T&lt;T.sub.c) conditions for an apparatus
        configuration in which the energy-magnifying coil 24 comprises a
        superconductor. </p>
      <p>[0115] After starting oscillations in the apparatus 15,
        electron flow builds up rapidly so long as the load 49 does not
        draw off too much of the output energy during startup. Upon
        reaching operational equilibrium, the output of electrical power
        from the apparatus 15 is a rapidly alternating current (ac). The
        ac output can be rectified by conventional means to produce
        direct current (dc), and the output can be regulated using
        conventional means as required. Many variations of conventional
        circuitry are possible, such as, but not limited to, automatic
        voltage controllers, current controllers, solenoidal switches,
        transformers, and rectifiers. </p>
      <p>[0116] Regarding the energy-magnifying coil 24, an exemplary
        embodiment can be made from a low-T.sub.c superconductor such as
        commercially available, flexible, niobium-zirconium wire that
        can be formed readily into a coil. Other embodiments, as noted
        above, of the energy-magnifying coil 24 can be made using a
        photoconductive material or a high-T.sub.c superconductor. Most
        high-T.sub.c superconductors (and some photoconductors) have
        ceramic-like properties and thus require application of special
        methods for forming the material into a cylindrical coil having
        electrical continuity throughout. Some commercially available
        high-T.sub.c superconductors are available in ribbon or tape
        form. The energy-magnifying coil 24 can be free-standing or
        supported on a rigid substrate. </p>
      <p>[0117] By way of example, an energy-magnifying coil 24 can be
        made from a ribbon of flexible photoconductive material such as
        the material discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,281, incorporated
        herein by reference. Briefly, a layer of stress-compliant metal
        is placed on a plastic ribbon. Then, the photoconductive
        material is deposited on both sides of the metal-covered ribbon
        and the edges of the ribbon so that the metal coats the ribbon
        all the way around. Such a configuration would allow low-mass
        electrons in the photoconductive material to receive energy from
        inductive photons emitted from the sending coil 20 on one side
        of the ribbon while re-radiating magnified energy from both
        sides of the ribbon. </p>
      <p>[0118] In another example a flexible photoconductor ribbon is
        made from a flexible organic polymer having photoconductive
        properties. (High electrical conductivity observed in
        photoconductive polymers is attributed to the presence of
        low-mass electrons in the material.) The flexible,
        photoconductive ribbon can be wound on a dielectric tubular
        support to form the energy-magnifying coil 24. </p>
      <p>[0119] In yet another example, a thick-film coating of
        photoconductive cadmium sulfide or cadmium selenide is formed on
        a wire coil by sintering a paste, which comprises a powder of
        finely ground CdS or CdSe crystals mixed with water and at least
        a fluidizer such as cadmium chloride, at a temperature of
        550.degree. C. to 600.degree. C. in a controlled atmosphere.
        During sintering the boundaries of the small crystals become
        melted with the heated fluidizer, allowing the crystals to
        regrow together and solidify when the fluidizer evaporates and
        the sintered coating is cooled. Alternatively, copper oxides are
        formed in place on bare copper or bronze wire by heating the
        wire above about 260.degree. C. in an oxygen atmosphere, or by
        application of chemical oxidants. </p>
      <p>[0120] In yet another example, a coil of a ceramic-like
        superconductor or photoconductor is made by tape-casting,
        extruding, slip-casting, cold- or hot-pressing, or coating of
        the material as a thin film arranged helically on a tubular
        dielectric substrate. The assembly is heat-treated in a
        controlled-atmosphere furnace to increase intercrystalline
        contacts. Alternatively, the thin film of superconductor or
        photoconductor is formed over the entire exterior of the
        dielectric substrate, followed by removal of selected portions
        of the superconductor or photoconductor to form the desired
        helical coil. </p>
      <p>[0121] In some photoconductors and doped semiconductors, only a
        small portion of a population of inductive photons irradiated on
        the material impact with, and yield acceleration of, low-mass
        electrons in the material. This is due to a low density of
        photoconductive low-mass electrons in the material. In such a
        case, inductive-photon radiation passing through the material
        can be captured efficiently by normal free conduction electrons
        in a metallic strip that desirably is in immediate contact with,
        or embedded in, the material. The acceleration of normal free
        electrons in the metallic conductor sets up an electric field
        that assists in accelerating the low-mass photoelectrons. In
        this configuration, it is desirable that the photoconductive
        material be disposed completely over and around the metallic
        strip so that the photoconductor faces both outwardly and
        inwardly, with both sides of the photoconductor or doped
        semiconductor being in electrical contact with each other. </p>
      <p>[0122] One factor in the choice of photoconductor material to
        use in forming the energy-magnifying coil 24 is the potential
        magnification of energy that can be realized by low-mass
        electrons of an n-type or p-type photoconductive material. Other
        important factors are the quantity of low-mass electrons that
        are available in the photoconductive material for a given amount
        of illumination and the actual electrical conductance of the
        material. Standard illumination-sensitivity measurements provide
        a general overall index of the ability of a photoconductor to
        serve effectively in magnifying energy. </p>
      <p>[0123] Cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide, the most common
        photoconductive compounds that are commercially available, have
        calculated magnification factors of 37 and 59, respectively. The
        peak response wavelength of cadmium sulfide is 515 nanometers
        (in the green part of the visible spectrum) and of cadmium
        selenide is 730 nanometers (in the near-infrared part of the
        spectrum). Cadmium sulfide can be mixed with cadmium selenide
        under certain conditions, so the resulting mixture assumes
        photoconductive characteristics that are intermediate the
        respective photoconductivities of the individual compounds.
        Mixtures can thereby be produced having peak wavelengths that
        are matched to wavelengths of commercially available LEDs of
        many sizes and illumination intensities. Some semiconductors
        that become photoconductive at a wavelength smaller than the
        wavelength produced by currently available LEDs can be made
        conductive of low-mass electrons merely by heating. Applicant
        has found that gallium arsenide develops considerably higher
        conductivity than copper or silver at a temperature of
        100.degree. C., and that the conductive electrons are low-mass.
        Also, alpha radiation is capable of liberating many low-mass
        electrons in some semiconductors. A second electron of
        comparatively low mass may have been liberated from cupric oxide
        by alpha radiation along with the outer copper electron in
        Leimer's (1915) experiments, since the measured energy
        magnification exceeded the magnification calculated from
        cyclotron resonance of CuO, which most likely pertains only to
        the mass of the outer electron. </p>
      <p>[0124] Dopants can be added to a semiconductor to make it more
        conductive of low-mass electrons without illumination. Also, the
        illumination-sensitivity and conductivity of cadmium sulfide are
        increased by adding small amounts of donor-type dopants such as,
        but not limited to, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, arsenides,
        antimonides, and phosphides of the Type-IIIa elements: aluminum,
        gallium, indium, and thallium. In this regard, the
        photoconductors of high-sensitivity photovoltaic cells may
        comprise as many as five different compounds. The actual
        mixtures of photoconductive compounds and dopants used in
        commercially available photovoltaic cells often are trade
        secrets. But, the sensitivities and conductances of the cells
        usually are given or are measurable, and this data can be used
        advantageously in selecting a particular photoconductive
        compound for use in the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0125] Other photoconductive compounds or elements can be
        employed in energy-magnifying coils. For example, the conduction
        electrons of silicon have an energy-magnification factor of
        15.times.. Photoconductors having very high magnification
        factors include, but are not limited to, gallium arsenide,
        indium phosphide, gallium antimonide, cadmium-tin arsenide, and
        cadmium arsenide, which have calculated energy-magnification
        factors ranging between 200.times. and 500.times., and mercury
        selenide (1100.times.), indium arsenide (2000.times.), mercury
        telluride (3400.times.), and indium antimonide (5100.times.). </p>
      <p>[0126] The depth of optical transmission largely determines the
        optimum thickness of photoconductive films for energy-magnifying
        coils. For example, the highest optical transmission of sintered
        CdS is reported to be 20 micrometers, but since the average
        grain size increases (and the average porosity decreases) with
        an increase in film thickness, the maximum conductivity of a
        sintered film is at a thickness of 35 micrometers (J. S. Lee et
        al., 1987). </p>
      <p>[0127] The metal chosen to be embedded must not react
        chemically with the photoconductor. For example, aluminum reacts
        with gallium arsenide (GaAs) in an electrical environment to
        change the conductive character of both the GaAs and the
        aluminum. Gold, platinum, and palladium can serve in many cases
        because these materials are relatively inert chemically. Gold
        combines chemically with tellurium, however, so gold is not
        suitable for embedding in mercury telluride. Cadmium plating
        over a common metal serves to alleviate the reactivity in cases
        where cadmium sulfide or cadmium selenide is used as the
        photoconductor. </p>
      <p>[0128] The discussion above has been, for ease of explanation,
        in the context of the apparatus including one energy-magnifying
        coil 24. However, as discussed, use of a single
        energy-magnifying coil 24 to capture inductive photons from the
        sending coil 20 results in loss (by non-capture) of most of the
        inductive photons from the sending coil 20. This proportion of
        captured inductive photons can be increased greatly in an
        embodiment in which multiple energy-magnifying coils 24 are
        arrayed around the sending coil 20, such as shown in FIG. 4. In
        the embodiment of FIG. 4, the energy-magnifying coils 24
        substantially completely surround the sending coil 20, and
        (although six energy-magnifying coils 24 are shown) as few as
        three energy-magnifying coils 24 of adequate diameter still
        could substantially completely surround the sending coil 20.
        There is no limit, except as possibly related to packaging
        concerns, to the maximal number of energy-magnifying coils 24
        that could be used. The depicted configuration (FIG. 4) has a
        desirable number of six energy-magnifying coils 24. In FIG. 4
        the shaded sectors 31, considered collectively, illustrate that
        nearly all 360 degrees of inductive-photon radiation 22 from the
        sending coil 20 are received by the energy-magnifying coils 24.
        Not shown in FIG. 4 are photoconduction exciters (items 26 in
        FIG. 3) used for illuminating respective portions of the
        energy-magnifying coils 24 in a photoconductive form of the
        apparatus 15. </p>
      <p>[0129] FIG. 4 also depicts respective internal output coils 28a
        nested coaxially and coextensively inside each of the
        energy-magnifying coils 24. As discussed earlier, each internal
        output coil 28a receives nearly all the inductive-photon
        radiation propagating radially inwardly from the respective
        energy-magnifying coil 24. Desirably, the overall energy output
        of the embodiment of FIG. 4 can be increased by surrounding the
        array of energy-magnifying coils 24 with an external output coil
        28b, of which the conductors desirably are made of insulated
        metallic wire (FIG. 5). In this embodiment approximately half
        the outwardly propagating, magnified inductive-photon radiation
        (large arrows 18) from each energy-magnifying coil 24 (one such
        coil is highlighted in FIG. 5) is received by the external
        output coil 28b. This captured radiation is denoted by the
        shaded sector 35. When this externally directed inductive
        radiation captured from all the energy-magnifying coils 24 is
        added to all the inwardly directed radiation captured from the
        energy-magnifying coils 24 by their respective internal output
        coils 28a (shaded areas 19), the total energy received by the
        output coils 28a, 28b greatly exceeds the back-force energy
        directed by the energy-magnifying coils 24 toward the sending
        coil 20 (the back-force energy from one energy-magnifying coil
        24 is shown as the shaded sector 16). Thus, the resulting energy
        "leverage" exhibited by the apparatus is increased substantially
        by including the external output coil 28b. </p>
      <p>[0130] The embodiment of FIG. 5 also includes respective arrays
        (viewed endwise) of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) collectively
        serving as photoconduction exciters 26 for the energy-magnifying
        coils 24. The LED arrays are arranged back-to-back and disposed
        between adjacent energy-magnifying coils 24. Each array in FIG.
        5 can comprise multiple LEDs or as few as one LED. </p>
      <p>[0131] FIG. 6 provides a perspective view of an apparatus 15
        having an arrangement of coils similar to the arrangement shown
        in FIG. 5. In FIG. 6 each energy-magnifying coil 24 comprises a
        helical coil of superconductive or photoconductive material in
        wire or ribbon (tape-like) form. </p>
      <p>[0132] Whenever multiple energy-magnifying coils 24 are used,
        the respective directions of electron flow in them desirably
        occur in the same circular direction as viewed endwise. Thus,
        the flow of electrons in all the energy-magnifying coils 24 is
        clockwise during one phase of an oscillation cycle and
        counterclockwise during the other phase. The same principle
        applies to the flow of electrons in the output coils 28a, 28b.
        (But, in such an embodiment, the flow of electrons in the output
        coils 28a, 28b is in the opposite direction to the electron flow
        in the energy-magnifying coils 24.) These relationships of
        electron flow in the coils during a particular phase of an
        oscillation cycle are shown in FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>[0133] The energy-magnifying coils 24 desirably are connected
        together in series, using intercoil connectors 30a, 30b to
        maintain the same direction of electron flow, which can be
        clockwise or counter-clockwise (as viewed from one end of such a
        coil). This direction of electron flow in a coil is termed the
        "handedness" of the coil. If the energy-magnifying coils 24 all
        have the same handedness, then the termini of adjacent
        energy-magnifying coils 24 are connected together in a
        head-to-foot manner progressively in one direction around the
        group of coils (not shown). ("Head" refers to the forward-facing
        end, and "foot" refers to the rearward-facing end of the
        apparatus in relation to the viewer.) In this case the intercoil
        connectors 30a, 30b must pass either completely through the
        apparatus or around the outside of the apparatus for its entire
        length, which reduces efficiency and can cause undesirable wear
        if the connectors are subjected to vibrations. A more desirable
        arrangement is depicted in FIG. 6, in which short intercoil
        connectors 30a cross directly head-to-head between one
        energy-magnifying coil 24 and an adjacent energy-magnifying coil
        24, and short intercoil connectors 30b cross over directly
        foot-to-foot in the next energy-magnifying coils 24. In this
        configuration the handedness of turns of the energy-magnifying
        coils 24 alternates from right-to-left to left-to-right in
        adjacent energy-magnifying coils 24. In the same manner as a
        right-handed screw advances from head to foot as it is turned
        clockwise, and a left-handed screw advances in the opposite
        direction as it is turned clockwise, clockwise electron flow in
        a right-handed coil advances from head to foot, and clockwise
        electron flow in a left-handed coil advances from foot to head
        in a left-handed coil. </p>
      <p>[0134] The single-layered internal output coils 28a in FIG. 6
        present the same situation in which these coils are connected in
        series. Desirably, the intercoil connectors 32a cross over
        directly from one internal output coil 28a to the adjacent
        internal output coil 28a head-to-head, and the intercoil
        connectors 32b cross over directly foot-to-foot from one
        internal output coil 28a to the adjacent internal output coil
        28a. This same handedness convention generally applies to all
        series-connected internal output coils 28a connected in this
        manner. The head-to-head intercoil connectors 32a and
        foot-to-foot intercoil connectors 32b for the internal output
        coils 28a need not coincide with the same respective connectors
        30a, 30b for the energy-magnifying coils 24. </p>
      <p>[0135] In another embodiment (not shown), each internal output
        coil is two-layered, with both leads at either the head or foot.
        Such a configuration allows for short and direct connections
        between adjacent internal output coils. Multiple-layered
        internal output coils may be more efficient, but the extra
        layers of coiled wire increase the mass of the apparatus, which
        may be a concern in mobile applications. Multiple wire layers
        carrying high current also may result in overheating, which may
        require that some space be left between each internal output
        coil 28a and its surrounding energy-magnifying coil 24 to
        accommodate one or more conduits of a coolant through the
        apparatus (at a sacrifice of some efficiency). The coolant can
        be, for example, forced air (in the case of photoconductors or
        doped semiconductors) or liquefied cryogenic gas (in the case of
        superconductors). </p>
      <p>[0136] FIG. 6 also shows two external conductors 34 connected
        to respective internal output coils 28a. Electrons flow through
        the conductors 34 and the internal output coils 28a in series.
        In addition, two external conductors 36 are connected to
        respective ends of the external output coil 28b, and two
        external conductors 38 are connected to respective ends of the
        sending coil 20. </p>
      <p>[0137] FIG. 7 is a schematic end view of the apparatus of FIG.
        6, showing the relative direction of electron flow in the
        various coils and in the intercoil connections described for
        single-layer coils. At a particular oscillation phase, the
        clockwise electron flow denoted by the arrow 39a in the sending
        coil 20 induces clockwise electron flow 39b in all the
        energy-magnifying coils 24. The magnified radiation from the
        clockwise electron flow in the energy-magnifying coils 24
        induces counter-clockwise electron flow in all the internal
        output coils 28a, as indicated by the arrows 39c. The
        counter-clockwise electron flow, denoted by the arrow 39d, in
        the external output coil 28b is opposite in direction to the
        electron flow in the energy-magnifying coils 24. </p>
      <p>[0138] The electron flow in the intercoil connectors 30a
        extending between adjacent energy-magnifying coils 24 is
        indicated by the arrows 39e, and the electron flow in the
        intercoil connectors 32a extending between adjacent internal
        output coils 28a is indicated by the arrows 39f. During the next
        oscillation phase, all the directional arrows shown in FIG. 7
        reverse themselves. </p>
      <p>[0139] Connecting the internal output coils 28a together in
        series is advantageous if it is desired to maximize the output
        voltage from the apparatus 15. Alternatively, the internal
        output coils 28a can be connected together in parallel if it is
        desired to maximize the output electrical current from the
        apparatus 15 while minimizing output voltage. In this
        alternative configuration, all the internal output coils 28a
        desirably are wound with the same handedness, with each coil 28a
        having two respective leads. The leads at one end (e.g., the
        foot end) of the coils 28a are connected to each other, and the
        leads at the other end (the head end) of the coils 28a are
        connected to each other. The resulting parallel-coil system is
        connected in a conventional manner in other circuitry of the
        apparatus (not shown). </p>
      <p>[0140] Further alternatively, the internal output coils 28a can
        be connected together so as to provide more than one output
        circuit (so long as sufficient energy is produced for use as
        feedback to the sending coil 20 and for use in establishing
        conditions favorable for producing abundant low-mass electrons).
        The relative voltage(s) and current(s) of output power
        alternatively can be varied by changing the ratio of the number
        of turns in the energy-magnifying coils 24 to the number of
        turns in the internal output coils 28a. Further alternatively,
        the energy-magnifying coils 24 can be employed in a separate
        manner to provide more than one energy-magnifying unit. Each
        unit can comprise one or more energy-magnifying coils that can
        serve its respective circuit of internal output coils. </p>
      <p>[0141] The two conductors 36 connected to the external output
        coil 28b can be connected to the internal output coils 28a or
        can be used (without being connected to the external output
        coils 28a) only with the external output coil 28b to provide an
        independent output circuit (not shown). The two conductors 38
        connected to the sending coil 20 are connected in the feed-back
        loop 46 such that electron flow in the sending coil 20 is in the
        same circular direction as in the internal output coils 28a. </p>
      <p>[0142] FIG. 8 depicts yet another embodiment of the apparatus
        15, in which each energy-magnifying coil 24 comprises a
        respective thin film or thick film of a polycrystalline or other
        suitable photoconductor deposited in a helical manner directly
        onto a respective tubular substrate 40 desirably made of ceramic
        or other suitable dielectric material. On each energy-magnifying
        coil 24 the polycrystalline photoconductor is formed as a
        helical band on the outside of the respective tubular substrate
        40. The helical band of photoconductor can include a respective
        thin film of metal embedded within. In certain cases, intercoil
        connections between adjacent energy-magnifying coils 24 can be
        made by extending the deposited photoconductor from the helices
        to respective contact areas 44 situated at ends of the tubular
        substrates 40 and extending toward contact areas 44 on adjacent
        tubular substrates 40. Electrical contact between adjacent
        energy-magnifying coils 24 is made under moderate pressure via
        the contact areas 44, which are shown in FIG. 8. To distinguish
        the individual contact areas 44, they are shown in a separated
        position before being pressed together to make contact. To
        maintain the integrity of the contact areas 44, the
        energy-magnifying coils 24 can be held together in mutual
        proximity by any of various non-metallic fasteners to make
        continuous electrical contact between all the photoconductive
        portions. For example, bolts 43 and nuts 45 made of a plastic
        such as nylon or other dielectric material can be used. Another
        variation is to maintain contact pressure of one coil to the
        next by means of spring clips. Thus, in one embodiment, the
        energy-magnifying coils 24 are connected so as to be in endless
        contact with each other, with no capacitative break between
        them. The remainder of the apparatus can be constructed in the
        same manner as the photoconductor or doped-semiconductor
        embodiment described above, wherein the same attention to the
        direction of electron flow in respective coils is observed. </p>
      <p>[0143] The coil configuration of yet another embodiment is
        shown in schematic end-section views in FIGS. 9(A)-9(B). A
        tubular substrate 40 supports a helical, thin-film or thick
        film, dipole-type of energy-magnifying coil 24 that is nested
        inside of, and coaxial with, a single external output coil 28b.
        Nested inside the tubular substrate 40, and with respective axes
        parallel to the axis of the tubular substrate 40, are a sending
        coil 20 and an internal output coil 28a. The sending coil 20 and
        the internal output coil 28a are disposed on opposite sides of a
        reflective metallic separator 59. The separator 59 is
        substantially parabolic in cross-section throughout its axial
        extent, and is disposed so that the longitudinal edges of the
        separator 59 are touching, or nearly touching, the tubular
        substrate 40. The separator 59 can be comprised of a common,
        non-magnetic metal such as aluminum or magnesium. The sending
        coil 20 is positioned on the concave side of the separator 59,
        with the axis of the sending coil 20 being positioned at the
        geometric focus 60 of the parabola and disposed parallel to the
        axis of the energy-magnifying coil 24. The energy-magnifying
        coil 24 in this embodiment comprises a thin-film or thick-film
        photoconductor formed helically on the tubular substrate 40. A
        photoconduction exciter 26 is disposed inside the separator 59.
        (The tubular substrate 40 is made of a rigid material that is
        transparent to radiation produced by the photoconduction exciter
        26.) All the other forms of the energy-magnifying coil 24 as
        described herein, including the superconducting form, can be
        employed in this embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0144] The separator 59 serves a double purpose. One purpose is
        to redirect toward the energy-magnifying coil 24 that portion of
        the inductive-photon radiation 22 that is not otherwise directed
        toward the separator, as shown by the reflected-photon rays 61
        in FIG. 9(A). (Reflection of these radiated photons does not
        change the directionality of the transverse force that these
        photons convey.) Another purpose of the separator 59 is to serve
        as a shield to restrict the amount of inward radiation 18b from
        the energy-magnifying coil 24 that is returned as a back-force
        to the sending coil 20. The restricted back-force radiation is
        shown by the shaded area 63 in FIG. 9(B). </p>
      <p>[0145] The portion of the inwardly directed, magnified
        inductive-photon radiation 18b that is received by the internal
        output coil 28a is denoted by the shaded area 65. The
        proportional amount of outwardly directed magnified radiation
        18a from the energy-magnifying coil 24 that is received by the
        external output coil 28b is shown by the shaded area 67. The sum
        of the magnified radiation in the area 65 that reaches the
        internal output coil 28a and the magnified radiation in the area
        67 that reaches the external output coil 28b substantially
        exceeds the magnified radiation in the area 63 (the latter
        serving as a back-force on the sending coil 20). This excess of
        utilized energy over the back-force energy provides energy
        leverage. This embodiment also includes a starting mechanism, an
        initial power source for the photoconduction exciter, a work
        loop, and a feed-back loop (not shown) as provided in the other
        embodiments described herein. </p>
      <p>[0146] Certain features can be incorporated with any of the
        embodiments described herein to add functional practicality. For
        example, referring to the schematic representation of a coil
        configuration shown in end view in FIG. 10(A), a ferromagnetic
        core 69 can be disposed inside the sending coil 20, and
        ferromagnetic cores 71 can be disposed inside respective
        internal output coils 28a. These cores increase the inductance
        of the apparatus, which lowers the frequency of the electrical
        oscillations produced by the apparatus. Although increases in
        inductance can cause the output voltage and current to be out of
        phase, the phase difference can be corrected by adding
        capacitance to the circuitry by conventional means. Also shown
        is an external metal shield that completely surrounds the
        apparatus to block any radiation from the device that could
        interfere with radios, televisions, telephones, computers, and
        other electronic devices. The shield can be comprised of any of
        various non-magnetic metals such as aluminum or magnesium. </p>
      <p>[0147] An alternative means of increasing the inductance of the
        apparatus is shown in FIG. 10(B), which is a variation of the
        end view just of the sending coil 20 that is depicted in FIG.
        10(A). In FIG. 10(B), a ferromagnetic sleeve 73 is disposed
        coaxially around the sending coil 20. </p>
      <p>[0148] The respective dimensional ratios of various components
        generally remain similar with respect to each other for
        different apparatus sizes, except for the longitudinal
        dimension, which generally can be as short or long as desired up
        to some practical limit. The respective gauges of wires used in
        the sending coil 20 and the output coils 28a, 28b are
        commensurate with the electric current carried by these wires,
        and the respective thicknesses of insulation (if used) on the
        wires are commensurate with the voltage. </p>
      <p>[0149] The outside diameter of the internal output coils 28a
        desirably is only slightly less than the inside diameter of the
        respective energy-magnifying coils 24, as shown in FIGS. 6, 7,
        and 8, thereby ensuring close proximity of each internal output
        coil 28a with its respective energy-magnifying coil 24. At a
        sacrifice in efficiency, the outside diameter of the internal
        output coils 28a can be made smaller to allow space for heat
        from the current-carrying wires to escape or be removed by a
        coolant such as forced air, in the case of a photoconductor-type
        or doped-semiconductor-type apparatus, or by a cryogenic
        liquefied gas in the case of a superconductor-type apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0150] Also desirably, the external output coil 28b is
        connected in series with the internal output coils 28a to
        maximize the output voltage from the apparatus 15 and to
        minimize heat produced by the electric currents in the
        apparatus. The output voltage can be stepped down and the output
        electrical current can be stepped up to normal respective
        operating ranges using a transformer, wherein the primary of the
        transformer would comprise the load in the work loop 48. </p>
      <p>[0151] As discussed above, each energy-magnifying coil 24 can
        comprise a photoconductor or doped semiconductor formed as a
        helical pattern on a respective thin-walled, tubular substrate
        provided with extended, raised contact surfaces at each end. The
        energy-magnifying coils 24 desirably are connected electrically
        (rather than capacitatively) to each other in series at the
        raised contact surfaces. The photoconductive coils desirably are
        coated using clear varnish or enamel to provide electrical
        insulation and to protect the photoconductors from oxidation and
        weathering. </p>
      <p>[0152] Where the low-mass photoconducting electrons in the
        energy-multiplying coils 24 are present in a concentration that
        is insufficient for capturing most of the inductive-photon
        radiation from the sending coil 20, each energy-magnifying coil
        desirably includes a very thin metallic band. The metal
        desirably is in intimate contact with the low-mass-electron
        carrier. The metal can be on the exterior of a doped
        semiconductor, or it can be embedded in a photoconductor band of
        the coil to capture the inductive radiation and set up an
        electric field that, in turn, assists in accelerating the
        low-mass electrons. In the photoconductive embodiment the
        photoconductive material desirably is disposed all around the
        metallic band so that the low-mass electrons are conducted on
        the outer side as well as the inner side and edges of the
        photoconductive band on the portion or portions that are exposed
        to illumination on the outside. The width of the metal band
        desirably is sufficient to capture as much of the
        inductive-photon radiation from the sending coil as practical,
        since gaps between turns of the metal band in the
        energy-magnifying coil permit the sending coil's inductive
        radiation to pass through to the internal output coil. Since the
        sending-coil's radiation is a half-cycle out of phase with the
        inductive radiation from the low-mass electrons, all the
        sending-coil radiation that reaches the output coil reduces the
        output efficiency of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0153] Appropriate photoconductive materials (e.g., cadmium
        sulfide, cadmium selenide) for forming the energy-magnifying
        coils 24 are commercially available. The photoconductive
        material can be a single material or a mixture of materials, and
        can be formed by, for example, sputtering. A mixture of cadmium
        sulfide and cadmium selenide can be adjusted optimally to yield
        energy-magnifying coils exhibiting maximal energy-magnifying
        factors at a peak wavelength matching the brightest
        photoconduction exciters 26 that are available. </p>
      <p>[0154] With respect to the photoconduction exciters 26,
        photo-excitation of the energy-magnifying coils 24 can be
        provided by one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs; either
        surface-emitting or edge-emitting), for example, selected to
        produce an output wavelength matched to the peak photoconduction
        wavelength of the energy-magnifying coils 24. In the embodiments
        of FIGS. 7 and 10(A), individual LEDs 26 are disposed in linear
        arrays mounted back-to-back on respective mounting bars. The
        assembled mounting bars with LEDs are disposed in the gaps
        between adjacent energy-magnifying coils 24 to illuminate at
        least the sides of the respective energy-magnifying coils 24
        that receive inductive-photon radiation from the sending coil
        20. LEDs are advantageous compared to incandescent lamps because
        LEDs produce more light with less heat than incandescent lamps,
        and have much longer operational lifetimes than incandescent
        lamps. LEDs also are preferred because of their small size,
        which facilitates fitting a large number of them into the
        relatively small space between adjacent energy-magnifying coils
        24. </p>
