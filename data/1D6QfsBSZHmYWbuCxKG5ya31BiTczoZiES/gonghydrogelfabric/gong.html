      Scientists have created a new hydrogel material reinforced with

      carbon steel – but still easy to bend and stretch.<br>
      <br>
      That combination of properties means the new fabric could be used

      <br>
      A team of Hokkaido University scientists has succeeded in creating
      “fiber-reinforced soft composites,” or tough hydrogels combined
      with woven fiber fabric. These fabrics are highly flexible,
      tougher than metals, and have a wide range of potential
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      Efforts are currently underway around the world to create
      materials that are friendly to both society and the environment.
      Among them are those that comprise different materials, which
      exhibit the merits of each component.<br>
      <br>
      Hokkaido University researchers, led by Professor Jian Ping Gong,
      have focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels.
      Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial,
      up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term
      use has been produced. This study was conducted as a part of the
      Cabinet Office’s Impulsing Paradigm Change through Disruptive
      Technologies Program (ImPACT).<br>
      <br>
      To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing
      high levels of water with glass fiber fabric to create bendable,
      yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce
      reinforced plastics. The team found that a combination of
      polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed
      earlier, and glass fiber fabric with a single fiber measuring
      around 10µm in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. The
      procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in
      PA precursor solutions for polymerization.<br>
      <br>
      When used alone, the fiber-reinforced hydrogels developed by the
      team are 25 times tougher than glass fiber fabric, and 100 times
      tougher than hydrogels – in terms of the energy required to
      destroy them. Combining these materials enables a synergistic
      toughening. The team theorizes that toughness is increased by
      dynamic ionic bonds between the fiber and hydrogels, and within
      the hydrogels, as the fiber’s toughness increases in relation to
      that of the hydrogels. Consequently, the newly developed hydrogels
      are 5 times tougher compared to carbon steel.<br>
      <br>
      “The fiber-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 percent water level,
      are environmentally friendly,” says Dr. Jian Ping Gong, “The
      material has multiple potential applications because of its
      reliability, durability and flexibility. For example, in addition
      to fashion and manufacturing uses, it could be used as artificial
      ligaments and tendons, which are subject to strong load-bearing
      tensions.” The principles to create the toughness of the present
      study can also be applied to other soft components, such as
      rubber.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Tough hydrogels have shown strong potential as structural
      biomaterials. These hydrogels alone, however, possess limited
      mechanical properties (such as low modulus) when compared to some
      load-bearing tissues, e.g., ligaments and tendons. Developing both
      strong and tough soft materials is still a challenge. To overcome
      this obstacle, a new material design strategy has been recently
      introduced by combining tough hydrogels with woven fiber fabric to
      create fiber reinforced soft composites (FRSCs). The new FRSCs
      exhibit extremely high toughness and tensile properties, far
      superior to those of the neat components, indicating a synergistic
      effect. Here, focus is on understanding the role of energy
      dissipation of the soft matrix in the synergistic toughening of
      FRSCs. By selecting a range of soft matrix materials, from tough
      hydrogels to weak hydrogels and even a commercially available
      elastomer, the toughness of the matrix is determined to play a
      critical role in achieving extremely tough FRSCs. This work
      provides a good guide toward the universal design of soft
      composites with extraordinary fracture resistance capacity.<br>

      Ligaments are unique wet biological tissues with high tensile
      modulus and fracture stress, combined with high bending
      flexibility. Developing synthetic materials with these properties
      is a significant challenge. Hydrogel composites made from high
      stiffness fabrics is a strategy to develop such unique materials;
      however, the ability to produce these materials has proven
      difficult, since common hydrogels swell in water and interact
      poorly with solid components, limiting the transfer of force from
      the fabric to the hydrogel matrix. In this work, for the first
      time, we successfully produce extraordinarily tough hydrogel
      composites by strategically selecting a recently developed tough
      hydrogel that de-swells in water. The new composites, consisting
      of polyampholyte hydrogels and glass fiber woven fabrics, exhibit
      extremely high effective toughness (250[thin space (1/6-em)]000 J
      m−2), high tear strength (∼65 N mm−1), high tensile modulus (606
      MPa), and low bending modulus (4.7 MPa). Even though these
      composites are composed of water-containing, biocompatible
      materials, their mechanical properties are comparable to high
      toughness Kevlar/polyurethane blends and fiber-reinforced
      polymers. Importantly, the mechanical properties of these
      composites greatly outperform the properties of either individual
      component. A mechanism is proposed based on established fabric
      tearing theory, which will enable the development of a new
      generation of mechanically robust composites based on fabrics.
      These results will be important towards developing soft biological
      prosthetics, and more generally for commercial applications such
      as tear-resistant gloves and bulletproof vests.<br>

      A composite comprising a fabric and a polyampholyte hydrogel is
      provided. In the composite, the polyampholyte hydrogel is a
      hydrogel of a polymer bearing randomly dispersed cationic and
      anionic repeat groups and at least a part of the fabric is coated
      with the polyampholyte hydrogel. A method of preparation of the
      composite comprises steps (a) to (c): (a) providing a monomer
      mixture for preparation of a polyampholyte hydrogel; (b) immersing
      a fabric in the monomer mixture solution; and (c) polymerizing
      monomers in the monomer mixture solution to obtain a precursor of
      the composite.<br>

      </b><b>Field of The Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a composite comprising a fabric and a
      polyampholyte hydrogel and a method of preparation of the
      composite.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion of The Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries are one
      of the most common surgeries performed by orthopedic surgeons. To
      avoid using autographs or allographs, synthetic materials have
      been investigated as potential replacements.<br>
      <br>
      Some materials which have been tested are Dacron, Marlex, Teflon,
      Nylon, and Carbon Fiber. [NP-2] It is important that the materials
      which are used can support the high load placed upon these
      ligaments. Carbon Fiber has been especially of interest as a
      replacement material because of its extremely high stiffness.
      Initial results with neat carbon fiber replacements were
      promising. [NP-3, 4] However problems were encountered, including
      fracture, fraying and spreading of carbon in the body, irritation
      and poor healing of the surrounding area, and accumulation of
      carbon in regional lymph nodes. [NP- 1,2, 5]<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Some researchers have also attempted to use hydrogels as ligament
      replacements, but they lack the mechanical properties to support
      high loads. There is some mention in the patent literature of
      hydrogel and fabrics as prosthetics. [P-l, 2, 3, 4]<br>
      <br>
      P-l : US Patent No. 6,629,997.<br>
      P-2: US Patent No. 6,187,043.<br>
      P-3: US Patent No. 6,027,744.<br>
      P-4: US Patent No. 4,919,667.<br>
      <br>
      However the brittleness of traditional hydrogels may have
      prevented these methods from entering the market.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the application in ACL reconstruction surgeries,
      the applications listed below are those in which high toughness is
      desired, such as skin grafts, flexible tear resistant clothing,
      bandaging, bullet-proofing, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In bandages, there is very little in the literature about fabric /
      hydrogel bandages, however there is some mention in the patent
      literature. In these systems fabric are used as support, and the
      hydrogel is used for wound closure, as they are generally
      non-toxic, consist mostly of water, and can promote wound healing.

      <br>
      However, within these patents there is no obvious mention of
      utilizing these composite materials to make extremely tough or
      tear resistant bandages.<br>
      <br>
      Fabric composites have been looked at and utilized before as high
      strength and toughness materials. Some of these are for ballistics
      and blast resistance.<br>

      material - 6,586,551 ;<br>
      P-18: Silicone coated textile fabrics - 6,354,620; etc.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, some patents mention fabrics which exhibit high tear
      strength.<br>
      <br>
      P-19: Textile-reinforced composites with high tear strength -
      7,549,303;<br>
      P-20: Method of making a cut and abrasion resistant laminate -
      6,280,546;<br>
      P-21 : Elastic composite structure - 7,153,789;<br>
      P-22: Composite elastic material - 6,706,364;<br>
      P-23: Cut resistant yarn, fabric and gloves - 5,119,512;<br>
      P-24: Fiber reinforced thermosetting resin compositions with
      coated fibers for improved toughness - 4,737,527;<br>
      P-25: Method of manufacture of silicone elastomer coated cloth -
      4,478,895.<br>
      <br>
      However in these examples, none of the composite materials utilize
      hydrogels, or any type of elastic materials which contain water.
      In many cases, the matrix material is thermosetting, which would
      result in the composite lacking any flexibility.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, new polyampholyte (PA) hydrogels produced by Sun et. al.
      have shown the ability to maintain these features through a
      macromolecular architecture that also features self-healing, and
      one-pot synthesis abilities. [NP-6,7]<br>

      Previous work from the Crosby Research Group has shown that
      embedding soft elastomers with stiff fabrics can result in very
      interesting composite materials. [NP-8 to NP-10] Double network
      hydrogels devolved in the Gong Research Group have extremely high
      toughness, while having moderate ultimate tensile strength and low

      Utilizing a fabric and PA hydrogel composite could allow for high
      loads (from the fiber) while the PA hydrogel could prevent wear
      and rejection from the body. Incorporating these new hydrogels
      into fabric will allow for new materials with unique properties
      that are currently lacking in the literatures and patents. <br>

      </b><b>Descriptions of The Embodiments </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following preferred specific embodiments are, therefore, to be
      construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the
      remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. In this regard,
      no attempt is made to show structural details of the present
      invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental
      understanding of the present invention, the description taken with
      the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the
      several forms of the present invention may be embodied in
      practice.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a composite comprising a fabric and a PA
      hydrogel which is relatively soft and viscoelastic. The fabric can
      be a woven fabric or unwoven fabric and the unwoven fabric can be
      a knitted fabric. A woven fabric is obtained by producing the
      interlacing of warp fibers and weft fibers in weave styles, such
      as plain, twill, or satin styles and so on. A woven fabric is
      preferred because the integrity of the woven fabric is maintained
      by the mechanical interlocking of the fibers, and their drape,
      surface smoothness and stability can be controlled by the weave
      styles based on the design requirements.<br>
      <br>
      The fabric can be made from inorganic material fibers, organic
      material fibers, biomaterial fibers or a mixture thereof.
      Inorganic material fibers are composed of inorganic chemical
      compounds, based on natural elements, which are resistant to high
      temperatures and high mechanical strength. Examples of the
      inorganic material fibers include glass fibers, carbon fibers,
      ceramics fibers and metals fibers. These inorganic materials
      fibers are commonly applied infields that require high performance
      materials, such as building materials, protective clothing, parts
      of airplanes, spaceships, and so on. Organic material fibers are
      made from synthesized polymers or small molecules, which are
      polymerized into long linear chains. Examples of the organic
      material fibers include synthetic polymer fibers such as nylon
      fibers, aramid fibers, polyalkylene fibers such as polyethylene
      fibers, polypropylene fibers. These organic material fibers with
      high mechanical performance and thermal stability are reinforced
      in the polymer matrix, which are applied in fields such as the
      automotive industry, railways, aerospace, and so on. Biomaterial
      fibers are made from plants and animals, which are low cost, low
      density, high toughness, renewable and biodegradable. Examples of
      biomaterial fibers include cellulose fibers and cotton fibers.
      These biomaterials fibers are widely reinforced with a polymer
      matrix in the textile, and automotive industries. The fabric is
      preferably comprised of long fibers. Woven and non-woven fabrics
      that are commercially available can be used. The fabric can be in
      a form of a sheet, a tape, a strip, a tube, a rod, and so on. The
      preferred composite is produced by the fabric with hydrophilic
      surface, such as glass fiber, and PA hydrogel.<br>
      <br>
      In the composite of this invention, at least a part of the surface
      of the fabric is coated with the PA hydrogel. The PA hydrogel can
      be coated on either surface of the fabric or both surface of the
      fabric partially or fully. The PA hydrogel is a hydrogel of a
      polymer bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat
      groups.<br>
      <br>
      The PA hydrogel is selected from the group consisting of random
      polymers obtained by random polymerization of a cationic monomer
      and an anionic monomer. The cationic monomer is selected from the
      group consisting of monomers having an amino group, preferably a
      quarternized amine group. Examples of the cationic monomer include
      the monomer selected from the group consisting of
      3-(methacryloylamino)propyltrimethylammonium chloride (MPTC),
      acryloyloxethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMAEA-Q),
      methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (MTAC) and
      4-vinylpyridine chloride (4-VPC).<br>
      <br>
      The anionic monomer is selected from the group consisting of a
      sulfonate group, a sulfonic acid group, a carboxylate group, a
      carboxyl acid group, a phosphate group, and a phosphoric acid
      group. Examples of the anionic monomer include the monomer
      selected from the group consisting of sodium p-styrenesulfonate
      (NaSS), anionic 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS),
      sodium 4-styrenecarboxylic acid (NaSA), acrylic acid(AA), sodium
      acrylate, methacrylic acid(MAA), and ethylene glycol
      1-methacrylate 2-phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      One example of the PA hydrogels is P(NaSS-co-MPTC) hydrogels,
      randomly copolymerized from concentrated aqueous solutions of
      oppositely charged monomers, sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and
      3-(methacryloylamino)propyltrimethylammonium chloride (MPTC). One
      example of the P(NaSS-co-MPTC) hydrogels exhibits high strength
      (tensile fracture stress ob . 1.8 MPa), high extensibility
      (tensile fracture strain eb = 7.4), and high toughness (tearing
      energies T = 4000 J m&lt;"2&gt;). The PA hydrogels are
      self-recoverable due to the non-covalent ionic bonds. In addition
      to these excellent mechanical properties, these PA hydrogels have
      excellent biocompatibility and anti-biofouling properties. [NP-6].<br>
      <br>
      Another example of a PA hydrogels is the PA P(NaSS-co-DMAEA-Q)
      hydrogels synthesized from sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and
      acryloyloxethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMAEA-Q). DMAEA-Q is
      relatively hydrophilic in comparison with the cationic monomer
      MPTC.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical structures of monomers are shown below:<br>
      <br>
      Cationic monomers: MPTC, DMAEA-Q;<br>
      <br>
      Anionic monomers: NaSS, AMPS.<br>
      <br>
      <b><img src="wo1.JPG" alt="1" width="533" height="283"></b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Other examples of PA hydrogels are the P(NaSS-co-MTAC4) and
      P(NaSS-co-VPC) systems synthesized by using methacrylatoethyl
      trimethyl ammonium chloride (MTAC) or 4-vinylpyridine chloride
      (4-VPC) as a cationic monomer. Chemical structures of the cationic
      monomers for the PA hydrogels are shown below:<br>

      </b><br>
      The above PAs are those developed from linear PAs by employing the
      ionic bond as a reversible sacrificial bond that breaks and
      reforms dynamically. [NP-6, 7] Owing to the random distribution,
      the opposite charges on the PAs form multiple ionic bonds of wide
      distribution in strength. The strong bonds work as permanent
      cross-linkers, imparting the elasticity of the hydrogel. The weak
      bonds are fragile and they break under stress, serving as
      reversible sacrificial bonds. Upon rupture of the weak bonds, the
      globule polymer chains unfolded, serving as hidden length. These
      two processes dissipate energy and impart toughness to the
      hydrogel. The PA hydrogels used in the present invention are
      supramolecular hydrogels and contain about 50 wt% water, yet are
      very tough and viscoelastic. An illustration of PA networks with
      ionic bonds of different strength is shown below. The strong bonds
      serve as permanent crosslinking points, and the weak bonds act as
      reversible sacrificial bonds that rupture under deformation.<br>
      <br>
      Neutral PAs form globule structures in aqueous medium by formation
      of ionic bonds, which leads to phase separation. It is better to
      determine the optimized charge ratio of the precursor solution to
      form the neutral PA. The effects of the monomer concentration Cm
      and the chemical cross-linker density C (CMBAA in case MBAA is
      used as the chemical cross-linker) on the behavior of the PA is
      considered when the PA hydrogel is prepared. These two parameters
      are crucial to control the phase separation of the system. It is
      preferred that a phase diagram of formulation in the Cm-CMBAA
      space can be constructed in advance and homogenous hydrogel phase
      is determined. The mechanical properties of PA hydrogels are
      dependent on the combinations of the ionic monomer pairs. There is
      a tendency of that more hydrophilic monomers produced softer and
      stretchable gels and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      The polymers are obtained by random copolymerization of a cationic
      monomer and an anionic monomer and a neutral monomer. The addition
      of the neutral monomer can adjust the stiffness and toughness of
      the samples. Examples of the neutral monomer include acrylamide
      based monomers such as acrylamide (AAm), N-isopropylacrylamide
      (NIPAM), dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm); vinyl based monomers such as
      vinyl acetate, vinyl pyridine, styrene; alkylacrylate based
      monomers such as methylmethacrylate; hydroxyalkyl acrylate based
      monomers such as hydroxyethylacrylate; and fluorine containing
      unsaturated monomers such as trifluoroethyl acrylate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthesis of PA hydrogels and preparation of the Composite</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      PA hydrogels are synthesized using a one-step random
      copolymerization of an anionic monomer and a cationic monomer.
      Using a one-step random copolymerization, the composite of the
      present invention can be manufactured in one step.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further relates to a method of preparation
      of a composite comprising a fabric and a polyampholyte hydrogel.
      The method comprises the following steps (a) to (c).<br>
      <br>
      (a) providing a monomer mixture for preparation of a polyampholyte
      hydrogel;<br>
      <br>
      (b) immersing a fabric in the monomer mixture solution; and<br>
      <br>
      (c) polymerizing monomers in the monomer mixture solution to
      obtain a precursor of the composite.<br>
      <br>
      (a) Provision of a monomer mixture<br>
      <br>
      The monomer mixture can be a mixed aqueous solution of an anionic
      monomer and a cationic monomer and the aqueous solution is
      prepared by mixing the monomers with water. The monomer
      concentration, Cm, influences the behavior of the resulting PA and
      the preparation of the PA hydrogels. The monomer concentration,
      Cm, means the total concentration of the anionic monomer and a
      cationic monomer. The monomer concentration, Cm, is desirably in a
      range from 1 to 5 mol/L, preferably range from 1.5 to 2.5 mol/L in
      order to prepare PA hydrogels enabling to provide a tough and
      stiff, yet&lt;'&gt;flexible composite.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, molar fraction of the anionic monomer F influences
      the behavior of the resulting PA and the preparation of the PA
      hydrogels. The molar fraction of the anionic monomer F means a
      molar fraction of the anionic monomer to the total of the anionic
      monomer and a cationic monomer. The molar fraction of the anionic
      monomer F is desirably in a range from 0.4 to 0.6, preferably in a
      range from 0.5 to 0.54 in order to prepare PA hydrogels that
      provide tough and stiff, yet flexible composites.<br>
      <br>
      The mixed aqueous solution can further contain a polymerization
      initiator and/or a cross-linking agent and/or a salt. The
      polymerization initiator can be ultraviolet initiator such as
      2-oxoglutaric acid, sodium<br>
      <br>
      4-[2-(4-morpholino)benzoyl-2-dimethylamino]butylbenzenesulfonate,
      and phenacylpyridinium oxalate. The concentration of the
      polymerization initiator can be set in view of the kind of the
      monomers and the preferable initiator concentration is, but not
      limited to, in a range from 0.01 mol% to lmol% against to total
      monomer concentration.<br>
      <br>
      The cross-linking agent is preferably a chemical cross-linker
      having two or more of (meth)acrylate groups in a molecule such as
      N, N'-methylenebis (acrylamide) (MBAA) and
      ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate. N, N'-methylenebis (acrylamide)
      (MBAA) is preferred when an (meth)acrylate based monomer is used.
      Ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate is preferred when a vinyl monomer
      such as NaSS and 4-VPC is used. The cross-linking agent can be
      used in combination or alone. The concentration of the
      cross-linking agent can vary in view of the monomers and the
      preferable concentration is, but not limited to, in a range of
      0.1mol% to 10mol% against to total monomer concentration.<br>
      <br>
      The salt can be an inorganic salt. Examples of the inorganic salt
      include an alkali metal salt such as LiCl, NaCl, KC1, CsCl, CaCl2,
      MgS04, K2S04, or MgCl2. The concentration of the salt can vary in
      view of the kind of the monomers and the monomer concentration Cm
      and is not limited specifically but is in a range of 0.1M to 2M,
      for example. The usage of salt can reduce the viscosity of the
      mixed aqueous solution and obtain the homogeneous samples.
      However, the higher the salt concentration, the higher the burden
      of removal of the salt after polymerization.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Immersion of a fabric into the monomer mixture solution; A
      cell for preparation of the composite is comprised of, but not
      limited to, a pair of plates such as glass plates facing each
      other and the thickness between the plates is controlled by a
      spacer thickness. This spacing is, but not limited to, desirably
      in a range from 0.001 mm to 10 mm, preferably in a range from 0.01
      mm to 5.0 mm, and more preferably in a range from 0.1 mm to 1.0
      mm. The plates and the spacer are selected from the material inert
      with the mixed aqueous solution and the spacer can be a silicone
      spacer, for example, with a prescribed thickness. The thickness of
      the spacer decides the thickness of the composite. A fabric is
      placed in the space made by the plates. This fabric can be woven
      or knit or unwoven and may range in thickness from 0.001 mm to 1
      mm in thickness, and may consist of a plain, twill, or satin
      weave. The mixed aqueous solution is added into the channel in
      which the fabric has been placed. The fabric can be placed
      nominally in the center of the space, or preferentially towards an
      edge or surface such as 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, etc. distribution of
      the PA on each side of the fabric. Alternatively, the composite
      may be prepared by coating the fabric with the mixed aqueous
      solution on either or both sides of the fabric surface. The
      coating may be applied by spraying, dipping, knife-over-roll, or
      other traditional fabric coating methods.<br>
      <br>
      (c) Polymerization of the monomers to obtain a precursor of the
      composite The mixed aqueous solution is cured, for example, by
      irradiation of ultraviolet light when an ultraviolet initiator is
      used. Wavelength of the ultraviolet light can be determined in
      view of the ultraviolet initiator. The irradiation can be
      conducted in an inert atmosphere, such as argon atmosphere, at an
      ambient temperature or an increased temperature for 1 minute to 24
      hours, preferably from 1 hour to 12 hours, and more preferably
      from 8 hours to 12 hours, which is adjusted by the power of
      ultraviolet light. This reaction can take place at an ambient
      temperature or an increased temperature in an inert atmosphere
      such as an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. The composite consisted
      of fabric and PA can be prepared with the thickness from 0.001mm
      to 10mm controlled by the size of spacer.<br>
      <br>
      In this method, the cationic and anionic monomers are essentially
      copolymerized randomly in the PA hydrogels. The random structure
      of the copolymer can be confirmed using a Ή-NMR reaction kinetics
      study, for example.<br>
      <br>
      After polymerization, the as-prepared gel is immersed in water to
      reach equilibrium and to wash away the residual chemicals after
      one week, for example. The amount of the water is not limited
      specifically and it is preferred to confirm the equilibrium state
      and disappearance of the residual chemicals in the gel. During
      this process, the mobile counter-ions of the ionic copolymer as
      well as the salt used, are removed from the gel, and the
      oppositely charged ions on the copolymer form stable ionic
      complexes either through intra- or interchain interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Polymerization conditions and structural features and mechanical
      properties of various PA hydrogels are shown in the table below.<br>

      * Cm and / represent the total ionic monomers concentration
      (mol/L) and the charge fraction of the anionic monomer,
      respectively, in the precursor solution used to synthesize the
      gels. The parameters cw, E, ab, eb, Wb, tan5, and R are the water
      content, Young's modulus, fracture stress, fracture strain, work
      of extension at fracture, loss factor (10 Hz and strain 0.5%), and
      shock-absorbing ratio, respectively, at room temperature. 7s is
      the softening temperature determined by the peak of loss factor of
      the gels.<br>

      A computer-aided drawing of one embodiment of the composites of
      the present invention is shown in Figure 1. Left side is a side
      view of the composite and right side is a projection view. One
      embodiment of the composites of the present invention exhibits
      toughness two orders of magnitude higher than traditional
      hydrogels (SN gel) (Gc 4800 J/m&lt;2&gt;vs 10 J/m&lt;2&gt;). In
      addition, one embodiment of the composites of present invention
      exhibits dramatic increase in toughness. For the case of a 20 mm
      wide strip of the composite comprised of woven glass fiber and PA
      gel, a Gc value (105,000 J/m&lt;2&gt;) can be obtained which is an
      additional two orders of magnitude greater than the neat PA gel,
      and 4 orders of magnitude higher than a traditional SN gel. (See
      Figure 3).<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, unlike most composites where combining two
      materials results in an averaging of their mechanical properties,
      in this case the tear strength is much greater than either
      materials when tested independently. Also when the control SN gel
      and fabric was tested, a noticeable decrease in tear strength was
      observed, which reinforces that this special combination of PA gel
      and fabric is necessary to see a great increase in tear strength
      (See the following Examples).<br>
      <br>
      The composite of the present invention can be employed for medical
      treatment for example for ligament reconstruction surgeries such
      as Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries. The
      composite of the present invention can also be employed for
      bandages, skin grafts, flexible tear resistant clothing or
      bullet-proofing.<br>
      <br>
      There are many ways this invention improves over the prior art.
      When used as internal prostheses, fabrics have many issues with
      regards to tearing, failing, and degrading. Often to prevent this,
      these stiff substrates would be coated in elastomers. However
      elastomers often result in a bodily response which can lead to
      infection or rejection. The coating material, the PA hydrogel,
      used here contains primarily of water and is non-toxic, and
      resists cell adhesion.<br>
      <br>
      The composite of the present invention has various utilities.
      Wound care would benefit from this invention, because the PA
      hydrogels could create extremely resilient and tear resistant
      bandages. In the composite of the present invention, the fabric is
      used as support and the PA hydrogel is used for wound closure, as
      they are generally non-toxic, consist mostly of water, and can
      promote wound healing.<br>

      2-oxoglutaric acid and N, N'-methylenebis (acrylamide) (MBAA) were
      purchased from the Wako company (Japan). Fabric (S-Glass 4-Harness
      Satin Weave) (4HS) were purchased from the ACP composite company.
      In the 4HS, the fill yarn passes over three warp yarns and under
      one. All of the chemicals were used as purchased without further
      purification.<br>

      <b>2. Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>2- 1. Synthesis of materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Polyampholyte hydrogels (PA) were synthesized using the one-step
      random copolymerization of an anionic monomer NaSS and a cationic
      monomer DMAEA-Q. A mixed aqueous solution with the prescribed
      monomer concentration (Cm=2.0 mol/L) and molar fraction of the
      anionic monomer (F=0.52), 0.1mol% ultraviolet initiator,
      2-oxoglutaric acid, 0.1mol% chemical crosslinker MBAA (in a
      concentration relative to the total monomer concentration), and
      0.5M NaCl was poured into a reaction cell. The cell was consisted
      of a pair of glass plates with 10 mm (L)x l0 mm (w)x lmm(d), where
      the thickness was controlled by the silicone spacer thickness. The
      reacted system was irradiated with 365-nm ultraviolet light for 8h
      in the atmosphere of argon.<br>
      <br>
      Polyacrylamide hydrogels (PAAm) were produced from the
      polymerization of 2 mol/L acrylamide monomer, 0.1mol%
      2-oxoglutaric acid and 1.0mol% chemical crosslinker MBAA (relative
      to the total monomer concentration) under the UV light.<br>
      <br>
      PA gel/fabric composite were produced by the similar described
      polymerization process. The fabric 4HS with approximately 0.3 mm
      thickness were fixed to the center of reaction cell prior to
      injecting the reaction solution. To produce the PA gel/fabric
      composite, the polymerization was carried out after filling the PA
      solution with the same composition to the reaction cell.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to the PA gel/fabric composite production, the PAAm/fabric
      composite was synthesized by the AAm solution and fabric 4HS.

      <br>
      After polymerization, the as-prepared gel was immersed in a large
      amount of water for 1 week to allow the gel to reach equilibrium
      and to wash away the residual chemicals and counter-ions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2-2. Characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Tearing test:<br>
      <br>
      The tearing test was performed to characterize the toughness in
      air using a commercial test machine (Instron Cat. No 2752-005).
      The image of testing setup for the tearing test is shown in Figure
      2. The test samples were cut to rectangular shape with 40 mm (L) x
      20-100 mm (w)&lt;χ&gt;0.5-1.3 mm (t). A cut was made 20 mm along
      the length, at the center of the width of the sample, to create
      two arms. The two arms of a test piece were clamped, and then the
      upper arm was pulled upward at constant velocity 50 mm/min while
      the tearing force F was recorded. The tearing energy T was
      calculated at a constant tearing force F using the relation T =
      2F/w, where w is the thickness of the sample. The results are
      shown in Figure 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows tear strength at breakage
      and Figure 4 shows force vs. displacement curve for 20 mm wide
      samples of the composite of the present invention, a neat glass
      fiber fabric, a combination of the fabric and a SN hydrogel.
      Figure 5 shows microscopy images of glass fiber fabric and PA
      hydrogel between the fibers of the fabric of the sample, A is an
      image of fibrillation in the matrix gel and B is an image of
      fracture of the fibrils, which is hypothesized to dissipate
      energy. Figure 6 is a microscopy image showing deformation in the
      tearing region of the fabric (macro scale).<br>
      <br>
      Tensile test:<br>
      <br>
      The tensile stress-strain measurements were performed using a
      tensile-compressive tester (Tensilon RTC-1310A, Orientec Co.) at a
      deformation rate of 10 mm/min in air. The test was carried out on
      samples with rectangle shape with the size (25 mm (L) x 20 mm
      (w)&lt;χ&gt;0.85 mm (d). In order to prevent the slipping of the
      sample at the end of the clamp during the tensile test,
      polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plates with 2 mm (L) x 2 mm
      (w)&lt;χ&gt;3mm (d) adhere the ends of samples was used by super
      glue cyanoacrylate. The PET plates were gripped by the clamp
      during the tensile test. The results are shown in Figures 7
      (composite) and 8 (neat glass fabric). The strength of the
      materials exceeded the strength of the mounting grips, and the
      ultimate properties of these materials exceed the results
      presented. [0062]<br>
