      <b>Abstract --- </b>A method and apparatus for implementing a
      thermodynamic cycle with intercooling, includes a condensing
      subsystem, a boiler, and a turbine. The boiler may include a
      preheater, an evaporator, and a superheater. After initial
      expansion in the turbine, the fluid may be diverted to a reheater
      to increase the temperature available for superheating. After
      return to the turbine and additional expansion, the fluid may be
      withdrawn from the turbine and cooled in an intercooler.
      Thereafter the fluid is returned to the turbine for additional
      expansion. The cooling of the turbine gas may provide additional
      heat for evaporation. Intercooling may provide compensation for
      the heat used in reheating and may provide recuperation of
      available heat which would otherwise remain unused following final
      turbine expansion.

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for
        transforming energy from a heat source into usable form using a
        working fluid that is expanded and regenerated. This invention
        further relates to a method and apparatus for improving the heat
        utilization efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>2. Brief Description of the Background Art </p>
      <p>In the Rankine cycle, a working fluid such as water, ammonia or
        a freon is evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available
        heat source. The evaporated gaseous working fluid is expanded
        across a turbine to transform its energy into usable form. The
        spent gaseous working fluid is then condensed in a condenser
        using an available cooling medium. The pressure of the condensed
        working medium is increased by pumping, followed by evaporation
        and so on to continue the cycle. </p>
      <p>The Exergy cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,561,
        utilizes a binary or multi-component working fluid. This cycle
        operates generally on the principle that a binary working fluid
        is pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure and is heated
        to partially vaporize the working fluid. The fluid is then
        flashed to separate high and low boiling working fluids. The low
        boiling component is expanded through a turbine, to drive the
        turbine, while the high boiling component has heat recovered for
        use in heating the binary working fluid prior to evaporation.
        The high boiling component is then mixed with the spent low
        boiling working fluid to absorb the spent working fluid in a
        condenser in the presence of a cooking medium. </p>
      <p>The theoretical comparison of the conventional Rankine cycle
        and the Exergy cycle demonstrates the improved efficiency of the
        new cycle over the Rankine cycle when an available, relatively
        low temperature heat source such as ocean water, geothermal
        energy or the like is employed. </p>
      <p>In applicant's further invention, referred to as the Basic
        Kalina cycle, the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563, relatively
        lower temperature available heat is utilized to effect partial
        distillation of at least a portion of a multi-component fluid
        stream at an intermediate pressure to generate working fluid
        fractions of differing compositions. The fractions are used to
        produce at least one main rich solution which is relatively
        enriched with respect to the lower boiling component, and to
        produce one lean solution which is relatively impoverished with
        respect to the lower boiling component. The pressure of the main
        rich solution is increased; thereafter, it is evaporated to
        produce a charged gaseous main working fluid. The main working
        fluid is expanded to a low pressure level to convert energy to
        usable form. The spent low pressure level working fluid is
        condensed in a main absorption stage by dissolving with cooling
        in the lean solution to regenerate an initial working fluid for
        reuse. </p>
      <p>In any process of converting thermal energy to a usable form,
        the major loss of available energy in the heat source occurs in
        the process of boiling or evaporating the working fluid. This
        loss of available energy (known as exergy or essergy) is due to
        the mismatch of the enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the
        heat source and the working fluid in the boiler. Simply put, for
        any given enthalpy the temperature of the heat source is always
        greater than the temperature of the working fluid. Ideally, this
        temperature difference would be almost, but not quite, zero. </p>
      <p>This mismatch occurs both in the classical Rankine cycle, using
        a pure substance as a working fluid, as well as in the Kalina
        and Exergy cycles described above, using a mixture as the
        working fluid. The use of a mixture as a working fluid in the
        manner of the Kalina and Exergy cycles reduces these losses to a
        significant extent. However, it would be highly desirable to
        further reduce these losses in any cycle. </p>
      <p>In the conventional Rankine cycle, the losses arising from
        mismatching of the enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the
        heat source and the working fluid would constitute about 25% of
        the available exergy. With a cycle such as that described in
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563, the loss of exergy in the boiler due to
        enthalpy-temperature characteristics mismatching would
        constitute about 14% of all of the available exergy. </p>
      <p>The overall boiling process in a thermodynamic cycle can be
        viewed for discussion purposes as consisting of three distinct
        parts: preheating, evaporation, and superheating. With
        conventional technology, the matching of a heat source and the
        working fluid is reasonably adequate during preheating. However,
        the quantity of heat in the temperature range suitable for
        superheating is generally much greater than necessary, while the
        quantity of heat in the temperature range suitable for
        evaporation is much smaller than necessary. The inventor of the
        present invention has appreciated that a portion of the high
        temperature heat which would be suitable for high temperature
        superheating is used for evaporation in previously known
        processes. This causes very large temperature differences
        between the two streams, and as a result, irreversible losses of
        exergy. </p>
      <p>These irreversible losses may be lessened by reheating the
        stream of working fluid after it has been partially expanded in
        a turbine. However, reheating results in repeated superheating.
        As a result, reheating increases the necessary quantity of heat
        for superheating. This increase in the required heat provides
        better matching between the heat source and the working fluid
        enthalpy-temperature characteristics. However, reheating has no
        beneficial effect with respect to the quantity of heat necessary
        for evaporation. Thus, the total quantity of heat necessary per
        unit of weight of working fluid significantly increases with
        reheating. Therefore, the total weight flow rate of working
        fluid through the boiler turbine is reduced. Thus, the benefits
        of reheating are largely transitory in that the reduced weight
        flow rate limits the possible increase in overall efficiency
        that may be derived. </p>
      <p>The ideal solution to the age old dilemma of poorly matched
        heat source and working fluid enthalpy-temperature
        characteristics would be one that makes high temperature heat
        available from the heat source for use in superheating thereby
        reducing the temperature differences during superheating, but at
        the same time provides lower temperature heat which minimizes
        the temperature differences in the process of evaporation. It
        should be evident that these two goals are apparently mutually
        inconsistent since increasing the superheating heat would appear
        to require either increasing the overall heating source
        temperature or using reheating. As discussed above, reheating
        has certain drawbacks, which to a large degree mitigate the
        partly transitory gains achieved. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the greater the available heat for superheating, the
        greater would be the output temperature of the gaseous spent
        working fluid from the turbine. This is undesirable from an
        efficiency standpoint since the superheating of the exiting
        steam makes subsequent condensing more difficult and causes
        additional losses of exergy. Thus, any effort to improve
        efficiency with respect to one part of the cycle seems to
        eventually cause lower efficiency in another part of the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is one feature of the present invention to provide a
        significant improvement in the efficiency of a thermodynamic
        cycle by permitting closer matching of the working fluid and the
        heat source enthalpy-temperature characteristics in the boiler.
        It is also a feature of the present invention to provide a
        system which both increases the efficiency of superheating while
        providing concommitant advantages during evaporation. Another
        feature of the present invention is to enable these advantages
        to be attained without necessarily adversely reducing the mass
        flow rate of the cycle. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a
        method of implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes the step
        of expanding a gaseous working fluid to transform its energy
        into a usable form. The expanded gaseous working fluid is cooled
        and subsequently expanded to a spent low pressure level to
        transform its energy into a usable form. The spent working fluid
        is condensed. The condensed fluid is then evaporated using the
        heat transferred during the cooling of the expanded gaseous
        working fluid. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,
        a method of implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes the step
        of superheating an evaporated working fluid. The superheated
        fluid is expanded to transform its energy into usable form. The
        expanded fluid is then reheated and subsequently further
        expanded to transform additional energy into a usable form. The
        expanded, reheated fluid is cooled and again expanded, this time
        to a spent low pressure level to transform its energy into a
        usable form. The spent working fluid is condensed and
        subsequently evaporated using heat transferred during cooling
        from the expanded, reheated fluid. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
        invention, a method for implementing a thermodynamic cycle
        includes the step of preheating an initial working fluid to a
        temperature approaching its boiling temperature. The preheated
        initial working fluid is split into first and second fluid
        streams. The first fluid stream is evaporated using a first heat
        source while a second fluid stream is evaporated using a second
        heat source. The first and second evaporated fluid streams are
        combined and subsequently superheated to produce a charged
        gaseous main working fluid. The charged gaseous main working
        fluid is expanded to transform its energy into a usable form.
        Then the expanded, charged main working fluid is reheated and
        again expanded. The expanded, reheated, charged main working
        fluid is cooled to provide the heat source for evaporating the
        second fluid stream. The cooled main working fluid is again
        expanded, this time to a spent low pressure level to transform
        its energy into a usable form. The spent main working fluid is
        cooled and condensed to form the intial working fluid. </p>
      <p>In accordance with still another embodiment of the present
        invention, an apparatus for implementing a thermodynamic cycle
        includes a turbine device. The turbine device has first and
        second turbine sets each including at least one turbine stage.
        Each of the turbine sets has a gas inlet and a gas outlet. A
        turbine gas cooler is connected between the gas outlet of the
        first set and the gas inlet of the second set, such that most of
        the fluid passing through the turbine would pass through the
        turbine gas cooler and then back to said turbine device. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawing wherein like reference characters are
        utilized for like parts throughout the several views, a system
        10, shown in FIG. 1, implements a thermodynamic cycle, in
        accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The
        system 10 includes a boiler 102, in turn made up of a preheater
        104, an evaporator 106, and a superheater 108. In addition, the
        system 10 includes a turbine 120, a reheater 122, an intercooler
        124, and a condensing subsystem 126. </p>
      <p>The condenser 126 may be any type of known heat rejection
        device. In the Rankine cycle, heat rejection occurs in a simple
        heat exchanger and thus, for Rankine applications, the
        condensing subsystem 126 may take the form of a heat exchanger
        or condenser. In the Kalina cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563 to Kalina, the heat rejection system requires that
        gases leaving the turbine be mixed with a multi-component fluid
        stream, for example, comprised of water and ammonia, condensed
        and then distilled to produce the original state of the working
        fluid. Thus, when the present invention is used with a Kalina
        cycle, the distillation subsystem described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563 may be utilized as the condensing subsystem 126. U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,489,563 is hereby expressly incorporated by reference
        herein. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. Thus, for example, heat sources with
        temperatures as high as, say 1000.degree. C. or more, down to
        low heat sources such as those obtained from ocean thermal
        gradients may be utilized. Heat sources such as, for example,
        low grade primary fuel, waste heat, geothermal heat, solar heat
        or ocean thermal energy conversion systems may be implemented
        with the present invention. </p>
      <p>A variety of working fluids may be used in conjunction with
        this system depending on the kind of condensing subsystem 126
        utilized. In conjunction with a condensing subsystem 126 as
        described in the U.S. patent incorporated by reference herein,
        any multi-component working fluid that comprises a lower boiling
        point fluid and a relatively higher boiling point fluid may be
        utilized. Thus, for example, the working fluid employed may be
        an ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons or the like. In
        general, the fluid may be mixtures of any number of compounds
        with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility.
        However, when implementing the conventional Rankine cycle, a
        conventional single component working fluid such as water,
        ammonia, or freon may be utilized. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a completely condensed working fluid passes
        through a preheater 104 where it is heated to a temperature a
        few degrees below its boiling temperature. This preheating is
        provided by the cooling of all streams of a heat source
        indicated in dashed lines through the preheater 104. The working
        fluid which exits the preheater 104 is divided at point 128 into
        two separate streams. </p>
      <p>A first stream, separated at point 128, enters the evaporator
        106 while the second stream enters the intercooler 124. The
        first stream is heated in the evaporator 106 by the
        countercurrent heating fluid flow indicated in dashed lines
        through the evaporator 106 and communicating with the heating
        fluid flow through the preheater 104. The second fluid stream
        passing through the intercooler 124 is heated by the fluid flow
        proceeding along line 130. Both the first and second streams are
        completely evaporated and initially superheated. Each of the
        streams has approximately the same pressure and temperature but
        the streams may have different flow rates. The fluid streams
        from the evaporator 106 and intercooler 124 are then recombined
        at point 132. </p>
      <p>The combined stream of working fluid is sent into the
        superheater 108 where it is finally superheated by heat exchange
        with only part of the heat source stream indicated by dashed
        lines extending through the superheater 108. Thus, the heat
        source stream extending from point 25 to point 26 passes first
        through the superheater 108, then through the evaporator 106 and
        finally through the preheater 104. The enthalpy-temperature
        characteristics of the illustrated heating fluid stream,
        indicated by the line A in FIG. 4, is linear. </p>
      <p>From the superheater 108, the total stream of working fluid
        enters the first turbine set 134 of turbine 120. The turbine set
        134 includes one or more stages 136 and, in the illustrated
        embodiment, the first turbine set 134 includes three stages 136.
        In the first turbine set 134 the working fluid expands to a
        first intermediate pressure thereby converting thermal energy
        into mechanical energy. </p>
      <p>The whole working fluid stream from the first turbine set 134
        is reheated in the reheater 122. The reheater 122 is a
        conventional superheater or heat exchanger. With this reheating
        process the remaining portion of the heat source stream, split
        at point 138 from the flow from point 25 to point 26, is
        utilized. Having been reheated to a high temperature, the stream
        of working fluid leaves the reheater 122 and travels to the
        second turbine set 140. At the same time the heating fluid flow
        from point 51 to point 53 is returned to the main heating fluid
        flow at point 142 to contribute to the processes in the
        evaporator 106 and preheater 104. The second turbine set 140 may
        include a number of stages 136. In the illustrated embodiment,
        the second turbine set 140 is shown as having four stages,
        however, the number of stages in each of the turbine sets
        described herein may be varied widely depending on particular
        circumstances. </p>
      <p>The working fluid in the second turbine set 140 is expanded
        from the first intermediate pressure to a second intermediate
        pressure, thus generating power. The total stream of working
        fluid is then sent to the intercooler 124 where it is cooled,
        providing the heat necessary for the evaporation of the second
        working fluid stream. The intercooler 124 may be a simple heat
        exchanger. The fluid stream travels along the line 130 to the
        last turbine set 144. </p>
      <p>The last turbine set 144 is illustrated as having only a single
        stage 136. However, the number of stages in the last turbine set
        144 may be subject to considerable variation depending on
        specific circumstances. The working fluid expands to the final
        spent fluid pressure level thus producing additional power. From
        the last turbine set 144 the fluid stream is passed through the
        condensing subsystem 126 where it is condensed, pumped to a
        higher pressure and sent to the preheater 104 to continue the
        cycle. </p>
      <p>A Kalina cycle condensing subsystem 126', shown in FIG. 2, may
        be used as the condensing subsystem 126 in the system shown in
        FIG. 1. In analyzing the condensing subsystem 126', it is useful
        to commence with the point in the subsystem identified by
        reference numeral 1 comprising the initial composite stream
        having an initial composition of higher and lower boiling
        components in the form of ammonia and water. At point 1 the
        initial composite stream is at a spent low pressure level. lt is
        pumped by means of a pump 151 to an intermediate pressure level
        where its pressure parameters will be as at point 2 following
        the pump 151. </p>
      <p>From point 2 of the flow line, the initial composite stream at
        an intermediate pressure is heated consecutively in the heat
        exchanger 154, in the recuperator 156 and in the main heat
        exchanger 158. </p>
      <p>The initial composite stream is heated in the heat exchanger
        154, in the recuperator 156 and in the main heat exchanger 158
        by heat exchange with the spent composite working fluid from the
        turbine 120'. When the system of FIG. 1 is being implemented
        with the condensing subsystem 126' the turbine 120 may be used
        in place of the turbine 120'. In addition, in the heat exchanger
        154 the initial composite stream is heated by the condensation
        stream as will be hereinafter described. In the recuperator 156
        the initial composite stream is further heated by the
        condensation stream and by heat exchange with lean and rich
        working fluid fractions as will be hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The heating in the main heat exchanger 158 is performed only by
        the heat of the flow from the turbine outlet and, as such, is
        essentially compensation for under recuperation. </p>
      <p>At point 5 between the main heat exchanger 158 and the
        separator stage 160 the initial composite stream has been
        subjected to distillation at the intermediate pressure in the
        distillation system comprising the heat exchangers 154 and 158
        and the recuperator 156. If desired, auxiliary heating means
        from any suitable or available heat source may be employed in
        any one of the heat exchangers 154 or 158 or in the recuperator
        156. </p>
      <p>At point 5 the initial composite stream has been partially
        evaporated in the distillation system and is sent to the gravity
        separator stage 160. In this stage 160 the enriched vapor
        faction which has been generated in the distillation system, and
        which is enriched with the low boiling component, namely
        ammonia, is separated from the remainder of the initial
        composite stream to produce an enriched vapor fraction at point
        6 and a stripped liquid fraction at point 7 from which the
        enriched vapor fraction has been stripped. </p>
      <p>Further, the stripped liquid fraction from point 7 is divided
        into first and second stripped liquid fraction streams having
        parameters as at points 8 and 10 respectively. </p>
      <p>The enriched fraction at point 6 is enriched with the lower
        boiling component, namely ammonia, relatively to a lean working
        fluid fraction as discussed below. </p>
      <p>The first enriched vapor fraction stream from point 6 is mixed
        with the first stripped liquid fraction stream at point 8 to
        provide a rich working fluid fraction at point 9. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction is enriched relatively to the
        composite working fluid (as hereinafter discussed) with the
        lower boiling component comprising ammonia. The lean working
        fluid fraction, on the other hand, is impoverished relatively to
        the composite working fluid (as hereinafter discussed) with
        respect to the lower boiling component. </p>
      <p>The second stripped liquid fraction at point 10 comprises the
        remaining part of the initial composite stream and is used to
        constitute the condensation stream. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction at point 9 is partially
        condensed in the recuperator 156 to point 11. Thereafter the
        rich working fluid fraction is further cooled and condensed in
        the preheater 162 (from point 11 to 13), and is finally
        condensed in the absorption stage 152 by means of heat exchange
        with a cooling water supply through points 23 to 24. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction is pumped to a charged high
        pressure level by means of the pump 166. Thereafter it passes
        through the preheater 162 to arrive at point 22. From point 22
        it may continue through the system shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>When a Kalina cycle is implemented, the composite working fluid
        at point 38 exiting from the turbine 120 has such a low pressure
        that it cannot be condensed at this pressure and at the
        available ambient temperature. From point 38 the spent composite
        working fluid flows through the main heat exchanger 158, through
        the recuperator 156 and through the heat exchanger 154. Here it
        is partially condensed and the released heat is used to preheat
        the incoming flow as previously discussed. </p>
      <p>The spent composite working fluid at point 17 is then mixed
        with the condensation stream at point 19. At point 19 the
        condensation stream has been throttled from point 20 to reduce
        its presure to the low presure level of the spent composite
        working fluid at point 17. The resultant mixture is then fed
        from point 18 through the absorption stage 152 where the spent
        composite working fluid is absorbed in the condensation stream
        to regenerate the initial composite stream at point 1. </p>
      <p>The intercooling process accomplished by the intercooler 124,
        shown in FIG. 1, reduces the output of the last turbine stage
        per pound of working fluid. However, intercooling also enables
        reheating without sacrificing the quantity of working fluid per
        pound. Thus, compared to reheating without intercooling, the use
        of intercooling achieves significant advantages. </p>
      <p>The heat returned by the intercooler 124 to the evaporation
        process is advantageously approximately equal the heat consumed
        in the reheater 122. This assures that the weight flow rate of
        the working fluid is restored. Then it is not necessary to
        decrease the mass flow rate of the working fluid to accommodate
        the higher temperature reheating process. </p>
      <p>The parameters of flow at points 40, 41, 42 and 43 are design
        variables and can be chosen in a way to obtain the maximum
        advantage from the system 10. One skilled in the art will be
        able to select the design variables to maximize performance
        under the various circumstances that may be encountered. </p>
      <p>The parameters of the various process points, shown in FIG. 1,
        are subject to considerable variation depending on specific
        circumstances. However, as a general guide or rule of thumb to
        the design of systems of this type, it can be pointed out that
        it may often be advantageous to make the temperature at point 40
        as close as possible to the temperature of point 37 so that the
        efficiencies of the first turbine set 134 and the second turbine
        set 140 are close to equal. In addition, it may be desirable in
        many situations to design the system so that the temperature at
        point 42 is generally higher than the temperature of the
        saturated vapor of the working fluid in the evaporator 106. It
        may also often be desirable to make the temperature at point 43
        generally higher than the temperature of a saturated liquid of
        the working fluid in the boiler 102. </p>
      <p>While a single pressure in the evaporator 106 and intercooler
        124 is utilized in the illustrated embodiment, one skillled in
        the art will appreciate that dual, triple and even higher
        numbers of boiler pressures may be selected for specific
        circumstances. The present invention is also applicable to
        multiple boiling cycles. While special advantages may be
        achieved through the use of intercooler 124 heat in the
        evaporation process, the use of the intercooler 124 between
        turbine sets can be applied to any portion of a thermodynamic
        system where there is a shortage of adequate temperature heat.
        Intercooling could provide heat to supplement boiling or to
        supplement heating in a superheater. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that the present invention is not
        limited to the use of intercooling in combination with
        reheating. Although this combination results in significant
        advantages, many advantages can be achieved with intercooling
        without reheating. For example, intercooling may be utilized
        without reheating whenever the fluid exiting from the final
        turbine stage is superheated. In general, it is important that
        intercooling be taken between turbine stages in order to obtain
        a sufficiently high fluid temperature. </p>
      <p>It is generally advantageous that at least most of the fluid
        flow through the turbine be passed through the intercooler. Even
        more advantageously, substantially all of the flow through the
        turbine is passed through the intercooler. Advantageously,
        substantially all of the cooled fluid is returned to the turbine
        for further expansion. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the present invention may be appreciated by
        comparison of FIGS. 3 and 4. In FIG. 3 a boiler heat duty cycle
        for a thermodynamic cycle is illustrated for a system of the
        type shown in FIG. 2, pursuant to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563, previously incorporated herein. The heat source is
        indicated by the line A while the working fluid is indicated by
        the line B. The enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the
        working fluid during preheating are represented by the curve
        portion B1. Similarly, evaporation is indicated by the portion
        B2 and superheating is indicated by the portion B3. The pinch
        point is located in the region of the intersection of the
        portions B1 and B2. The extent of the gap between the curves A
        and B represents irreversible inefficiencies in the system which
        are sought to be minimized by the present invention. During
        superheating, excessive heat is available, while during
        evaporation insufficient heat is available. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 4, calculated temperature versus enthalpy
        or heat duty in a boiler is shown for an illustrative embodiment
        of the present invention. The working fluid is represented by
        curve C while the heat source fluid is represented by the curve
        A. The points on the graph correspond to points on FIG. 1.
        Instead of having three approximately linear regions, the graph
        shows that the working fluid has approximately four linear
        regions with the present invention. In the region between points
        22 and 44, 46, preheating is occuring in the manner generally
        identical to that occuring with Applicant's previous invention,
        represented by portion B1 in FIG. 3. Evaporation is represented
        by the curve portion between the points 44, 46 and 48, 49 and
        the saturated liquid point is indicated as "SL" while the
        saturated vapor point is indicated as "SV". The curve portion
        between points 48, 49 and 30, 41 represents superheating with
        reheating following efficient evaporation. It can be seen that
        the curve portion between points 40 and 30, 41 closely follows
        the heat source line A and therefore results in close
        temperature matching. In general, the overall configuration of
        the curve, particularly, the portion between points SV and 30,
        41 more closely approximates the heat source line A than was
        previously possible so that greater efficiencies may be realized
        with the present invention. </p>
      <p>In order to further illustrate the advantages that can be
        obtained by the present invention, two sets of calculations were
        performed. In both sets, the same heat source was utilized. The
        first set of calculations is related to an illustrative power
        cycle in accordance with the system shown in FIG. 2. In this
        illustrative cycle the working fluid is a water-ammonia mixture
        with a concentration of 72.5 weight percent of ammonia (weight
        of ammonia to total weight). The parameters for the theoretical
        calculations which were performed utilizing standard
        ammonia-water enthalpy/concentration diagrams are set forth in
        Table 1 below. In this table the points set forth in the first
        column correspond to points set forth in FIG. 2. </p>

        The above cycle had an output of 2595.78 KWe with a cycle
        efficiency of 31.78%. </p>
      <p>In the second case study, an illustrative power cycle in
        accordance with the present invention was added to the apparatus
        which was the subject of the aforementioned case study. The same
        pressure in the boiler, the same composition of working fluid,
        and the same temperature of cooling water were employed. The
        parameters for the theoretical calculations which were performed
        again utilizing standard ammonia-water and
        enthalpy/concentration diagrams are set out in Table 2 below. In
        Table 2 below, points 1-21 correspond with the specifically

      evaporate the working stream. After being superheated, the working
      stream is expanded in a turbine. Thereafter, the expanded stream
      is separated into a spent stream and a withdrawal stream. The
      withdrawal stream is combined with a lean stream to produce a

      stream and preheats the working stream and the lean stream. The
      composite stream is then expanded to a reduced pressure. A first
      portion of this composite stream is fed into a gravity separator.
      The liquid stream flowing from the gravity separator forms a
      portion of the lean stream that is combined with the withdrawal
      stream. The vapor stream flowing from the separator combines with
      a second portion of the composite stream in a scrubber. The vapor
      stream from the scrubber combines with a third portion of the
      expanded composite stream to produce a pre-condensed working
      stream that is condensed forming a liquid working stream. The
      liquid streams from the scrubber and gravity separator combine to
      form the lean stream. The liquid working stream is preheated and
      evaporated transforming it into the gaseous working stream. The
      cycle is complete when the gaseous working stream is again
      superheated.

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for
        transforming thermal energy from a heat source into mechanical
        and then electrical form using a working fluid that is expanded
        and regenerated. This invention further relates to a method and
        apparatus for improving the thermal efficiency of a
        thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>2. Brief Description of the Background Art </p>
      <p>It is well known that, in accordance with the Second Law of
        thermodynamics, the exergy (energy potential) of any heat source
        is increased as the temperature of this heat source is
        increased. Because of this effect, technological improvements in
        power generation have been directed toward increasing the
        temperature of the heat released in the process of combustion.
        One such improvement is the counterflow preheating of the
        combustion air with combustion gases to increase the combustion
        temperature and the average temperature of heat released from
        the burning of fuel. This technique, referred to as
        "pulverized-coal combustion," is well known and widely
        established. </p>
      <p>Unlike the energy potential of the heat source, the efficiency
        of a power cycle depends, not on the temperature of the heat
        source directly, but on the average temperature of the working
        fluid in the process of heat transfer from the heat source. If
        this temperature of heat acquisition is significantly lower than
        the temperature of the available heat source, irreversible
        losses of exergy occur in the process of heat transfer, and the
        efficiency of the cycle remains relatively low. </p>
      <p>This effect explains the relatively low efficiency of
        conventional power plants. For example, the limit of efficiency
        of a power plant converting thermal energy into power is on the
        level of approximately 63% , even when the working fluid
        temperature is maintained at the 1,000.degree. to 1,100.degree.
        F. limit that the metallurgical properties of modern power
        plants dictate. Similarly, the efficiency of the best
        direct-fired plants, based on a turbine electrical-power output
        (from which the work of the circulating feed pumps is
        subtracted) does not exceed 41-42%. In other words, the
        thermodynamic efficiency of these plants does not exceed 65%
        (the ratio of the thermal efficiency to the thermodynamic limit
        of efficiency). </p>
      <p>The theoretical reason for this phenomenon is that the bulk of
        the heat transferred to the working fluid, i.e., water, is
        acquired in the boiler, where water boils at a temperature of
        approximately 660.degree. F. (350.degree. C.), while the
        available heat has a much higher temperature. It is absolutely
        clear, from a thermodynamic point of view, that unless the
        temperature of the heat acquisition by the working fluid is
        increased drastically, the efficiency of the process of
        conversion of thermal energy into power, i.e., the efficiency of
        the thermodynamic cycle, cannot be increased. </p>
      <p>Use of a working fluid with a boiling temperature higher than
        that of water would not as a practical matter improve efficiency
        of the cycle for the following reason. The pressure in the
        condenser must be maintained at deep vacuum, even when water is
        used as a working fluid. If fluid with a normally
        higher-than-water boiling temperature is used, an even deeper
        vacuum in the condenser would be required, which would be
        technically impractical. Unless this super-low pressure in the
        condenser was provided, the temperature of condensation of such
        a hypothetical high-boiling fluid would be high, and all the
        gains obtained in the boiler would be lost in the condenser.
        Because of this problem, very little progress has been made in
        improving the efficiency of direct-fired power plants in the
        last sixty to seventy years. </p>
      <p>A promising way to increase the efficiency of a power cycle
        utilizing high-temperature heat sources would be to use the
        so-called "recuperative cycle". According to this idea, the
        working fluid should be preheated to a relatively high
        temperature by the returning streams of the same working fluid.
        Only after such preheating should the external heat be
        transferred to the working fluid. As a result, all heat
        acquisition would occur at a high temperature, and theoretically
        the efficiency of such a cycle would be increased. </p>
      <p>The only practical example of such a cycle is the so-called
        "recuperative Brighton Cycle", which utilizes a gaseous working
        fluid. In this cycle, the working fluid is compressed at ambient
        temperature, preheated in a recuperator, additionally heated by
        a heat source, expanded in a turbine, and sent back into the
        recuperator, thus providing preheating. </p>
      <p>Despite its theoretical advantages, the recuperative Brighton
        Cycle does not, in reality, provide a superior efficiency
        because of two factors: </p>
      <p>(1) the "work of compression" of a gaseous working fluid is
        very high and cannot be performed isothermally or with a small
        rise in temperature; and </p>
      <p>(2) because a gaseous working fluid is used, the temperature
        difference in the recuperator must be relatively high, thus
        causing irreversible exergy losses. </p>
      <p>The ideal solution to a high-efficiency power cycle would be to
        combine a high degree of recuperation, characteristic of the
        Brighton Cycle, with a steam cycle wherein the working fluid
        pressure is increased while this fluid is in a liquid state.
        This allows the use of pumps, with a relatively minor work
        requirement (low "work of compression") to increase fluid
        pressure. </p>
      <p>The direct realization of such a cycle unfortunately appears
        impossible, for a very simple reason. If the process of
        recuperative heating includes liquid preheating, evaporation,
        and some superheating, then the returning stream, which must
        have a lower pressure than the oncoming stream, would condense
        at a lower temperature than that at which the oncoming stream
        boils. This phenomenon appears to make the direct recuperation
        of heat in such a process impossible. </p>
      <p>As indicated above, the overall boiling process in a
        thermodynamic cycle can be viewed for discussion purposes as
        consisting of three distinct parts: preheating, evaporation, and
        superheating. With conventional technology, the matching of a
        heat source and the working fluid is adequate only during the
        high temperature portion of superheating. The inventor of the
        present invention has appreciated, however, that in previously
        known processes a portion of the high temperature heat which
        would be suitable for high temperature superheating is used
        instead for evaporation and preheating. This causes very large
        temperature differences between the two streams, and as a
        result, irreversible losses of exergy. For example, in the
        conventional Rankine cycle, the losses arising from mismatching
        of the enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the heat source
        and the working fluid would constitute about 25% of the
        available exergy. </p>
      <p>The ideal solution to the age old dilemma of poorly matched
        heat source and working fluid enthalpy-temperature
        characteristics would be one that makes high temperature heat
        available from the heat source for use in superheating thereby
        reducing the temperature differences during superheating, but at
        the same time provides lower temperature heat which minimizes
        the temperature differences in the process of evaporation. </p>
      <p>Conventional steam-power systems provide a poor substitute for
        this ideal system. This is because the heat provided by the
        multiple withdrawal of steam, that has been partially expanded
        in a turbine, may only be used for the low temperature
        pre-heating of the incoming or feed water stream to the turbine.
        This use of the multiple withdrawal of steam to provide heat to
        the feedwater is known as feedwater preheating. Unlike its use
        in low temperature pre-heating, the withdrawal of partially
        expanded steam can not provide heat for the high temperature
        protion of the preheating process or for the evaporation of or
        for the low temperature portion of the superheating of the
        feedwater stream. </p>
      <p>Because of technological limitations, the water usually boils
        at a pressure of approximately 2,500 psia and at a temperature
        of about 670.degree. F. Thus, the temperature of the heat source
        of these systems is generally substantially greater than the
        boiling temperature of the liquid working fluid. Because of the
        difference between the high temperature of the combustion gases
        and the relatively low boiling temperature of the working fluid,
        conventional steam systems use high-temperature heat
        predominantly for low-temperature purposes. Since the difference
        between the temperature of the available heat and the
        temperature required for the process is very large, very high
        thermodynamic losses result from an irreversible heat exchange.
        Such losses severely limit the efficiency of conventional steam
        systems. </p>
      <p>Replacing conventional systems with a system that provides
        lower temperature heat for evaporation of the working fluid may
        substantially reduce thermodynamic losses resulting from
        evaporation. Reducing these losses can substantially increase
        the efficiency of the system. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is one feature of the present invention to provide a
        significant improvement in the efficiency of a thermodynamic
        cycle by permitting closer matching of the working fluid and the
        heat source enthalpy-temperature characteristics in the boiler.
        It is also a feature of the present invention to provide a
        direct fired power cycle in which high temperature heat added to
        the cycle may be used predominately, if not entirely, for high
        temperature purposes. </p>
      <p>This transfer of heat to a working fluid predominately or
        solely at relatively high temperatures creates the necessary
        conditions at which to achieve a high thermodynamic and thermal
        efficiency. Because the working fluid in this cycle is a mixture
        of at least two components, the cycle enables a large percentage
        of recuperative heat exchange, including recuperative
        preheating, recuperative boiling and partial recuperative
        superheating, to be achieved. Such recuperative boiling,
        although impossible in a single component system, is possible in
        this multicomponent working fluid cycle. Unlike a single
        component system, when two or more components are used,
        different compositions for the working fluid may be used in
        different locations in the cycle. This enables a returning
        stream of working fluid, having a lower pressure than an
        oncoming stream, to condense within a temperature range which is
        higher than the temperature range within which the oncoming
        stream boils, thus effecting recuperative boiling of the working
        fluid. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a
        method of implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes the step
        of expanding a gaseous working stream to transform its energy
        into a useable form. The expanded gaseous working stream is
        divided into a withdrawal stream and a spent stream. After
        dividing the expanded stream into the two streams, the
        withdrawal stream is combined with a lean stream, having a
        higher content of a high-boiling component than is contained in
        the withdrawal stream, to form a composite stream that condenses
        over a temperature range that is higher than the temperature
        range required to evaporate an oncoming liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>After forming the composite stream, that stream is transported
        to a boiler where it is condensed to provide heat for the
        boiling of the oncoming liquid working stream. Evaporation of
        the liquid working stream produces the above mentioned gaseous
        working stream. Subsequently, the composite stream is separated
        to form a liquid stream and a vapor stream. Some or all of the
        liquid stream forms the above mentioned lean stream. The vapor
        stream is returned into the cycle, preferably by being combined
        with a portion of the composite stream to produce a
        pre-condensed working stream. The pre-condensed working stream
        is condensed to produce the liquid working stream that is
        transported to the boiler. The spent stream may be combined with
        this liquid working stream prior to the liquid working stream
        being sent to the boiler. Alternatively, the spent stream may be
        returned to the system at some other location. To complete the
        cycle, the heat, that the above mentioned composite stream
        transports to the boiler, is used to evaporate the liquid
        working stream to form the gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,
        the gaseous working stream, exiting from the boiler, may then by
        superheated in one or more heat exchangers by either the
        withdrawal stream or the spent stream or by both the withdrawal
        and spent streams. Following the superheating of the gaseous
        working stream in the heat exchangers, the gaseous working
        stream may be further superheated in a heater. The energy
        supplied to the heater is supplied from outside the
        thermodynamic cycle. After this superheating, expansion of the
        gaseous working stream takes place. This expanded gaseous
        working stream may be reheated and expanded one or more times
        before being divided into the spent and withdrawal streams. This
        embodiment may further include the step of reheating and
        expanding the spent stream one or more times after the spent
        stream has been separated from the withdrawal stream. </p>
      <p>In addition, this embodiment may further include a series of
        recuperative heat exchangers used to recuperate heat from the
        withdrawal, composite and spent streams. These heat exchangers
        may allow the lean stream and the liquid working stream to
        absorb heat from the composite stream. Further, one or more of
        these heat exchangers may allow the spent stream to provide
        additional heat to the liquid working stream to aid in the
        preheating and boiling of the liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
        invention, the methods for implementing a thermodynamic cycle
        described above may further include the step of reducing the
        pressure of the composite stream with a hydraulic turbine (or
        alternatively a throttle valve). After this reduction of
        pressure, a first portion of this composite stream may be
        partially evaporated in one or more heat exchangers with heat
        from the spent stream and with heat from this same composite
        stream as it flows toward the turbine. After the partial
        evaporation of this first portion of the composite stream, it is
        sent to a separator where it is separated into a vapor stream
        and a liquid stream. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the liquid stream forms a portion of the
        lean stream which may be sent to a circulation pump to be pumped
        to a higher pressure. The circulation pump may be connected to
        the hydraulic turbine; the hydraulic turbine releasing energy
        used to operate the pump. After attaining this high pressure,
        the lean stream may be heated by the returning composite stream
        in one or more heat exchangers. After acquiring this additional
        heat, the lean stream is combined with the withdrawal stream to
        form the composite stream used to preheat and evaporate the
        liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>The vapor stream may be combined with a second portion of the
        composite stream, that flows from the hydraulic turbine, in a
        direct contact heat exchanger or in a scrubber. The liquid
        stream flowing from the heat exchanger or scrubber may combine
        with the liquid stream from the separator to produce the lean
        stream. The vapor stream flowing from the heat exchanger or
        scrubber forms a super rich stream. In this embodiment, this
        super rich stream may be combined with a third portion of the
        composite stream, that flows from the hydraulic turbine, to form
        a pre-condensed working stream. This stream may then pass
        through a heat exchanger, to supply heat to the returning liquid
        working stream, before it is fed into a water-cooled condenser
        to be fully condensed to produce the liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>The liquid working stream may be pumped to a high pressure by a
        feed pump. After obtaining this high pressure, the liquid
        working stream may be heated in a series of heat exchangers by
        the pre-condensed working stream, returning composite stream and
        the returning spent stream. This heat exchange, which may be
        accompanied by the pumping of the liquid working stream to
        progressively higher pressures, continues until the liquid
        working stream is evaporated to produce the gaseous working
        stream, thereby completing the cycle. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of preferred
        apparatus that may be used in the above described cycle.
        Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 100 that includes a boiler
        in the form of heat exchangers 112 and 127, a preheater in the
        form of heat exchangers 114 and 116, and a superheater in the
        form of heat exchangers 109 and 110. In addition, the system 100
        includes turbines 102, 104 and 106, superheater 101, reheaters
        103 and 105, gravity separator 120, scrubber 125, hydraulic
        turbine 119, pumps 122, 123, 138 and 139, heat exchangers 117,
        118 and 128, and condenser 121. Further, the system 100 includes
        stream separators 131-137 and stream mixers 140-147. </p>
      <p>The condenser 121 may be any type of known heat rejection
        device. For example, the condenser 121 may take the form of a
        heat exchanger, such as a water cooled system, or another type
        of condensing device. In the alternative, condenser 121 may be
        replaced with the heat rejection system described in U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867 to Kalina. The Kalina system
        requires that the stream shown approaching condenser 121 in FIG.
        1 be mixed with a multi-component fluid stream, for example, a
        fluid stream comprised of water and ammonia, condensed and then
        distilled to produce the original state of the working fluid.
        Thus, when the heat rejection system of the Kalina cycle is used
        in place of condenser 121, the distillation subsystem described
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867 may be utilized in
        place of condenser 121. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867
        are hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. Thus, for example, heat sources with
        temperatures as high as 1,000.degree. C. or more down to heat
        sources sufficient to superheat a gaseous working stream may be
        used to heat the gaseous working stream flowing through heater
        101 and reheaters 103 and 105. The combustion gases resulting
        from the burning of fossil fuels is a preferred heat source. Any
        other heat source capable of superheating the gaseous working
        stream that is used in the described embodiment of the invention
        may also be used. </p>
      <p>While the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 is related to
        pulverized coal combustion, this system may be used with a
        variety of combustion systems, including different types of
        fluidized bed combustion systems and waste incineration systems.
        One of ordinary skill can adjust the system by adding heat
        exchangers needed to accommodate a variety of different
        combustion systems. </p>
      <p>The working fluid used in the system 100 may be any
        multi-component working fluid that comprises a lower boiling
        point fluid and a relatively higher boiling point fluid. Thus,
        for example, the working fluid employed may be an ammonia-water
        mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more freons, mixtures
        of hydrocarbons and freons or the like. In general, the fluid
        may be mixtures of any number of compounds with favorable
        thermodynamic characteristics and solubility. In a preferred
        embodiment, a mixture of water and ammonia is used. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a working stream circulates through system
        100. The working stream includes a gaseous working stream that
        flows from stream mixer 142 until it is separated into a
        withdrawal stream and a spent stream at separator 131. In
        addition to the gaseous working stream, the withdrawal stream
        (that flows from separator 131 to stream mixer 141) and the
        spent stream (that flows from separator 131 to stream mixer 147)
        the working stream includes a pre-condensed working stream (that
        flows from mixer 146 to condenser 121) and a liquid working
        stream (that flows from condenser 121 to boilers 112, 127). Each
        portion of the working stream contains the same percentage of
        high boiling and low boiling components. </p>
      <p>The gaseous working stream, that has been completely evaporated
        and superheated in previous stages of system 100, enters heater
        101. While in heater 101, the gaseous working stream is
        superheated to the highest temperature that is reached at any
        stage in the process. After being superheated, this gaseous
        working stream is expanded in turbine 102 to an intermediate
        pressure. This expansion allows the heat contained in the
        gaseous working stream to be converted into energy that is in a
        useable form. </p>
      <p>After expansion in turbine 102, the gaseous working stream is
        separated by separator 131 into two streams, a withdrawal stream
        and a spent stream. The spent stream is reheated in reheater
        103, expanded in turbine 104, reheated a second time in reheater
        105 and expanded a second time in turbine 106. Although FIG. 1
        shows the system 100 as having two reheaters 103 and 105, for
        reheating the spent stream, and two turbines 104 and 106, for
        expandiang the spent stream, the optimum number of reheaters and
        turbines depends upon the desired efficiency of the system. The
        number of reheaters and turbines may be either increased or
        decreased from the number shown in FIG. 1. In addition, a single
        heater may be used to heat the gaseous working stream, prior to
        expansion, and the spent working stream, prior to the expansion
        of the spent stream. Therefore, the number of heaters and
        reheaters may be more than, less than or equal to the number of
        turbines. </p>
      <p>Further, system 100 may include additional heaters and turbines
        for reheating and expanding the gaseous stream exiting from
        turbine 102 prior to that stream's separation into the
        withdrawal and spent streams. Thus, although the inclusion of
        reheaters 103 and 105 and turbines 104 and 106 to system 100
        provides a preferred embodiment of the present invention, one
        may select a different number of reheaters and turbines without
        departing from the scope of the disclosed general inventive
        concept. </p>
      <p>After these reheatings and expansions of the spent stream, the
        stream passes through a series of recuperative heat exchangers.
        As shown in FIG. 1, the spent stream, after expansion, passes
        through recuperative heat exchangers 110, 127 and 116. While
        passing through heat exchanger 110, the spent stream provides
        heat to superheat the gaseous working stream. While passing
        through heat exchanger 127, the spent stream provides heat to
        evaporate the oncoming high-pressure liquid working stream.
        Similarly, while passing through heat exchanger 116, the spent
        stream provides heat to preheat this oncoming high pressure
        liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>Whether any or all of the heat exchangers 110, 127 and 116 are
        used or whether a number of additional heat exchangers are added
        to the system is a matter of design choice. Although the
        inclusion of heat exchangers 110, 127 and 116 to system 100 is
        preferred, the spent stream may pass through an increased number
        of heat exchangers, or not pass through any heat exchangers at
        all, without departing from the scope of the disclosed
        invention. </p>
      <p>The withdrawal stream beginning at stream separator 131
        initially passes through recuperative heat exchanger 109. While
        passing through heat exchanger 109, the withdrawal stream
        provides heat for the superheating of the oncoming high-pressure
        gaseous working stream. Although system 100 preferably includes
        heat exchanger 109, one may remove heat exchanger 109 or add
        additional heat exchangers. The preferred state of the
        withdrawal stream at point 42, after it has passed through heat
        exchanger 109, is that of a superheated vapor. </p>
      <p>After heating the gaseous working stream, the withdrawal stream
        combines with a lean stream at stream mixer 141. This lean
        stream contains the same components as are contained in the
        working stream. The lean stream, however, contains a higher
        content of a high-boiling component than is contained in any
        part of the working stream. For example, if ammonia and water
        are the two components present in the working and lean streams,
        the water is the high-boiling component and the ammonia is the
        low-boiling component. In such a two component system, the lean
        stream contains a higher percentage of water than is contained
        in the working stream. As shown in FIG. 1, the lean stream flows
        from stream mixer 144 to stream mixer 141. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the state of the lean stream at point 74,
        prior to mixing with the withdrawal stream at stream mixer 141,
        is preferably that of a subcooled liquid. </p>
      <p>Mixing the lean stream with the withdrawal stream at stream
        mixer 141 provides a composite stream that has a lower boiling
        temperature range than the lean stream but a higher boiling
        temperature range than the withdrawal stream or any other
        portion of the working stream. The state of the composite stream
        as it flows from stream mixer 141 depends upon the states of the
        lean and withdrawal streams. It is preferably that of a
        vapor-liquid mixture. Preferably, the pressure of the withdrawal
        stream at point 42 and the lean stream at point 74, prior to
        mixing at stream mixer 141, will be the same as the pressure of
        the composite stream at point 50, that is formed at stream mixer
        141. The temperature of the composite stream at this point is
        preferably higher than the temperature of the lean stream at
        point 74 and slightly lower than that of the withdrawal stream
        at point 42. </p>
      <p>The composite stream will contain a higher percentage of a
        high-boiling component than is contained in the withdrawal
        stream or in other portions of the working stream. Because the
        composite stream contains a higher percentage of a high-boiling
        component, it may be condensed within a temperature range which
        exceeds the boiling temperature range of the liquid working
        stream. Further, in this preferred embodiment, the composite
        stream may be condensed at a higher temperature than the boiling
        temperature of the liquid working stream, even if the pressure
        of the composite stream is significantly lower than the pressure
        of the oncoming liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>The composite stream produced by the mixing of the withdrawal
        stream with the lean stream flows into heat exchanger 112, where
        it is cooled and condensed. As it is being cooled and condensed,
        the composite stream provides heat to evaporate the oncoming
        liquid working stream and to provide heat to the oncoming lean
        stream, as those streams enter heat exchanger 112. </p>
      <p>Using a composite stream, having a higher boiling temperature
        range than the boiling temperature range of the liquid working
        stream, provides one of the principle distinctions between the
        thermodynamic cycle disclosed in the present invention and
        conventionally used cycles. Unlike a conventional thermodynamic
        cycle, the cycle of the present invention withdraws part of the
        gaseous working stream, after it has been partially expanded, to
        provide heat for a composite stream comprising that withdrawn
        part of the gaseous working stream together with a lower
        temperature lean stream. This composite stream, preferably
        having a pressure that is lower than the pressure of the
        oncoming liquid working stream, is used to heat and completely
        or partially evaporate the oncoming liquid stream. </p>
      <p>Because of the higher percentage of a high-boiling component
        contained in this composite stream, the composite stream
        condenses over a range of temperatures that are higher than the
        temperatures required to evaporate the oncoming liquid working
        stream, even though the liquid working stream may enter heat
        exchanger 112 at a higher pressure than the pressure of the
        composite stream. </p>
      <p>Such a method of evaporating a liquid working stream can not be
        performed in conventional steam-power systems. In conventional
        systems, the condensation of the withdrawn stream must occur
        over a lower temperature range than the boiling temperature of
        the oncoming liquid working stream, if the withdrawn stream has
        a lower pressure than the pressure of the oncoming liquid
        working stream. Thus, heat released by condensation of a
        withdrawn stream in conventional systems can be used only for
        partial preheating of the oncoming working stream. </p>
      <p>In contrast, in the method disclosed by the present invention,
        the presence of a higher percentage of a high-boiling component
        in the composite stream allows that stream to condense over a
        higher temperature range than the boiling temperature range of
        the oncoming liquid working stream, even if the pressure of the
        composite stream is substantially lower than the pressure of the
        liquid working stream. It should be appreciated that the
        described method uses a single withdrawal stream to form a
        composite stream that acts as the heat source effecting the
        complete preheating and evaporation of the working stream and
        also provides heat for the low temperature superheating of the
        working stream. </p>
      <p>To create this composite stream, however, part of the expanded
        gaseous working stream must be withdrawn. It should be
        appreciated that withdrawing part of this superheated stream for
        combination with a lean stream to produce the composite stream
        results in thermodynamic losses because of the reduction in
        temperature of the withdrawn stream. The losses resulting from
        the removal of part of the gaseous stream and mixing that
        withdrawal stream with a lean stream are, however, more than
        compensated for by the losses that are prevented when the
        composite stream is used to evaporate the liquid working stream.
      </p>
      <p>As the calculations in Table II show, using a portion of the
        expanded gaseous working stream to create a composite stream,
        having a higher percentage of a high-boiling component than is
        contained in the liquid working stream, allows the thermodynamic
        cycle of the present invention to have a substantially increased
        efficiency compared to conventional steam-power systems. Using
        this composite stream to provide low temperature heat for the
        low temperature evaporation process allows the available heat in
        the system to be more adequately matched with the liquid working
        stream's enthalpy-temperature characteristics. This matching
        prevents the very high thermodynamic losses that occur in
        conventional systems that use high temperature heat in low
        temperature evaportion processes. The enormous amount of exergy
        saved by using this composite stream to more closely match the
        temperature of the heat source with the liquid working stream's
        enthalpy-temperature characteristics substantially exceeds any
        losses caused from removing part of the gaseous working stream
        from its superheated state. </p>
      <p>The pressure at which the withdrawal stream is mixed with the
        lean stream to produce the composite stream must be a pressure
        which insures that the temperature over which the composite
        stream condenses will be higher than the temperature over which
        the liquid working stream evaporates. The leaner the composite
        stream, the lower will be the pressure needed for condensation.
        The lower the pressure, the larger the expansion ratio of
        turbine 102, corresponding to an increase in the work that this
        turbine provides. </p>
      <p>There is a practical limit to the amount of the high boiling
        component that can be used in the composite stream. This is
        because a leaner composite stream is more difficult to separate.
        Thus, to optimize the system's efficiency, the choice of
        pressure and composition for the composite stream must be
        carefully made. Table I provides one example of a composite
        stream pressure and composition that may be used to provide a
        highly efficient cycle. </p>
      <p>It should be appreciated that heat exchanger 127, wherein the
        spent stream is used to evaporate part of the liquid working
        stream, may be removed from system 100 without departing from
        the scope of the described general inventive concept. The
        portion of the liquid working stream that had passed through
        heat exchanger 127 would then be diverted to heat exchanger 112,
        where it would be evaporated. </p>
      <p>After passing through heat exchanger 112, the composite stream
        is sent into heat exchanger 114 to provide heat for preheating
        the lean stream and the liquid working stream. As the composite
        stream transfers heat to the lean stream and the liquid working
        stream, the composite stream is further cooled. Again, although
        limiting the number of heat exchangers in this part of system
        100 to heat exchangers 112 and 114 is preferred, additional heat
        exchangers may be added or heat exchanger 114 may be removed
        from the system 100 without departing from the scope of the
        disclosed invention. </p>
      <p>After the composite stream exits from heat exchanger 114, it is
        sent into heat exchanger 117, where its heat is used to
        partially evaporate a countercurrent portion of that same
        composite stream that flows from separator 135. </p>
      <p>Even after exiting heat exchanger 117, the pressure of the
        composite stream at point 53, in this embodiment of the present
        invention, remains relatively high. Since the composite stream
        may not be able to produce the working stream and lean stream at
        this high pressure, this pressure may have to be reduced. This
        reduction in pressure occurs in the hydraulic turbine 119. A
        particular hydraulic turbine that may be used in a Pelton wheel.
      </p>
      <p>During this pressure reduction step, all or part of the work
        needed to pump the lean solution at pump 122 may be recovered.
        Because the weight flow rate of the stream passing through
        Pelton wheel 119 is higher than the weight flow rate of the lean
        stream passing through pump 122, the energy released in Pelton
        wheel 119 is usually sufficient to provide the work of pump 122.
        If the energy that Pelton wheel 119 releases is insufficient, a
        supplementary electrical motor can be installed to supply the
        additional power that pump 122 requires. </p>
      <p>A throttle valve may be used as an alternative to hydraulic
        turbine 119. If a throttle valve is used instead of the
        hydraulic turbine, work spent to pump the lean solution will, of
        course, not be recovered. Regardless of whether hydraulic
        turbine 119 or a throttle valve is used, however, the remainder
        of the process will not be affected. The choice of whether to
        use a hydraulic turbine or a throttle valve to reduce the
        pressure of the composite stream is strictly an economic one.
        Further, although the use of heat exchanger 117 and turbine 119
        is preferred, one may decide not to use these devices, or may
        decide to add additional heat exchangers or other pressure
        reduction apparatus to the system 100. </p>
      <p>The composite stream flowing from hydraulic turbine 119
        preferably has a pressure at point 56 that is approximately
        equal to or slightly greater than the pressure of condensation.
        A portion of this composite stream, having this reduced
        pressure, is separated from the composite stream at separator
        137. This stream is again divided at separator 136. A first
        portion of the composite stream separated at separator 136 is
        then split into two streams at separator 135. These two streams
        are then sent into heat exchangers 117 and 118, where the
        counterstream of the same composite stream is cooled and the
        returning spent stream is condensed, partially evaporating these
        two streams. The countercurrent composite stream adds heat in
        heat exchanger 117 and the condensing spent stream adds heat in
        heat exchanger 118. After exiting exchangers 117 and 118, the
        two streams flowing from separator 135 are combined at stream
        mixer 145. This partially evaporated stream is then sent to
        gravity separator 120. </p>
      <p>The state of the stream entering gravity separator 120 is that
        of a vapor-liquid mixture. In order to provide heat for this
        partial evaporation, the spent stream, which had been condensed
        in heat exchanger 118, must have a pressure which will enable
        the spent stream to be condensed at an average temperature which
        is higher than the average temperature needed to evaporate the
        portion of the composite stream that is to be separated. The
        leaner the composite stream, the higher the temperature
        necessary for its evaporation, and thus the higher the pressure
        of the spent stream at point 37. Increasing the pressure at
        point 37 reduces the expansion ratio in turbines 104 and 106
        and, as a result, reduces the work output of these turbines.
        This shows that, although making the composite stream leaner
        increases the power output of turbine 102, it reduces the power
        output of turbines 104 and 106. </p>
      <p>To maximize the total output of all three turbines, an
        appropriate composition must be selected for the composite
        stream. One such composition is provided in Table I. </p>
      <p>The embodiment shown in FIG. 1 uses the returned spent stream
        to preheat the liquid working stream and to partially evaporate
        the stream sent to gravity separator 120. At the same time, the
        spent stream is condensed as it passes through heat exchanger
        118. It should be noted that, instead of condensing the spent
        stream in condenser 121, without simultaneously recovering heat
        from that condensing stream, system 100 uses the heat that the
        spent stream releases as it is being condensed in heat exchanger
        118 to preheat the liquid working stream and partially evaporate
        the composite stream sent to separator 120. </p>
      <p>Gravity separator 120 separates the first portion of the
        composite stream into a vapor stream and a liquid stream. The
        liquid stream flowing from the bottom of gravity separator 120
        forms a portion of the lean stream that is mixed with the
        previously described withdrawal stream at mixer 141. </p>
      <p>The vapor stream flowing from gravity separator 120 is sent to
        the bottom of scrubber 125. A second portion of the composite
        stream, flowing from separator 136, is sent into the top of
        scrubber 125. The liquid and vapor streams fed into scrubber 125
        interact, providing heat and mass exchange. A direct contact
        heat exchanger or other means for effecting heat and mass
        exchange between the liquid and vapor streams, shown fed into
        scrubber 125 in FIG. 1, may be used in place of scrubber 125.
        Whether scrubber 125, a heat exchanger, or some other means is
        used in system 100 is a matter of design choice. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, liquid and vapor streams
        exit scrubber 125. The liquid stream is combined with the liquid
        stream flowing from separator 120 at stream mixer 144 to form
        the lean stream that is mixed with the withdrawal stream at
        stream mixer 141 to produce the composite stream. The liquid
        streams flowing from scrubber 125 and separator 120 to form the
        lean stream preferably have the same, or nearly the same,
        composition. </p>
      <p>The lean stream flows from stream mixer 144 into circulation
        pump 122. Pump 122 pumps the lean stream to a high pressure. In
        the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the pressure of the lean stream
        at point 70, as it flows from pump 122, is higher than the
        pressure of the lean stream at point 74, as it flows from heat
        exchanger 112, as is shown in Table I. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, this high pressure lean stream passes
        through heat exchangers 114 and 112, where the countercurrent
        composite stream provides heat to the lean stream, and combines
        with the withdrawal stream at stream mixer 141. </p>
      <p>The vapor stream exiting scrubber 125 is a stream having a high
        percentage of the lower boiling component. This super rich
        stream combines with a third portion of the composite stream,
        i.e., that portion flowing from separator 137, at stream mixer
        146. This stream forms a pre-condensed working stream which
        flows through heat exchanger 128 and into condenser 121. While
        passing through heat exchanger 128, this pre-condensed working
        stream is further condensed while adding heat to the
        countercurrent liquid working stream flowing from condenser 121
        and pump 123. After exiting heat exchanger 128, the
        pre-condensed working stream enters condenser 121, where it is
        fully condensed. </p>
      <p>This pre-condensed working stream has the same composition as
        the above described withdrawal stream. It should be noted that
        only this pre-condensed working stream is condensed, minimizing
        the exergy losses at the condenser. As described above, the
        spent stream does not pass through the condenser. Instead, the
        heat released from the condensation of the spent stream is used
        to preheat the liquid working stream and to partially evaporate
        the composite stream sent to separator 120. The use of the spent
        stream in this manner ensures that the liquid working stream
        sent to heat exchangers 112 and 127 will be completely
        evaporated in a recuperative way, ensuring that system 100 will
        have a greater efficiency than the best conventional Rankine
        cycles. </p>
      <p>Condenser 121 is preferably a water-cooled condenser. When such
        a condenser is used, a stream of cooling water flowing through
        condenser 121 completely condenses this working stream to
        produce the liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>This liquid working stream flows into feed pump 123, where it
        is pumped to an increased pressure. This liquid working stream
        then flows into heat exchanger 128, where heat transferred from
        the pre-condensed working stream preheats the liquid working
        stream. After being preheated in heat exchanger 128, the liquid
        working stream is combined with the spent stream at stream mixer
        147. This mixed stream is pumped to an intermediate pressure by
        pump 138. It then passes through heat exchanger 118, where it is
        preheated by heat transferred by the condensing returning spent
        stream. After exiting heat exchanger 118, the liquid working
        stream is pumped to a high pressure by pump 139. This high
        pressure, preferably subcooled, liquid working stream is then
        separated at separator 134 into two streams. One of the streams
        passes through heat exchanger 114, where heat transferred from
        the composite stream preheats this portion of the liquid working
        stream. The other stream flowing from separator 134 flows into
        exchanger 116, where heat from the returning spent stream is
        transferred to this portion of the liquid working stream,
        preheating this portion of the liquid working stream. The spent
        stream as it exits from exchanger 116 is preferably in the state
        of a saturated vapor, but alternatively may be in the state of a
        superheated vapor or may be partially condensed. </p>
      <p>The portion of the liquid working stream passing through heat
        exchanger 116 is combined with the stream flowing from heat
        exchanger 114 at stream mixer 143. This stream is preferably in
        a state of a saturated, or slightly subcooled, liquid. The
        stream flowing from stream mixer 143 then is separated into two
        streams at separator 133. One stream flows into heat exchanger
        112. The liquid working stream passing through heat exchanger
        112 is evaporated with heat transferred from the composite
        stream flowing from stream mixer 141. </p>
      <p>The other stream flowing from separator 133 then flows into
        heat exchanger 127, where it is evaporated with heat transferred
        from the spent stream. </p>
      <p>The streams exiting heat exchangers 112 and 127 are combined at
        stream mixer 142. As described above, heat exchanger 127 could
        be removed, with all of the liquid working stream flowing from
        stream mixer 143 diverted to heat exchanger 112, without
        departing from the described general inventive concept. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the stream flowing from stream mixer 142 is
        in the vapor state and makes up the cycle's gaseous working
        stream. The gaseous working stream flowing from stream mixer
        142, which might even be slightly superheated, is divided into
        two streams at stream separator 132. One of these streams passes
        through heat exchanger 109, where it is superheated by the
        withdrawal stream passing from stream separator 131 through heat
        exchanger 109 to stream mixer 141. The other portion of the
        gaseous working stream passes through heat exchanger 110, where
        heat from the spent stream flowing from turbine 106 is used to
        superheat this portion of the gaseous working stream. The two
        streams flowing from stream separator 132 and through heat
        exchangers 109 and 110 are recombined at stream mixer 140. This
        recombined gaseous working stream flows into heater 101 to
        complete this thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of system 200, shown in FIG. 2, the process
        of absorption, i.e., of adding the lean stream to the withdrawal
        stream to make the composite stream, is performed in two steps.
        The withdrawal stream is divided into first and second
        withdrawal streams at stream separator 150. The first withdrawal
        stream is combined with the lean stream at stream mixer 141,
        producing a first composite stream, which is leaner than it
        would be if the withdrawal stream with parameters as at point 42
        was combined with the lean stream (as was done in the embodiment
        shown in FIG. 1). </p>
      <p>Because the first composite stream in FIG. 2 is now leaner than
        the composite stream of FIG. 1, its pressure can be reduced,
        which will increase the work output from turbine 102. The first
        composite stream is then condensed in boiler 112. Thereafter,
        the first composite stream is combined with the second
        withdrawal stream at mixer 151, creating a second composite
        stream. The second composite stream is richer than the first
        composite stream. As a result, it is easier to provide for its
        separation. </p>
      <p>The first composite stream provides heat for boiler 112, and
        enables the pressure of absorption to be reduced thus increasing
        the output of turbine 102. At the same time, the embodiment in
        FIG. 2 enables an enriched second composite stream to be sent
        into separator 120. This FIG. 2 embodiment thus provides the
        benefits of a lower pressure composite stream which does not at
        the same time prevent the composite stream from being easily
        separated. </p>
      <p>Both the cycle shown in FIG. 1 and the cycle shown in FIG. 2
        are substantially more efficient than conventional steam-power
        systems. The decision to use one of these preferred systems
        instead of the other is a matter of design choice. </p>
      <p>In the above described thermodynamic cycles of the present
        invention, all of the heating and evaporating of the liquid
        working stream may be provided in a recuperative way, i.e., the
        returning composite and spent streams transfer heat to the
        liquid working stream as these two streams cool. Further, even
        part of the superheating of the gaseous working stream may be
        provided in this recuperative manner, i.e., the withdrawal
        stream and spent stream may transfer heat to the gaseous working
        stream as these two streams cool. </p>
      <p>Use of a withdrawal stream to preheat an oncoming working
        stream is common in conventional steam-power systems. Such a
        practice is commonly known as "feed water heating". Feedwater
        heating is conventional systems is useful only for preheating
        the incoming liquid working stream, because the pressure and
        temperature of condensation of the withdrawal stream is too low
        for it to </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for
        transforming energy from a heat source into a useable form using
        a working fluid that is expanded and regenerated. This invention
        further relates to a method and apparatus for improving the heat
        utilization efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>2. Brief Description of the Background Art </p>
      <p>In the Rankine cycle, a working fluid such as water, ammonia or
        freon is evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available heat
        source. The evaporated gaseous working fluid is expanded across
        a turbine to transform its energy into useable form. The spent
        gaseous working fluid is then condensed in a condenser using an
        available cooling medium. The pressure of the condensed working
        medium is increased by pumping, followed by evaporation and so
        on to continue the cycle. </p>
      <p>The Exergy cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,561,
        utilizes a binary or multi-component working fluid. This cycle
        operates generally on the principle that a binary working fluid
        is pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure and is heated
        to partially vaporize the working fluid. The fluid is then
        flashed to separate high and low boiling working fluids. The low
        boiling component is expanded through a turbine, to drive the
        turbine, while the high boiling component has heat recovered for
        use in heating the binary working fluid prior to evaporation.
        The high boiling component is then mixed with the spent low
        boiling working fluid to absorb the spent working fluid in a
        condenser in the presence of a cooling medium. </p>
      <p>A theoretical comparison of the conventional Rankine cycle and
        the Exergy cycle demonstrates the improved efficiency of the new
        cycle over the Rankine cycle when an available, relatively low
        temperature heat source such as ocean water, geothermal energy
        or the like is employed. </p>
      <p>In applicant's further invention referred to as the Basic
        Kalina cycle, the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563, relatively
        lower temperature available heat is utilized to effect partial
        distillation of at least a portion of a multi-component fluid
        stream at an intermediate pressure to generate working fluid
        fractions of different compositions. The fractions are used to
        produce at least one main rich solution which is relatively
        enriched with respect to the lower boiling component, and to
        produce one lean solution which is relatively impoverished with
        respect to the lower boiling component. The pressure of the main
        rich solution is increased; thereafter, it is evaporated to
        produce a charged gaseous main working fluid. The main working
        fluid is expanded to a low pressure level to convert energy to
        useable form. The spent low pressure level working fluid is
        condensed in a main absorption stage by dissolving with cooling
        in the lean solution to regenerate an initial working fluid for
        reuse. </p>
      <p>In any process of converting thermal energy to a useable form,
        a major loss of available energy in the heat source occurs in
        the process of boiling or evaporating the working fluid. This
        loss of available energy (known as exergy or essergy) is due to
        the mismatch of the enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the
        heat source and the working fluid in the boiler. Simply put, for
        any given enthalpy the temperature of the heat source is always
        greater than the temperature of the working fluid. Ideally, this
        temperature difference would be almost, but not quite, zero.
        This mismatch occurs both in the classical Rankine cycle, using
        a pure substance as a working fluid, as well as in the Kalina
        and Exergy cycles described above, using a mixture as a working
        fluid. The use of a mixture as a working fluid in the manner of
        the Kalina and Exergy cycles reduces these losses to a
        significant extent. However, it would be highly desireable to
        further reduce these losses in any cycle. </p>
      <p>In the conventional Rankine cycle the losses arising from
        mismatching of the enthalpy-temperature characteristics of the
        heat source and the working fluid constitute about 25% of the
        available energy. With a cycle such as that described in U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,489,563, the loss of exergy in the boiler due to
        enthalpy-temperature characteristics mismatching would
        constitute about 14% of all of the available exergy. </p>
      <p>The overall boiling process in a thermodynamic cycle can be
        viewed for discussion purposes as consisting of three distinct
        parts: preheating, evaporation and superheating. The quantity of
        heat in the temperature range suitable for superheating is
        generally much greater than necessary, or the quantity of heat
        in the temperature range suitable for evaporation is much
        smaller than necessary. A portion of the high temperature heat
        which would be suitable for high temperature superheating is
        used for evaporation in conventional processes. This causes very
        large temperature differences between the two streams, and as a
        result, irreversible losses of exergy. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another invention of the applicant, the
        subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,867, a fluid may be diverted to a
        reheater after initial expansion in the turbine to increase the
        temperature available for superheating. After return to the
        turbine, and additional expansion, the fluid is withdrawn from
        the turbine and cooled in an intercooler. Afterwards, the fluid
        is returned to the turbine for additional expansion. The cooling
        of the turbine gas may provide additional heat for evaporation.
        Intercooling provides compensation for the heat used in
        reheating and may provide recuperation of heat available which
        would otherwise remain unused following final turbine expansion.
      </p>
      <p>In the past preheating of a working fluid is usually performed
        by extraction of part of the working fluid stream between
        turbine stages. This is followed by injection of the extracted
        stream or streams into the stream of feed water to the turbine.
        As a result heat of a lower temperature level may perform
        preheating, which occurs at relatively low temperature levels.
        Therefore, in general, this process increases the efficiency of
        the power plant. </p>
      <p>However, conventional preheating has a drawback, because the
        steam used for preheating has a temperature which is
        significantly higher than the temperature of the feed water into
        which it is injected. This steam may even have a temperature
        which is higher than the temperature of the feed water obtained
        after injection. This creates irreversibilities and lowers the
        potential efficiency of the power plant. </p>
      <p>It would be highly desirable to provide a process and apparatus
        which avoids the creation of these irreversibilities and thereby
        increases the efficiency of the power plant. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is one feature of the present invention to provide a
        significant improvement in the efficiency of a thermodynamic
        cycle by permitting closer matching of the working fluid and
        heat source enthalpy-temperature characteristics during
        preheating. It is also a feature of the present invention to
        provide a system of preheating which decreases the
        irreversibilities and therefore increases the efficiency of the
        entire system. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a
        method of implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes the step
        of expanding a gaseous working fluid to transform its energy
        into useable form. The expanded gaseous working fluid is then
        split into two streams. The first stream is expanded to a spent
        low pressure level to transform its energy into usable form. The
        first stream is then condensed. The first and second streams are
        mixed to form a mixed stream after the second stream is used to
        preheat at least a portion of the mixed stream. Then the working
        fluid stream is evaporated to form the gaseous working fluid. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,
        an apparatus for implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes a
        first turbine having a fluid inlet path and a fluid outlet path.
        The fluid outlet path is split into first and second lines. A
        second turbine is connected for fluid communication with the
        first line. A heat exchanger is connected for fluid
        communication with the second line and the first turbine. A
        condensing system has its output connected for fluid
        communication with the second turbine. A mixing chamber is
        connected for fluid communication with the output of the
        condensing system. The heat exchanger is arranged to transfer
        heat from fluid flowing from the first turbine to the mixing
        chamber to fluid flowing from the mixing chamber to the first
        turbine. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawing wherein like reference characters are
        utilized for like parts throughout the several views, a system
        100, shown in FIG. 1, implements a thermodynamic cycle, in
        accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The
        illustrated system 100 includes a series of three turbines 102,
        104 and 106, a condensing subsystem 108, and heat exchangers
        110-124. </p>
      <p>The condensing subsystem 108 may be any type of known heat
        rejection device. In the Rankine cycle, heat rejection occurs in
        a simple heat exchanger and thus for Rankine applications, the
        subsystem 108 may take the form of a heat exchanger or
        condenser. In the Kalina cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563 to Kalina, the heat rejection system requires that gas
        leaving the turbine be mixed with a multi-component fluid
        stream, for example, comprised of water and ammonia, condensed
        and then distilled to produce the original state of the working
        fluid. Thus, when the present invention is used with a Kalina
        cycle, the distillation subsystem described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563 may be utilized as a system 108. U.S. Pat. No.
        4,489,563 is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.
      </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. For example, heat sources with temperatures as
        high as, say 1000.degree. F. or more, down to the low heat
        sources such as those obtained from ocean thermal gradients may
        be utilized. Heat sources such as for example, low grade primary
        fuel, waste heat, geothermal heat, solar heat or ocean thermal
        energy conversion systems may also be implemented with the
        present invention. However, the present invention is
        particularly suitable for use with heat produced by the burning
        of fuel in a fluidized bed or by the burning of municipal wastes
        or other low grade fuel. Normally in the burning of such fuel,
        to avoid corrosion, the combustion gases cannot be cooled below
        a temperature of 300.degree. to 400.degree. F. </p>
      <p>A variety of working fluids may be used in conjunction with the
        system 100 depending on the kind of condensing subsystem 108
        utilized. In conjunction with a condensing system 108 described
        in the U.S. patent incorporated by reference herein, any
        multi-component working fluid that comprises a lower boiling
        point fluid and a relatively higher boiling point fluid may be
        utilized. Thus, for example, the working fluid employed may be
        an ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons or the like. In
        general, the fluid may be mixtures of any number of compounds
        with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility.
        However, when implementing the conventional Rankine cycle,
        conventional single component working fluids such as water,
        ammonia, or freon may be utilized. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a completely condensed working fluid which
        has been slightly preheated and pumped to a high pressure, exits
        the condensing subsystem 108 and is combined with a returning
        stream from the pump 126. The fluid exiting the pump 126 is at a
        temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate relatively close to
        that of the fluid exiting the condensing subsystem 108. In an
        illustrative embodiment the pressure of the two streams are
        substantially the same before they are mixed. After the two
        streams from the subsystem 108 and the pump 126 are combined at
        point 128, the working fluid is divided into two streams 130 and
        132. The stream 132 is heated in the heat exchanger 122 in
        counterflow with the fluid in the line 134 returning from the
        turbine 102. The flow along the path 130 is heated by
        counterflow in the heat exchanger 124 with the returning stream
        from the turbine 106. </p>
      <p>The returning stream along the path 134 that exits from the
        turbine 102 is a medium pressure stream relative to the
        returning streams from the turbine 106. The medium pressure
        returning stream from the turbine 102 is pumped by the pump 126
        as described previously. In the heat exchanger 122, the
        returning medium pressure stream is condensed, releasing heat of
        condensation, which heats the stream 132. </p>
      <p>The returning stream from the turbine 106, progressing along
        the line 136, is at a lower pressure than the stream from the
        turbine 102 which progresses along line 134. This returning
        stream 136 gives up heat in heat exchanger 124 to heat the fluid
        flow along the path 130 as described previously. </p>
      <p>At point 138, the streams progressing along the paths 130 and
        132 are combined and then divided into three streams which pass
        through heat exchangers 116, 118 and 120 respectively. The
        stream passing through line 140 is heated by the return stream
        in the line 136 which exited from the turbine 106. The fluid
        stream progressing along line 142 is heated by the medium
        pressure returning stream in line 134 which exits from turbine
        102. Finally, the fluid flow through the line 144 is heated by
        an external heat source in the heat exchanger 116. As a result
        of the processes occuring in the heat exchangers 116, 118 and
        120, each of the exiting flows along the lines 144, 142 and 140
        is evaporated and slightly superheated. </p>
      <p>Each of these slightly superheated streams are combined and
        pass through a heat exchanger 110 with heating by an external
        heat source. The flow exiting from the heat exchanger 110 is
        sent into the high pressure turbine 102 where it is expanded to
        a medium pressure to produce work. </p>
      <p>The flow exiting from the turbine 102 is divided into two
        streams. One stream progresses along the path 134 and the other
        stream progresses along the path 146. The fluid flow through the
        path 134 is cooled and condensed, as described previously, to
        provide heat for preheating. </p>
      <p>The stream progressing along the path 146 is reheated in heat
        exchanger 112 and is then expanded in the intermediate pressure
        turbine 104 to produce work. Thereafter, the stream is reheated
        in the heat exchanger 114 by an external heat source and then
        expanded in the low pressure turbine 106 to produce work. The
        flow exiting from the turbine 106 is a relatively low pressure
        returning stream. This stream progresses along the path 136 to
        be cooled in the heat exchanger 120, providing heat for the
        stream 140 as described previously. Ultimately the stream passes
        to the subsystem 108. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been described with two stage
        cooling of the stream progressing along the path 134 and two
        stage heating of the turbine 102 feed water, those skilled in
        the art will appreciate that the present invention can be
        implemented with single, double, triple or multiple stage
        heating of the feed water and cooling of the flow through the
        path 134. </p>
      <p>A Kalina cycle condensing subsystem 108', shown in FIG. 2, is
        advantageously used as a subsystem 108 in the system shown in
        FIG. 1. In order to condense the working fluid stream, a
        distillation-condensation subsystem is employed when the
        pressure of the incoming stream to the system 108 is
        substantially lower than the pressure necessary to provide
        condensation of the returning low pressure stream at normal
        ambient temperatures. </p>
      <p>The stream from the path 136 is sent into a heat exchanger 200
        where it is cooled and partially condensed, releasing heat.
        Thereafter the stream passes through the heat exchanger 210,
        where it is further cooled and condensed. The stream is then
        mixed with a stream of lean solution at the point 212. As will
        become apparent subsequently, the lean solution is a solution
        which contains a higher proportion of a higher boiling
        temperature component than the stream exiting from the heat
        exchanger 210. The new stream, called the basic solution, has an
        increased content of the higher boiling component in comparison
        with the returning low pressure stream and for this reason can
        be completely condensed by a cooling source such as water. After
        complete condensation in the condenser 214, the basic solution
        is pumped by a pump 216. The basic solution is then sent into
        the heat exchanger 210 where it is heated by the returning
        streams from the heat exchangers 200 and 218. </p>
      <p>Usually the temperature of the flow heading from the heat
        exchanger 210 toward the heat exchanger 218 is slightly below
        the boiling temperature of the fluid. The stream is divided into
        three separate paths 220, 222 and 224. The fluid progressing
        along the path 222 is sent into the heat exchanger 200 where it
        is partially heated and partially evaporated. The stream
        progressing along the path 220 is sent into the heat exchanger
        218. Thereafter, the streams 220 and 222 are recombined to form
        the stream 226. </p>
      <p>The stream 226, a vapor-liquid mixture, passes through a
        gravity separator 228 where it is separated into lean stream 232
        and rich stream 230. Both streams 230 and 232 are sent through
        the heat exchanger 218 counterflow to the stream 220. The rich
        stream 230 is enriched with the light (lower temperature
        boiling) component and is cooled and partially condensed in the
        heat exchanger 218. </p>
      <p>The partially condensed rich stream is combined with the flow
        from the path 224 producing a working solution composition. The
        working solution composition passes through heat exchanger 234
        where it is further cooled and condensed. From here it is
        finally sent into the condenser 214 where it is fully condensed
        by a cooling source. </p>
      <p>The condensate is pumped by a pump 236 to an intermediate
        pressure. Thereafter, it is sent counterflow through heat
        exchanger 234 where it is preheated. After preheating the stream
        is finally pumped to a high pressure by the pump 238 where it
        exits from the subsystem 108'. </p>
      <p>Returning now to the lean stream, which is enriched with the
        heavier (higher temperature boiling) component, exiting from the
        gravity separator 228 along the line 232, the lean stream is
        cooled in the heat exchanger 218. Then it is further cooled in
        the heat exchanger 210 providing heat for the output flow from
        the pump 216. Thereafter, the stream progressing along the path
        232 is throttled by the throttle valve 240 and is mixed at 212
        as described previously. </p>
      <p>The parameters of flow at the various points indicated in FIGS.
        1 and 2 are design variables that can be chosen in a way to
        obtain the maximum advantage from the system 100. One skilled in
        the art will be able to select the design variables to maximize
        performance under the various conditions and circumstances that
        may be encountered, while achieving a heat balance. The
        parameters of the various process points, shown in FIG. 1, are
        subject to considerable variation depending on specific
        circumstances. </p>
      <p>In order to further illustrate the advantages that can be
        obtained by the present invention, a set of calculations were
        performed. In these calculations, an illustrative power cycle in
        accordance with the system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 was selected
        wherein the working fluid was a water-ammonia mixture. The
        parameters for the theoretical calculations (assumed ambient
        temperature 60 F.) which were performed utilized standard
        ammonia-water enthalpy-concentration diagrams. In the following
        table the points set forth in the first column correspond to the
        points in FIGS. 1 and 2. The column headed by the letter "G"
        shows the weight of the fluid at each point in proportion to the
        weight of fluid at the point 38. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A method and apparatus for implementing a
        thermodynamic cycle, which includes the use of a composite
        stream, having a higher content of a high-boiling component than
        a working stream, to provide heat needed to partially evaporate
        the working stream. After being partially evaporated, the
        working stream is evaporated completely with heat provided by
        returning gaseous working streams and heat from an auxiliary
        steam cycle. After being superheated, the working stream is
        expanded in a turbine. Thereafter, the expanded stream is
        separated into a spent stream and a withdrawal stream. The
        withdrawal stream is combined with a lean stream to produce the
        composite stream. The composite stream partially evaporates the
        working stream and preheats the working stream and the lean
        stream. A first portion of the composite stream is fed into a
        distillation tower. A liquid stream flowing from the
        distillation tower forms the lean stream that is combined with
        the withdrawal stream. A vapor stream flowing from the
        distillation tower combines with a second portion of the
        composite stream to produce a pre-condensed working stream that
        is condensed forming a liquid working stream. The cycle is
        complete when the liquid working stream is preheated prior to
        being partially evaporated. </p>

    <blockquote>This invention relates generally to methods and
      apparatus for transforming thermal energy from a heat source into
      mechanical and then electrical form using a working fluid that is
      expanded and regenerated. This invention further relates to a

    <blockquote>2. Brief Description of the Background Art</blockquote>
    <blockquote> U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,005 describes a thermodynamic cycle
      that includes a working fluid that is a mixture of at least two
      components. As described in that patent, such a multi-component
      working fluid may enable a large percentage of recuperative heat
      exchange to be achieved, including recuperative preheating,
      recuperative boiling and partial recuperative superheating. Such
      recuperative boiling, although apparently impossible in a single
      component system, may be possible in the multi-component working
      fluid cycle described in that patent. That cycle provides lower
      temperature heat for evaporation, which may substantially reduce
      thermodynamic losses resulting from evaporation. Reducing those
      losses can substantially increase the efficiency of the system.
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,005 is expressly incorporated by reference
      herein. &nbsp; <br>
      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the system of the present invention,
      heat from an external heat source is used to complete the
      evaporation of a multicomponent working stream that has been
      partially evaporated by heat transferred from a counterstream of a
      composite stream that includes a higher percentage of a high
      boiling component than is contained in the working stream. In
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method
      of implementing a thermodynamic cycle includes the step of
      expanding a gaseous working stream to transform its energy into a
      usable form. The expanded gaseous working stream is divided into a
      withdrawal stream and a spent stream. After dividing the expanded
      stream into the two streams, the withdrawal stream is combined
      with a lean stream, having a higher content of a high-boiling
      component than is contained in the withdrawal stream, to form a
      composite stream that condenses over a temperature range that is
      higher than the temperature range required to evaporate an
      oncoming liquid working stream. After forming the composite
      stream, that stream is transported to a boiler where it is
      condensed to provide heat for the partial evaporation of the
      oncoming liquid working stream. An external heat source is used to
      completely evaporate the liquid working stream. Evaporation of the
      liquid working stream produces the above mentioned gaseous working
      stream. Subsequently, the composite stream is separated to form a
      liquid stream and a vapor stream. Some or all of the liquid stream
      forms the above mentioned lean stream. The vapor stream is
      returned into the cycle, preferably by being combined with a
      portion of the composite stream to produce a pre-condensed working
      stream. The pre-condensed working stream is condensed to produce
      the liquid working stream that is transported to the boiler. The
      spent stream may be combined with the composite stream.
      Alternatively, the spent stream may be returned to the system at
      some other location. To complete the cycle, the heat that the
      above mentioned composite stream and external heat source
      transport to the boiler, is used to evaporate the liquid working
      stream to form the gaseous working stream. In accordance with
      another embodiment of the present invention, the gaseous working
      stream, exiting from the boiler, may then be superheated in one or
      more heat exchangers by either the withdrawal stream or the spent
      stream or by both the withdrawal and spent streams. The external
      heat source may also be used to superheat the gaseous working
      stream. Following the superheating of the gaseous working stream
      in the heat exchangers, the gaseous working stream may be further
      superheated in a heater. The energy supplied to the heater is
      supplied from outside the thermodynamic cycle. After this
      superheating, expansion of the gaseous working stream takes place.
      This expanded gaseous working stream may be reheated and expanded
      one or more times before being divided into the spent and
      withdrawal streams. This embodiment may further include the step
      of reheating and expanding the spent stream one or more times
      after the spent stream has been separated from the withdrawal
      stream. In addition, this embodiment may further include a series
      of recuperative heat exchangers used to recuperate heat from the
      withdrawal, composite, and spent streams. These heat exchangers
      may allow the lean stream and the liquid working stream to absorb
      heat from the composite stream. Further, one or more of these heat
      exchangers may allow the spent and withdrawal streams to provide
      additional heat to the liquid working stream to aid in the
      evaporation of the liquid working stream.
      <p>In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
        invention, the methods for implementing a thermodynamic cycle
        described above may further include the step of reducing the
        pressure of the composite stream with a hydraulic turbine (or
        alternatively a throttle valve). After this reduction of
        pressure, a first portion of this composite stream may be sent
        to a separator where it is separated into a vapor stream and a
        liquid stream. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the liquid stream may form all or a portion
        of the lean stream which may be sent to a circulation pump to be
        pumped to a higher pressure. The circulation pump may be
        connected to the hydraulic turbine; the hydraulic turbine
        releasing energy used to operate the pump. After attaining this
        high pressure, the lean stream may be heated by the returning
        composite and spent streams in one or more heat exchangers.
        After acquiring this additional heat, the lean stream is
        combined with the withdrawal stream to form the composite stream
        used to preheat and partially evaporate the liquid working
        stream. </p>
      <p>The vapor stream may be combined with a second portion of the
        composite stream, that flows from the hydraulic turbine, to form
        a pre-condensed working stream. This stream may then pass
        through a heat exchanger, to supply heat to the returning liquid
        working stream, before it is fed into a water-cooled condenser
        to be fully condensed to produce the liquid working stream. </p>
      <p>The liquid working stream may be pumped to a high pressure by a
        feed pump. After obtaining this high pressure, the liquid
        working stream may be heated in a series of heat exchangers by
        the pre-condensed working stream and the returning composite
        stream. This heat exchange continues until the liquid working
        stream is partially evaporated. In this embodiment, the
        partially evaporated working stream may be completely evaporated
        by heat from the external heat source and from the returning
        withdrawal and spent streams to produce the gaseous working
        stream, thereby completing the cycle. </p>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> is a schematic representation of one embodiment
        of the method and apparatus of the present invention. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of preferred
        apparatus that may be used in the above described cycle.
        Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 200 that includes a boiler
        in the form of heat exchangers 212, 250, 251, and 252, a
        preheater in the form of heat exchangers 214, 216, and 227, and
        a superheater in the form of heat exchangers 209, 210, and 253.
        In addition, the system 200 includes turbines 202, 204, 206, and
        255, superheaters 201 and 218, reheaters 203 and 205, gravity
        separator 220, distillation tower 225, hydraulic turbine 219,
        pumps 222, 223, and 239, heat exchangers 217 and 228, boiler
        254, throttle valve 256, and condenser 221. Further, the system
        200 includes stream separators 231-237 and 257-259 and stream
        mixers 240-249. </p>
      <p>The condenser 221 may be any type of known heat rejection
        device. For example, the condenser 221 may take the form of a
        heat exchanger, such as a water cooled system, or another type
        of condensing device. In the alternative, condenser 221 may be
        replaced with the heat rejection system described in U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867 to Kalina. The Kalina system
        requires that the stream shown approaching condenser 221 in FIG.
        1 be mixed with a multi-component fluid stream, for example, a
        fluid stream comprised of water and ammonia, condensed and then
        distilled to produce the original state of the working fluid.
        Thus, when the heat rejection system of the Kalina cycle is used
        in place of condenser 221, the distillation subsystem described
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867 may be utilized in
        place of condenser 221. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,563 and 4,604,867
        are expressly incorporated by reference herein. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. Thus, for example, heat sources with
        temperatures as high as 1,000 C. or more down to heat sources
        sufficient to superheat a gaseous working stream may be used to
        heat the gaseous working stream flowing through heater 201 and
        reheaters 203 and 205 and the auxiliary gaseous working stream
        flowing through heater 218, described below. Preferred heat
        sources are those generated by the combustion of fossil fuels in
        preheated air. (Combustion gases, which are cooled to a
        temperature of about 750 F., may be further used to preheat
        oncoming air, enabling heat released at a temperature near 750
        F. to be usable for that purpose). Any other heat source capable
        of superheating the gaseous working stream that is used in the
        described embodiment of the invention may also be used. </p>
      <p>The working fluid used in the system 200 may be any
        multi-component working fluid that comprises a lower boiling
        point fluid and a relatively higher boiling point fluid. Thus,
        for example, the working fluid employed may be an ammonia-water
        mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more freons, mixtures
        of hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In general, the fluid
        may be mixtures of any number of compounds with favorable
        thermodynamic characteristics and solubility. In a preferred
        embodiment, a mixture of water and ammonia is used. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a working stream circulates through system
        200. The working stream includes a gaseous working stream that
        flows from stream mixer 242 until it is separated into a
        withdrawal stream and a spent stream at separator 231. In
        addition to the gaseous working stream, the withdrawal stream
        (that flows from separator 231 to stream separator 259) and the
        spent stream (that flows from separator 231 to distillation
        tower 225) the working stream includes a first withdrawal stream
        (that flows from stream separator 259 to stream mixer 241), a
        second withdrawal stream (that flows from stream separator 259
        to stream mixer 248), a pre-condensed working stream (that flows
        from mixer 246 to condenser 221) and a liquid working stream
        (that flows from condenser 221 to boilers 212, 250, 251, and
        252). Each portion of the working stream contains the same
        percentage of high boiling and low boiling components. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the gaseous working stream with
        parameters as at point 99, that has been completely evaporated
        and superheated in previous stages of system 200, enters heater
        201. While in heater 201, the gaseous working stream is
        superheated by an external heat source to the highest
        temperature that is reached at any stage in the process
        obtaining parameters as at point 100. After being superheated,
        this gaseous working stream is expanded in high pressure turbine
        202 to an intermediate pressure, producing work, and obtaining
        parameters as at point 132. </p>
      <p>After expansion in turbine 202, the gaseous working stream is
        separated by separator 231 into two streams, a withdrawal stream
        and a spent stream, with parameters as at points 64 and 65,
        respectively. The spent stream is reheated in reheater 203,
        obtaining parameters as at point 133, and expanded in
        intermediate pressure turbine 204, producing work, and obtaining
        parameters as at point 30. The spent stream is then reheated a
        second time in heater 205 obtaining parameters as at point 31,
        and expanded a second time in low pressure turbine 206,
        obtaining parameters as at point 32. </p>
      <p>Although FIG. 1 shows the system 200 as having two reheaters
        203 and 205, for reheating the spent stream, and two turbines
        204 and 206, for expanding the spent stream, the optimum number
        of reheaters and turbines depends upon the desired efficiency of
        the system. The number of reheaters and turbines may be either
        increased or decreased from the number shown in FIG. 1. In
        addition, a single heater may be used to heat the gaseous
        working stream, prior to expansion, and the spent working
        stream, prior to the expansion of the spent stream. Therefore,
        the number of heaters and reheaters may be more than, less than,
        or equal to the number of turbines. </p>
      <p>Further, system 200 may include additional heaters and turbines
        for reheating and expanding the gaseous stream exiting from
        turbine 202 prior to that stream's separation into the
        withdrawal and spent streams. Thus, although the inclusion of
        reheaters 203 and 205 and turbines 204 and 206 to system 200
        provides a preferred embodiment of the present invention, one
        may select a different number of reheaters and turbines without
        departing from the scope of the disclosed general inventive
        concept. </p>
      <p>After the above described reheatings and expansions of the
        spent stream, the stream passes through a series of recuperative
        heat exchangers. As shown in FIG. 1, the spent stream, after
        expansion, passes through recuperative heat exchangers 253, 252,
        227 and 216. While passing through heat exchanger 253, the spent
        stream provides heat to superheat the gaseous working stream
        flowing from point 95 to point 96. The spent stream obtains
        parameters as at point 33 after it exits from heat exchanger
        253. While passing through heat exchanger 252, the spent stream
        provides heat to completely evaporate an oncoming partially
        evaporated high-pressure liquid working stream flowing from
        point 67 to point 90. The spent stream obtains parameters as at
        point 34 after it exits from heat exchanger 252. Similarly,
        while passing through heat exchangers 227 and 216, the spent
        stream provides heat to preheat a lean stream flowing from point
        25 to point 85, and from point 73 to point 75, respectively. The
        spent stream obtains parameters as at point 35, after it exits
        from heat exchanger 227, and parameters as at point 36, after it
        exits from heat exchanger 216. </p>
      <p>Whether any or all of the heat exchangers 227, 252, 253, and
        216 are used or whether a number of additional heat exchangers
        are added to the system is a matter of design choice. Although
        the inclusion of heat exchangers 252, 253, 227, and 216 to
        system 200 is preferred, the spent stream may pass through an
        increased number of heat exchangers, or not pass through any
        heat exchangers at all, without departing from the scope of the
        disclosed invention. </p>
      <p>The withdrawal stream beginning at stream separator 231
        initially passes through recuperative heat exchanger 210. While
        passing through heat exchanger 210, the withdrawal stream
        provides heat for the superheating of the oncoming high-pressure
        gaseous working stream flowing from point 94 to point 97. The
        withdrawal stream obtains parameters as at point 50 after it
        exits from heat exchanger 210. </p>
      <p>The withdrawal stream then passes through heat exchanger 251,
        where it provides heat to completely evaporate an oncoming
        partially evaporated high-pressure liquid working stream flowing
        from point 66 to point 91. The withdrawal stream obtains
        parameters as at point 51 after it exits from heat exchanger
        251. Although system 200 preferably includes heat exchangers 210
        and 251, one may remove heat exchanges 210 and 251 or add
        additional heat exchangers. </p>
      <p>After the withdrawal stream exits from heat exchanger 251, it
        is divided at stream separator 259 into a first withdrawal
        stream (that passes from stream separator 259 to stream mixer
        241) and a second withdrawal stream (that passes from stream
        separator 259 to stream mixer 248). The first and second
        withdrawal streams have parameters as at points 54 and 53,
        respectively. The temperature of the streams flowing past points
        51, 53, and 54 is higher than the temperature of the stream
        flowing past point 62. The preferred state of the streams
        flowing past points 51, 53, and 54 is that of a superheated
        vapor. </p>
      <p>The first withdrawal stream combines with a lean stream, having
        parameters as at point 78, at stream mixer 241. That lean stream
        contains the same components as are contained in the working
        stream. The lean stream, however, contains a higher content of a
        high-boiling component than is contained in any part of the
        working stream. For example, if ammonia and water are the two
        components present in the working and lean streams, the water is
        the high-boiling component and the ammonia is the low-boiling
        component. In such two component system, the lean stream
        contains a higher percentage of water than is contained in the
        working stream. As shown in FIG. 1, the lean stream flows from
        distillation tower 225 to stream mixer 241. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the state of the lean stream at point 78,
        prior to mixing with the first withdrawal stream at stream mixer
        241, is preferably that of a subcooled liquid. </p>
      <p>Mixing the lean stream with the first withdrawal stream at
        stream mixer 241 provides a composite stream having parameters
        as at point 55. That composite stream has a lower boiling
        temperature range than the lean stream but a higher boiling
        temperature range than the first withdrawal stream or any other
        portion of the working stream. The state of the composite stream
        as it flows from stream mixer 241 depends upon the states of the
        lean and first withdrawal streams. It is preferably that of a
        vapor-liquid mixture. Preferably, the pressure of the first
        withdrawal stream at point 54 and the lean stream at point 78,
        prior to mixing at stream mixer 241, will be the same as the
        pressure of the composite stream at point 55, that is formed at
        stream mixer 241. The temperature of the composite stream at
        point 55 is preferably higher than the temperature of the lean
        stream at point 78 and slightly lower than the temperature of
        the first withdrawal stream at point 54. </p>
      <p>The composite stream will contain a higher percentage of a
        high-boiling component than is contained in the withdrawal
        stream or in other portions of the working stream. Because the
        composite stream contains a higher percentage of a high-boiling
        component, it may be condensed within a temperature range which
        exceeds the boiling temperature range of the liquid working
        stream. </p>
      <p>For the composite stream to partially evaporate the liquid
        working stream flowing from point 63 to point 62, conditions for
        combining the first withdrawal stream and the lean stream at
        stream mixer 241 should be chosen so that the temperature of the
        composite stream at point 55 is higher than the temperature of
        the partially evaporated working stream at point 62. </p>
      <p>The composite stream produced by the mixing of the first
        withdrawal stream with the lean stream flows into heat exchanger
        212, where it is cooled and partially condensed. As it is being
        cooled and condensed, the composite stream provides heat to
        partially evaporate the oncoming liquid working stream flowing
        from point 63 to point 62 and to provide heat to the oncoming
        lean stream flowing from point 26 to point 86. The composite
        stream obtains parameters as at point 56 after it exits from
        heat exchanger 212. Thereafter, the composite stream is combined
        with the second withdrawal stream at stream mixer 248, creating
        a second composite stream having parameters as at point 57. The
        temperature of the composite stream at point 56 preferably is
        the same as the temperature of the second composite stream at
        point 57. </p>
      <p>The withdrawal stream with parameters as at point 51 is thus
        combined with the lean stream in two steps. First, the lean
        stream having parameters as at point 78 is combined with the
        first withdrawal stream, having parameters as at point 54, to
        form the composite stream. The second withdrawal stream is then
        combined with the composite stream to create a second composite
        stream. </p>
      <p>After being created at stream mixer 248, the second composite
        stream is sent into heat exchanger 214 to provide heat for
        preheating the lean stream flowing from point 72 to point 74 and
        the liquid working stream flowing from point 60 through point 61
        to point 63. As the second composite stream transfers heat to
        the lean stream and the liquid working stream, the second
        composite stream is completely condensed and supercooled
        obtaining parameters as at point 59. </p>
      <p>Again, although limiting the number of heat exchangers in this
        part o system 200 to heat exchangers 212 and 214 is preferred,
        additional heat exchangers may be added or heat exchanger 214
        may be removed from the system 200 without departing from the
        scope of the disclosed invention. </p>
      <p>After the second composite stream exits from heat exchanger
        214, it is divided at stream separator 235 into a third
        composite stream and a fourth composite stream having parameters
        as at points 46 and 40, respectively. The fourth composite
        stream preferably includes the bulk of the second composite
        stream. The fourth composite stream is sent into heat exchanger
        217, where its heat is used to preheat the liquid working
        stream. </p>
      <p>Even after exiting heat exchanger 217, the pressure of the
        fourth composite stream at point 41, in this embodiment of the
        present invention, remains relatively high. Accordingly, the
        pressure of the fourth composite stream is reduced by passing it
        through hydraulic turbine 219. A particularly preferred
        hydraulic turbine that may be used is a Pelton wheel. The fourth
        composite stream obtains parameters as at point 43 after it
        exits hydraulic turbine 219, which preferably correspond to a
        state of a saturated liquid. </p>
      <p>During this pressure reduction step, all or part of the work
        needed to pump the lean solution at pump 222 may be recovered.
        Because the weight flow rate of the stream passing through
        hydraulic turbine 219 is higher than the weight flow rate of the
        lean stream passing through pump 222, the energy released in
        hydraulic turbine 219 should usually be sufficient to provide
        the work of pump 222. If the energy that hydraulic turbine 219
        releases is insufficient, a supplementary electrical motor can
        be installed to supply the additional power that pump 222
        requires. </p>
      <p>A throttle valve may be used as an alternative to hydraulic
        turbine 219. If a throttle valve is used instead of the
        hydraulic turbine, work spent to pump the lean solution will, of
        course, not be recovered. Regardless of whether hydraulic
        turbine 219 or a throttle valve is used, however, the remainder
        of the process will not be affected. The choice of whether to
        use a hydraulic turbine or a throttle valve to reduce the
        pressure of the fourth composite stream is strictly an economic
        one. Further, although the use of heat exchanger 217 and turbine
        219 is preferred, one may decide not to use these devices, or
        may decide to add additional heat exchangers or other pressure
        reduction apparatus to the system 200. </p>
      <p>After exiting from hydraulic turbine 219, the fourth composite
        stream is separated at stream separator 236 into first and
        second liquid streams having parameters as at points 44 and 45,
        respectively. The first liquid stream, in this embodiment of the
        present invention, is sent into the top of distillation tower
        225. As is shown in FIG. 1, the spent stream, having parameters
        as at point 36, is sent into the bottom of distillation tower
        225. </p>
      <p>The third composite stream, after having passed through
        throttle valve 256, obtaining parameters as at point 47, is sent
        into the middle section of distillation tower 225. </p>
      <p>The distillation process takes place via direct contact heat
        and mass exchange in distillation tower 225. That direct
        exchange enables the pressure at point 36 to be significantly
        decreased--enabling increased expansion work at turbine 206. </p>
      <p>A stream of enriched vapor, with parameters as at point 37,
        exists from the top of distillation tower 225. The stream
        forming the above described lean stream (that is combined with
        the first withdrawal stream to form the composite stream), with
        parameters as at point 39, exits from the bottom of distillation
        tower 225. The vapor stream is combined at stream mixer 246 with
        the second liquid stream, with parameters as at point 45,
        creating a pre-condensed working stream having parameters as at
        point 38. The state of the pre-condensed working stream at point
        38 preferably corresponds to that of a vapor-liquid mixture. </p>
      <p>The pre-condensed working stream passes through recuperative
        heat exchanger 228 where it is cooled and partially condensed,
        obtaining parameters as at point 29. The pre-condensed working
        stream then enters condenser 221, where it is completely
        condensed to form a liquid working stream, having parameters as
        at point 14. </p>
      <p>Condenser 221 may be cooled by water or air (represented by the
        stream flowing from point 23 to point 24). The liquid working
        stream flowing from point 14 is pumped by pump 223 to high
        pressure, obtaining parameters as at point 21. Thereafter, this
        high pressure liquid working stream passes through heat
        exchanger 228 where it is heated, obtaining parameters as at
        point 22. The high pressure liquid working stream then passes
        through heat exchanger 217 where it is further preheated and
        obtains parameters as at point 60. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of the present invention shown schematically
        in FIG. 1, parallel with the high pressure liquid working
        stream, having parameters as at point 60, the lean stream, with
        parameters as at point 70, enters the portion of the system at
        which the lean stream is preheated. Prior to entering that
        portion of the system, the lean stream exiting from distillation
        tower 225, which has parameters as at point 39, is pumped to an
        intermediate pressure by pump 222, producing the lean stream
        having parameters as at point 70. </p>
      <p>The lean stream is then split at stream separator 234 into
        first and second substreams, with parameters as at points 72 and
        73, respectively. The streams with parameters as at points 72
        and 73 pass through heat exchangers 214 and 216, respectively,
        where they are heated, obtaining parameters as at points 74 and
        75, respectively. The first and second substreams are recombined
        at stream mixer 243, obtaining parameters as at point 79.
        Thereafter, the lean stream is again split at stream separator
        233 into third and fourth substreams, with parameters as at
        points 25 and 26, respectively. Those streams pass through heat
        exchangers 227 and 212 respectively, obtaining parameters as at
        points 85 and 86, respectively. Thereafter, the third and fourth
        substreams are recombined at stream mixer 247, obtaining
        parameters as at point 78. As described above, the lean stream
        at point 78 is combined with the first withdrawal stream at
        stream mixer 241 to form the above described composite stream. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the high pressure liquid working stream, having
        parameters as at point 60, parallel with the lean stream, having
        parameters as at point 70, passes through heat exchanger 214.
        Within the heat exchanger 214, the stream is heated and obtains
        parameters as at point 61. Preferably, the high pressure liquid
        working stream starts to boil at point 61. A preferably
        partially evaporated stream leaves heat exchanger 214 with
        parameters as at point 63. That stream then enters heat
        exchanger 212, where it is further heated and evaporated,
        obtaining parameters as at point 62. The stream with parameters
        as at point 62 is preferably partially evaporated. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, that stream is split into first, second, and third
        substreams at stream separators 237 and 257, forming streams
        with parameters as at points 69, 66 and 67, respectively. The
        first substream passes through heat exchanger 250. The second
        substream passes through heat exchanger 251. The third substream
        passes through heat exchanger 252. The substreams are completely
        evaporated as they pass through recuperative heat exchangers
        250, 251, and 252. </p>
      <p>After exiting the heat exchangers, the substreams obtain
        parameters as at points 92, 91 and 90, respectively. Thereafter,
        all three substreams are recombined at stream mixers 245 and
        242, producing a gaseous working stream having parameters as at
        point 68. That gaseous working stream is split into three
        substreams by stream separators 232 and 258 to produce streams
        having parameters as at points 93, 94 and 95, respectively.
        Those three substreams are sent through recuperative
        super-heaters 209, 210 and 253, where they are superheated. The
        three streams exiting from heat exchangers 209, 210, and 253
        have parameters as at points 98, 97 and 96, respectively.
        Thereafter, all three superheated gaseous working substreams are
        recombined at stream mixers 244 and 240 to produce the
        superheated gaseous working stream having parameters as at point
        99, completing the working fluid cycle. </p>
      <p>From the above description, and the schematic of FIG. 1, it is
        apparent that the lean stream and high pressure liquid working
        stream having parameters as at points 70 and 60, respectively,
        enter the evaporation portion of the cycle, and that the second
        composite stream and the spent stream, with parameters as at
        points 59 and 36, respectively, exit the evaporation portion of
        the cycle. </p>
      <p>The heating of the partially evaporated working stream as it
        flows from point 62 is provided by recuperation of heat from the
        returning withdrawal and spent streams in heat exchangers 210,
        251, 253, and 252. However, the returning withdrawal and spent
        streams are at a significantly lower pressure than the pressure
        of the oncoming partially evaporated working stream. Additional
        heating of that stream in heat exchangers 209 and 250 is needed
        to completely evaporate and superheat the partially evaporated
        working stream. In the cycle of the present invention, that heat
        is provided by an external heat source. </p>
      <p>In the described embodiment of the present invention, the
        external heat source includes an auxiliary steam cycle. In the
        embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the auxiliary steam cycle includes a
        boiler 254, a gravity separator 220, a superheater 218, a
        turbine 255, a pump 239, and a stream mixer 249. In that
        auxiliary steam cycle, a stream of completely condensed water,
        with parameters as at point 84, is pumped to high pressure by
        pump 239, obtaining parameters as at point 87. Thereafter, the
        stream, with parameters as at point 87, is combined at stream
        mixer 249 with a stream of condensed water flowing from
        separator 220, which has parameters as at point 129. The
        combination creates a stream with parameters as at point 127.
        The stream with parameters as at point 127, which is preferably
        in a state of a subcooled liquid, passes through a boiler 254,
        where it is preferably partially evaporated, obtaining
        parameters as at point 128. </p>
      <p>That stream is then sent into gravity separator 220, where
        steam is separated from water. As described above, the water,
        with parameters as at point 129, is combined at stream mixer 249
        with the stream flowing from pump 239, which has parameters as
        at point 87. The vapor stream, with parameters as at point 130,
        enters superheater 218 where it is heated, obtaining parameters
        as at point 131. Thereafter, the vapor stream with parameters as
        at point 131 passes through steam turbine 255 where it expands,
        providing work output and obtaining parameters as at point 89. </p>
      <p>The vapor stream, with parameters as at point 89, passes
        through heat exchanger 209 where it is cooled, providing heat to
        superheat the gaseous working stream flowing from point 93 to
        point 98. After exiting heat exchanger 209, the vapor stream
        obtains parameters as at point 88. The state of the vapor stream
        as at point 88 preferably corresponds to that of a saturated
        vapor. The vapor stream then passes through heat exchanger 250,
        where it completely condenses, providing heat to completely
        evaporate the partially evaporated working stream flowing from
        point 69 to point 92. After exiting heat exchanger 250, the
        condensed stream has parameters as at point 84, which
        corresponds to the state of a saturated liquid. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, heat rejection from the
        auxiliary steam cycle is utilized in the main cycle to
        supplement recuperative heating. Although water is the preferred
        working fluid for use in the auxiliary steam cycle, any fluid
        having favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility
        may be used as the working fluid for the auxiliary steam cycle.
      </p>
      <p>In order to further illustrate the advantages that can be
        obtained by the present invention, a set of calculations was
        performed, as shown in Table II. This set of calculations is
        related to an illustrative power cycle in accordance with the
        system shown in FIG. 1. In this illustrative cycle, the working
        fluid is a water-ammonia mixture with a concentration of 75 wt.
        % of ammonia (weight of ammonia to total weight of the mixture).
        The parameters for the theoretical calculations of Table II are
        set forth in Table I below. In Table I the points set forth in
        the first column correspond to points set forth in FIG. 1. </p>

      <p>The sample calculation shown in Table II shows that the FIG. 1
        cycle, using the parameters shown in Table I, has an internal,
        or turbine, efficiency of 48.57% versus the 47.49% achieved by
        the cycle described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,005.</p>

    <blockquote>While the present invention has been described with
      respect to a single preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art
      will appreciate a number of variations and modifications of that
      embodiment. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such
      variations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and
      scope of the present invention.
      <p>The cycle with the parameters as set forth in Table I was
        calculated to have a total net electrical output of 598.32 BTU
        with a total heat input of 1385.65 BTU. Thus, the net thermal
        efficiency was 43.2%. The calculated total pump work was 18.04
        BTU. </p>
      <p>When the disclosed system is utilized in connection with low
        grade fuel such as municipal waste, these calculations indicate
        that efficiency could be improved as much as 25% or more over
        conventional systems. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been described with respect to
        a single preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will
        appreciate a number of variations and modifications therefrom
        and it is intended within the appended claims to cover all such
        variations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and
        scope of the present invention. </p>
      <p>This cycle would have an output of 2,800.96 kWe with a cycle
        efficiency of 34.59%. Thus, the improvement ratio is 1.079. The
        additional power gained is 204 kWe (7.9%). The weight flow rate
        is increased 1.386% and the exergy losses are reduced by 6.514%.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, with the combination of the intermediate reheating
        between stages of the turbine and intercooling between stages of
        the turbine, high temperature heat is available from the heat
        source for use in superheating with reduced temperature
        differences. In its turn, the deficit of heat caused by such
        double superheating is compensated for by the heat released in
        the process of recooling, but at a significantly lower
        temperature, resulting in lower temperature differences in the
        process of evaporation. </p>
      <p>As a result, the exergy losses in the boiler as a whole are
        drastically reduced. The efficiency of the whole cycle is
        proportionately increased. </p>
      <p>While the addition of the present invention to Applicant's
        previous cycle results in significant improvements, the increase
        in output is much higher when the present invention is added to
        a conventional Rankine cycle apparatus. This is due to the fact
        that the cycle described in the above-mentioned patent is much
        more efficient than the Rankine cycle and consequently leaves
        less room for further improvement. </p>
      <p>In order to illustrate the advantages that can be obtained by
        the present invention used in the Rankine cycle, two sets of
        calculations were performed. These calculations are based on the
        utilization of the same heat source as described above with the
        same cooling-water temperature and the same constraints. A
        Rankine cycle, using pure water as a working fluid with a single
        pressure in the boiler equal to 711.165 psia, has a calculated
        total net output of 1,800 kWe, with a cycle efficiency of
        22.04%. When this Rankine cycle system is modified to include
        reheating and intercooling, the modified cycle achieves a
        calculated output of 2,207 kWe, with a cycle efficiency of
        27.02%. Thus, the improvement ratio is 1.226, and the additional
        power gained is 407 kWe. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been described with respect to
        a single preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will
        appreciate a number of variations and modifications therefrom
        and it is intended within the appended claims to cover all such
        variations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and
        scope of the present invention.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a continuation-in-part
        application of Ser. No. 295,829, filed Jan. 11, 1989, abandoned.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention relates generally to
        methods and apparatus for transforming thermal energy from a
        heat source into mechanical and then electrical form using a
        working fluid that is expanded and regenerated. This invention
        further relates to a method and apparatus for improving the
        thermal efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle via the heating of a
        multicomponent liquid working stream with heat released by the
        partial condensation of an expanded spent stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Brief Description of the
        Background Art </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Methods for converting the thermal
        energy, that geothermal fluid releases, into electric power
        presents an important and growing area of energy generation.
        Geothermal power plants generally belong to one of two
        categories: namely, steam plants and binary plants </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In steam plants, the geothermal
        source is utilized directly to produce steam. That steam is then
        expanded in a turbine, producing power. In binary plants, heat
        extracted from the geofluid is used to evaporate a working fluid
        that circulates within the power cycle. That working fluid is
        then expanded in a turbine, producing power. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One problem resulting from the use
        of a geothermal source is that geofluid (brine) can generally be
        cooled to moderate temperatures only. The reason for this is
        believed to be that further cooling can cause precipitation of
        silica, which may plug heat exchanger surfaces. Typically,
        geothermal brine may not be cooled to a temperature less than
        160-180 F. Once it reaches that temperature, it should be
        rejected into the geothermal strata. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The most advanced technology
        currently being used to convert the heat from geothermal heat
        sources into electric power appears to be the so-called
        supercritical organic Rankine cycle. That process, however, is
        associated with significant losses, which appear to result for
        the following reasons working fluid, after being condensed at
        ambient temperature, has to be heated by a geothermal brine
        which has a relatively high temperature, for the reasons stated
        above. As a result of such a mismatch between the temperature of
        the working fluid and the relatively high temperature of the
        geothermal brine, thermodynamic losses are incurred, leading to
        relatively low efficiency. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For example, the advanced geothermal
        power plant that is located at Heber, Calif., appears to have a
        thermal efficiency of about 13.2%. In contrast, the theoretical
        limit for the border condition at Heber is apparently about
        27.15%. Thus, what appears to be the most advanced geothermal
        plant has a thermodynamic, or Second Law, efficiency of
        apparently about 48.62%. The efficiency of the subcritical
        organic Rankine cycle, which is widely used for geothermal
        application, is, of course, even lower than the efficiency of
        the supercritical organic Rankine cycle being used at Heber. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Replacing conventional systems,
        which use the thermal energy of geothermal fluids for relatively
        low temperature processes, with a system that more adequately
        matches the temperature of the working fluid with the
        temperature of the geothermal source may substantially reduce
        thermodynamic losses resulting from the temperature mismatching
        of conventional systems. Reducing those losses can substantially
        increase the efficiency of the system. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is one feature of the present
        invention to provide a significant improvement in the efficiency
        of a thermodynamic cycle by heating a multicomponent liquid
        working stream with heat released by the partial condensation of
        an expanded spent stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In accordance with one embodiment of
        the present invention, a method for implementing a thermodynamic
        cycle includes the step of expanding a gaseous working stream,
        transforming its energy into usable form. That expansion
        produces a spent stream. The spent stream is then partially
        condensed to provide heat. A multicomponent oncoming liquid
        working stream is heated using the heat produced by the partial
        condensation of the spent stream and heat from an external heat
        source, until the multicomponent liquid working stream is
        evaporated. The evaporation of the multicomponent liquid working
        stream produces the gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a preferred embodiment of the
        present invention, the difference in the pressure of the
        multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream and the spent
        stream ensures that the multicomponent oncoming liquid working
        stream will begin to evaporate at a temperature that is lower
        than the temperature at which the spent stream begins to
        condense. To create such a multicomponent liquid working stream,
        the working fluid used in the process of the present invention
        may be a mixture comprising a high-boiling component and a
        low-boiling component, which begins to boil at a temperature
        that is lower than the temperature at which the high-boiling
        component begins to boil. In a particularly preferred embodiment
        of the present invention, the multicomponent oncoming liquid
        working stream includes about 55% to about 95% of the
        low-boiling component. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such a mixture is preferred because
        such a mixture boils at variable temperatures so that the
        temperature at which boiling begins at any given pressure (the
        bubbling point) is lower than the temperature at which
        evaporation is completed (the dew point). Conversely, if such a
        mixture is condensed, the temperature at which condensation
        starts is higher than the temperature at which condensation
        ends. The difference between the dew point temperature and the
        bubbling point temperature depends on the properties of the
        components comprising the mixture and the composition of the
        mixture itself. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The mixture employed as a working
        fluid preferably has an initial boiling temperature at high
        pressure (the boiler pressure) that is significantly lower than
        the initial temperature of condensation at low pressure (the
        condenser pressure). Under appropriate temperatures and
        pressures, such a feature may allow use of part of the heat
        rejected during the initial condensation of the spent stream to
        cause the initial evaporation of the multicomponent oncoming
        liquid working stream. Such a feature may allow use of that heat
        to preheat the working fluid as well. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, if the pressure of the
        multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream is significantly
        higher than the pressure of the spent stream, heat transferred
        from the spent stream, as the spent stream begins to condense,
        to the multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream may be
        insufficient to partially evaporate the multicomponent oncoming
        liquid working stream. In such an embodiment of the present
        invention, heat transferred from the partial condensation of the
        spent stream is used to preheat the multicomponent oncoming
        liquid working stream, without partially evaporating the
        multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Although any conventional heat
        source may, in general, be used in conjunction with the system
        of the present invention, the system is particularly useful for
        the conversion of geothermal energy into electric power. As will
        be apparent from the following description of preferred
        embodiments, the system of the present invention may enable heat
        extracted from geothermal brine to be used for relatively high
        temperature purposes only, which may increase the thermodynamic
        reversibility of the system and may result in an increased
        efficiency of a power cycle that uses such a heat source. </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows
        an embodiment of preferred apparatus that may be used in the
        above described cycle. Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 100
        that includes a boiler in the form of heat exchangers 105, 106,
        and 107, a preheater in the form of heat exchanger 108, and a
        superheater in the form of heat exchanger 101. In addition, the
        system 100 includes turbines 102 and 104, reheater 103, pump
        110, and condenser 109. Further, the system 100 includes stream
        separators 111 and 112 and stream mixers 113 and 114. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The condenser 109 may be any type of
        known heat rejection device. For example, the condenser 109 may
        take the form of a heat exchanger, such as a water cooled
        system, or another type of condensing device. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Various types of heat sources may be
        used to drive the cycle of this invention. In the embodiment
        shown in FIG. 1, the heat source is a stream of geothermal fluid
        that flows from point 1 to point 4 through heat exchangers 101,
        103, 105, and 106. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The working stream used in the
        system 100 preferably is a multicomponent working stream that
        comprises a lower boiling point fluid--the low-boiling component
        --- and a higher boiling point fluid --- the high-boiling
        component. Such a preferred working stream may be an
        ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In
        general, the stream may be mixtures of any number of compounds
        with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility. In
        a particularly preferred embodiment, a mixture of water and
        ammonia is used. The multicomponent working stream preferably
        includes about 55% to about 95% of the low-boiling component. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 1, a working stream
        circulates through system 100. The working stream includes a
        gaseous working stream that flows from heat exchanger 105 to
        turbine 102. The working stream also includes a spent stream,
        which flows from turbine 102 to condenser 109, and a liquid
        working stream, which flows from condenser 109 to heat exchanger
        105. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the cycle of the present
        invention, the liquid working stream, which has been completely
        condensed and which has a temperature that preferably is close
        to ambient temperature --- with parameters as at point 14 --- is
        pumped by pump 110 to a selected high pressure, obtaining
        parameters as at point 21. Thereafter, that stream passes
        through recuperative preheater 108, where it is preheated by a
        returning spent stream, obtaining parameters as at point 60. The
        liquid working stream at point 60 preferably has parameters
        corresponding to those at or near its boiling point, i.e., it
        preferably is in the state of a saturated liquid or a slightly
        subcooled liquid. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The liquid working stream is then
        split at stream separator 111 into two substreams, having
        parameters as at points 61 and 62, respectively. Those two
        substreams form first and second parts of the liquid working
        stream. The substream flowing by point 61, i.e., the first part
        of the liquid working stream, passes through exchanger 106 where
        it boils, being heated--in this embodiment of the invention--by
        a stream of geofluid flowing from point 1 to point 4. That
        substream exits heat exchanger 106, having parameters as at
        point 63. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The other substream, flowing by
        point 62, i.e., the second part of the liquid working stream,
        passes through recuperative heat exchanger 107 where it is
        heated by a returning spent stream. That substream is preferably
        partially evaporated producing a stream having parameters as at
        point 64. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the parameters
        for the partially evaporated working fluid at points 63 and 64
        are nearly identical. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The substreams passing by points 63
        and 64 (which are first and second parts of a heated liquid
        working stream) are recombined at stream mixer 113 into one
        stream, i.e., a heated liquid working stream, obtaining
        parameters as at point 66. The heated liquid working stream,
        which in this embodiment of the present invention has been
        partially evaporated with parameters as at point 66, passes
        through heat exchanger 105 where it is heated--in this
        embodiment--by a stream of geofluid. In a particularly preferred
        embodiment, the partially evaporated working fluid is completely
        evaporated as it passes through heat exchanger 105. The
        partially evaporated working fluid entering heat exchanger 105,
        however, need not be completely evaporated at that step of the
        cycle. In either event, the working fluid exits heat exchanger
        105 with parameters as at point 68. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The working stream, at point 68, is
        preferably in a state of a saturated vapor. However, it can be
        in a state of an incompletely evaporated mixture or a
        superheated vapor as well. In the particularly preferred
        embodiment set forth herein, that working fluid stream is a
        gaseous working fluid stream, having parameters as at point 68
        (as shown in Table I). That stream passes through heat exchanger
        101 where it is superheated by a stream of geofluid to form a
        superheated gaseous working stream with parameters as at point
        25. The stream with parameters as at point 25 is sent into the
        high pressure turbine 102 where it expands, producing power, and
        obtaining parameters as at point 26. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
        the spent stream, with parameters as at point 26, is then sent
        into reheater 103 where it is reheated by a stream of geofluid,
        obtaining parameters as at point 30. The spent stream is then
        sent to the low pressure turbine 104 where it is finally
        expanded, producing power, and obtaining parameters as at point
        36. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a particularly preferred
        embodiment of the system of the present invention, the
        parameters of the spent stream at point 36 correspond to those
        of a stream that is in the state of a saturated vapor. The
        pressure, at point 36, may be conveniently selected to ensure
        the complete condensation of the spent stream, as it passes
        through condenser 109, at the available temperature of the
        cooling medium flowing through condenser 109 from point 23 to
        point 24, which is preferably water or air. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The spent stream passes from point
        36 through heat exchanger 107 where it partially condenses,
        providing heat for the initial evaporation of the liquid working
        stream passing from point 62 to point 64, i.e., the second part
        of the liquid working stream. After the partially condensed
        spent stream exits from heat exchanger 107, it obtains
        parameters as at point 38. The partially condensed spent stream
        then passes through recuperative preheater 108 where it further
        condenses, providing heat for preheating the oncoming liquid
        working stream. The partially condensed spent stream exits
        recuperative preheater 108 with parameters as at point 29. The
        partially condensed spent stream then enters condenser 109 where
        it is cooled by water or air flowing from point 23 to point 24.
        The above described liquid working stream, having parameters as
        at point 14, exits from condenser 109 completing the cycle. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment of the present
        invention shown in FIG. 1, the external heat source for
        completing the evaporation of the liquid working stream is a
        stream of geofluid, having initial parameters as at point 1.
        That stream is split at stream separator 112, into two
        substreams, having parameters as at points 5 and 6,
        respectively. The substreams passing by points 5 and 6 pass
        through heat exchangers 101 and 103, respectively, providing
        heat for superheating the above described gaseous working stream
        and for reheating the spent stream. The substream passing by
        point 5 exits heat exchanger 101 with parameters as at point 7,
        and the substream passing by point 6 exits heat exchanger 103
        with parameters as at point 8. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thereafter, the substreams of
        geofluid are combined at stream mixer 114 into one stream having
        parameters as at point 2. That stream of geofluid passes through
        heat exchanger (boiler) 105 where it is cooled, providing heat
        for the complete evaporation of the partially evaporated, i.e.,
        heated, liquid working stream The geofluid stream exits heat
        exchanger 105 with parameters as at point 3. The stream of
        geofluid then passes through heat exchanger 106 where it is
        cooled, providing heat for the initial evaporation of a first
        part of the liquid working stream (a second part of the liquid
        working stream is initially evaporated by recuperation of heat
        from the returning spent stream, as described above). The stream
        of geofluid exits heat exchanger 106 with parameters as at point
        4, after which it may be pumped into the geofluid strata. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As is apparent from the above
        description, a unique feature of the above described embodiment
        of the present invention is that the initial temperature of
        condensation of the returning spent stream (the stream passing
        by point 36) is higher than the initial boiling temperature of
        the second part of the oncoming liquid working stream (the
        stream passing by point 62). </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The relationship between the initial
        condensation temperature of the returning spent stream and the
        initial boiling temperature of the liquid working stream of that
        embodiment enables the partial evaporation of the liquid working
        stream via recuperation of heat from the returning spent stream.
        That feature should enable the power system and cycle of the
        above described embodiment of the present invention to provide a
        significant increase in efficiency, when compared with the
        presently available organic and supercritical organic Rankine
        cycles. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It will be apparent to those skilled
        in the art that the pressure of the oncoming liquid working
        stream, at point 62, may be so high that the partial
        condensation of the returning spent stream will heat that
        portion of the liquid working stream, but will not cause that
        stream to begin to evaporate. However, an embodiment of the
        present invention in which the difference in pressure between
        the liquid working stream and the returning spent stream enables
        heat from the partial condensation of the spent stream to
        partially evaporate the liquid working stream is preferred over
        an embodiment in which the pressure of the oncoming liquid
        working stream, at point 62, is so high as to inhibit partial
        evaporation of that stream, despite the transfer of heat
        produced by the partial condensation of the returning spent
        stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Preferred parameters for the points
        corresponding to the points set forth in FIG. 1 are presented in
        Table I for a system having a water-ammonia working fluid stream
        which includes 83.05 wt. % of ammonia. All calculations used to
        generate the parameters of Table I were performed for what
        appear to be the same border conditions and the same limitations
        as have been used in the above referenced Heber geothermal plant
        A comparison in performance of the Heber geothermal power plant
        and the potential performance of the system of the present
        invention, using what appear to be the same border conditions,
        is included in Table II. </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The results shown in Table II
        suggest that the system of the present invention could
        potentially increase the power output from the same geothermal
        source by a factor of about 1.37. Such an enhanced power output
        could significantly reduce the overall cost of a geothermal
        power plant. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When a geothermal power plant is
        operating, and a significant portion of its power output must be
        spent to circulate geothermal brine, the power needed to
        circulate the geothermal brine generally remains constant,
        irrespective of the efficiency of the power plant. For the Heber
        power plant, this power is apparently equal to about 12MW. The
        net output of the Heber power plant is, therefore, apparently
        equal to about 47.2MW. In contrast, the net output of the
        proposed system of the present invention could be equal to about
        68.785MW. As a result, the net efficiency of the proposed system
        potentially could be about 1.46 times higher than the net
        efficiency of the Heber geothermal plant. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Because the cost to provide
        geothermal brine for a power plant is apparently identical for
        either the Heber plant system or the system of the present
        invention, the proposed system could potentially provide for a
        significantly lower cost for the geofluid supplied to the cycle
        per 1 kW of net output. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the system of FIG. 1, the
        composition of the working fluid flowing through the cycle
        remains constant An increased efficiency for the cycle may be
        obtained, however, if the composition of the working fluid is
        varied at different parts of the cycle. FIG. 2 provides such an
        embodiment of the present invention in which the liquid working
        stream is split into working streams having different
        compositions before the oncoming liquid working stream is
        completely evaporated to produce the gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In accordance with the embodiment of
        FIG. 2 of the present invention, a method for implementing a
        thermodynamic cycle includes the step of expanding a gaseous
        working stream, transforming its energy into usable form (as in
        the FIG. 1 embodiment). That expansion produces a spent stream
        that is partially condensed to provide heat to heat an oncoming
        liquid working stream (as in the FIG. 1 embodiment). </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, the oncoming liquid working
        stream of the FIG. 2 embodiment is generated in a different
        manner from the FIG. 1 embodiment. In the FIG. 2 embodiment, the
        spent stream is condensed to produce a first liquid working
        stream. The first liquid working stream is divided into enriched
        and lean substreams through the following steps Initially, the
        first liquid working stream is separated into first and second
        liquid substreams. The first liquid substream is heated to form
        a partially evaporated liquid substream that is separated to
        form a vapor stream and a liquid stream. The vapor stream is
        combined with the second liquid substream to form the enriched
        substream. The enriched substream is enriched with a higher
        percentage of a lower boiling component than is contained in the
        first liquid working stream. The liquid stream comprises the
        lean substream, which includes a lower percentage of a low
        boiling component than is contained in the first liquid working
        stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The enriched substream is condensed
        and then heated by the returning spent stream, until it is
        preferably partially evaporated. The lean substream is combined
        with the preferably partially evaporated enriched substream to
        form the oncoming liquid working stream that is heated
        (preferably partially evaporated) by the returning spent stream
        and then completely evaporated by an external heat source, such
        as a geothermal heat source, to form the gaseous working stream.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2,
        the completely condensed first liquid working stream (having a
        temperature which is close to the initial temperature of the
        cooling source (e.g, cooling water) flowing from point 223 to
        point 224 of FIG. 2) with parameters as at point 214 is pumped
        to an intermediate pressure by pump 316 to obtain parameters as
        at point 221. The first liquid working stream is divided at
        stream separator 320 into first and second liquid substreams
        having parameters as at points 210 and 211, respectively. The
        first liquid substream is sent into recuperative heat exchanger
        302, where it is heated to form a partially evaporated liquid
        substream with parameters as at point 213. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The partially evaporated liquid
        substream is then sent into separator 313 (which may be a flash
        tank), where it is separated into a vapor stream, with
        parameters as at point 212, and a liquid stream, with parameters
        as at point 215. The vapor stream is then combined with the
        second liquid substream at stream mixer 340 to form an enriched
        substream, with parameters as at point 217. That enriched
        substream is then sent into condenser 312, where it is
        completely condensed by a stream of cooling water, flowing from
        point 243 to point 244, to obtain parameters as at point 218.
        The enriched substream is then pumped to an increased pressure
        by pump 315, obtaining parameters as at point 219. Thereafter,
        the enriched substream is sent parallel with the first liquid
        substream, flowing from point 210 to point 213, into heat
        exchanger 302, where the enriched substream is heated, obtaining
        parameters as at point 222. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Meanwhile, the liquid stream, which
        comprises the lean substream, has been pumped to an increased
        pressure by pump 314 to obtain parameters as at point 216. The
        temperatures of the streams flowing past points 216 and 222
        preferably are approximately equal. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The preceding process steps yield an
        enriched substream, flowing by point 222, that is enriched with
        a higher percentage of a lower boiling component than is
        contained in the first liquid working stream, and a lean
        substream, flowing by point 216, that includes a lower
        percentage of a lower boiling component than is contained in the
        first liquid working stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The enriched and lean substreams are
        sent into heat exchangers 309 and 308. The lean substream is
        separated at stream separator 321 into first and second lean
        substreams, having parameters as at points 246 and 247,
        respectively, before the first lean substream enters heat
        exchanger 308 and the second lean substream enters heat
        exchanger 309. The enriched substream enters heat exchanger 309
        only. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2,
        heat exchanger 309 is a recuperative heat exchanger, in which
        the returning spent stream exchanges heat with the second lean
        substream and the enriched substream. In heat exchanger 308,
        heat is transferred to the first lean substream from a stream of
        geofluid passing from point 204 to point 209. (Mineralization
        may not allow cooling of geothermal brine to a sufficiently low
        temperature to warrant use of heat exchanger 308. Under those
        circumstances, heat exchanger 308 preferably should be removed
        from the system, and both the enriched and lean substreams sent
        into heat exchanger 309 only.) </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The preheated enriched substream
        exits heat exchanger 309 with parameters as at point 220, which
        preferably correspond to those of a liquid stream in a state of
        a saturated liquid. The first and second lean substreams exit
        heat exchangers 308 and 309, obtaining parameters as at points
        248 and 249, respectively. Those substreams are combined at
        stream mixer 341 to reconstitute the lean substream, which has
        become a preheated lean substream with parameters as at point
        240 (those parameters preferably correspond to those of a liquid
        stream in the state of a subcooled liquid). The temperatures of
        the streams flowing past points 220 and 240 are preferably about
        equal. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The preheated enriched substream is
        separated into first and second enriched substreams, having
        parameters as at points 232 and 233, respectively, at stream
        separator 322. The first enriched substream is sent into heat
        exchanger 310, along with the reconstituted and preheated lean
        substream. While passing through heat exchanger 310, the first
        enriched substream and the preheated lean substream are heated
        with heat transferred from a stream of geofluid passing from
        point 299 to point 204. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The second enriched substream is
        sent into heat exchanger 311, where it is heated by heat
        released from the returning spent stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first and second enriched
        substreams preferably begin to boil as they pass through heat
        exchangers 310 and 311 to form first and second parts of a
        partially evaporated enriched substream with parameters as at
        points 234 and 235, respectively. Those substreams are combined
        at stream mixer 342 to reconstitute the enriched substream,
        which has become a partially evaporated enriched substream, with
        parameters as at point 250 (those parameters preferably
        correspond to those of a stream in a bi-phase state). The
        preheated lean substream exits from heat exchanger 310 as a
        heated lean substream with parameters as at point 228, which
        preferably correspond to those of a saturated liquid. The
        temperatures and pressures of the streams flowing past points
        250 and 228 are preferably approximately equal. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The partially evaporated enriched
        substream and the heated lean substream are combined at stream
        mixer 343 to form a partially evaporated oncoming liquid working
        stream (corresponding, in essence, to the oncoming liquid
        working stream flowing by point 60 in the FIG. 1 embodiment of
        the present invention) with parameters as at point 265,
        corresponding to those of a stream in a bi-phase state. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As in the FIG. 1 embodiment of the
        present invention, the oncoming liquid working stream (in a
        bi-phase state in the FIG. 2 embodiment in contrast to the
        single phase state in the FIG. 1 embodiment) is then split at
        stream separator 323 into two substreams, which comprise first
        and second parts of the partially evaporated oncoming liquid
        working stream, having parameters as at points 261 and 262,
        respectively. The substream flowing by point 261 passes through
        exchanger 303 where it further boils, being heated--in this
        embodiment of the invention--by a stream of geofluid flowing
        from point 203 to point 299. That substream exits heat exchanger
        303 as a first part of a further evaporated working stream,
        having parameters as at point 263. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The other substream, flowing by
        point 262, passes through recuperative heat exchanger 304 where
        it is heated by the returning spent stream. That substream also
        further boils producing a second part of a further evaporated
        working stream, having parameters as at point 264. In a
        particularly preferred embodiment, the parameters for the
        further evaporated working fluid at points 263 and 264 are
        nearly identical. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The substreams passing by points 263
        and 264 are recombined at stream mixer 344 into one stream, a
        further evaporated working stream with parameters as at point
        266. The further evaporated working stream, with parameters as
        at point 266, passes through heat exchanger 305 where it is
        heated--in this embodiment--by a stream of geofluid flowing from
        point 202 to point 203 In a particularly preferred embodiment,
        the further evaporated working fluid is completely evaporated as
        it passes through heat exchanger 305, obtaining parameters as at
        point 268, which preferably correspond to a gaseous working
        stream in a state of a saturated vapor. That stream passes
        through heat exchanger 306 where it is superheated by a stream
        of geofluid flowing from point 205 to point 207, forming a
        superheated gaseous working stream with parameters as at point
        225. The superheated gaseous working stream with parameters as
        at point 225 is sent into the high pressure turbine 317 where it
        expands to an intermediate pressure, producing work, and
        obtaining parameters as at point 226. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Like the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
        the spent stream, with parameters as at point 226, is then sent
        into reheater 307 where it is reheated by a stream of geofluid
        flowing from point 206 to point 208, obtaining parameters as at
        point 230. The spent stream is then sent to the low pressure
        turbine 318 where it is further expanded, producing work, and
        obtaining parameters as at point 236. In a particularly
        preferred embodiment, the parameters of the spent stream at
        point 236 correspond to those of a stream that is in the state
        of a saturated vapor. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The spent stream passes from point
        236 through heat exchanger 304 where it partially condenses,
        providing heat for the further evaporation of the second part of
        the partially evaporated liquid working stream passing from
        point 262 to point 264. After the partially condensed spent
        stream exits from heat exchanger 304, it obtains parameters as
        at point 237. The partially condensed spent stream then passes
        through recuperative heat exchangers 311, 309, and 302,
        obtaining parameters as at points 238, 239, and 229,
        respectively. While passing through those heat exchangers, the
        spent stream further condenses, providing heat for partially
        evaporating the second enriched substream, preheating the
        enriched substream and the second lean substream, and partially
        evaporating the first liquid substream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The partially condensed spent stream
        then enters condenser 301, where it is cooled by water or air
        flowing from point 223 to point 224, to produce the above
        described first liquid working stream, having parameters as at
        point 214, completing the cycle of FIG. 2. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Like the embodiment of FIG. 1, the
        external heat source for the FIG. 2 embodiment of the present
        invention for completing the evaporation of the liquid working
        stream is a stream of geofluid, having initial parameters as at
        point 201. That stream is split at stream separator 324 into two
        substreams, having parameters as at points 205 and 206,
        respectively. The substreams passing by points 205 and 206 pass
        through heat exchangers 306 and 307, respectively, providing
        heat for superheating the above described gaseous working stream
        and for reheating the spent stream. The substream passing by
        point 205 exits heat exchanger 306 with parameters as at point
        207, and the substream passing by point 206 exits heat exchanger
        307 with parameters as at point 208. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thereafter, the substreams of
        geofluid are combined at stream mixer 345 into one stream having
        parameters as at point 202. That stream of geofluid passes
        through heat exchanger (boiler) 305 where it is cooled,
        providing heat for the complete evaporation of the further
        evaporated working stream. The geofluid stream exits heat
        exchanger 305 with parameters as at point 203. The stream of
        geofluid then passes through heat exchangers 303 and 310, where
        it is cooled, providing heat for the further evaporation of a
        first part of the partially evaporated liquid working stream,
        the initial evaporation of the first enriched substream, and the
        preheating of the lean substream. The stream of geofluid exits
        heat exchangers 303 and 310 with parameters as at points 299 and
        204, respectively. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If not inhibited by mineralization
        of the brine, the stream of geofluid may be sent through heat
        exchanger 308 to preheat the first lean substream, where it is
        further cooled yielding a stream with parameters as at point
        209. The stream of geofluid may be reinjected into the geostrata
        after exiting from heat exchanger 308. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The several heat exchangers shown in
        FIG. 2 represent, in essence, calculation zones. Although real
        apparatuses may be used as shown in FIG. 2, that system may
        alternatively comprise only four actual heat exchangers, i.e.,
        heat exchangers 312 and 307, and a single heat exchanger in
        place of heat exchangers 306, 305, 303, 310, and 308, and a
        single heat exchanger in place of heat exchangers 304, 311, 309,
        302, and 301. Such a system is shown in FIG. 3, in which heat
        exchanger 350 is used in place of heat exchangers 306, 305, 303,
        310, and 308, and heat exchanger 360 is used in place of heat
        exchangers 304, 311, 309, 302, and 301. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The FIG. 2 embodiment of the present
        invention offers some potential advantages over the FIG. 1
        embodiment. One advantage is that by splitting the liquid
        working stream, exiting from the condenser 301, into lean and
        enriched substreams, the overall pressure at which the liquid
        working stream boils may be increased from what it would have
        been if the liquid working stream was not split. (For the same
        temperature, the enriched substream would begin to boil at a
        higher pressure than the liquid working stream would begin to
        boil.) Such an increased overall boiling pressure should reduce
        exergy losses in the process of transferring heat from the
        geofluid, or other external heat source, to the cycle's working
        stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The increased overall boiling
        pressure also should increase the efficiency of the cycle and
        the power output per unit of heat input, or per unit of geofluid
        flow in the embodiment of the present invention employing a
        geofluid as the external heat source. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another advantage of the FIG. 2
        embodiment of the present invention, over the FIG. 1 embodiment,
        is that the FIG. 2 embodiment should permit a greater degree of
        flexibility, especially when a geofluid is used as the external
        heat source The FIG. 2 embodiment allows for adjustment of the
        system to a wide variety of border conditions, sustaining high
        thermodynamic efficiency. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Parameters for the points
        corresponding to the points set forth in FIG. 2 are presented in
        Table III for a system having a water-ammonia working fluid
        stream. All calculations used to generate the parameters of
        Table III were performed for the same border conditions used for
        calculating the parameters of Table I. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The thermal efficiency and power
        output per 1000 lbs. of geofluid of the FIG. 2 embodiment, using
        the parameters shown in Table III, should be significantly
        greater than those for the FIG. 1 embodiment, using the
        parameters shown in Table I. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>

    <blockquote>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      <p>This invention relates generally to the field of thermal energy
        conversion into mechanical and then electrical form. More
        particularly, this invention relates to the conversion of low
        temperature heat from low temperature heat sources into electric
        power. </p>
      <p>Methods for converting the thermal energy of low temperature
        heat sources into electric power present an important area of
        energy generation. There is a need for a method and apparatus
        for increasing the efficiency of the conversion of such low
        temperature heat to electric power that exceeds the efficiency
        of standard Rankine cycles. The present invention provides such
        a method and apparatus. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention provides for a method for implementing a
        thermodynamic cycle comprising the steps of: <br>
        expanding a gaseous working stream, transforming its energy into
        usable form and producing a spent stream; <br>
        condensing the spent stream producing a liquid working stream; <br>
        forming from the liquid working stream an enriched stream and a
        lean stream; and <br>
        heating the enriched stream forming the gaseous working stream.
        <br>
        The present invention also provides for an apparatus for
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle comprising: <br>
        means for expanding a gaseous working stream, transferring its
        energy into usable form and producing a spent stream; <br>
        a first stream mixer for mixing the spent stream with a lean
        stream forming a pre-condensed stream; <br>
        a condenser for condensing the pre-condensed stream producing a
        liquid working stream; <br>
        a pump for pumping the liquid working stream to an increased
        pressure; <br>
        a gravity separator for forming from the liquid working stream a
        vapor stream and a first liquid stream; <br>
        a first stream separator for separating the first liquid stream
        producing a second liquid stream and the lean stream; <br>

        for the conversion of low temperature heat from a low
        temperature geothermal brine or from a solar pond. As will be
        apparent from the following description of preferred
        embodiments, the method and apparatus of the present invention

    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      <p>This invention is a novel method and apparatus for implementing
        a thermodynamic cycle. In the method of the present invention, a
        gaseous working stream is expanded. This expansion transforms
        that stream's energy into usable form and produces a spent
        stream. Preferred expansion means include conventionally used
        turbines or turbine systems. The spent stream is condensed
        producing a liquid working stream. Preferred condensers are
        those conventionally used in the art. </p>
      <p>From the liquid working stream, an enriched stream and a lean
        stream are formed. The enriched stream preferably includes a
        higher percentage of a low boiling component than the liquid
        working stream includes. The lean stream preferably includes a
        lower percentage of a low boiling component than the liquid
        working stream includes. </p>
      <p>Any conventional apparatus used to form two or more streams
        having different compositions from a single stream may be used
        to form the lean stream and the enriched stream from the liquid
        working stream. Preferred means for forming those streams
        include conventionally used gravity separators, such as a
        conventional flash tank. </p>
      <p>The enriched stream preferably is in the state of a vapor or a
        vapor-liquid mixture. The lean stream preferably is in the state
        of a saturated or subcooled liquid. </p>
      <p>The enriched stream is heated to form the gaseous working
        stream. This heat transfer may occur via a conventional heat
        exchanger. Any conventional heating source may be used,
        including recuperative or external heat sources. Preferred
        external heat sources that may be used in the present invention
        are those having temperatures of less than about 400 F.
        Particularly preferred are those having temperatures of less
        than about 250 F., such as low temperature geothermal brine or
        solar pond external heat sources. </p>
      <p>The method of the present invention preferably includes the
        additional step of combining at a first stream mixer the lean
        stream with the spent stream prior to condensing the spent
        stream to form the liquid working stream. Such a stream, which
        includes the lean stream and the spent stream, may be referred
        to as a pre-condensed stream. </p>
      <p>The method of the present invention preferably includes the
        additional steps of pumping the liquid working stream to an
        increased pressure and partially evaporating the liquid working
        stream with heat transferred from the spent stream and the lean
        stream. Conventional pumps and heat exchangers may be used for
        such purposes. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of the present invention in which the liquid
        working stream is partially evaporated, the enriched stream and
        the lean stream may be formed by separating vapor and liquid
        streams from the partially evaporated liquid working stream at a
        flash tank--the vapor producing the enriched stream, which is
        heated to form the gaseous working stream, and the liquid
        producing the lean stream. Alternatively, such a partially
        evaporated liquid working stream may be separated into a vapor
        stream and a first liquid stream at a flash tank. The first
        liquid stream, in turn, may be separated at a first stream
        separator into a second liquid stream and the lean stream. The
        second liquid stream may then be mixed at a second stream mixer
        with the vapor stream to produce the enriched stream. In such an
        embodiment of the present invention, the enriched stream should
        be in the state of a vapor-liquid mixture that is then heated to
        form the gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p>The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of preferred
        apparatus that may be used in the method of the present
        invention. Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 100 that includes
        turbine 101, heat exchangers 104, 105 and 102, condenser 106,
        gravity separator 103, pump 108, stream separators 109 and 111,
        stream mixers 110, 112 and 114, and external heat source 113. </p>
      <p>The condenser 106 may be any type of known heat rejection
        device. For example, the condenser 106 may take the form of a
        heat exchanger, such as a water cooled system, or another type
        of condensing device. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, external heat
        source 113 represents a stream of low temperature geothermal
        fluid that flows from point 1 to point 9 through heat exchanger
        102. </p>
      <p>The working stream for the embodiment of the present invention
        shown in system 100 preferably is a multi-component working
        stream that comprises a low boiling component and a high boiling
        component. Such a preferred working stream may be an
        ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In
        general, the working stream may be mixtures of any number of
        compounds with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and
        solubility. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a mixture of
        water and ammonia is used. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, the working stream circulates through
        system 100. The working stream includes a gaseous working stream
        that flows from heat exchanger 102 to turbine 101. The working
        stream also includes a spent stream, which flows from turbine
        101 to first stream mixer 114, a pre-condensed stream, which
        flows from first stream mixer 114 to condenser 106, a liquid
        working stream, which flows from condenser 106 to gravity
        separator 103, and an enriched stream, which flows from second
        stream mixer 112 to heat exchanger 102. The gaseous working
        stream, the spent stream, and the enriched stream preferably
        each include a higher percentage of a low boiling component than
        is included in the pre-condensed stream and the liquid working
        stream. </p>
      <p>In addition to the working stream that circulates through
        system 100 are a lean stream, which flows from first stream
        separator 111 to first stream mixer 114, a first liquid stream,
        which flows from gravity separator 103 to first stream separator
        111, a second liquid stream, which flows from first stream
        separator 111 to second stream mixer 112, and a vapor stream,
        which flows from gravity separator 103 to second stream mixer
        112. The lean stream, the first liquid stream, and the second
        liquid stream preferably each include a lower percentage of a
        low boiling component than is included in the liquid working
        stream. The vapor stream preferably includes a higher percentage
        of a low boiling component than is included in the liquid
        working stream. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, the
        liquid working stream, which has been completely condensed and
        which has a temperature that preferably is close to ambient
        temperature--with parameters as at point 14--is pumped by pump
        108 to a higher pressure, obtaining parameters as at point 21.
        Thereafter, this liquid working stream is separated at stream
        separator 109 producing substreams with parameters as at points
        61 and 62, respectively. These substreams are sent into
        recuperative heat exchangers 104 and 105, respectively. While
        passing through heat exchangers 104 and 105, the substreams of
        the liquid working stream are heated, achieving a boiling
        temperature having parameters as at points 7 and 4,
        respectively, and then partially evaporated. The partially
        evaporated substreams of the liquid working stream exit heat
        exchangers 104 and 105 with parameters as at points 63 and 64,
        respectively. Those substreams are then recombined at stream
        mixer 110 to reconstitute the liquid working stream with
        parameters as at point 5. </p>
      <p>The liquid working stream at point 5 is preferably in a
        bi-phase state, i.e., in a partially evaporated state. The
        liquid working stream is sent into gravity separator 103, such
        as a flash tank, where the liquid separates from the vapor. </p>
      <p>A vapor stream with parameters as at point 6 exits from the top
        of gravity separator 103 and a first liquid stream, with
        parameters as at point 10, exits from the bottom of gravity
        separator 103. The first liquid stream is separated at first
        stream separator 111 into a lean stream and a second liquid
        stream having parameters as at points 11 and 13, respectively.
        The second liquid stream, with parameters as at point 13, is
        combined at second stream mixer 112 with the vapor stream
        producing an enriched stream (enriched in this embodiment of the
        present invention with respect to a lower boiling component when
        compared to the liquid working stream) having parameters as at
        point 69. The enriched stream preferably is in the state of a
        vapor-liquid mixture. </p>
      <p>The enriched stream is sent into heat exchanger 102 where it is
        heated by external heat source 113. The external heat source 113
        shown in FIG. 1 represents a stream of geothermal brine. Such a
        heat source typically has a temperature of less than about 400
        F., and may have a temperature of less than about 250 F.
        Alternatively, external heat source 113 may consist of some
        other type of low temperature stream, such as one flowing from a
        solar pond. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the geothermal
        brine enters heat exchanger 102 with parameters as at point 1
        and exits heat exchanger 102 with parameters as at point 9. As
        shown in TABLE 1, the geothermal brine at point 1 may be at a
        temperature of 230 F. </p>
      <p>The enriched stream that enters heat exchanger 102 is further
        heated and evaporated, exiting heat exchanger 102 as the gaseous
        working stream. The gaseous working stream exiting heat
        exchanger 102 may be partially evaporated, or it may be
        completely evaporated and superheated. </p>
      <p>The gaseous working stream in the FIG. 1 embodiment exits heat
        exchanger 102 with parameters as at point 30. The gaseous
        working stream then enters turbine 101 where it expands,
        producing work. A spent stream exits from turbine 101 with
        parameters as at point 36. That spent stream is sent into heat
        exchanger 105 where it is cooled. The spent stream is preferably
        partially condensed as it passes through heat exchanger 105 to
        obtain parameters as at point 38. As it passes through heat
        exchanger 105, the spent stream transfers heat for heating and
        preferably partially evaporating the substream of the liquid
        working stream flowing from point 62 to point 64. </p>
      <p>The lean stream, with parameters as at point 11, passes through
        heat exchanger 104, where it is cooled. While passing through
        heat exchanger 104, the lean stream provides heat for
        pre-heating and preferably partially evaporating the substream
        of the liquid working stream flowing from point 61 to point 63.
        The lean stream exits heat exchanger 104 with parameters as at
        point 20. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the lean stream
        passes through a pressure reduction device 107, which may be a
        throttle valve. After exiting pressure reduction device 107, the
        lean stream obtains parameters as at point 19. </p>
      <p>The lean stream and the spent stream are combined at first
        stream mixer 114 to produce a pre-condensed stream having
        parameters as at point 29. The pre-condensed stream is sent into
        condenser 106, where it is completely condensed by a stream of
        coolant flowing from point 23 to point 24. This produces the
        liquid working stream, with parameters as at point 14, which
        completes the cycle. </p>
      <p>Convenient parameters for the points corresponding to the
        points set forth in FIG. 1 are presented in TABLE 1 for a system
        having a water-ammonia enriched stream which includes 49.5
        weight % of ammonia. The theoretical performance of the system
        of the present invention, using the parameters of TABLE 1 in the
        embodiment shown in FIG. 1, is included in TABLE 2. The data
        presented in that table shows that the proposed system
        theoretically should have an efficiency of 10.34%, which should
        exceed the efficiency of the standard Rankine cycle, working at
        the same border conditions, by about 1.67 times. It should be
        expected that use of the heat source proposed for the embodiment
        shown in FIG. 1, with parameters as set forth in TABLE 1, should
        increase power output from 3.3 MW to 5.5 MW.</p>

        high pressure gaseous working stream is expanded, producing a
        spent stream. The spent stream is condensed, producing a
        condensed stream. The condensed stream forms first and second
        partially evaporated streams, which in turn form first and

        is generated from combining the second vapor stream with a
        mixing stream. The resulting rich and lean streams are passed
        through a boiler where they are evaporated. After exiting the
        boiler, the evaporated rich stream is combined with the
        evaporated lean stream generating the high pressure gaseous
        working stream, completing the cycle. </p>

    <blockquote> II. Brief Description of the Background Art &nbsp; <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,043 describes a system that uses two different
      streams of working solution with different compositions. That
      system includes means for heating and expanding a working fluid
      and a condensation subsystem for condensing that working fluid and
      generating the two streams having different compositions. &nbsp; <br>
      The condensation subsystem described in that patent generates from
      a single partially evaporated stream, comprising a mixture of
      ammonia and water, a single enriched vapor stream and a single
      lean liquid stream. The enriched vapor stream is divided into two
      enriched vapor substreams. The lean liquid stream is divided into
      two lean liquid substreams. One of those enriched vapor substreams
      is combined with one of the lean liquid substreams producing a
      rich stream. The other enriched vapor substream is combined with
      the other lean liquid substream producing a lean stream. Because
      the two enriched vapor substreams are generated from a single
      enriched vapor stream, they are each generated at the same
      pressure and temperature. The two working streams generated from
      combining the two vapor substreams with the two liquid substreams
      in U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,043, i.e., the rich stream and the lean
      stream, are combined during the boiling process. U.S. Pat. No.
      4,604,867 likewise describes a system that includes means for
      evaporating and expanding a working stream followed by condensing
      that expanded stream via a condensation subsystem. The
      condensation subsystem described in that patent, like that
      included in U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,043, generates an enriched vapor
      stream and a lean liquid stream from a single partially evaporated
      multi-component stream. The vapor stream is combined with a
      portion of the liquid stream to produce the working stream that is
      subsequently evaporated and expanded. The systems of U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 4,548,043 and 4,604,867 provide significantly enhanced
      thermal efficiency, when compared to conventional Rankine cycles
      that use a single component working fluid. However, it is always
      desirable to improve upon the economics and efficiencies of such
      systems. The method and system of the present invention, when
      compared to the systems described in the above-mentioned patents,
      provides such an improvement. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is one
      feature of the present invention to provide a significant
      improvement in the efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle by heating
      and evaporating at least two multicomponent liquid working streams
      that comprise a rich stream and a lean stream. The rich stream
      includes a higher percentage of a low boiling component than is
      included in the lean stream. In one aspect of the present
      invention, the rich stream and the lean stream are combined, after
      they exit from the boiler, to form a high pressure gaseous working
      stream. This feature should allow for a better match of the
      required and available heat in the process of heating, vaporizing,
      and superheating than can be obtained if a single stream is
      introduced into the boiler. In a second aspect of the present
      invention, the rich and lean streams are generated by forming from
      a condensed stream a first partially evaporated stream and a
      second partially evaporated stream. The first partially evaporated
      stream is separated into a first vapor stream and a first liquid
      stream, and the second partially evaporated stream is separated
      into a second vapor stream and a second liquid stream. The first
      vapor stream generates the rich stream, and the second vapor
      stream is combined with a mixing stream to generate the lean
      stream.
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In accordance with one embodiment of
        the present invention, a method for implementing a thermodynamic
        cycle includes the step of expanding a high pressure gaseous
        working stream, transforming its energy into usable form and
        generating a spent stream. The spent stream is then condensed,
        producing a condensed stream. A rich stream, having a higher
        percentage of a low boiling component than is included in the
        condensed stream, is generated from the condensed stream. A lean
        stream, having a lower percentage of a low boiling component
        than is included in the condensed stream, is also generated from
        the condensed stream. The rich stream and the lean stream are
        passed through a boiler generating an evaporated rich stream and
        an evaporated lean stream. The evaporated rich stream and the
        evaporated lean stream are then combined after the two
        evaporated streams exit from the boiler. This generates the high
        pressure gaseous working stream, completing the cycle. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a preferred embodiment of the
        present invention, the rich stream and the lean stream are
        generated from the condensed stream by first forming from that
        condensed stream a first partially evaporated stream and a
        second partially evaporated stream. The first partially
        evaporated stream is separated into a first vapor stream and a
        first liquid stream. The second partially evaporated stream is
        separated into a second vapor stream and a second liquid stream.
        The rich stream is generated from the first vapor stream, such
        as by combining that first vapor stream with a first mixing
        stream generated from the condensed stream. Alternatively, the
        rich stream may be produced by condensing the first vapor stream
        without first combining that first vapor stream with another
        stream. The second vapor stream is combined with a mixing stream
        generating the lean stream. Preferably that mixing stream is
        generated from the condensed stream, but alternatively may be
        generated from other streams that circulate through the system,
        such as the first or second liquid streams, for example. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In accordance with another
        embodiment of the present invention, the method for implementing
        a thermodynamic cycle includes the step of expanding a high
        pressure gaseous working stream transforming its energy into
        usable form and generating a spent stream. The spent stream is
        condensed, producing a condensed stream. From the condensed
        stream is formed a first partially-evaporated stream and a
        second partially-evaporated stream. The first
        partially-evaporated stream is separated into a first vapor
        stream and a first liquid stream. The second
        partially-evaporated stream is separated into a second vapor
        stream and a second liquid stream. The first vapor stream
        generates a rich stream, having a higher percentage of a low
        boiling component than is included in the condensed stream. The
        second vapor stream is combined with a mixing stream, such as
        may be formed from the condensed stream, generating a lean
        stream, having a lower percentage of a low boiling component
        than is included in the condensed stream. The high pressure
        gaseous working stream is formed by combining the rich stream
        and the lean stream, completing the cycle. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a preferred embodiment, the rich
        stream and the lean stream are combined to form the high
        pressure gaseous working stream after those two streams have
        exited from a boiler, after having been evaporated while passing
        through the boiler. </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows
        an embodiment of preferred apparatus that may be used in the
        method and system of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 1
        shows a system 200 that includes a boiler 201, turbines 202,
        203, and 204, recooler 205, condensation subsystem 206, pumps
        207 and 208, stream separators 209, 210, and 211, stream mixers
        212-215, and valve 216. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Various types of heat sources may be
        used to drive the cycle of this invention, including for
        example, gas turbine exhaust gases. In this regard, the system
        of the present invention may be used as a bottoming cycle in
        combined cycle systems. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The working stream flowing through
        system 200 is a multi-component working stream that comprises a
        lower boiling point fluid--the low-boiling component--and a
        higher boiling point fluid--the high-boiling component.
        Preferred working streams include ammonia-water mixtures,
        mixtures of two or more hydrocarbons, two or more freons,
        mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In general,
        the working stream may be a mixture of any number of compounds
        with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility. In
        a particularly preferred embodiment, a mixture of water and
        ammonia is used. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 1, a working stream
        circulates through system 200. The working stream includes a
        high pressure gaseous working stream that flows from stream
        mixer 214 to turbine 202. The working stream also includes a
        spent stream, which flows from turbine 202 to condensation
        subsystem 206. That spent stream includes an intermediate
        pressure gaseous stream, which flows from turbine 202 to turbine
        203, a low pressure gaseous stream, which flows from turbine 203
        to turbine 204, and a low pressure spent stream, which flows
        from turbine 204 to condensation subsystem 206. The working
        stream also includes lean and rich streams that flow from
        condensation subsystem 206 to stream mixer 214. The rich stream
        is separated into first and second rich substreams at stream
        separator 209, and the lean stream is separated into first and
        second lean substreams at stream separator 210. The second rich
        substream and the second lean substream pass through recooler
        205 before they are recombined with the first rich substream and
        first lean substream to reconstitute the rich stream and lean
        stream at stream mixers 212 and 213, respectively. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
        rich and lean streams exit condensation subsystem 206 with
        parameters as at points 29 and 73, respectively. A portion of
        the lean stream is diverted at stream separator 211. That
        portion passes by point 97 and is combined at stream mixer 215
        with the rich stream. This step of the process yields a lean
        stream having parameters as at point 96 and a rich stream having
        parameters as at point 32. This addition of a portion of the
        lean stream to the rich stream should help prevent the
        supercritical boiling of the rich stream and should help
        facilitate a favorable temperature-heat profile in boiler 201. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rich and lean streams are pumped
        to an increased pressure at pumps 207 and 208, respectively,
        obtaining parameters as at points 22 and 92, respectively. The
        two streams are then sent into boiler 201. Both the rich and
        lean streams are preheated in boiler 201 obtaining parameters as
        at points 60 and 100, respectively. The rich stream is then
        separated at stream separator 209 into first and second rich
        substreams, and the lean stream is separated at stream separator
        210 into first and second lean substreams. The first rich
        substream and the first lean substream, having parameters as at
        points 61 and 101, respectively, pass through boiler 201 where
        they are heated by the heating stream flowing from point 25 to
        point 26. Preferably, that heating stream is a stream of
        combustion gases emitted from a gas turbine. The second rich
        substream and second lean substream, with parameters as at
        points 66 and 106, respectively, pass through recooler 205.
        There, they are further heated and at least partially
        evaporated. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Preferably, the weight ratio of the
        second rich substream to the second lean substream should be
        about the same as the weight ratio of the first rich substream
        to the first lean substream and as the weight ratio of the rich
        stream to the lean stream, when the two streams entered boiler
        201. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The second rich substream and the
        second lean substream exit recooler 205 with parameters as at
        points 110 and 111, respectively. Those substreams are
        preferably completely evaporated when exiting recooler 205. The
        second rich substream combines with the first rich substream at
        stream mixer 212 to reform the rich stream, having parameters as
        at point 114. The second lean substream combines with the first
        lean substream at stream mixer 213 to reform the lean stream,
        having parameters as at point 116. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rich stream, having parameters
        at point 114, and the lean stream, having parameters at point
        116, pass through boiler 201, where they are superheated via
        heat transferred from the stream flowing from point 25 to point
        26, which is preferably a stream of combustion gases. The rich
        stream exits from boiler 201 with parameters as at point 118.
        The lean stream exits boiler 201 with parameters as at point
        119. The lean stream is then combined with the rich stream at
        stream mixer 214, producing a high pressure gaseous working
        stream, having parameters as at point 30. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Because the embodiment of the
        present invention shown in FIG. 1 does not mix the lean stream
        with the rich stream during the boiling process, that embodiment
        eliminates potential complications that may result when such
        mixing takes place during the boiling process. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The stream having parameters as at
        point 30 passes through admission valve 216, producing a stream
        having parameters as at point 31. The high pressure gaseous
        working stream then passes through high pressure turbine 202.
        There it expands, producing work, and generating a spent stream.
        The spent stream in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 includes an
        intermediate pressure gaseous stream having parameters as at
        point 40. That stream is returned to boiler 201 where it is
        reheated, producing an intermediate pressure gaseous stream
        having parameters as at point 41. That portion of the spent
        stream is then sent into intermediate pressure turbine 203.
        There it further expands, producing work, and producing a low
        pressure gaseous stream having parameters as at point 42. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The portion of the spent stream that
        is in the form of a low pressure gaseous stream passes through
        recooler 205. There, that portion of the spent stream is cooled,
        transferring heat for the vaporizing of the second rich
        substream and the second lean substream that pass from point 66
        to point 110 and point 106 to point 111, respectively. The low
        pressure gaseous stream portion of the spent stream exits
        recooler 205 with parameters as at point 43. The spent stream,
        still in the form of a low pressure gaseous stream, is then sent
        into low pressure turbine 204. There, the low pressure gaseous
        stream portion of the spent stream is expanded, producing work,
        and generating a low pressure spent stream having parameters as
        at point 38. The spent stream, now in the form of a low pressure
        spent stream, then enters condensation subsystem 206. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The pressure and the temperature of
        the spent stream at point 43 should be chosen to enable that
        stream to provide additional heat for the heating and boiling of
        the second rich substream and the second lean substream to
        ensure maximum efficiency of system 200. Suggested values for
        the temperature and pressure for the spent stream at point 43
        are shown in Table 1. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rich and lean streams generated
        in condensation subsystem 206 exit condensation subsystem 206
        with parameters as at points 29 and 73, respectively, completing
        the cycle. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The embodiment of the present
        invention shown in FIG. 1 includes three turbines, a single
        boiler, and a single recooler. The number of turbines,
        recoolers, and boilers may be increased or decreased without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In
        addition, the number of rich, lean, and working streams and
        substreams may be increased or decreased. Likewise, additional
        apparatus conventionally used in thermodynamic cycle systems,
        e.g., reheaters, other types of heat exchange devices,
        separation apparatus, and the like, may be included in the
        embodiment shown in FIG. 1 without departing from the disclosed
        inventive concept. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 2 shows a preferred embodiment
        for condensation subsystem 206. In that embodiment, the spent
        stream, now in the form of a low pressure spent stream, passes
        through heat exchangers 222 and 225, where that stream releases
        heat of condensation, generating a stream having parameters as
        at point 17. The spent stream is then mixed at stream mixer 240
        with a mixed stream (hereinafter referred to as the third mixed
        stream). having parameters as at point 19, producing a
        pre-condensed stream, having parameters as at point 18. The
        pre-condensed stream is condensed in condenser 228, which may be
        cooled by a cooling stream flowing from point 23 to point 24,
        preferably a stream of cooling water. This produces a condensed
        stream having parameters as at point 1. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">That condensed stream is pumped to a
        higher pressure by pump 233. The condensed stream, having
        parameters at point 2, is separated at stream separator 250 into
        a first condensed substream and a second condensed substream,
        having parameters as at points 89 and 79, respectively. The
        second condensed substream is separated into third, fourth, and
        fifth condensed substreams at stream separator 251, having
        parameters as at points 28, 82, and 83, respectively. Those
        three substreams then pass through heat exchangers 223, 224, and
        225, respectively, producing first, second, and third preheated
        substreams, having parameters as at points 35, 3, and 84,
        respectively. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first preheated substream is
        separated at stream separator 252 into a first prepartially
        evaporated substream, having parameters as at point 33, and a
        fourth preheated substream, having parameters as at point 77.
        The third preheated substream is separated at stream separator
        253 into a third pre-partially evaporated substream, having
        parameters as at point 27, and a fifth preheated substream,
        having parameters as at point 78. The fourth and fifth preheated
        substreams are combined with the second preheated substream at
        steam mixer 244, producing a sixth preheated substream having
        parameters as at point 36. That sixth preheated substream is
        separated at stream separator 254 into a second pre-partially
        evaporated substream, having parameters as at point 37, and a
        fourth pre-partially evaporated substream, having parameters as
        at point 76. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first, second, and third
        pre-partially evaporated substreams pass through heat exchangers
        220, 221, and 222, respectively. There, they are further heated
        and partially evaporated, generating a first partially
        evaporated substream, having parameters as at point 34, a second
        partially evaporated substream, having parameters as at point 4,
        and a third partially evaporated substream, having parameters as
        at point 15. The first partially evaporated substream is
        combined with the second partially evaporated substream at
        stream mixer 245. The resulting stream is then combined with the
        third partially evaporated substream at stream mixer 246 to
        produce a first partially evaporated stream, having parameters
        as at point 5. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">That first partially evaporated
        stream is fed into gravity separator 229. There, the liquid is
        separated from the vapor, producing a first vapor stream, having
        parameters as at point 6, and a first liquid stream, having
        parameters as at point 10. The first vapor stream is enriched
        with a low-boiling component, when compared to the first
        partially evaporated stream. The first liquid stream is enriched
        with a high-boiling component, when compared to the first
        partially evaporated stream. In a preferred embodiment, that
        low-boiling component is ammonia and that high-boiling component
        is water. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first vapor stream passes
        through heat exchangers 220 and 223, where it partially
        condenses, releasing heat that partially evaporates the first
        pre-partially evaporated substream passing from point 33 to
        point 34 and that preheats the third condensed substream passing
        from point 28 to point 35. The first vapor stream exits heat
        exchanger 223 with parameters as at point 9. The first liquid
        stream is cooled as it passes through heat exchangers 221 and
        224, releasing heat that partially evaporates the second
        pre-partially evaporated substream passing from point 37 to
        point 4 and that preheats the fourth condensed substream passing
        from point 82 to point 3, the rich stream passing from point 21
        to point 29, and the lean stream passing from point 72 to point
        73. The first liquid stream exits heat exchanger 224 with
        parameters as at point 70. The heat released by the spent
        stream, as it passes through heat exchangers 222 and 225, is
        used to preheat the fifth condensed substream passing from point
        83 to point 84, and to partially evaporate the third
        pre-partially evaporated substream passing from point 27 to
        point 15. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first condensed substream,
        having parameters as at point 89, is separated at stream
        separator 255 into a first mixing stream, having parameters as
        at point 8, and a second mixing stream, having parameters as at
        point 90. The first mixing stream is combined with the first
        vapor stream at stream mixer 243 to produce the rich stream
        having parameters as at point 13. At sufficiently high pressure,
        the first vapor stream flowing past point 9 may become the rich
        stream flowing past point 13 without mixing with a first mixing
        stream like that flowing past point 8. In such a case, the first
        condensed substream is not separated into first and second
        mixing streams at stream separator 255. Instead, all of the
        first condensed substream flowing past point 89 continues on to
        point 90 without any of that stream being diverted at stream
        separator 255 to form the first mixing stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The fourth pre-partially evaporated
        substream, having parameters as at point 76, is throttled to a
        lower pressure at valve 260, producing a second partially
        evaporated stream having parameters as at point 85. The pressure
        of the second partially evaporated stream at point 85 preferably
        is lower than the pressure of the first vapor stream at point 9
        or the pressure of the rich stream at point 14. The pressure of
        the second partially evaporated stream at point 85 is preferably
        higher than the pressure of the condensed stream at point 1. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The second partially evaporated
        stream is sent into gravity separator 230 where the liquid is
        separated from the vapor. A second vapor stream, with parameters
        as at point 86, exits from the top of gravity separator 230.
        That second vapor stream is enriched with a low-boiling
        component, which is ammonia in an ammonia-water mixture. A
        second liquid stream, with parameters as at point 87, exits from
        the bottom of gravity separator 230. That second liquid stream
        is enriched with a high-boiling component, which is water in an
        ammonia-water mixture. The second vapor stream is combined with
        the second mixing stream at stream mixer 242, generating the
        lean stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The lean stream generated at stream
        mixer 242 is fully condensed in condenser 227 by a cooling
        stream flowing from point 98 to point 99, preferably a stream of
        cooling water. The lean stream exits condenser 227 with
        parameters as at point 74. The rich stream is fully condensed in
        condenser 226 by heat exchange with a cooling stream flowing
        from point 58 to point 59, preferably a stream of cooling water.
        The rich stream exits from condenser 226 with parameters as at
        point 14. The flow rate of the rich stream at point 14 is lower
        than the flow rate of the spent stream at point 38, and the
        percentage of the low-boiling component in the rich stream at
        point 14 is higher than the percentage of that component
        included in the spent stream at point 38. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first liquid stream has its
        pressure reduced when passing through valve 261, obtaining
        parameters as at point 91. The second liquid stream has its
        pressure reduced as it passes through throttle valve 262,
        obtaining parameters as at point 20. (The second liquid stream
        at point 20 may be in the form of a partially evaporated
        stream.) The first liquid stream is combined with the second
        liquid stream at stream mixer 241, generating the third mixing
        stream having parameters as at point 19. As described above,
        that third mixing stream is mixed with the spent stream at
        stream mixer 240, generating the pre-condensed stream having
        parameters as at point 18. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rich stream is pumped to an
        intermediate pressure by pump 231, producing a rich stream
        having the parameters as at point 21. The lean stream is pumped
        to an intermediate pressure by pump 232, producing a lean stream
        having parameters as at point 72. The rich stream and the lean
        stream are then fed into heat exchanger 224, where they are
        heated with heat transferred from the first liquid stream
        passing from point 12 to point 70. The rich stream exits heat
        exchanger 224 with parameters as at point 29. The lean stream
        exits heat exchanger 224 with parameters as at point 73. The
        lean stream and the rich stream then exit condensation subsystem
        206, as shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The sum of the flow rates for the
        rich stream at point 29 and the lean stream at point 73 is equal
        to the flow rate for the spent stream at point 38. If the rich
        stream were mixed with the lean stream, the composition of the
        resulting mixture would be identical to the composition of the
        spent stream at point 38. However, via condensation subsystem
        206, two streams of working solution have been created: a rich
        stream, having parameters as at point 29, which includes a
        higher percentage of a low-boiling component than is included in
        the spent stream at point 38, and a lean stream, having
        parameters as at point 73, which includes a lesser amount of a
        low-boiling component than is included in the spent stream at
        point 38. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the embodiment of the
        condensation subsystem shown in FIG. 2, the condensation
        subsystem produces a rich stream from a first vapor stream that
        is at a different pressure and temperature from the second vapor
        stream used to produce the lean stream. Such a technique should
        provide for better use of the available heat over a wider range
        of temperatures than could be achieved if the vapor streams used
        to produce the rich stream and the lean stream were each
        maintained at the same pressure and temperature. The
        condensation subsystem shown in FIG. 2 thus should permit the
        pressure of the spent stream at point 38 to be lower than
        necessary to reproduce a single stream of working solution. If
        the two vapor streams, used to generate the rich stream and the
        lean stream, were maintained at the same pressure and
        temperature, the pressure of the spent stream at point 38 may
        have to have been higher than necessary to reproduce a single
        stream of working solution. The condensation subsystem of FIG. 2
        thus should be more efficient than a condensation subsystem that
        generates a rich stream and a lean stream from first and second
        vapor streams that were maintained at the same pressure and
        temperature. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The condensation subsystem shown in
        FIG. 2 may be used in conjunction with systems other than that
        shown in FIG. 1. For example, that condensation subsystem may be
        used in a system which includes the step of preheating the rich
        stream and the lean stream producing a preheated rich stream and
        a preheated lean stream, followed by combining the preheated
        rich stream with the preheated lean stream producing a preheated
        stream, followed by evaporating the preheated stream producing a
        high pressure gaseous working stream. Alternatively, that
        condensation subsystem may be used in a system which includes
        the step of preheating and partially evaporating the rich stream
        and the lean stream producing a partially evaporated rich stream
        and a partially evaporated lean stream, followed by combining
        the partially evaporated rich stream with the partially
        evaporated lean stream forming a partially evaporated stream,
        followed by evaporating the partially evaporated stream
        producing the high pressure gaseous working stream.
        Alternatively, that condensation subsystem may be used in a
        system which includes the steps of preheating and evaporating
        the rich stream and the lean stream producing an evaporated rich
        stream and an evaporated lean stream, followed by combining the
        evaporated rich stream with the evaporated lean stream forming
        an evaporated stream, followed by superheating the evaporated
        stream producing the high pressure gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The embodiment of the condensation
        subsystem shown in FIG. 2 may be varied in numerous ways without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In
        that regard, the number and type of heat exchangers, condensers,
        separation apparatus, valves, and pumps may be varied. The
        number and type of streams flowing through the embodiment of the
        condensation subsystem shown in FIG. 2 may be varied. Similarly,
        the applications for any such streams may be modified. Likewise,
        additional apparatus conventionally used in thermodynamic cycle
        systems may be included in that condensation subsystem without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Suggested parameters for the points
        corresponding to the points set forth in system 200 shown in
        FIG. 1 are presented in Table 1 for a system having a
        water-ammonia rich stream that exits condensation subsystem 206
        with a composition which includes 95.51 weight % of ammonia, and
        a water-ammonia lean stream that exits condensation subsystem
        206 with a composition which includes 59.16 weight % of ammonia.
        Suggested parameters for the points corresponding to the points
        set forth in condensation subsystem 206 shown in FIG. 2 are
        presented in Table 2 for a system having a water-ammonia working
        stream. A summary of the performance of the system shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 2, using the parameters shown in Tables 1 and 2, is

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The system of the present invention
        should provide for an increased thermal efficiency when compared
        to the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,867. If the
        system of the present invention is used as a bottoming cycle for
        a combined cycle system, such as one that includes an Asea Brown
        Boveri gas turbine 13E, the system of the present invention
        should theoretically deliver about 90.617 MW net power output;
        whereas, the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,867
        theoretically should deliver about 88.279 MW net power output.
        Thus, the system of the present invention, when used in such a
        combined cycle system, theoretically should provide
        approximately a 2.6% increase in efficiency over the system
        described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,867. Because the system of the
        present invention should not present any significant additional
        technological complications, it should likewise provide improved
        economics when compared to the system described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,604,867. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">While the present invention has been
        described with respect to a preferred embodiment, those skilled
        in the art will appreciate a number of variations and
        modifications of that embodiment. For example, multi-component
        working streams other than ammonia-water mixtures may be used,
        the number and types of heat exchangers may be increased or

      <p>Description </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
        transforming thermal energy from a geothermal heat source
        consisting of a mixture of geothermal liquid and geothermal
        steam ("geofluid" ) into electric power. This invention further
        relates to utilizing the energy potential of both geothermal
        liquid and geothermal steam in one integrated system. </p>
      <p>Geothermal heat sources can generally be divided into two
        groups. In the first group are "liquid-dominated" heat sources
        that produce mostly hot geothermal liquid (brine). In the second
        group are "steam-dominated" heat sources that produce mostly
        geothermal steam with some geothermal liquid. </p>
      <p>Methods for converting the thermal energy released by
        geothermal heat sources into electric power present an important
        and growing area of energy generation. Geothermal power plants
        generally belong to one of two categories, namely, steam plants
        and binary plants. </p>
      <p>In steam plants, the geothermal source is utilized directly to
        produce steam (e.g., by throttling and flashing geothermal
        liquid). That steam is then expanded in a turbine, producing
        power. In binary plants, heat extracted from the geothermal
        liquid is used to evaporate a working fluid that circulates
        within the power cycle. The working fluid is then expanded in a
        turbine, producing power. </p>
      <p>Steam plants are generally used for steam-dominated geothermal
        heat sources, while binary plants are generally used for
        liquid-dominated geothermal heat sources. U.S. Pat. No.
        4,982,568 describes a method and apparatus for transforming
        thermal energy from geothermal liquid into electrical power in a
        binary plant. This method increases efficiency by using a
        thermodynamic cycle with a multi-component working fluid and
        internal recuperation. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In a first aspect, the invention features a method of
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle that includes the steps of: <br>
        expanding a gaseous working stream, transforming its energy into
        usable form and producing a spent working stream; <br>
        heating a multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream by
        partially condensing the spent working stream; and <br>
        evaporating the heated working stream to form the gaseous
        working stream using heat produced by a combination of cooling
        geothermal liquid and condensing geothermal steam. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments, the liquid working stream is
        superheated following evaporation using heat produced by cooling
        geothermal liquid to form the gaseous working stream. The
        multicomponent oncoming liquid working stream is preferably
        preheated by partially condensing the spent working stream,
        after which it is divided into first and second substreams. The
        first substream is then partially evaporated using heat produced
        by partially condensing the spent working stream, while the
        second substream is partially evaporated using heat produced by
        cooling geothermal liquid. The partially evaporated first and
        second substreams are then combined and evaporated to form the
        gaseous working stream using heat produced by a combination of
        cooling geothermal liquid and condensing geothermal steam. The
        difference between the boiling temperature of the second
        substream and the temperature of the geothermal liquid
        preferably is greater than the difference between the boiling
        temperature of the first substream and the temperature of the
        condensed spent working stream. </p>
      <p>The geothermal steam is expanded, transforming its energy into
        usable form and producing a spent geothermal stream. The spent
        geothermal stream is then condensed to heat and partially
        evaporate the liquid working stream, after which it is combined
        with the geothermal liquid and used for further evaporation of
        the liquid working stream. Where the geothermal steam content of
        the geofluid is relatively high, it is preferable to perform
        multiple expansions of the geothermal steam. Thus, in one
        preferred embodiment, the spent geothermal stream produced by a
        first expansion of geothermal steam is divided into first and
        second geothermal substreams. The first geothermal substream is
        condensed to heat and partially evaporate the liquid working
        stream, and then combined with the geothermal liquid. The second
        geothermal substream is expanded, transforming its energy into
        usable form and producing a spent geothermal substream, which is
        then condensed to heat and partially evaporate the liquid
        working stream. The spent geothermal substream is then combined
        with the geothermal liquid. </p>
      <p>In a second aspect, the invention features apparatus for
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle that includes: </p>
      <p>means for expanding a gaseous working stream, transferring its
        energy into usable form and producing a spent stream; <br>
        a heat exchanger for partially condensing the spent stream and
        for transferring heat from the spent stream to an oncoming
        multicomponent liquid working stream; <br>
        a separator for separating geofluid into geothermal liquid and
        geothermal steam; and <br>
        a multiplicity of heat exchangers for cooling geothermal liquid
        and condensing geothermal steam, and for transferring heat from
        the geothermal liquid and geothermal steam to evaporate the
        liquid working stream and form the gaseous working stream. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments, the apparatus includes a heat
        exchanger for cooling geothermal liquid and transferring heat
        from the geothermal liquid to superheat the liquid working
        stream and form the gaseous working stream. The apparatus also
        preferably includes a stream separator for dividing the heated
        liquid working stream into first and second substreams; a heat
        exchanger for partially condensing the spent working stream and
        transferring heat from the spent working stream to partially
        evaporate the first substream; a heat exchanger for cooling the
        geothermal liquid and transferring heat from the cooled
        geothermal liquid to partially evaporate the second substream;
        and a stream mixer for combining the partially evaporated first
        and second substreams. </p>
      <p>The apparatus further preferably includes means for expanding
        geothermal steam, transforming its energy into usable form and
        producing a spent geothermal stream; a heat exchanger for
        condensing the spent geothermal stream and transferring heat
        from the spent geothermal stream to partially evaporate the
        liquid working stream; and a stream mixer for combining the
        spent geothermal stream with the geothermal liquid. To
        accommodate geofluids with relatively high geothermal steam
        content, the apparatus further includes a stream separator for
        dividing the spent geothermal stream produced in the first
        expansion into first and second geothermal streams; a heat
        exchanger for condensing the first geothermal substream and
        transferring heat from the first geothermal substream to
        partially evaporate the liquid working stream; a stream mixer
        for combining the first geothermal substream with the geothermal
        liquid; means for expanding the second geothermal substream,
        transforming its energy into usable form and producing a spent
        geothermal substream; a heat exchanger for condensing the spent
        geothermal substream and transferring heat from the spent
        geothermal substream to partially evaporate the liquid working
        stream; and a stream mixer for combining the spent geothermal
        substream with the geothermal liquid. </p>
      <p>The invention provides an integrated system that utilizes the
        energy potentials of both geothermal steam and geothermal liquid
        (brine). The system can handle practically all geothermal
        resources in almost any proportion between steam and liquid.
        Geofluids from different wells having different temperatures and
        different proportions of steam and liquid may be used as well.
        Higher outputs and efficiencies are achieved relative to systems
        in which geothermal liquid and geothermal steam are utilized
        separately. In addition, the efficiency and output are higher
        relative to steam power systems that are currently used for
        utilization of such geothermal resources. </p>
      <p>Because the heat source for the thermodynamic cycle involves a
        combination of cooling geothermal liquid and condensing
        geothermal steam, only a one stage expansion of the working
        fluid is necessary (as opposed to two stages of expansion with
        intermediate reheat). Moreover, by splitting the liquid working
        fluid into two substreams, one of which is partially evaporated
        by heat transferred from cooling geothermal liquid and the other
        of which is partially evaporated by heat transferred from
        partially condensing spent working fluid, geofluid having a high
        degree of mineralization (which can be cooled only to relatively
        high temperatures) can be used as well. </p>
      <p>Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent
        from the following description of the preferred embodiments
        thereof, and from the claims. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of preferred
        apparatus that may be used in the above-described cycle.
        Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 100 that includes a gravity
        separator 101, a preheater in the form of a heat exchanger 109,
        a superheater in the form of a heat exchanger 104, and a boiler
        in the form of heat exchangers 103, 106, 107, and 108. In
        addition, the system 100 includes turbines 102 and 114, pumps
        105 and 111, and condenser 110. Further, the system 100 includes
        stream separator 112 and stream mixer 113. </p>
      <p>The condenser 110 may be any type of known heat rejection
        device. For example, the condenser 110 may take the form of a
        heat exchanger, such as a water cooled system, or another type
        of condensing device. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, geofluid consisting of geothermal liquid
        (brine) and geothermal steam leaving the geothermal well is sent
        into gravity separator 101, where geothermal liquid and
        geothermal steam are separated. Steam leaves separator 101 with
        parameters as at point 41, and liquid leaves separator 101, with
        parameters as at point 51. Thereafter, the steam is sent into
        steam turbine 102 where it expands, producing power which is
        converted into electric power, and leaves turbine 102 with
        parameters as at point 43. The steam is then sent into heat
        exchanger 103 where it condenses, releasing its heat of
        condensation and being completely condensed. The condensate
        leaves heat exchanger 103 with parameters as at point 44. Heat
        from the condensation of the steam is transferred in heat
        exchanger 103 to the working fluid of the power cycle. </p>
      <p>The geothermal liquid, with parameters as at point 51, is
        cooled in heat exchanger 104, which it leaves with parameters as
        at point 52 and transfers heat to the working fluid of the power
        cycle. The temperature of the steam condensate at point 44 is
        substantially equal to the temperature of the geothermal liquid
        at point 52. The steam condensate with parameters as at point 44
        is pumped by a pump 105 to a pressure equal to that of the
        geothermal liquid at point 52, obtaining parameters as at point
        45. Thereafter, the steam condensate with parameters
        corresponding to point 45 is combined with the geothermal liquid
        with parameters corresponding to point 52, obtaining parameters
        as at point 53. </p>
      <p>The combined liquid having parameters as at point 53 passes
        through heat exchanger 106 where it is further cooled, releasing
        heat which is transferred to the working fluid of the power
        cycle and obtaining parameters as at point 56. Finally, liquid
        with parameters as at point 56 passes through heat exchanger 107
        where it is further cooled, releasing heat which is transferred
        to the working fluid of the power cycle and obtaining parameters
        as at point 57. Thereafter, geothermal liquid is removed from
        the system and reinjected into the geothermal strata. </p>
      <p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that the
        thermodynamic power cycle according to the invention utilizes
        two sources of geothermal heat, i.e., heat released in the
        process of condensation of geothermal steam and heat released by
        the cooling of liquid and steam condensate (geothermal liquid).
        The power cycle operates as follows. </p>
      <p>The fully condensed working fluid of the power cycle with
        parameters as at point 21 passes through a recuperative
        preheater 109 where it is preheated up to boiling temperature
        and exits preheater 109 with parameters as at point 60.
        Thereafter, the working fluid is divided into two substreams at
        stream separator 112 having parameters, correspondingly, as at
        points 61 and 62. The first substream with parameters as at
        point 61 passes through heat exchanger 107, where it is heated
        by a stream of liquid geofluid and partially evaporated. It
        leaves heat exchanger 107 with parameters as at point 63. </p>
      <p>The second substream having parameters as at point 62 passes
        through heat exchanger 108 where it is also heated and partially
        evaporated. It leaves heat exchanger 108 with parameters as at
        point 64. Thereafter, both substreams are combined at stream
        mixer 113, obtaining parameters as at point 66. The combined
        substreams are then sent into heat exchanger 106 where further
        evaporation occurs using heat transferred from a stream of
        liquid geofluid. </p>
      <p>The temperature difference between the boiling point of the
        working fluid having parameters at point 62 and the temperature
        of the condensing working fluid stream at point 38 is minimized.
        However, the temperature difference between the initial boiling
        temperature and final temperature of the geothermal liquid used
        for evaporation in heat exchanger 107 can significantly exceed
        the minimum temperature difference between points 62 and 38 in
        heat exchanger 108. Thus, it is possible to optimize temperature
        and corresponding pressure at point 60 even where the geothermal
        liquid can only be cooled to relatively high temperatures
        because of a high degree of mineralization. </p>
      <p>The working fluid leaves heat exchanger 106 having parameters
        as at point 69 and enters heat exchanger 103, where evaporation
        is completed using heat produced by condensation of the
        geothermal steam. The working fluid leaves heat exchanger 103
        with parameters as at point 68 and enters heat exchanger 104,
        where it is superheated by a stream of geothermal liquid.
        Thereafter, the working fluid, which leaves heat exchanger 104
        with parameters as at point 30, enters turbine 114 where it is
        expanded, producing power. The expanded working fluid stream
        then leaves turbine 114 with parameters as at point 36. </p>
      <p>The expanded working fluid at point 36 is usually in the form
        of a dry or a wet saturated vapor. It then passes through heat
        exchanger 108 where it is partially condensed. The heat released
        during condensation is utilized for an initial boiling of the
        liquid working fluid. Thereafter, the expanded working fluid
        leaves heat exchanger 108 with parameters as at point 38 and
        passes through heat exchanger 109, where it is further
        condensed. The heat of condensation is utilized to preheat
        oncoming working fluid. The partially condensed working fluid
        with parameters as at point 29 leaves heat exchanger 109 and
        enters heat exchanger 110, where it is fully condensed,
        obtaining parameters as at point 14. Condensation can be
        provided by cooling water, cooling air, or any other cooling
        medium. The condensed working fluid is then pumped to a higher
        pressure by pump 111, obtaining parameters as at point 21. The
        cycle is then repeated. </p>
      <p>The pressure at point 43 to which geothermal steam is expanded
        is chosen to achieve maximum total power output from both steam
        turbine 102 and working fluid turbine 114. The composition of
        the multicomponent working fluid (which includes a lower boiling
        point fluid and a higher boiling point fluid) is similarly
        chosen to maximize total power output. Specifically, the
        composition is chosen such that the temperature at which the
        expanded working fluid having parameters at point 36 condenses
        is higher than the temperature at which the same working fluid
        having parameters at point 60 boils. Examples of suitable
        multicomponent working fluids include an ammonia-water mixture,
        two or more hydrocarbons, two or more freons, mixtures of
        hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In a particularly
        preferred embodiment, a mixture of water and ammonia is used.
        The multicomponent working stream preferably includes about 55%
        to about 95% of the low-boiling component. </p>
      <p>Preferred parameters for the points corresponding to the points
        set forth in FIG. 1 are presented in Table I for a system having
        a water-ammonia working fluid stream. From the data it follows
        that the proposed system increases output in comparison with a
        traditional steam system by 1.55 times, and in comparison with a
        system that separately utilizes heat from brine and steam by
        1.077 times. <br>

      <p>Where the initial geofluid leaving the geothermal well contains
        a relatively large quantity of steam, it is preferable to expand
        and then condense the geothermal steam in two or more steps,
        rather than in one step as shown in FIG. 1. In such a case,
        heating and evaporation of the working fluid is performed
        alternately by cooling the geothermal liquid and condensing the
        geothermal steam. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 2, a system which includes two stages of expansion of
        geothermal steam is presented. It differs from the system shown
        in FIG. 1 by the fact that after the first stage of expansion,
        part of the expanded steam with parameters as at 43 is sent into
        heat exchanger 103. A portion of partially expanded steam is
        further expanded in a second steam turbine 204 and then
        condensed in a second steam condenser shown as heat exchanger
        203, from which it is pressurized via pump 201 and then
        recombined with geothermal liquid. Geothermal liquid is used to
        heat the working fluid of the power cycle between those two
        steam condensers in heat exchanger 204. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been described with respect to
        a number of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will
        appreciate a number of variations and modifications of those
        embodiments. For example, the number of heat exchangers may be
        increased or decreased. In addition, the geothermal steam may
        undergo more than two expansions depending on the steam content
        of the geofluid. Thus, it is intended that the appended claims
        cover all such variations and modifications as fall within the
        true spirit and scope of the present invention. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method and systems for combusting
        fuel to supply heat to boilers and superheaters of externally
        fired power plants. </p>
      <p>Combustion systems currently used for externally fired power
        plants can be divided into two categories: systems in which air
        fed into the combustor is preheated and systems in which air is
        not preheated. A combustion system with air preheating allows
        for higher efficiency of the power system because the heat is
        released in a temperature range above the temperature. at which
        flue gases are utilized to preheat oncoming air, e.g., usually
        in a temperature range above approximately 700 F. </p>
      <p>Two known types of combustion processes include pulverized coal
        combustion systems (in which combusted coal is micronized into a
        thin powder) and fluidized bed combustion systems. Pulverized
        coal combustion systems are usually used only for burning coal
        (which, unlike other types of fuel, can be ground into thin
        powder). The thin coal powder is typically burned with at least
        15-20% of excess air to provide complete combustion. The removal
        of heat is performed by special tubes surrounding the flame
        zone. In these tubes, the working fluid (usually water) is
        boiling, thus preventing the tubes from overheating and burning.
        The temperature of combustion typically is very high so that
        environmentally hazardous nitrogen oxide (NO.sub.x) gases are
        produced as a by-product. The high combustion temperature also
        prevents removal of environmentally hazardous sulfur gases,
        e.g., through limestone addition. </p>
      <p>In fluidized bed combustion systems, different forms of solid
        fuel can be combusted. The fuel is usually fed into the
        combustion zone mixed with limestone; the purpose of the
        limestone is to remove sulfur gases. As in the pulverized coal
        system, the fuel is typically burned with at least 15-20% of
        excess air to provide complete combustion. Special cooling tubes
        which acquire heat in such combustors are located directly in
        the combustion zone, thus providing effective cooling. As a
        result, fluidized bed combustion systems can combust fuel at
        temperatures of approximately 1600 F. At such temperature
        limestone absorbs sulfur gases and NO.sub.x gases are not
        produced from air. However, because the bulk of the heat is
        released by a single cooling of flue gas from 1600 F. to
        approximately 700 F., there is not enough released heat for
        reheating the working fluid in the power cycle, thereby
        decreasing the efficiency of the power system. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for
        transforming energy from a heat source into usable form using a
        working fluid that is expanded and regenerated. The invention
        further relates to methods and apparatus for improving the heat
        utilization efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle. </p>
      <p>In the Rankine cycle, a working fluid such as water, ammonia,
        or a freon is evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available
        heat source. The evaporated gaseous working fluid is expanded
        across a turbine to transform its energy into usable form. The
        spent gaseous working fluid is then condensed in a condenser
        using an available cooling medium. The pressure of the condensed
        working medium is increased by pumping, followed by evaporation
        and so on to continue the cycle. </p>
      <p>The Exergy cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,561,
        utilizes a binary or multi-component working fluid. This cycle
        operates generally on the principle that a binary working fluid
        is pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure and is heated
        to partially vaporize the working fluid. The fluid is then
        flashed to separate high and low boiling working fluids. The low
        boiling component is expanded through a turbine, to drive the
        turbine, while the high boiling component has heat recovered for
        use in heating the binary working fluid prior to evaporation.
        The high boiling component is then mixed with the spent low
        boiling working fluid to absorb the spent working fluid in a
        condenser in the presence of a cooling medium. </p>
      <p>In applicant's further invention, referred to as the Basic
        Kalina cycle, the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563, relatively
        lower temperature available heat is utilized to effect partial
        distillation of at least a portion of a multi-component fluid
        stream at an intermediate pressure to generate working fluid
        fractions of differing compositions. The fractions are used to
        produce at least one main rich solution which is relatively
        enriched with respect to the lower boiling component, and to
        produce one lean solution which is relatively impoverished with
        respect to the lower boiling component. The pressure of the main
        rich solution is increased; thereafter, it is evaporated to
        produce a charged gaseous main working fluid. The main working
        fluid is expanded to a low pressure level to convert energy to
        usable form. The spent low pressure level working fluid is
        condensed in a main absorption stage by dissolving with cooling
        in the lean solution to regenerate an initial working fluid for
        reuse. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another invention of the applicant, the
        subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,867, a fluid may be diverted to a
        reheater after initial expansion in the turbine to increase the
        temperature available for superheating. After return to the
        turbine, and additional expansion, the fluid is withdrawn from
        the turbine and cooled in an intercooler. Afterwards, the fluid
        is returned to the turbine for additional expansion. The cooling
        of the turbine gas may provide additional heat for evaporation.
        Intercooling provides compensation for the heat used in
        reheating and may provide recuperation of heat available which
        would otherwise remain unused following final turbine expansion.
      </p>
      <p>It would be desirable to further increase the efficiency of the
        aforementioned thermodynamic cycles. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is one feature of the present invention to provide a
        significant improvement in the efficiency of a thermodynamic
        cycle by a process that includes the steps of: </p>
      <p>expanding a gaseous working fluid to transform its energy into
        useable form and generating a spent stream; </p>
      <p>condensing the spent stream producing a condensed stream; </p>
      <p>generating from the condensed stream a first stream having a
        higher percentage of a low boiling component than is included in
        the condensed stream, a second stream having a lower percentage
        of a low boiling component than is included in the condensed
        stream, and a third stream having the same percentage of a low
        boiling component as is included in the condensed stream; </p>
      <p>subjecting said first, second, and third streams to multiple
        distillation operations to generate a liquid working fluid; and
      </p>
      <p>evaporating the liquid working fluid to generate the gaseous
        working fluid. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments, the multiple distillation operations
        yield generate a vapor stream which is condensed to generate the
        liquid working fluid, and a liquid stream which is mixed with
        the spent working fluid. It is preferably to perform the
        distillation in at least two stages (and more preferably in at
        least three stages). </p>
      <p>In one particularly preferred embodiment, the first, second,
        and third streams are generated as follows. The condensed stream
        is divided into first and second substreams. The pressure of the
        first substream is increased to form a first pressurized
        substream. Similarly, the pressure of the second substream is
        increased to form a second pressurized substream; the pressure
        of the second pressurized substream is greater than the pressure
        of the first pressurized substream. The first pressurized
        substream is partially evaporated to form a partially evaporated
        stream, which is then separated into a vapor stream and a liquid
        stream. The pressure of the liquid stream is increased to the
        same level as the second pressurized substream to form a stream
        having a lower percentage of a low boiling component than is
        included in the condensed stream (i.e., the second stream). The
        vapor stream is mixed with a portion of the first pressurized
        substream to form a composite stream having the same composition
        as the condensed stream, which is then condensed to form a
        condensed composite stream. The pressure of the condensed
        composite stream is increased to a level equal to that of the
        second pressurized substream to form a pressurized condensed
        composite stream, which is then heated (along with the second
        pressurized substream) to form, respectively, a stream having
        the same composition as the condensed stream (i.e., the third
        stream) and a stream having a higher percentage of a low boiling
        component than is included in the condensed stream (i.e., the
        first stream). </p>
      <p>Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent
        from the following description of the preferred embodiments
        thereof, and from the claims. </p>

      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      <p>The schematic shown in FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of preferred
        apparatus that may be used in the method and system of the
        present invention. Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a system 200 that
        includes a boiler 201, turbines 202, 203, and 204, intercooler
        205, distillation condensation subsystem (DCSS) 206, pump 207,
        stream separator 208, stream mixer 209, and admission valve 210.
      </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention, including for example, gas turbine exhaust
        gases. In this regard, the system of the present invention may
        be used as a bottoming cycle in combined cycle systems. </p>
      <p>The working stream flowing through system 200 is a
        multi-component working stream that comprises a lower boiling
        point fluid (the low boiling component) and a higher boiling
        point fluid (the high boiling component). Preferred working
        streams include ammonia-water mixtures, mixtures of two or more
        hydrocarbons, two or more freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and
        freons, or the like. In general, the working stream may be a
        mixture of any number of compounds with favorable thermodynamic
        characteristics and solubility. In a particularly preferred
        embodiment, a mixture of water and ammonia is used. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a completely condensed working fluid having
        parameters as at 22 passes through the preheater portion of heat
        recovery boiler 201 where it is heated to a temperature a few
        degrees below its boiling temperature and obtains parameters as
        at 44. This preheating is provided by the cooling of all streams
        of a heat source indicated in dashed lines through boiler 201.
        The working fluid which exits the preheater is divided by stream
        separator 208 into two separate streams having parameters as at
        45 and 46, respectively. </p>
      <p>A first stream having parameters as at 46 enters the evaporator
        portion of boiler 201 while the second stream (having parameters
        as at 45) enters intercooler 205. The first stream is heated in
        the evaporator by the countercurrent heating fluid flow
        described above, obtaining parameters as at 48. The second fluid
        stream passing through the intercooler 205 is heated by
        countercurrent fluid flow, thereby obtaining parameters as at
        47. Both the first and second streams are completely evaporated
        and initially superheated. Each of the streams has approximately
        the same pressure and temperature but the streams may have
        different flow rates. The fluid streams from the evaporator and
        intercooler 205 are then recombined by stream mixer 209, thereby
        obtaining parameters as at 49. </p>
      <p>The combined stream of working fluid is sent into the
        superheater portion of boiler 201 where it is finally
        superheated by heat exchange with the heat source stream
        described above and obtains parameters as at 30. Thus, the heat
        source stream extending from point 25 to point 26 passes first
        through the superheater, then through the evaporator, and
        finally through the preheater. The enthalpy-temperature
        characteristics of the illustrated heating fluid stream is
        linear. </p>
      <p>From the superheater portion of boiler 201, the total stream of
        working fluid (having parameters as at 30) passes through
        admission valve 210, thereby obtaining parameters as at 31, and
        enters a first turbine 202 which may include a number of stages.
        In turbine 202, the working fluid expands to a first
        intermediate pressure, thereby converting thermal energy into
        mechanical energy, and obtains parameters as at 40. </p>
      <p>The whole working fluid stream from turbine 202 (having
        parameters as at 40) is reheated by passing again through boiler
        201 using heat generated by the countercurrent fluid flow
        through boiler 201 described above and obtains parameters as at
        41. Having been reheated to a high temperature, the stream of
        working fluid leaves boiler 201 and travels to a second turbine
        203 which may include a number of stages. </p>
      <p>The working fluid in turbine 203 is expanded from the first
        intermediate pressure to a second intermediate pressure, thus
        generating power. The total stream of working fluid (having
        parameters as at 42) is then sent to intercooler 205 where it is
        cooled, providing the heat necessary for the evaporation of the
        second working fluid stream. Intercooler 205 may be a simple
        heat exchanger. The working fluid stream (having parameters as
        at 43) then exits intercooler 205 and travels to a third turbine
        204 (which may also include multiple stages). </p>
      <p>In turbine 204, the working fluid expands to the final spent
        fluid pressure level, thus producing additional power. From
        turbine 204 the working fluid stream (having parameters as at
        38) is passed through distillation condensation subsystem (DCSS)
        206 where it is condensed (thereby obtaining parameters as at
        29), pumped to a higher pressure by pump 207 (thereby obtaining
        parameters as at 32), and sent to boiler 201 to continue the
        cycle. </p>
      <p>The distillation condensation subsystem (DCSS) 206 will now be
        described. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the working fluid exiting low
        pressure turbine 204 (in the form of a saturated vapor having
        parameters as at point 38), passes through heat exchanger 1
        where it is partially condensed and cooled, yielding a stream
        having parameters as at point 16. Thereafter, this stream is
        mixed with a second stream of liquid having parameters as at
        point 19 and in thermodynamic equilibrium with the stream having
        parameters as at point 16. The stream having parameters as at
        point 19 contains less low boiling component (e.g., ammonia)
        than the stream having parameters as at point 16 and is thus
        said to be "lean" relative to the stream having parameters as at
        point 16. </p>
      <p>Mixing the two streams yields a third stream having parameters
        as at 17. Because the stream having parameters as at point 19 is
        leaner than the stream having parameters as at point 16, the
        composition of </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention relates to supplying heat to an externally fired
        power system. </p>
      <p>In direct fired power plants, fuel, e.g., pulverized coal, is
        burned in a combustion chamber in which combustion air,
        typically preheated, is supplied. Tubes surrounding the flame
        zone contain a working fluid (e.g., water) that is heated to
        boiling and then delivered to a power system (e.g., including a
        turbine) for conversion to a useful form of energy, such as
        electricity. Kalina U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,821 describes a
        multi-stage combustion system that employs separate combustion
        chambers and heat exchangers and controls the temperature of
        heat released at the various stages to match the thermal
        characteristics of the working fluid and to keep temperatures
        below temperatures at which NO.sub.x gasses form. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention features, in general, supplying heat to an
        externally fired power system by using a multistage system
        having two or more combustion zones. Each combustion zone has an
        associated heat exchanger that conveys a respective working
        fluid stream from the externally fired power system. Each
        combustion zone receives a portion of the total amount of
        combustion fuel, and the amounts of fuel and air supplied to
        each combustion zone are adjusted to control the temperature to
        a predetermined value. The combustion zone temperature can thus
        be controlled to prevent excessive tube metal temperatures,
        thereby avoiding damage. In addition, the cold portions of two
        or more independent fluid streams can be used to define the
        furnace boundaries, to additionally facilitate lower tube metal
        temperatures, and the temperatures of the various working fluid
        streams can be matched to the needs of the power system to
        promote efficiency. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments the various combustion zones are
        located in the same furnace. The air supplied to one or more
        combustion zones is preheated using heat from the stack gas. The
        heat exchanger conduits surround the combustion zones. There
        also are convective zones connected to receive the flue gasses
        from the combustion zones and containing heat exchangers for
        transferring heat from the flue gasses to respective working
        fluid streams in heat exchanger conduits in the convective
        zones. Working fluid streams from the heat exchangers in the
        combustion zones can be connected in series with the working
        fluid streams in the convective zones. </p>

      DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a furnace system that includes an air preheater
        100, two combustion zones 101 and 102, which are formed by
        independent working fluid cooled heat exchangers HE1A and HE2A,
        respectively, two convective pass zones 103 and 104, which
        include working fluid cooled heat exchanger HE2B and HE1B,
        respectively, and an external power system 105. The amounts of
        fuel in fuel streams 5 and 6 and the amounts of air in air
        streams 3 and 4 are controlled by suitable control mechanisms,
        shown as mechanisms 203, 204, 205, 206 on FIG. 1. Power system
        105 may be any externally direct fired power conversion system.
        The combustion system according to the invention is particularly
        useful in power cycles and systems in which much of the heat
        needed for energy conversion cycles is used not for vaporization
        of working fluid, but rather for its superheating and reheating.
        Examples of such power systems are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,732,005 and 4,889,545, which are hereby incorporated by
        reference. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,346,561; 4,489,563; 5,548,043;
        4,586,340; 4,604,867; 4,732,005; 4,763,480; 4,899,545;
        4,982,568; 5,029,444; 5,095,708; 5,450,821; and 5,440,882 are
        also incorporated by reference for disclosure of energy
        conversion systems. The working fluid streams may be sub-cooled
        liquid, saturated liquid, two-phase liquid, saturated vapor, or
        superheated vapor. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, combustion air at point 1 is fed to air
        preheater 100 where it is preheated to a temperature of
        500-600 F. at point 2. The amount of fuel in fuel stream 5
        supplied to combustion zone 101 represents only a portion of the
        total fuel to be combusted. Combustion zone 101 is formed within
        working fluid cooled tubes of heat exchanger HE1A. A first
        working fluid stream enters the heat exchanger at point 11 and
        exits the heat exchanger with increased temperature at point 12.
        The heat from the flue gas stream is transferred primarily as
        radiant energy. The amount of fuel and pre-heated air supplied
        to the combustion chamber is chosen to control the combustion
        zone temperature to a predetermined value based upon the heat
        absorption requirements of the surrounding furnace walls. In
        particular, the combustion zone temperature in first combustion
        zone 101 is controlled to prevent excessive furnace wall
        temperatures in heat exchanger HE1A to avoid damage to the heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p>Flue gas from first combustion zone 101 passes at point 7 into
        the second combustion zone 102. The flue gas is mixed with a
        combustion air stream 4 and a fuel stream 6. The combustion zone
        temperature in combustion zone 102 is controlled to prevent
        excessive furnace wall temperatures in heat exchanger HE2A to
        avoid damage to the heat exchanger. Combustion zone 102 is
        formed within working fluid cooled tubes of heat exchanger HE2A.
        A second working fluid stream enters the heat exchanger HE2A at
        point 13 and exits with the heat exchanger with increased
        temperature at point 14. </p>
      <p>Flue gas from the second combustion zone 102 passes to the
        convective pass of the furnace entering first convective zone
        103, in which the flue gas is cooled in heat exchanger HE2B. A
        third working fluid stream, in this case connected in series
        with the second working fluid stream, enters heat exchanger HE2B
        at point 15 and exits heat exchanger HE2B with increased
        temperature at point 16 and is then returned to power system
        105. Flue gas leaves convective zone 103 with lowered
        temperature at point 9 as compared to point 8 and passes to
        second convective zone 104. </p>
      <p>Similarly, the flue gas is further cooled in second convective
        zone 104 by giving up heat to heat exchanger HE1B. A fourth
        working fluid stream, in this case connected in series with the
        first working fluid stream, enters heat exchanger HE1B at point
        17 and exits heat exchanger HE1B with increased temperature at
        point 18 and is then returned to power system 105. Flue gas at
        point 10 exits the convective pass and flows to the air
        preheater 100. In the air preheater 100 the flue gas is cooled
        further, giving up heat to the combustion air stream, and passes
        to the stack with decreased temperature at point 11. </p>
      <p>A significant advantage of the multi-stage furnace design is
        that the combustion temperatures reached in the individual
        firing zones may be controlled individually through management
        of the fuel and air streams. Either sub-stoichiometric or
        super-stoichiometric combustion may be utilized to control the
        firing zone temperature in the first stage. Additionally, by
        utilizing independent working fluid streams to form the furnace
        enclosure, the utilization of cold working fluid in the hottest
        zones of the furnace is possible. Final heating of the working
        fluid streams occurs in the convective pass of the furnace. The
        invention supplies heat to a direct fired furnace system in a
        way that facilitates the control of combustion zone temperatures
        so as to prevent excessive tube metal temperatures. </p>
      <p>We have described a two-stage system with the combustion zones
        and the convective pass cooled by two independent streams of
        working fluid which are connected in series between the
        combustion zone and the convective pass. In each case a flue gas
        stream includes the flue gas streams from all preceding steps.
        Other variants may include three and four stage systems of a
        similar nature. In addition, independent working fluid streams
        may be utilized to cool only sections in the furnace or sections
        in the convective pass. </p>

        that is lean with respect to a lower boiling temperature

      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention features, in general, a method and apparatus for
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle. A heated gaseous working
        stream including a low boiling point component and a higher
        boiling point component is expanded to transform the energy of
        the stream into useable form and to provide an expanded working
        stream. The expanded working stream is then split into two
        streams, one of which is expanded further to obtain further
        energy, resulting in a spent stream, the other of which is
        extracted. The spent stream is fed into a
        distillation/condensation subsystem, which converts the spent
        stream into a lean stream that is lean with respect to the low
        boiling point component and a rich stream that is enriched with
        respect to the low boiling point component. The lean stream and
        the rich stream are then combined in a regenerating subsystem
        with the portion of the expanded stream that was extracted to
        provide the working stream, which is then efficiently heated in
        a heater to provide the heated gaseous working stream that is
        expanded. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments the lean stream and the rich stream
        that are outputted by the distillation/condensation subsystem
        are fully condensed streams. The lean stream is combined with
        the expanded stream to provide an intermediate stream, which is
        cooled to provide heat to preheat the rich stream, and
        thereafter the intermediate stream is combined with the
        preheated rich stream. The intermediate stream is condensed
        during the cooling, is thereafter pumped to increase its
        pressure, and is preheated prior to combining with the preheated
        rich stream using heat from the cooling of the intermediate
        stream. The lean stream is also preheated using heat from the
        cooling of the intermediate stream prior to mixing with the
        expanded stream. The working stream that is regenerated from the
        lean and rich streams is thus preheated by the heat of the
        expanded stream mixed with them to provide for efficient heat
        transfer when the regenerated working stream is then heated. </p>
      <p>Preferably the distillation/condensation subsystem produces a
        second lean stream and combines it with the spent stream to
        provide a combined stream that has a lower concentration of low
        boiling point component than the spent stream and can be
        condensed at a low pressure, providing improved efficiency of
        operation of the system by expanding to the low pressure. The
        distillation/condensation subsystem includes a separator that
        receives at least part of the combined stream, after it has been
        condensed and recuperatively heated, and separates it into an
        original enriched stream in the form of a vapor and the original
        lean stream in the form of a liquid. Part of the condensed
        combined stream is mixed with the original enriched stream to
        provide the rich stream. The distillation/condensation subsystem
        includes heat exchangers to recuperatively heat the combined
        condensed stream prior to separation in the separator, to
        preheat the rich stream after it has been condensed and pumped
        to high pressure, to cool the spent stream and lean stream prior
        to condensing, and to cool the enriched stream prior to mixing
        with the condensed combined stream. </p>
      <p>Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent
        from the following description of the preferred embodiment
        thereof and from the claims. </p>

      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown apparatus 400 for
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle, using heat obtained from
        combusting fuel, e.g. refuse, in heater 412 and reheater 414,
        and using water 450 at a temperature of 57 F. as a low
        temperature source. Apparatus 400 includes, in addition to
        heater 412 and reheater 414, heat exchangers 401-411, high
        pressure turbine 416, low pressure turbine 422, gravity
        separator 424, and pumps 428, 430, 432, 434. A two-component
        working fluid including water and ammonia (which has a lower
        boiling point than water) is employed in apparatus 400. Other
        multicomponent fluids can be used, as described in the
        above-referenced patents. </p>
      <p>High pressure turbine 416 includes two stages 418, 420, each of
        which acts as a gas expander and includes mechanical components
        that transform the energy of the heated gas being expanded
        therein into useable form as it is being expanded. </p>
      <p>Heat exchangers 405-411, separator 424, and pumps 428-432 make
        up distillation/condensation subsystem 426, which receives a
        spent stream from low pressure turbine 422 and converts it to a
        first lean stream (at point 41 on FIG. 1) that is lean with
        respect to the low boiling point component and a rich stream (at
        point 22) that is enriched with respect to the low boiling point
        component. </p>
      <p>Heat exchangers 401, 402 and 403 and pump 434 make up
        regenerating subsystem 452, which regenerates the working stream
        (point 62) from an expanded working stream (point 34) from
        turbine stage 418, and the lean stream (point 41) and the rich
        stream (22) from distillation/condensation subsystem 426. </p>
      <p>Apparatus 400 works as is discussed below. The parameters of
        key points of the system are presented in Table 1. </p>
      <p>The entering working fluid, called a "spent stream," is
        saturated vapor exiting low pressure turbine 422. The spent
        stream has parameters as at point 38, and passes through heat
        exchanger 404, where it is partially condensed and cooled,
        obtaining parameters as at point 16. The spent stream with
        parameters as at point 16 then passes through heat exchanger
        407, where it is further partially condensed and cooled,
        obtaining parameters as at point 17. Thereafter, the spent
        stream is mixed with a stream of liquid having parameters as at
        point 20; this stream is called a "lean stream" because it
        contains significantly less low boiling component (ammonia) than
        the spent stream. The "combined stream" that results from this
        mixing (point 18) has low concentration of low boiling component
        and can therefore be fully condensed at a low pressure and
        available temperature of cooling water. This permits a low
        pressure in the spent stream (point 38), improving the
        efficiency of the system. </p>
      <p>The combined stream with parameters as at point 18 passes
        through heat exchanger 410, where it is fully condensed by a
        stream of cooling water (points 23-59), and obtains parameters
        as at point 1. Thereafter, the condensed combined stream with
        parameters as at point 1 is pumped by pump, 428 to a higher
        pressure. As a result, after pump 428, the combined stream
        obtains parameters as at point 2. A portion of the combined
        stream with parameters as at point 2 is separated from the
        stream. This portion has parameters as at point 8. The rest of
        the combined stream is divided into two substreams, having
        parameters as at points 201 and 202 respectively. The portion of
        the combined stream having parameters as at point 202 enters
        heat exchanger 407, where it is heated in counterflow by spent
        stream 16-17 (see above), and obtains parameters as at point 56.
        The portion of the combined stream having parameters as at point
        201 enters heat exchanger 408, where it is heated in counterflow
        by lean stream 12-19 (see below), and obtains parameters as at
        point 55. In the preferred embodiment of this design, the
        temperatures at points 55 and 56 would be close to each other or
        equal. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, those two streams are combined into one stream
        having parameters as at point 3. The stream with parameters as
        at point 3 is then divided into three substreams having
        parameters as at points 301, 302, and 303, respectively. The
        stream having parameters as at point 303 is sent into heat
        exchanger 404, where it is further heated and partially
        vaporized by spent stream 38-16 (see above) and obtains
        parameters as at point 53. The stream having parameters as at
        point 302 is sent into heat exchanger 405, where it is further
        heated and partially vaporized by lean stream 11-12 (see below)
        and obtains parameters as at point 52. The stream having
        parameters as at point 301 is sent into heat exchanger 406,
        where it is further heated and partially vaporized by "original
        enriched stream" 6-7 (see below) and obtains parameters as at
        point 51. The three streams with parameters as at points 51, 52,
        and 53 are then combined into a single combined stream having
        parameters as at point 5. </p>
      <p>The combined stream with parameters as at point 5 is sent into
        the gravity separator 424. In the gravity separator 424, the
        stream with parameters as at point 5 is separated into an
        "original enriched stream" of saturated vapor having parameters
        as at point 6 and an "original lean stream" of saturated liquid
        having parameters as at point 10. The saturated vapor with
        parameters as at point 6, the original enriched stream, is sent
        into heat exchanger 406, where it is cooled and partially
        condensed by stream 301-51 (see above), obtaining parameters as
        at point 7. Then the original enriched stream with parameters as
        at point 7 enters heat exchanger 409, where it is further cooled
        and partially condensed by "rich stream" 21-22 (see below),
        obtaining parameters as at point 9. </p>
      <p>The original enriched stream with parameters as at point 9 is
        then mixed with the combined condensed stream of liquid having
        parameters as at point 8 (see above), creating a so-called "rich
        stream" having parameters as at point 13. The composition and
        pressure at point 13 are such that this rich stream can be fully
        condensed by cooling water of available temperature. The rich
        stream with parameters as at point 13 passes through heat
        exchanger 411, where it is cooled by water (stream 23-58), and
        fully condensed, obtaining parameters as at point 14.
        Thereafter, the fully condensed rich stream with parameters as
        at point 14 is pumped to a high pressure by a feed pump 430 and
        obtains parameters as at point 21. The rich stream with
        parameters as at point 21 is now in a state of subcooled liquid.
        The rich stream with parameters as at point 21 then enters heat
        exchanger 409, where it is heated by the partially condensed
        original enriched stream 7-9 (see above), to obtain parameters
        as at point 22. The rich stream with parameters as at point 22
        is one of the two fully condensed streams outputted by
        distillation/condensation subsystem 426. </p>
      <p>Returning now to gravity separator 424, the stream of saturated
        liquid produced there (see above), called the original lean
        stream and having parameters as at point 10, is divided into two
        lean streams, having parameters as at points 11 and 40. The
        first lean stream has parameters as at point 40, is pumped to a
        high pressure by pump 432, and obtains parameters as at point
        41. This first lean stream with parameters at point 41 is the
        second of the two fully condensed streams outputted by
        distillation/condensation subsystem 426. The second lean stream
        having parameters as at point 11 enters heat exchanger 405,
        where it is cooled, providing heat to stream 302-52 (see above),
        obtaining parameters as at point 12. Then the second lean stream
        having parameters as at point 12 enters heat exchanger 408,
        where it is further cooled, providing heat to stream 201-55 (see
        above), obtaining parameters as at point 19. The second lean
        stream having parameters as at point 19 is throttled to a lower
        pressure, namely the pressure as at point 17, thereby obtaining
        parameters as at point 20. The second lean stream having
        parameters as at point 20 is then mixed with the spent stream
        having parameters as at point 17 to produce the combined stream
        having parameters as at point 18, as described above. </p>
      <p>As a result of the process described above, the spent stream
        from low pressure turbine 422 with parameters as at point 38 has
        been fully condensed, and divided into two liquid streams, the
        rich stream and the lean stream, having parameters as at point
        22 and at point 41, respectively, within
        distillation/condensation subsystem 426. The sum total of the
        flow rates of these two streams is equal to the weight flow rate
        entering the subsystem 426 with parameters as at point 38. The
        compositions of streams having parameters as at point 41 and as
        at point 22 are different. The flow rates and compositions of
        the streams having parameters as at point 22 and at 41,
        respectively, are such that would those two streams be mixed,
        the resulting stream would have the flow rate and compositions
        of a stream with parameters as at point 38. But the temperature
        of the rich stream having parameters as at point 22 is lower
        than temperature of the lean stream having parameters as at
        point 41. As is described below, these two streams are combined
        with an expanded stream having parameters as at point 34 within
        regenerating subsystem 452 to make up the working fluid that is
        heated and expanded in high pressure turbine 416. </p>
      <p>The subcooled liquid rich stream having parameters as at point
        22 enters heat exchanger 403 where it is preheated in
        counterflow to stream 68-69 (see below), obtaining parameters as
        at point 27. As a result, the temperature at point 27 is close
        to or equal to the temperature at point 41. </p>
      <p>The rich stream having parameters as at point 27 enters heat
        exchanger 401, where it is further heated in counterflow by
        "intermediate stream" 166-66 (see below) and partially or
        completely vaporized, obtaining parameters as at point 61. The
        liquid lean stream having parameters as at point 41 enters heat
        exchanger 402, where it is heated by stream 167-67 and obtains
        parameters as at point 44. The lean stream with parameters as at
        point 44 is then combined with an expanded stream having
        parameters as at point 34 from turbine stage 418 (see below) to
        provide the "intermediate stream" having parameters as at point
        65. This intermediate stream is then split into two intermediate
        streams having parameters as at points 166 and 167, which are
        cooled in travel through respective heat exchangers 401 and 402,
        resulting in streams having parameters as at points 66 and 67.
        These two intermediate streams are then combined to create an
        intermediate stream having parameters as at point 68. Thereafter
        the intermediate stream with parameters as at point 68 enters
        heat exchanger 403, where it is cooled providing heat for
        preheating rich stream 22-27 (see above) in obtaining parameters
        as at point 69. Thereafter, the intermediate stream having
        parameters as at point 69 is pumped to a high pressure by pump
        434 and obtains parameters as at point 70. Then the intermediate
        stream having parameters as at point 70 enters heat exchanger
        402 in parallel with the lean stream having parameters as at
        point 41. The intermediate stream having parameters as at point
        70 is heated in heat exchanger 402 in counterflow to stream
        167-67 (see above) and obtains parameters as at point 71. </p>
      <p>The rich stream having parameters as at point 61 and the
        intermediate stream having parameters as at point 71 are mixed
        together, obtaining the working fluid with parameters as at
        point 62. The working stream having parameters as at point 62
        then enters heater 412, where it is heated by the external heat
        source, and obtains parameters as at point 30, which in most
        cases corresponds to a state of superheated vapor. </p>
      <p>The working stream having parameters as at point 30 entering
        high pressure turbine 418 is expanded and produces mechanical
        power, which can then be converted to electrical power. In the
        mid-section of high pressure turbine 416, part of the initially
        expanded stream is extracted and creates an expanded stream with
        parameters as at point 34. The expanded stream having parameters
        as at point 34 is then mixed with the lean stream having
        parameters as at point 44 (see above). As a result of this
        mixing, the "intermediate stream" with parameters as at point 65
        is created. The remaining portion of the expanded stream passes
        through the second stage 420 of high pressure turbine 416 with
        parameters as at point 35, continuing its expansion, and leaves
        high pressure turbine 416 with parameters as at point 36. </p>
      <p>It is clear from the presented description that the composition
        of the intermediate stream having parameters as at point 71 is
        equal to the composition of the intermediate stream having
        parameters as at point 65. It is also clear that the composition
        of the working stream having parameters as at point 62, which is
        a result of a mixing of the streams with parameters as at points
        71 and 61, respectively, (see above) is equal to the composition
        of the expanded stream having parameters as at point 34. </p>
      <p>The sequence of mixing described above is as follows: First the
        lean stream with parameters as at point 44 is added to the
        expanded stream of working composition with parameters as at
        point 34. Thereafter this mixture is combined with the rich
        stream having parameters as at point 61 (see above). Because the
        combination of the lean stream (point 44) and the rich stream
        (point 61), would be exactly the working composition (i.e., the
        composition of the spent stream at point 38), it is clear that
        the composition of the working stream having parameters as at
        point 62 (resulting from mixing of streams having composition as
        at points 34, 44 and 61) is equal to the composition of the
        spent stream at point 38. This working stream (point 62) that is
        regenerated from the lean and rich streams is thus preheated by
        the heat of the expanded stream mixed with them to provide for
        efficient heat transfer when the regenerated working stream is
        then heated in heater 412. </p>
      <p>The expanded stream leaving the high pressure turbine 416 and
        having parameters as at point 36 (see above) is passed through
        reheater 414, where it is heated by the external source of heat
        and obtains parameters as at point 37. Thereafter, the expanded
        stream with parameters as at point 37 passes through low
        pressure turbine 422, where it is expanded, producing mechanical
        power, and obtains as a result parameters as at point 38 (see
        above). </p>
      <p>The cycle is closed. </p>
      <p>Parameters of operation of the proposed system presented in
        Table 1 correspond to a condition of composition of a low grade
        fuel such as municipal waste, biomass, etc. A summary of the
        performance of the system is presented in Table 2. Output of the
        proposed system for a given heat source is equal to 12.79 Mw. By
        way of comparison, Rankine Cycle technology, which is presently
        being used, at the same conditions would produce an output of
        9.2 Mw. As a result, the proposed system has an efficiency 1.39
        times higher than that of Rankine Cycle technology. </p>
      <p>Other embodiments of the invention are within the scope of the
        claims. E.g., in the described embodiment, the vapor is
        extracted from the mid-point of the high pressure turbine 416.
        It is obvious that it is possible to extract vapor for
        regenerating subsystem 452 from the exit of high pressure
        turbine 416 and to then send the remaining portion of the stream
        through the reheater 414 into the low pressure turbine 422. It
        is, as well, possible to reheat the stream sent to low pressure
        turbine 422 to a temperature which is different from the
        temperature of the stream entering the high pressure turbine
        416. It is, as well, possible to send the stream into low
        pressure turbine with no reheating at all. One experienced in
        the art can find optimal parameters for the best performance of
        the described system. </p>

      <b>Abstract --- </b>Converting heat in a primary fluid (e.g.,
      steam) to useful energy by multistage expansion of the primary
      fluid, heating of a multicomponent working fluid in a separate
      closed loop using heat of the primary fluid, and expansion of the
      multicomponent working fluid. The primary fluid in a vapor state
      is expanded in a first stage expander to obtain useful energy and
      to produce a partially expanded primary fluid. The partially
      expanded primary fluid stream is then separated into liquid and
      vapor components and split into a vapor stream (which is expanded
      in a second stage expander) and a further primary stream (which
      used to heat the multicomponent working fluid).

        produced by the combustion of toxic and/or corrosive fuels such
        as municipal waste or heat from geofluid) into useful (e.g.,
        mechanical and electrical) energy. </p>
      <p>In the process of combustion of fuels which generate toxic
        and/or corrosive flue gases, it is necessary to maintain the
        temperature of the boiler's tubes below some temperature level
        in order to prevent rapid corrosion of these tubes. This is
        usually achieved by circulating boiling water through these
        tubes and producing, as a result, saturated or slightly
        superheated steam. Conventionally, this steam is then subjected
        to expansion in a steam turbine, in order to produce useful
        power. However, because this steam is usually saturated or
        superheated only slightly, expansion of it causes the turbine to
        work in the wet region, which drastically reduces efficiency and
        longevity of the steam turbine. Because the steam turbine cannot
        operate in conditions where wetness of the vapor exceeds 12-13%,
        it is therefore often necessary to stop the expansion in the
        middle of the expansion and separate and remove the liquid and
        thereafter continue further expansion. </p>
      <p>Useful energy can also be obtained from geofluid containing
        steam and brine, as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,440,882.
      </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In one aspect, the invention features, in general, converting
        heat in a primary fluid (e.g., steam) to useful energy by
        multistage expansion of the primary fluid, heating of a
        multicomponent working fluid in a separate closed loop using
        heat of the primary fluid, and expansion of the multicomponent
        working fluid. The primary fluid in a vapor state is expanded in
        a first stage expander to obtain useful energy and to produce a
        partially expanded primary fluid stream. The partially expanded
        primary fluid stream is then separated into liquid and vapor
        components and split into a vapor stream (which is expanded in a
        second stage expander) and a further primary stream (which used
        to heat the multicomponent working fluid). </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments, spent multicomponent working fluid
        (that has been expanded) is condensed at a condenser and passed
        through a recuperative heat exchanger in which heat from the
        spent multicomponent working fluid is used to recuperatively
        heat the condensed multicomponent working fluid. The primary
        fluid can be heated in a boiler or can be steam from a geofluid.
      </p>
      <p>In another aspect, the invention features, in general,
        converting heat to useful energy by using two closed loops. One
        closed loop contains a primary working fluid that is heated by
        an external source of heat (e.g., in a boiler combusting
        corrosive or toxic fuel) and then split into two streams. The
        first stream is expanded to obtain useful energy (e.g., in a
        turbine), and the second stream is used at a first heat
        exchanger to heat a multicomponent working fluid in the second
        closed loop. The heated multicomponent working fluid is then
        also expanded to obtain further useful energy (e.g., in a second
        turbine). </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments the first stream is split into two
        streams, one of which is a vapor stream that is expanded to
        obtain useful energy, and both of the additional streams are
        used to also heat the multicomponent working fluid at two
        further heat exchangers. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, the invention features, in general, a power
        system for converting heat in a geofluid containing steam and
        brine to useful energy. The steam is separated from the brine
        and expanded, and heat in the steam is used to heat a
        multicomponent working fluid in a separate closed loop at a
        first heat exchanger. The separated brine is used to further
        heat the multicomponent working fluid at a second heat
        exchanger, and is then discharged from the system. The
        multicomponent working fluid is then expanded to obtain further
        useful energy. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments the spent multicomponent working fluid
        is condensed at a condenser and passed through a recuperative
        heat exchanger in which heat from the spent multicomponent
        working fluid is used to recuperatively heat the multicomponent
        working fluid after being condensed at the condenser. The heat
        used to heat the multicomponent working fluid in the first heat
        exchanger is obtained from steam that has been expanded and then
        split into two streams. One stream is a vapor that is expanded
        to obtain useful energy, and the other stream passes through the
        first heat exchanger, and is thereafter throttled and recombined
        with the expanded stream. </p>
      <p>Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent
        from the following description of particular embodiments thereof
        and from the claims. </p>

        applications Ser. Nos. 08/283,091, 08/546,419 which are hereby
        incorporated by reference. </p>
      <p>In closed loop 112, condensed liquid water with parameters as
        at point 56 is sent through tubes into boiler 116, which
        combusts corrosive and/or toxic fuels. In the tubes in boiler
        116, water boils, producing dry, saturated steam with parameters
        as at point 51. Steam with parameters as at point 51 is divided
        into first and second primary streams having parameters as at
        points 41 and 52, respectively. The stream of steam with
        parameters as at point 41 is sent into the first stage of steam
        turbine ST-1, which is a first expander where the steam expands
        to an intermediate pressure, producing power and leaving ST-1
        with parameters as at point 42. This steam, already wet, is sent
        into separator S in separator/splitter 118, where the liquid in
        the expanded first primary stream is separated from the vapor.
        Part of the separated vapor having parameters as at point 43
        makes up a third primary stream that is sent into the second
        stage, ST-2 (a second expander) of the steam turbine. The
        remainder of the steam and all of the liquid leaving separator S
        are combined to create a fourth primary stream with parameters
        as at point 45. The third primary stream of steam having
        parameters as at point 43 (see above) is expanded in the second
        stage of steam turbine ST-2, producing power and obtaining
        parameters as at point 44. As a result, second, third, and
        fourth primary streams of saturated or wet steam are created
        having parameters as at points 52, 44, and 45, respectively. The
        second primary stream with parameters as at point 52 has the
        highest pressure and temperature. The fourth primary stream with
        parameters as at point 45 has intermediate pressure and
        temperature, and the third primary stream with parameters as at
        point 44 has the lowest pressure and temperature, respectively.
        Steam in the second primary stream with parameters as at point
        52 is sent into heat exchanger HE-1 where it is condensed and
        then subcooled, releasing heat and leaving HE-1 with parameters
        as at point 54. Steam in the fourth primary stream with
        parameters as at point 45 is sent into second heat exchanger
        HE-2 where it is condensed and subcooled, releasing heat and
        leaving third HE-2 with parameters as at point 46. This fourth
        primary stream is then pumped by pump P-2 up to a pressure equal
        to that of steam in the second primary stream having parameters
        as at point 54 (see above) and obtains parameters as at point
        50. Steam in the third primary stream with parameters as at
        point 44 is sent into third heat exchanger HE-3 where it is
        condensed and subcooled, releasing heat and leaving heat
        exchanger HE-3 with parameters as at point 48. This third
        primary stream is then pumped by pump P-3 to a pressure equal to
        that of the second and fourth primary steams having parameters
        as at points 54 and 50 (see above) and obtains parameters as at
        point 49. Thereafter, second, third, and fourth primary streams
        having parameters as at points 54, 49, and 50, respectively, are
        combined to create a stream with parameters as at point 55. This
        stream is then pumped by pump P-4 to the required pressure,
        acquiring parameters as at point 56 (see above), and is sent
        into boiler 116. </p>
      <p>In second closed loop 114, a fully-condensed multicomponent
        working fluid having parameters as at point 14 is pumped to the
        required high pressure by pump P-1 and obtains parameters as at
        point 21. Thereafter, a stream of multicomponent working fluid
        with parameters as at point 21 passes through fourth heat
        exchanger HE-4 where it is heated and obtains parameters as at
        point 60. Preferably the state of the working fluid at point 60
        is a saturated liquid. Thereafter, the stream of multicomponent
        working fluid with parameters as at point 60 is passed through
        recuperative fifth heat exchanger HE-5 where it is partially
        vaporized, obtaining parameters as at point 62. A stream with
        parameters as at point 62, thereafter, is sent into third heat
        exchanger HE-3 (see above) where it is further heated and
        vaporized by heat released in third heat exchanger HE-3 and
        obtains parameters as at point 66. Thereafter, a stream of
        working fluid having parameters as at point 66 is sent into
        second heat exchanger HE-2 where it is further heated and fully
        vaporized by heat released in second heat exchanger HE-2. A
        stream of multicomponent working fluid leaving heat exchanger
        HE-2 with parameters as at point 68 (preferably in the state of
        saturated vapor), enters first heat exchanger HE-1 where it is
        superheated by heat released in heat exchanger HE-1 and leaves
        with parameters as at point 30. A stream of multicomponent
        working fluid with parameters as at point 30 passes through
        working fluid turbine WFT (a second expander) where it is
        expanded, producing power and leaving WFT as a spent
        multicomponent working fluid with parameters as at point 36. The
        spent multicomponent working fluid with parameters as at point
        36 passes through recuperative heat exchanger HE-5 where it is
        cooled and partially condensed, releasing heat (see above) and
        leaves HE-5 with parameters as at point 38. Thereafter, a stream
        of multicomponent working fluid with parameters as at point 38
        enters recuperative heat exchanger HE-4 where it is further
        cooled and condensed, releasing heat (see above) and leaves HE-4
        with parameters as at point 29. A stream of a partially
        condensed multicomponent working fluid having parameters as at
        point 29 passes through a condenser HE-6 where it is fully
        condensed by a stream of cooling water or cooling air 23-24 and
        obtains, as a result, parameters as at point 14. </p>
      <p>All specific parameters of all key points of the described
        process are presented in Table 1. </p>
      <p>Apparatus 110 provides effective conversion of heat produced by
        combustion of toxic and corrosive fuels. A summary of
        performance of the proposed FIG. 1 system is presented in Table
        2 and shows a net thermal efficiency of 28.14%. In a traditional
        system based on direct expansion of the steam, steam leaving the
        boiler with the identical parameters as at point 51 would
        produce a net efficiency of 21%. As a result, the FIG. 1 system
        increases efficiency of heat conversion and power generation by
        33%. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown power system 210 designed
        for utilization of heat from geofluid consisting of steam and
        brine. The high mineralization of brine limits the extent to
        which it can be practically cooled and results in conditions
        that are similar in some respects to the FIG. 1 system designed
        for utilization of corrosive and toxic fuels. The similarity of
        conditions permits some of the same principles to be utilized in
        geofluid power system 210. </p>
      <p>In geofluid power system 210, geofluid comprising steam and
        mineralized brine having parameters as at point 151 enters
        separator S-1 where it is separated into a stream of saturated
        steam having parameters as at point 141 and stream of
        mineralized liquid brine having parameters as at point 152.
        Stream of steam having parameters as at point 141 enters into
        the high pressure steam turbine ST-1, where it is expanded to
        intermediate pressure obtaining parameters as at point 142.
        Steam with parameters as at point 142 is wet and enters into
        separator S-2 in separator/splitter 212, where the liquid in the
        expanded steam is separated from the vapor and split into a
        first stream with parameters as at point 143 and a second stream
        with parameters as at point 146. Steam exiting separator S-2 is
        divided into two substreams with parameters as at point 143 and
        point 145, respectively. Thereafter, the first stream (steam
        with parameters as at point 143) is sent into the low pressure
        steam turbine ST-2 where it is expanded to a low pressure and
        produces useful energy. High pressure steam turbine ST-1 and low
        pressure steam turbine ST-2 are first and second stage
        expanders, respectively, for the steam. After expansion at low
        pressure turbine ST-2, the first stream obtains parameters as at
        point 144. Stream of steam with parameters as at point 145 is
        mixed with the liquid removed from separator S-2 and creates the

      <p>The invention relates to implementing a thermodynamic cycle to

      <p>Conversion of high temperature heat (thermal energy) which is

        describe thermodynamic cycle processes which are based on use of
        multi-component working fluids. These processes differ
        substantially from the Rankine Cycle, and provide higher
        efficiency. The system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,545
        employs a distillation tower, a component which is complicated
        and unusual for the power industry. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In one aspect, the invention features, in general, a method of
        and an apparatus for implementing a thermodynamic cycle. A
        gaseous working stream is expanded to transform its energy into
        a useful form and produce an expanded gaseous stream. An
        extracted stream is removed from the expanded gaseous stream and
        absorbed into a lean stream having a higher content of
        higher-boiling component than is contained in the extracted
        stream to form a combined extracted/lean stream. The combined
        extracted/lean stream is at least partially condensed. At least
        part of the combined extracted/lean stream in condensed form is
        added to an oncoming working stream including a rich stream
        having a lower content of higher-boiling component than is
        contained in the extracted stream. The oncoming working stream
        is then recuperatively heated with heat released in the
        condensation of the combined extracted/lean stream prior to
        forming the gaseous working stream that is then expanded. </p>
      <p>Certain implementations of the invention may include one or
        more of the following features. In certain implementations the
        oncoming working stream is heated with external heat after being
        recuperatively heated to provide the gaseous working stream. At
        least part of the combined extracted/lean stream in condensed
        form is heated by external heat to a vapor state prior to being
        added to the oncoming working stream, and the oncoming working
        stream is in a vapor state when combined. At least part of the
        combined extracted/lean stream in condensed form and the
        oncoming working stream are in liquid states when the former is
        added to the latter. A first part of the combined extracted/lean
        stream is added in liquid state, and a second part of the
        combined extracted/lean stream is heated to a vapor state and
        added to the oncoming working stream in a vapor state. The
        remainder of the expanded gaseous stream (beyond the extracted
        stream) can be subjected to one or more reheatings and further
        expansions to obtain further useful work. The lean stream and
        rich stream are produced from the spent stream. The extracted
        stream is cooled before absorbing into the lean stream by
        transferring heat to the oncoming working stream prior to
        heating the oncoming working stream with external heat. The
        combined extracted/lean stream is separated into a liquid
        component and a vapor component after being partially condensed
        and before being added to the oncoming working stream. The vapor
        component is condensed by transferring heat to the oncoming
        working stream to produce a condensed vapor component, which is
        then added to the oncoming working stream. At least part of the
        liquid component is heated by heat transfer from partial
        condensing of the combined extracted/lean stream. Part of the
        liquid component is added to the oncoming working stream as a
        liquid, and part of the liquid component is converted to a vapor
        and added to the oncoming working stream as a vapor. The
        oncoming stream is converted into a vapor by transferring heat
        from the combined extracted/lean stream. Heat from the remainder
        of the expanded gaseous stream is used to recuperatively heat
        the oncoming working stream and the lean stream. Heat from the
        extracted stream is used to recuperatively heat the oncoming
        working stream. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, the invention features, in general, a
        different method of and apparatus for implementing a
        thermodynamic cycle. A gaseous working stream is expanded to
        transform its energy into a useful form and produce a spent
        stream. The spent stream is separated into a lean stream having
        a higher content of higher-boiling component than is contained
        in the spent stream and a remainder spent stream. A makeup
        stream is added to the remainder spent stream to produce a
        combined makeup/remainder spent stream, which is then condensed
        to produce a condensed remainder spent stream. The condensed
        remainder spent stream is separated into a rich stream and the
        makeup stream, the rich stream having a lower content of
        higher-boiling component than is contained in the spent stream,
        the makeup stream having a higher content of higher-boiling
        component than the rich stream. </p>
      <p>Certain implementations of the invention may have one or more
        of the following features. The spent stream is partially
        condensed into liquid and vapor components, which are then
        separated, the vapor component being the remainder spent stream.
        The liquid component is partially boiled and separated into the
        lean stream in liquid form and a vapor stream that is added to
        the spent stream prior to the initial partial condensation step.
      </p>
      <p>A second makeup stream is also extracted from the condensed
        remainder stream and added to the combined makeup/remainder
        stream. The condensed remainder stream is split into first and
        second streams; the first stream is recuperatively heated to
        partially boil it; thereafter a liquid component is separated
        from the first stream to provide the second makeup stream. A
        vapor component separated from the first stream is added to the
        second stream; the second stream is recuperatively heated to
        partially boil it; thereafter a second stream liquid component
        is separated from the second stream, and used to provide the
        first makeup stream. The second stream liquid component is
        recuperatively heated to partially boil it; thereafter a further
        liquid component is separated from the second stream liquid
        component and used to provide the first makeup stream. Vapors
        separated from the second stream liquid component and the
        further liquid component are combined to provide the rich
        stream. </p>
      <p>Embodiments of the invention may have one or more of the
        following advantages. High efficiency is provided in a
        thermodynamic cycle for converting heat produced in a furnace to
        mechanical and electrical energy without the need for a
        distillation tower. Combining the lean stream with the extracted
        stream reduces the composition of the extracted stream, making
        it leaner and causing it to condense in a temperature range high
        enough to heat the rich portion of the oncoming working stream.
        Because the extracted stream is added to the oncoming working
        stream and returned in a loop to the high pressure turbine,
        there is less rejection of heat to outside of the system and
        improved efficiency. The rich stream is converted into a vapor
        at high pressure by recuperation of heat released in
        condensation of the extracted stream. Part of the combined
        extracted/lean stream is heated, after its complete
        condensation, recuperatively, by using heat released in the
        process of condensation of the same stream. In the distillation
        condensation subsystem the spent stream is condensed at a
        pressure which is lower than the pressure at which it could be
        condensed directly by available cooling media, and the spent
        stream is split and condensed into a very lean liquid and a very
        rich liquid. </p>
      <p>Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent
        from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof
        and from the claims. </p>

      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, system 300 for implementing a
        thermodynamic cycle includes distillation condensation subsystem
        (DCSS) 312 shown on FIG. 1 and heat recuperation, heat
        acquisition and turbine expansion subsystem 314 shown on FIG. 2
        along with DCSS 312. Subsystem 314 is further broken down into
        boiling condensing heat recuperation subsystem 316, furnace
        boiling and vapor heat recuperation subsystem 318, and
        superheating heat acquisition and turbine expansion subsystem
        320. </p>
      <p>Boiling condensing heat recuperation subsystem 316 includes
        recuperative heat exchangers HE-16, HE-17, HE-18, HE-19, HE-20,
        HE-21, HE-22, HE-23 and HE-24. (Note that the "HE" designations
        do not appear on the drawings.) It also includes gravity
        separator S-6, feed pump P6, and pumps P5, P7 and P8. </p>
      <p>Furnace boiling and vapor heat recuperation subsystem 318
        includes furnace heat exchanger HE-34 and recuperative heat
        exchangers HE-13, HE-14 and HE-15. </p>
      <p>Superheating heat acquisition and turbine expansion subsystem
        320 includes superheater heat exchangers HE-31, HE-32, and HE-33
        and turbines: high pressure turbine (HPT), intermediate pressure
        turbine (IPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT). </p>
      <p>System 300 utilizes as a working fluid a mixture of at least
        two components. Suitable mixtures include water-ammonia,
        water-carbon dioxide, and others. The following description is
        based on using a water-ammonia mixture as a working fluid; this
        is the same working fluid as described in the above-referenced
        patents. DCSS 312 is described in detail first, with reference
        to FIG. 1 and Table 1, which sets forth the conditions of the
        streams at indicated points in the flow diagram. </p>
      <p>Distillation Condensation Subsystem 312 </p>
      <p>The spent working fluid enters DCSS 312 (see FIGS. 1 and 2)
        fully expanded and cooled to parameters corresponding to a state
        of dry saturated vapor having parameters as at point 38.
        Referring to FIG. 1, a stream of saturated vapor, having
        parameters as at point 156 (see below), is mixed with the spent
        stream having parameters as at point 38 and creates a stream of
        vapor having parameters as at point 157. Thereafter the stream
        of vapor, having parameters as at point 157, is divided into two
        substreams which pass through heat exchangers HE-1 and HE-2,
        where they are cooled and partially condensed and obtain
        parameters as at points 154 and 153, correspondingly. Thereafter
        streams, having parameters as at points 153 and 154, are
        combined, creating a stream with parameters as at point 152
        which is sent into gravity separator S-4. In gravity separator
        S-4, the liquid is separated from the vapor. The stream of
        liquid from gravity separator S-4, having parameters as at point
        151, is sent, in counterflow, to stream 157-154 into heat
        exchanger HE-1 (see above) where this stream is partially
        boiled. This stream leaves heat exchanger HE-1, having
        parameters as at point 155, and then enters gravity separator
        S-3. In gravity separator S-3, vapor is separated from the
        liquid, and this vapor, having parameters as at point 156, is
        mixed with the entering spent stream, having parameters as at
        point 38, creating a stream of vapor with parameters as at point
        157 (see above). Liquid separated in gravity separator S-3,
        having parameters as at point 40, leaves DCSS 312 and is sent
        into boiling condensing heat recuperation subsystem 316 (FIG. 2;
        see below). This stream, at point 40, is referred to as the lean
        stream and has a higher content of higher-boiling component
        (water) than is contained in the entering spent stream, at point
        38. </p>
      <p>Vapor separated in gravity separator S-4 (see above) is in a
        state of dry saturated vapor. This stream of vapor, having
        parameters as at point 138 and referred to as the remainder
        spent stream, passes through heat exchanger HE-5 where it is
        cooled and partially condensed and obtains parameters as at
        point 16. Thereafter the remainder spent stream, having
        parameters as at point 16, is mixed with the stream of liquid,
        having parameters as at point 19 and referred to as a first
        makeup stream, and as a result a new stream of partially
        condensed working fluid, having parameters as at point 17, is
        created. The resulting stream is referred to as a combined
        makeup/remainder spent stream. In a preferred embodiment, liquid
        having parameters as at point 19 is at thermodynamic equilibrium
        to the stream having parameters as at point 16 and, as a result
        of such equilibrium, the temperatures and pressures at points
        16, 19 and 17 are equal. Thereafter, the combined
        makeup/remainder spent stream, having parameters as at point 17,
        is divided into two substreams, which pass through heat
        exchangers HE-6 and HE-7, obtaining parameters as at points 129
        and 128, correspondingly, before recombining. In these two heat
        exchangers, the substreams having parameters as at point 17 are
        further cooled and condensed and release heat. The substreams
        have the parameters as at points 128 and 129, and the combined
        makeup/remainder spent stream then has parameters as at point
        15. Then the liquid having parameters as at point 110 and
        referred to as a second makeup stream is added to the combined
        makeup/remainder spent stream, having parameters as at point 15,
        resulting in the combined makeup/remainder stream having the
        parameters as at point 18. As a result of this mixing, the
        composition of the stream at point 18 is leaner than the
        composition of a stream at point 15; i.e., it has a higher
        content of water than the stream having parameters as at point
        15. Thereafter the stream, having parameters as at point 18,
        passes through the low pressure condenser HE-12, where it is
        fully condensed and obtains parameters as at point 1. This
        stream (at point 1) is referred to as the condensed remainder
        stream. The heat of condensation is removed by a stream of
        cooling media (water or air) which enters heat exchanger HE-12,
        with parameters as at point 23, and exits this heat exchanger
        having parameters as at point 59. </p>
      <p>It is noted that the remainder stream, having compositions as
        at point 138 and 16, and the initial combined makeup/remainder
        spent stream, having the composition as at points 17 and 15,
        cannot be fully condensed at the pressure and temperature
        corresponding to point 1. Only after final mixing with the
        second makeup stream, having parameters as at point 110, can the
        final combined makeup/remainder spent stream, having parameters
        as at point 18, obtain a composition which allows the remainder
        stream to be fully condensed as at point 1. </p>

      <p>Thermal energy can be usefully converted into mechanical and

        increasing the efficiency of the conversion of such low
        temperature heat to electric power. </p>
      <p>Thermal energy from a heat source can be transformed into
        mechanical and then electrical form using a working fluid that

      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention features, in general a method and system for
        implementing a thermodynamic cycle. A working stream including a
        low boiling point component and a higher boiling point component
        is heated with a source of external heat (e.g., a low
        temperature source) to provide a heated gaseous working stream.
        The heated gaseous working stream is separated at a first
        separator to provide a heated gaseous rich stream having
        relatively more of the low boiling point component and a lean
        stream having relatively less of the low boiling point
        component. The heated gaseous rich stream is expanded to
        transform the energy of the stream into useable form and to
        provide an expanded, spent rich stream. The lean stream and the
        expanded, spent rich stream are then combined to provide the
        working stream. </p>
      <p>Particular embodiments of the invention may include one or more
        of the following features. The working stream is condensed by
        transferring heat to a low temperature source at a first heat
        exchanger and thereafter pumped to a higher pressure. The
        expanding takes place in a first expansion stage and a second
        expansion stage, and a stream of partially expanded fluid is
        extracted between the stages and combined with the lean stream.
        A separator between the expander stages separates a partially
        expanded fluid into vapor and liquid portions, and some or all
        of the vapor portion is fed to the second stage, and some of the
        vapor portion can be combined with the liquid portion and then
        combined with the lean stream. A second heat exchanger
        recuperatively transfers heat from the reconstituted
        multicomponent working stream (prior to condensing) to the
        condensed multicomponent working stream at a higher pressure. A
        third heat exchanger transfers heat from the lean stream to the
        working stream after the second heat exchanger. The working
        stream is split into two substreams, one of which is heated with
        the external heat, the other of which is heated at a fourth heat
        exchanger with heat from the lean stream; the two streams are
        then combined to provide the heated gaseous working stream that
        is separated at the separator. </p>
      <p>Embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the
        following advantages. Embodiments of the invention can achieve
        efficiency of conversion of low temperature heat to electric
        power that exceeds the efficiency of standard Rankine cycles. </p>
      <p>Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent
        from the following detailed description of particular
        embodiments and from the claims. </p>

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, a system for implementing a thermodynamic
        cycle to obtain useful energy (e.g., mechanical and then
        electrical energy) from an external heat source is shown. In the
        described example, the external heat source is a stream of low
        temperature waste-heat water that flows in the path represented
        by points 25-26 through heat exchanger HE-5 and heats working
        stream 117-17 of the closed thermodynamic cycle. Table 1
        presents the conditions at the numbered points indicated on FIG.
        1. A typical output from the system is presented in Table 5. </p>
      <p>The working stream of the FIG. 1 system is a multicomponent
        working stream that includes a low boiling component and a high
        boiling component. Such a preferred working stream may be an
        ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons, or the like. In
        general, the working stream may be mixtures of any number of
        compounds with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and
        solubility. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a mixture of
        water and ammonia is used. In the system shown in FIG. 1, the
        working stream has the same composition from point 13 to point
        19. </p>
      <p>Beginning the discussion of the FIG. 1 system at the exit of
        turbine T, the stream at point 34 is referred to as the
        expanded, spent rich stream. This stream is considered "rich" in
        lower boiling point component. It is at a low pressure and will
        be mixed with a leaner, absorbing stream having parameters as at
        point 12 to produce the working stream of intermediate
        composition having parameters as at point 13. The stream at
        point 12 is considered "lean" in lower boiling point component.
      </p>
      <p>At any given temperature, the working stream (of intermediate
        composition) at point 13 can be condensed at a lower pressure
        than the richer stream at point 34. This permits more power to
        be extracted from the turbine T, and increases the efficiency of
        the process. </p>
      <p>The working stream at point 13 is partially condensed. This
        stream enters heat exchanger HE-2, where it is cooled and exits
        the heat exchanger HE-2 having parameters as at point 29. It is
        still partially, not completely, condensed. The stream now
        enters heat exchanger HE-1 where it is cooled by stream 23-24 of
        cooling water, and is thereby completely condensed, obtaining
        parameters as at point 14. The working stream having parameters
        as at point 14 is then pumped to a higher pressure obtaining
        parameters as at point 21. The working stream at point 21 then
        enters heat exchanger HE-2 where it is recuperatively heated by
        the working stream at points 13-29 (see above) to a point having
        parameters as at point 15. The working stream having parameters
        as at point 15 enters heat exchanger HE-3 where it is heated and
        obtains parameters as at point 16. In a typical design, point 16
        may be precisely at the boiling point but it need not be. The
        working stream at point 16 is split into two substreams; first
        working substream 117 and second working substream 118. The
        first working substream having parameters as at point 117 is
        sent into heat exchanger HE-5, leaving with parameters as at
        point 17. It is heated by the external heat source, stream
        25-26. The other substream, second working substream 118, enters
        heat exchanger HE-4 in which it is heated recuperatively,
        obtaining parameters as at point 18. The two working substreams,
        17 and 18, which have exited heat exchangers HE-4 and HE-5, are
        combined to form a heated, gaseous working stream having
        parameters as at point 19. This stream is in a state of partial,
        or possibly complete, vaporization. In the preferred embodiment,
        point 19 is only partially vaporized. The working stream at
        point 19 has the same intermediate composition which was
        produced at point 13, completely condensed at point 14, pumped
        to a high pressure at point 21, and preheated to point 15 and to
        point 16. It enters the separator S. There, it is separated into
        a rich saturated vapor, termed the "heated gaseous rich stream"
        and having parameters as at point 30, and a lean saturated
        liquid, termed the "lean stream" and having parameters as at
        point 7. The lean stream (saturated liquid) at point 7 enters
        heat exchanger HE-4 where it is cooled while heating working
        stream 118-18 (see above). The lean stream at point 9 exits heat
        exchanger HE-4 having parameters as at point 8. It is throttled
        to a suitably chosen pressure, obtaining parameters as at point
        9. </p>
      <p>Returning now to point 30, the heated gaseous rich stream
        (saturated vapor) exits separator S. This stream enters turbine
        T where it is expanded to lower pressures, providing useful
        mechanical energy to turbine T used to generate electricity. A
        partially expanded stream having parameters as at point 32 is
        extracted from the turbine T at an intermediate pressure
        (approximately the pressure as at point 9) and this extracted
        stream 32 (also referred to as a "second portion" of a partially
        expanded rich stream, the "first portion" being expanded
        further) is mixed with the lean stream at point 9 to produce a
        combined stream having parameters as at point 10. The lean
        stream having parameters as at point 9 serves as an absorbing
        stream for the extracted stream 32. The resulting stream (lean
        stream and second portion) having parameters as at point 10
        enters heat exchanger HE-3 where it is cooled, while heating
        working stream 15-16, to a point having parameters as at point
        11. The stream having parameters as at point 11 is then
        throttled to the pressure of point 34, obtaining parameters as
        at point 12. </p>
      <p>Returning to turbine T, not all of the turbine inflow was
        extracted at point 32 in a partially expanded state. The
        remainder, referred to as the first portion, is expanded to a
        suitably chosen low pressure and exits the turbine T at point
        34. The cycle is closed. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the extraction at point 32
        has the same composition as the streams at points 30 and 34. In
        the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the turbine is shown as first
        turbine stage T-1 and second turbine stage T-2, with the
        partially expanded rich stream leaving the higher pressure stage
        T-1 of the turbine at point 31. Conditions at the numbered
        points shown on FIG. 2 are presented in Table 2. A typical
        output from the FIG. 2 system is presented in Table 6. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 2, the partially expanded rich stream from
        first turbine stage T-1 is divided into a first portion at 33
        that is expanded further at lower pressure turbine stage T-2,
        and a second portion at 32 that is combined with the lean stream
        at 9. The partially expanded rich stream enters separator S-2,
        where it is separated into a vapor portion and a liquid portion.
        The composition of the second portion at 32 may be chosen in
        order to optimize its effectiveness when it is mixed with the
        stream at point 9. Separator S-2 permits stream 32 to be as lean
        as the saturated liquid at the pressure and temperature obtained
        in the separator S-2; in that case, stream 33 would be a
        saturated vapor at the conditions obtained in the separator S-2.
        By choice of the amount of mixing at stream 133, the amount of
        saturated liquid and the saturated vapor in stream 32 can be
        varied. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 3, this embodiment differs from the
        embodiment of FIG. 1, in that the heat exchanger HE-4 has been
        omitted, and there is no extraction of a partially expanded
        stream from the turbine stage. In the FIG. 3 embodiment, the hot
        stream exiting the separator S is admitted directly into heat
        exchanger HE-3. Conditions at the numbered points shown on FIG.
        3 are presented in Table 3. A typical output from the system is
        presented in Table 7. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 4, this embodiment differs from the FIG. 3
        embodiment in omitting heat exchanger HE-2. Conditions at the
        numbered points shown on FIG. 4 are presented in Table 4. A
        typical output from the system is presented in Table 8. While
        omitting heat exchanger HE-2 reduces the efficiency of the
        process, it may be economically advisable in circumstances where
        the increased power given up will not pay for the cost of the
        heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>In general, standard equipment may be utilized in carrying out
        the method of this invention. Thus, equipment such as heat
        exchangers, tanks, pumps, turbines, valves and fittings of the
        type used in a typical Rankine cycles, may be employed in
        carrying out the method of this invention. </p>
      <p>In the described embodiments of the invention, the working
        fluid is expanded to drive a turbine of conventional type.
        However, the expansion of the working fluid from a charged high
        pressure level to a spent low pressure level to release energy
        may be effected by any suitable conventional means known to
        those skilled in the art. The energy so released may be stored
        or utilized in accordance with any of a number of conventional
        methods known to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>The separators of the described embodiments can be
        conventionally used gravity separators, such as conventional
        flash tanks. Any conventional apparatus used to form two or more
        streams having different compositions from a single stream may
        be used to form the lean stream and the enriched stream from the
        fluid working stream. </p>
      <p>The condenser may be any type of known heat rejection device.
        For example, the condenser may take the form of a heat
        exchanger, such as a water cooled system, or another type of
        condensing device. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention.<br>
