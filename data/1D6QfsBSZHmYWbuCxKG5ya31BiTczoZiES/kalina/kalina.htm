      <p>Seventeen years ago, Russian èmigrè Alexander Kalina arrived in
        Houston, Texas, with $5.36 in his pocket and a plan. That plan
        has now borne fruit in a process that will considerably reduce
        global fuel consumption by improving the efficiency of
        steam-driven power plants, which produce more than two-thirds of
        the world's energy. If U.S. plants had the new technology, they
        could save $6 billion a year, according to a Department of
        Energy (DOE) study. </p>
      <p>Kalina's invention has drawn the attention of prominent
        investors and is now licensed to such major manufacturers of
        power-plant equipment as General Electric, ABB, Europe's Ansaldo
        Energia, and Japan's Ebara Corporation. </p>
      <p>The steam power plant now used to make electricity was invented
        150 years ago by Scottish engineer William Rankine. It uses a
        heat source-coal, oil, natural gas, geothermal heat-to produce
        high-pressure steam that drives a turbine. The excess steam is
        condensed into water, which is then pumped back to a boiler. In
        a Rankine cycle only about 35 to 40 percent of the heat energy
        released ever becomes electricity. That means that of the $40
        billion spent each year in the United States to fuel steam power
        plants, nearly $25 billion is lost. And that figure is matched
        in excess pollution and excess depletion of resources. </p>
      <p>Mixing the water with ammonia --- which evaporates at lower
        temperatures --- can raise efficiency at the heat stage of the
        cycle. But ammonia also condenses less readily, forcing
        engineers to use smaller turbines and lowering efficiency.
        Kalinas' invention solves that problem, using sophisticated
        thermodynamics to draw off most of the ammonia before the
        condensation stage. Engineers traditionally strain for
        productivity gains of 1 percent; a Kalina cycle can boost
        efficiency by as much as 40 percent. </p>
      <p>In 1991 the first Kalina power plan went online at an
        experimental site run by the DOE in Canoga Park, California.
        Built with funds from Australian scientist and inventor Ronald
        Wise, it can supply enough power for more than 1,000 houses.
        Stephan Schmidheiny, a principal of the Swatch watch company,
        and well-known speculator George Soros have each purchased 20
        percent shares in Kalina's Exergy Corporation. In 1994 the DOE
        awarded Exergy a $7 million grant for a geothermal plant in
        Steamboat, Nevada, on which construction will begin later this
        year. Once it's operational, the DOE will compare its
        performance with that of two Rankine geothermal plants now in
        operation there. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Kalina Cycle Goes Commercial; Energy
              Commission Accepts First Royalty Payment</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Claudia Chandler</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Kalina Cycle, a Russian emigre's dream of making thermal
        power plants up to 50 percent more efficient, is on the road to
        commercial reality. And the company that developed the
        technology, has begun paying back the California Energy
        Commission royalties on the state's investment. Exergy Inc. of
        Hayward has made the first royalty payment of $250,000 to the
        Commission for funding the innovation during its infancy. </p>
      <p>"Technologies such as this offer win-win opportunities for
        California energy producers, consumers and taxpayers," said
        Governor Pete Wilson. "Not only has the state supported advances
        in energy efficiency, but California is reaping a share of its
        commercial success." </p>
      <p>The technology is the creation of Dr. Alexander Kalina, who
        left a high position in the Soviet Union 18 years ago to come to
        the United States to develop this advanced thermodynamic cycle.
        He formed Exergy Inc. to commercialize the technology. </p>
      <p>The technology uses a mix of water and ammonia rather than
        water alone to supply the heat recovery system for electricity
        generation in a power plant. Because ammonia has a much lower
        boiling point than water, the Kalina cycle is able to begin
        spinning the steam turbine at much lower temperatures than
        typically associated with the conventional steam boiler/turbine
        systems. Similarly, the lower boiling point of ammonia allows
        additional energy to be obtained on the condenser side of the
        steam turbine. </p>
      <p>Under its Energy Technologies Advancement Program (ETAP) the
        Energy Commission awarded the project $2.25 million to co-fund a
        pilot plant in Canoga Park. Under the terms of a royalty
        agreement, Exergy will pay back total royalties of $6.75 million
        over a period of time based on its gross revenues. The Energy
        Commission plows back the royalty funds into ETAP to fund future
        projects, thus providing a mechanism for a successful project to
        fund other ETAP projects. </p>
      <p>The Canoga Park plant at the U.S. Department of Energy's
        Engineering Center, has a capacity of six megawatts. It has sold
        power to the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International and
        Southern California Edison since 1992. </p>
      <p>In 1993, General Electric signed an agreement with Exergy for a
        worldwide exclusive licensing rights to use the technology for
        combined-cycle systems in the 50 to 150 megawatt range. GE and
        Exergy are proposing a 110 megawatt combined-cycle project in
        Livingston, California that will operate at 55 percent
        efficiency. In addition, GE and Exergy currently have on the
        drawing board a combined-cycle plant that will operate on an
        overall efficiency above 62 percent. </p>
      <p>Exergy has also signed agreements with Ansaldo Energia of
        Italy, ABB and Ebara Corporation of Japan for use of the Kalina
        cycle technology in geotheral, waste incineration and
        direct-fired coal applications. </p>
      <p>The Governor, noting the company's successful ventures abroad
        said: "Exports of environmentally-friendly energy technology
        sharpen California's competitive edge in global markets,
        harnessing the international trade and investment that have been
        so critical to the California comeback." </p>
      <p>The Kalina cycle can be used with any fuel, geotheral source or
        excess energy. Exergy predicts that with the Kalina technology,
        geotheral plants can post an efficiency gain of up to 50 percent
        while coal-fired plants will operate 20 percent more efficiently
        with the technology. </p>
      <p>Through ETAP, the Energy Commission assists California energy
        research and development companies make energy technologies more
        efficient or cost-effective, and to help develop alternative
        sources of energy. </p>
      <p>ETAP leverages funds from private companies toward each
        project. Since its establishment by the Rosenthal-Naylor Act in
        1984, the program has funded 68 projects totalling more than
        $23.4 million, with project sponsors providing more than $175
        million in matching funds. The projects provide research,
        development and manufacturing jobs and tax revenues to state and
        local governments. </p>
      <p>The Kalina cycle was one of the first projects funded by ETAP,
        the first to sign a royalty agreement and the first to pay
        royalties to the Commission. </p>

    <blockquote><b>Description</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>This invention relates to the generation of energy by
      means of a working fluid, and to the regeneration of a working
      fluid. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of
      and to apparatus for generating energy by means of a working fluid
      and for regenerating such a working fluid. In the generation of
      energy by expansion of a working fluid, the energy which can be
      produced by expansion of the working fluid is limited by the
      temperatures at which heating and cooling mediums can economically
      be provided for regeneration of the working fluid. The result is,
      therefore, that such a working fluid is expanded from a high
      pressure charged level to a low pressure spent level, with the
      high pressure charged level being governed by the maximum pressure
      at which the working fluid can be evaporated with the available
      heating medium, and with the spent low pressure level being
      governed by the minimum pressure at which the working fluid can be
      condensed with the available cooling medium. In practice,
      therefore, expansion of the working fluid is controlled to provide
      a spent low pressure level at which the condensation temperature
      of the working fluid is greater than the temperature of the
      cooling medium, to permit condensation of the working fluid. In
      addition, in practice, regeneration is based on condensation of
      working fluid in a condenser wherein the working fluid is arranged
      to flow in heat exchange relationship with an available cooling
      medium. Because of the desire to achieve maximum expansion of the
      working fluid, regeneration of working fluid is often effected
      where the temperature difference between the condensation
      temperature of the spent working fluid at the spent level and the
      temperature of the available cooling medium is marginal --- often
      as low as 1.degree. C. This of necessity imposes a requirement for
      a large condenser with an extensive heat exchange surface, and for
      a large supply of cooling medium, thereby substantially adding to
      the operating costs. This is particularly significant where severe
      restraints are imposed by the temperatures of available heating
      and cooling mediums as in the case of ocean thermal energy
      conversion systems. In accordance with one aspect of this
      invention, there is provided a method of generating energy, which
      comprises expanding a gaseous working fluid from a charged high
      pressure level to a spent low pressure level to release energy,
      and regenerating the spent working fluid by, in a plurality of
      successive regeneration stages: (a) condensing the working fluid
      in an absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution
      while cooling with a cooling medium, the solvent solution
      comprising a solvent having an initial working fluid concentration
      which is sufficient to provide a solvent solution boiling range
      suitable for absorption of the working fluid;
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid, and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated by heating in an evaporation stage; </p>
      <p>(c) feeding the evaporated working fluid to a succeeding
        regeneration stage; </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid, to constitute the
        solvent solution for the absorption stage of that regeneration
        stage; and </p>
      <p>(e) withdrawing regenerated charged working fluid from a final
        regeneration stage for re-expansion to release energy; </p>
      <p>The working fluid may be expanded to a spent low pressure level
        where the condensation temperature of the gaseous working fluid
        is below the minimum temperature of the cooling medium in the
        absorption stage. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is
        provided a method of optimizing, within limits imposed by
        available sources of cooling and heating mediums, the energy
        supply capability of a gaseous working fluid which is expanded
        from a charged high pressure level to a spent low pressure level
        to provide available energy, the method comprising expanding the
        gaseous working fluid to a spent low pressure level where the
        condensation temperature of the working fluid is below the
        minimum temperature of the available cooling medium, and
        regenerating the spent working fluid by, in a plurality of
        successive incremental regeneration stages: </p>
      <p>(a) condensing the working fluid being regenerated in an
        absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution while
        cooling with the cooling medium, the solvent solution comprising
        a solvent having an initial working fluid concentration which is
        sufficient to provide a solvent solution boiling range suitable
        for absorption of the working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid, and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated by heating in an evaporation stage with the
        available heating medium; </p>
      <p>(c) feeding the evaporated working fluid to a succeeding
        regeneration stage for condensation; </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid being regenerated, to
        constitute the solvent solution for the absorption stage of that
        regeneration stage; and </p>
      <p>(e) withdrawing regenerated working fluid from a final
        regeneration stage. </p>
      <p>Further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a
        method of optimizing, within limits imposed by available sources
        of cooling and heating mediums, the energy supply capability of
        a gaseous working fluid which is expanded from a charged high
        pressure level to a spent low pressure level to provide
        available energy, the method comprising expanding the gaseous
        working fluid to a spent low pressure level, and regenerating
        the spent working fluid by, in a plurality of successive
        regeneration stages, condensing the working fluid and then
        evaporating the working fluid at an increased pressure, the
        working fluid being condensed in each regeneration stage by
        absorbing or dissolving it in a solvent solution while cooling
        with the cooling medium, the solvent solution comprising a
        solvent having, in each stage, an initial working fluid
        concentration which is sufficient to provide a solvent solution
        boiling range suitable for absorption of the working fluid, and
        the working fluid being evaporated in each stage by increasing
        the pressure to a level where the working fluid being
        regenerated can be evaporated with the available heating medium,
        and then evaporating the working fluid. </p>
      <p>The invention further extends to apparatus for generating
        energy, the apparatus comprising expansion means for expanding a
        gaseous working fluid from a charged high pressure level to a
        spent low pressure level to release energy, and a plurality of
        successive regeneration stages for regenerating such a spent
        working fluid, each regeneration stage comprising: </p>
      <p>(a) an absorber for receiving both a spent working fluid and a
        solvent solution for dissolving or absorbing the spent working
        fluid, the absorber having circulation means for circulating a
        cooling medium through it to cool it; </p>
      <p>(b) a pump for pumping a resultant solvent solution from the
        absorber to increase its pressure; </p>
      <p>(c) an evaporator for receiving a resultant solvent solution
        from the pump, the evaporator having circulation means for
        circulating a heating medium through it to heat it to evaporate
        such a working fluid to be regenerated; </p>
      <p>(d) a separator for separating such an evaporated working fluid
        being regenerated, from such a solvent solution; </p>
      <p>(e) feed means to feed such an evaporated working fluid to the
        absorber of a succeeding regeneration stage; </p>
      <p>(f) recycle means for recycling a solvent solution from the
        separator to the condenser; </p>
      <p>and a feed conduit for feeding a regenerated working fluid from
        the separator of a final regeneration stage to the expansion
        means. </p>
      <p>Since the solvent solution in each regeneration stage is
        recycled, the solvent solution constitutes a closed loop in that
        stage, and is separate from the solvent solution in each other
        regeneration stage. Furthermore, in each regeneration stage, the
        quantity of working fluid being regenerated is dissolved in the
        solvent solution of that stage, and the equivalent quantity of
        working fluid being regenerated is evaporated from the solvent
        solution in the evaporation stage of each regeneration stage. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the quantity of solvent solution,
        and the initial concentration of working fluid in the solvent
        solution in each regeneration stage will be separately adjusted
        as may be required for specific operating conditions, and as may
        be required for variations in the minimum temperature level of
        an available cooling medium. </p>
      <p>The solvent of the solvent solution may be any suitable solvent
        which is a solvent for the working fluid, which has a boiling
        point above the maximum temperature which will be attained in
        any evaporation stage, and which will provide a solvent solution
        when working fluid is dissolved therein, which has a boiling
        point which decreases as the concentration of working fluid
        increases. </p>
      <p>While the solvent solution is preferably a binary solution, it
        will be appreciated that it may be a solution of a plurality of
        liquids. </p>
      <p>A number of working fluids which would be suitable, are known
        to those skilled in the art. Any of such working fluids may be
        employed in this invention. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the working fluid and
        solvent may be in the form of hydrocarbons having appropriate
        boiling points. Thus, for example, the solvent may be in the
        form of butane or pentane while the working fluid may be in the
        form of propane. In an alternative example, the working fluid
        may be an appropriate freon compound, with the solvent being an
        appropriate solvent for that compound. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the working fluid
        is in the form of ammonia and the solvent is in the form of
        water. In this embodiment of the invention, at a pressure of one
        atmosphere the boiling point of water is 100.degree. C. whereas
        the boiling point of pure ammonia is -33.degree. C. As the
        concentration of ammonia in water increases, the boiling point
        of the aqueous ammonia solution will decrease. From binary phase
        diagrams of water and ammonia solutions, the appropriate initial
        concentration of ammonia in the solvent solution for each
        regeneration stage, can readily be determined for this invention
        from the pressure and temperature which will prevail in each
        condensation stage. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the initial
        concentration of working fluid in the solvent solution in each
        regeneration stage, and the proportion of solvent solution to
        working fluid to be regenerated will be selected so that after
        complete absorption of the working fluid being regenerated in
        the absorption stage of that regeneration stage, the solvent
        solution will have a boiling point marginally above the minimum
        temperature attained in that absorption stage during use. </p>
      <p>In practice, therefore, the minimum quantity of solvent
        solution will be employed which will satisfy this requirement
        thereby reducing cooling medium requirements to the minimum, and
        thereby further reducing heating medium requirements to the
        minimum. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that since the pressure is increased
        between the absorption stage and evaporation stage of each
        regeneration stage, there will be a step-wise or incremental
        increase in pressure between each preceeding regeneration stage
        and each succeeding regeneration stage. It follows, therefore,
        that the initial concentration of working fluid in the solvent
        solution for each successive regeneration stage will be
        correspondingly higher to provide a boiling range for the
        solvent solution in each stage which is suitable for dissolving
        or absorbing the working fluid at the pressure prevailing in
        that stage. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pressure is
        increased between the absorption and evaporation stages of each
        regeneration stage, to the maximum pressure at which the working
        fluid being regenerated can be evaporated effectively in the
        evaporation stage by the, or by a heating medium, available for
        heating the evaporation stage. </p>
      <p>The pressure is, therefore, preferably increased in each
        regeneration stage to the maximum level where the solvent
        solution in each evaporation stage will, after evaporation of
        the working fluid in that stage, have a boiling point marginally
        below the maximum temperature attainable in that evaporation
        stage. </p>
      <p>By appropriate control of the pressure, evaporation of the
        required quantity of working fluid being regenerated can be
        readily effected in each evaporation stage. Control valve means
        may, however, be provided to control the quantity of evaporated
        working fluid which is fed from each regeneration stage to each
        succeeding regeneration stage. Thus, if a greater quantity of
        working fluid than that required for regeneration has been
        evaporated in an evaporator stage, only the required quantity
        will pass to the succeeding regeneration stage. The balance will
        be recycled with the solvent solution. </p>
      <p>The method of this invention may preferably include the step
        of, in each regeneration stage, feeding the solvent solution and
        evaporated working fluid from the evaporation stage to a
        separation stage for separating the working fluid being
        regenerated. </p>
      <p>The separator stage may be provided by a separator of any
        conventional suitable type known to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>The solvent solution which is recycled to the absorption stage
        in each regeneration stage, is conveniently expanded to reduce
        its pressure to a pressure corresponding with or approaching
        that of the pressure of the working fluid being regenerated in
        that absorption stage. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in each
        regeneration stage, the solvent solution which is recycled, is
        recycled in heat exchange relationship with the evaporation
        stage to thereby reduce the heating medium requirements for the
        evaporation stage. </p>
      <p>The solvent solution which is recycled in each regeneration
        stage, may be recycled at least partially in heat exchange
        relationship with the absorption stage. </p>
      <p>Where the recycled solvent solution is recycled in heat
        exchange relationship with an absorption stage, the cooling
        medium requirement will decrease because the quantity of heat to
        be removed will remain constant, but the capacity of the
        absorption stage will have to be increased. Conversely, if the
        recycled solvent solution is not recycled in heat exchange
        relationship with the absorption stage, the capacity of the
        absorption stage will decrease while the requirement of cooling
        medium will increase. </p>
      <p>In practice, therefore, depending upon the source and
        availability of the cooling medium, on the basis of economic
        considerations, the reduced cost of supplying lesser quantities
        of cooling medium can be balanced against the capital costs of
        increasing the capacity of the absorption stages to determine
        whether the recycled solvent solution should be recycled in heat
        exchange relationship, or at least partially in heat exchange
        relationship with the absorption stages, or not at all. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment of the invention, all of the absorption stages
        of the regeneration stages may be carried out separately in a
        single composite absorption stage which is cooled by means of
        cooling medium from a common source. Furthermore, all of the
        evaporation stages may be carried out separately in a single
        composite evaporation stage which is heated by means of a
        heating medium from a common source. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of this invention may, therefore, include a
        single composite absorption unit and a single composite
        evaporation unit, with all the absorbers of the various
        regeneration stages being incorporated in the absorption unit,
        and all the evaporators of the various regeneration stages being
        incorporated in the evaporated unit. </p>
      <p>While this invention may have various applications, and while
        various types of cooling and heating means known to those
        skilled in the art, may be employed, this invention can have
        particular application in regard to the utilization of readily
        and economically available cooling and heating mediums for the
        generation of energy. </p>
      <p>The invention can, therefore, have specific application where
        low temperature differential heating and cooling mediums are
        employed. </p>
      <p>A preferred application of the invention would, therefore, be
        in the field of thermal energy conversion using cool water
        withdrawn from a sufficient depth from a body of water as the
        cooling medium, and using, as heating medium, surface water from
        a body of water, solar heating, surface water heated
        additionally by solar heating means, or water or heating fluid
        in the form of waste heat fluids from industrial plants. </p>
      <p>A preferred application of the invention would, therefore, be
        in the field of ocean thermal energy conversion [OTEC] where
        ocean surface water is used as the heating medium and ocean
        water withdrawn from a sufficient depth from an ocean is used as
        the cooling medium, thereby resulting in a low temperature
        differential between the heating and cooling mediums. </p>
      <p>Normally, ocean water would be withdrawn from a depth of about
        200 feet to provide the most economical cooling medium at the
        lowest temperature. The temperature does not tend to decrease
        significantly beyond a depth of about 200 feet. </p>
      <p>The invention further extends to a method of increasing the
        pressure of a gaseous working fluid from an initial low pressure
        level to a high pressure level utilizing an available heating
        medium and utilizing an available cooling medium, which
        comprises incrementally increasing the pressure of the working
        fluid by, in a plurality of successive incremental regeneration
        stages: </p>
      <p>(a) absorbing the working fluid being regenerated in an
        absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution while
        cooling with such an available cooling medium; the solvent
        solution comprising a solvent having an initial working fluid
        concentration which is sufficient to provide a solvent solution
        boiling range suitable for absorption of the working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid, and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated in an evaporation stage by heating with such
        an available heating medium; </p>
      <p>(c) feeding the evaporated working fluid which is at an
        increased pressure level, to a succeeding regeneration stage for
        absorption; </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid being regenerated, to
        constitute the solvent solution for the absorption stage of that
        regeneration stage; and </p>
      <p>(e) withdrawing regenerated working fluid from a final
        regeneration stage. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is
        provided a method of generating energy, which comprises
        expanding a gaseous working fluid from a charged high pressure
        level to a spent low pressure level to release energy, and
        regenerating the spent working fluid by, in at least one
        regeneration stage: </p>
      <p>(a) condensing the working fluid in an absorption stage by
        dissolving it in a solvent solution while cooling with a cooling
        medium, the solvent solution comprising a solvent having an
        initial working fluid concentration which is sufficient to
        provide a solvent solution boiling range suitable for absorption
        of the working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated by heating in an evaporation stage; </p>
      <p>(c) withdrawing the evaporated working fluid for re-expansion
        to release energy; and </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid, to constitute the
        solvent solution for the absorption stage of that regeneration
        stage. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is
        provided a method of optimizing, within limits imposed by
        available sources of cooling and heating mediums, the energy
        supply capability of a gaseous working fluid which is expanded
        from a charged high pressure level to a spent low pressure level
        to provide available energy, the method comprising expanding the
        gaseous working fluid to a spent low pressure level, and
        regenerating the spent working fluid by, in at least one
        regeneration stage: </p>
      <p>(a) condensing the working fluid being regenerated in an
        absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution while
        cooling with the cooling medium, the solvent solution comprising
        a solvent having an initial working fluid concentration which is
        sufficient to provide a solvent solution boiling range suitable
        for absorption of the working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid, and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated by heating in an evaporation stage with the
        available heating medium; </p>
      <p>(c) withdrawing the evaporated working fluid to constitute a
        charged working fluid; and </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid being regenerated, to
        constitute the solvent solution for the absorption stage of that
        regeneration stage. </p>
      <p>The invention further extends to a method of optimizing, within
        limits imposed by available sources of cooling and heating
        mediums, the energy supply capability of a gaseous working fluid
        which is expanded from a charged high pressure level to a spent
        low pressure level to provide available energy, the method
        comprising expanding the gaseous working fluid to a spent low
        pressure level where the condensation temperature of the working
        fluid is below the minimum temperature of the available cooling
        medium, and regenerating the spent working fluid by absorbing
        the working fluid and then evaporating the working fluid at an
        increased pressure, the working fluid being absorbed in an
        absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution while
        cooling with the cooling medium, the solvent solution comprising
        a solvent having an initial working fluid concentration which is
        sufficient to provide a solvent solution boiling range suitable
        for absorption of the working fluid, and the working fluid being
        evaporated in an evaporator stage by increasing the pressure and
        then evaporating the working fluid being regenerated with the
        available heating medium. </p>
      <p>The invention further extends to a method of increasing the
        pressure of a gaseous working fluid from an initial low pressure
        level to a high pressure level utilizing an available heating
        medium and utilizing an available cooling medium having a
        temperature which need not be below the condensation temperature
        of the low pressure working fluid, which comprises: </p>
      <p>(a) condensing the working fluid being regenerated in an
        absorption stage by dissolving it in a solvent solution while
        cooling with such an available cooling medium; the solvent
        solution comprising a solvent having an initial working fluid
        concentration which is sufficient to provide a solvent solution
        boiling range suitable for absorption of the working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the solvent solution containing
        the dissolved working fluid, and evaporating the working fluid
        being regenerated in an evaporation stage by heating with such
        an available heating medium; </p>
      <p>(c) recovering the evaporated working fluid which is at the
        increased pressure level; and </p>
      <p>(d) recycling the balance of the solvent solution remaining
        after evaporation of the working fluid being regenerated, to
        constitute the solvent solution for the absorption stage. </p>
      <p>The expansion of the working fluid from a charged high pressure
        level to a spent low pressure level to release energy may be
        effected by any suitable conventional means known to those
        skilled in the art, and the energy so released may be stored or
        utilized in accordance with any of a number of conventional
        methods known to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the working fluid
        may be expanded to drive a turbine of conventional type. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment of the invention, where the mass ratio between
        the solvent solution being recycled through an absorption stage
        and the working fluid being regenerated is sufficient, the
        pressure of the solvent solution leaving the evaporation stage
        may be utilized to increase the pressure of the working fluid
        being regenerated which is introduced into the absorption stage
        with the recycled solvent solution. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of the invention, instead of expanding the
        solvent solution which is recycled to reduce its pressure to a
        pressure corresponding with or approaching that of the pressure
        of the working fluid being regenerated in an absorption stage,
        the solvent solution may be injected into the absorption stage
        in such a manner as to entrain the working fluid and draw the
        working fluid into the absorption stage. </p>
      <p>Various injection systems are known to those skilled in the art
        which could be used for this purpose. As an example, an
        injection system such as an injection nozzle having a restricted
        zone to create a zone of low pressure may be used. With such an
        injection nozzle, the working fluid will be introduced into the
        proximity of the restricted zone so that the reduced pressure
        created will permit the working fluid to be introduced into the
        absorption stage. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that, depending upon relative flow rates
        and pressures, it may still be necessary to control the pressure
        of the recycled solvent solution by expanding it to provide an
        appropriate pressure. </p>
      <p>By utilizing the pressure, or at least part of the pressure, of
        the solvent solution which is recycled, this will contribute to
        an increase in pressure in the absorption stage. This can
        provide the advantage of improving absorption in the absorption
        stage, or can be utilized to permit expansion of the working
        fluid to an even lower spent level. In this event, the initial
        increase in pressure provided by the solvent solution may be
        utilized to increase the pressure in the absorption stage, to a
        level where absorption can be effectively achieved in accordance
        with this invention. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that this application of the pressure of the
        solvent solution will tend to be valuable in the first stage,
        and probably the first and second stages of a multi-stage
        regeneration system while, in a single stage system or a system
        employing only two stages it will tend to be less valuable. This
        will primarily be due to the fact that the mass ratio between
        the recycled solvent solution and the working fluid will not be
        sufficient. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments of the invention are now described by way
        of example with reference to the accompany drawings. </p>

      <p>With reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings, numeral 50 refers
        generally to apparatus for use in generating energy by the
        expansion of a gaseous working fluid from a charged high
        pressure level to a spent low pressure level to release energy,
        and for regenerating the spent working fluid. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 50 includes expansion means in the form of a
        turbine 52 in which a gaseous working fluid is expanded from a
        charged high pressure level to a spent low pressure level to
        released energy to drive the turbine 52. The gaseous working
        fluid at the high pressure level is fed to the turbine 52 along
        charged line 54 and is discharged from the turbine 52 along
        spent line 56. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 50 further includes regeneration means for
        regenerating the spent gaseous fluid. The regeneration means
        comprises four successive incremental regeneration stages. </p>
      <p>For ease of reference the components of each regeneration stage
        have been identified by a letter followed by a suffix in arabic
        numerals indicating the particular regeneration stage. In
        addition, the flow lines for each regeneration stage have been
        identified by reference numerals having a prefix corresponding
        to that of the particular regeneration stage. </p>
      <p>The first regeneration stage comprises an absorber A1 for
        condensing the gaseous working fluid by dissolving it in a
        solvent solution, a pump P1 for pumping the solvent solution
        containing the dissolved working fluid to increase the pressure,
        evaporator E1 for evaporating the working fluid, and a separator
        S1 for separating the evaporated working fluid from the solvent
        solution. </p>
      <p>The first regeneration stage includes an influent line 1-1 into
        which the spent gaseous working fluid from the spent line 56 and
        solvent solution from a solvent solution recycle line 1-13 are
        fed into the first stage and through the absorber A1. </p>
      <p>The resultant solvent solution from the absorber A1 is fed
        along line 1-2 to the inlet of the pump P1. The solution is
        discharged from the pump P1 at an increased pressure along line
        1-3 and through the evaporator E1. The solvent solution and
        evaporated working fluid are fed from the evaporator E1 along
        line 1-4 to the separator S1. The separated evaporated working
        fluid is fed from the separator S1 along line 1-5 to the
        influent line 2-1 of the second stage. The solvent solution from
        the separator S1 is recycled along solvent solution recycle line
        1-13 to the influent line 1-1. </p>
      <p>The second, third and fourth regeneration stages correspond
        exactly with the first regeneration stage except that the
        evaporated, separated working fluid from the separator S4 is
        withdrawn along line 4-5 and fed into the charged line 54 to
        repeat the cycle. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the gaseous
        working fluid is ammonia, whereas the solvent is water. In
        addition, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the
        apparatus 50 is an apparatus for use in producing energy by
        ocean thermal energy conversion. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 50 is, therefore, conveniently installed on the
        seashore or on a floating platform. In addition, the apparatus
        50 includes pump means [not shown] for pumping surface water
        from the surface of an ocean to the evaporators of the apparatus
        to constitute the heating medium for the apparatus, and includes
        pump means [not shown] for pumping cold water from a sufficient
        depth of such an ocean for constituting the cooling medium for
        cooling the absorbers of the apparatus 50. </p>
      <p>Thus, the absorber A1 includes circulation means having an
        inlet 1-9 and an outlet 1-10 for circulating deep ocean water
        through the absorber A1. Similarly, the evaporator E1 includes
        an inlet 1-11 and an outlet 1-12 for circulating ocean surface
        water through the evaporator for heating the evaporator E1. </p>
      <p>Further, in each regeneration stage, the recycle line 1-13,
        2-13, 3-13 and 4-13 has an evaporator heat exchange line 1-15,
        2-15, 3-15 and 4-15, respectively, passing in heat exchange
        relationship through the evaporator E. </p>
      <p>In addition, in each of the regeneration stages, the solvent
        solution recycle line -13 may have a condenser heat exchange
        line 1-16, 2-16, 3-16 and 4-16, respectively, extending in heat
        exchange relationship through the absorber A or, alternatively,
        may completely bypass the absorber A as indicated by
        chain-dotted lines 1-18, 2-18, 3-18 and 4-18. </p>
      <p>Where the recycled solvent solution passes in heat exchange
        relationship through the absorber of each regeneration stage, it
        will assist in cooling the absorber and will thus reduce the
        quantity of cooling water required to effect the required
        cooling in that absorber since the quantity of heat to be
        transferred will remain constant. It will, however, necessitate
        an increase in the absorber capacity and thus, in the absorber
        size. </p>
      <p>In practice, therefore, the capital cost of an increase in
        absorber size can be balanced against the cost of the additional
        quantity of cooling medium to decide, on the basis of pure
        economics, as to whether the recycle line should pass through
        the absorbers, should completely bypass the absorbers, or should
        pass partially through the absorbers. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the recycle lines
        will bypass the absorbers. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the gaseous
        working fluid is ammonia, whereas the solvent solution is a
        solution of ammonia in water. </p>
      <p>The use of the apparatus 50, and thus the process of this
        invention, is now described with reference to a preferred ocean
        thermal energy conversion system typically employing, as heating
        medium, surface water at a temperature of 27° C., and employing
        as cooling medium, deep ocean water [typically at a depth of not
        less than about 200 feet] having a temperature of about 4° C. </p>
      <p>Since the boiling point of pure ammonia is -33° C. at a
        pressure of one atmosphere, and since the minimum temperature of
        the cold water cooling medium is 4° C., it would normally not be
        possible to regenerate ammonia at a pressure of one atmosphere
        by using such a cooling medium. In other words, regeneration
        would only be possible if the ammonia working fluid were at a
        pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is above 4° C. </p>
      <p>In other words, regeneration of the gaseous working fluid would
        only be possible if the working fluid is expanded across the
        turbine 52 to a pressure at which it is capable of regeneration
        with the available cooling medium. This imposes a direct and
        severe limitation on the energy which can be generated since the
        maximum pressure to which the ammonia working fluid can be
        regenerated is also limited by the evaporation capacity of the
        hot water heating medium at 27° C. </p>
      <p>In practice, utilizing surface water at a temperature of about
        27° C., evaporation of ammonia in the final evaporator E4 can
        only be achieved in an effective manner at a maximum pressure of
        about nine atmospheres. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated, therefore, that if the working fluid
        can be expanded from a charged level of nine atmospheres to a
        spent level pressure of one atmosphere, as opposed to a spent
        level pressure of say only four atmospheres, the quantity of
        energy released will be increased substantially. </p>
      <p>In the preferred process as illustrated in FIG. 1, the gaseous
        ammonia working fluid is indeed allowed to expand across the
        turbine 52 from a pressure of about nine atmospheres to a
        pressure of about one atmosphere. </p>
      <p>A specific quantity of gaseous working fluid to be regenerated,
        at a spent pressure level of one atmosphere is, therefore fed to
        the first stage along influent line 1-1. </p>
      <p>This quantity of gaseous working fluid is condensed in the
        absorber A1 by dissolving it in a solvent solution which is fed
        along solvent solution recycle line 1-13 into the influent line
        1-1 at the same pressure of one atmosphere. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the solvent
        solutions will not be passed in heat exchange relationship
        through the absorbers. Thus, the spent gaseous ammonia, which
        may contain about 10% by weight of liquid ammonia, will be at a
        temperature of about -33° C., whereas the corresponding solvent
        solution will be at a temperature of about 8° C. </p>
      <p>The solvent solution comprises water having an initial ammonia
        concentration which is sufficient to provide a binary solution
        which at the pressure of one atmosphere, has a boiling point
        within the temperature range which will prevail in the absorber
        A1. Further, the proportion of solvent solution to the quantity
        of working fluid to be regenerated is such that after the
        solvent solution has dissolved the quantity of working fluid to
        be regenerated in the absorber A1, the resultant binary solution
        will have a concentration which will provide, at the pressure of
        one atmosphere, a boiling point marginally above the minimum
        temperature of the cooling medium. The boiling point of the
        solvent solution will thus be in the region of about 6° C. where
        the minimum temperature of the cold water is about 4° C. </p>
      <p>In this way it will be insured that the total quantity of
        working fluid to be regenerated will dissolve in the solvent
        solution, and that the minimum quantity of solvent solution to
        dissolve that quantity of gaseous ammonia will be employed
        thereby reducing the cold water requirements and the capacity of
        the absorber A1 to the practical minimum. </p>
      <p>The solvent solution containing the dissolved working fluid
        being regenerated, will leave the absorber A1 at a temperature
        of about 6° C. and at a pressure of one atmosphere, and is
        pumped by the pump P1 to the evaporator E1. </p>
      <p>The pump P1 is controlled to increase the pressure of the
        solvent solution to the maximum pressure at which the dissolved
        ammonia working fluid can be effectively evaporated in the
        evaporator E1 by means of the surface water heating medium at a
        maximum temperature of 27° C. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the pressure increase is controlled so that after
        evaporation of the quantity of working fluid being regenerated,
        the solvent solution in the evaporator E1 will have a boiling
        point marginally below 27° C., such as about 25° C. </p>
      <p>This pressure can readily be determined from a binary
        water/ammonia phase diagram in relation to the prevailing
        ammonia concentration and temperature range in the evaporator
        E1. </p>
      <p>It will naturally be appreciated that the initial concentration
        of ammonia in water for the solvent solution, as also the
        required quantity of solvent solution; which is fed to the
        absorber A1, can also readily be determined from such a phase
        diagram on the basis of the known pressure and temperature
        range. </p>
      <p>The evaporated working fluid and solvent solution are fed along
        line 1-4 to the separator S1, where they are allowed to
        separate. </p>
      <p>From the separator S1, the solvent solution, at a temperature
        of about 25° C. will be recycled along the solvent solution
        recycle line 1-13 to constitute the solvent solution for the
        first stage. The separated, evaporated ammonia working fluid at
        about 25° C. is fed from the separator S1 to the second
        regeneration stage along influent line 2-1. As in the case of
        the first regeneration stage, the quantity of working fluid
        being regenerated, is mixed with a solvent solution recycled
        from a separator S2 of the second regeneration stage along the
        solvent solution recycle line 2-13 for dissolving the working
        fluid in the absorber A2. </p>
      <p>Since the pressure in the absorber A2 will be greater than the
        pressure in the absorber A1, it follows that the initial
        concetration of ammonia in the solvent solution for the second
        stage will be correspondingly higher to insure that an
        appropriate boiling point is again provided for effectively
        dissolving or absorbing the working fluid being regenerated in
        the absorber A2. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the solvent solution which is
        recycled from the separator S to the absorber A in each stage
        leaves the separator S at a higher pressure than the pressure of
        the influent working fluid. Each solvent solution recycle line
        1-13, 2-13, 3-13 and 4-13, therefore, includes a
        pressure-reducing valve V1, V2, V3 and V4, respectively, for
        reducing the pressure of the recycled solvent solution to the
        same pressure as that of the influent working fluid being
        regenerated. </p>
      <p>For each successive regeneration stage, therefore, the initial
        concentration of ammonia in the solvent solution will increase
        step-wise in correspondence with the step-wise increase in
        pressure provided by the pump means in each stage. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the apparatus will include an
        appropriate number of regeneration stages until the quantity of
        working fluid being regenerated, has been regenerated to the
        appropriate charged high pressure level in a final regeneration
        stage such as the fourth regeneration stage shown in the
        drawing. It will further be appreciated that the spent pressure
        level to which the working fluid is expanded, will likewise
        determine the number of regeneration stages required. Thus if
        the working fluid is expanded to only say 3 atmospheres, only
        two or three regeneration stages may be required. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment illustrated in the drawing, the pump means P4
        will increase the pressure of the solvent solution to about nine
        atmospheres thereby yielding a charged regenerated working fluid
        at a pressure of about nine atmospheres which is withdrawn from
        the separator S4 and fed along the charged line 54 to the
        turbine 52. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that in the preferred embodiment of the
        invention, the process will be carried out as a continuous
        process in which a constant quantity of working fluid by unit
        time is continuously being expanded across the turbine 52 and is
        then continuously being regenerated in the regeneration means. </p>
      <p>To further illustrate the use of the invention in the preferred
        embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 1, typical parameters of the
        process are now indicated with reference to specific theoretical
        calculations performed on the basis of 1 kilogram of gaseous
        ammonia working fluid, and on the basis of deep ocean water at a
        minimum temperature of 4° C. as cooling medium, and surface
        ocean water at a maximum temperature of 27° C. as heating
        medium. </p>
      <p>These parameters as calculated are set out in Tables I, II, III
        and IV below for the first, second, third and fourth
        regeneration stages, respectively. </p>
      <p>In each table, the particular point at which the parameter has
        been calculated, is indicated by the appropriate reference
        numeral in the drawing. These points are listed in the first
        column of each table. </p>
      <p>The columns in the tables are as follows: </p>
      <p>(a) First column--reference numerals (RN); </p>
      <p>(b) Second column--temperature (t) in° C.; </p>
      <p>(c) Third column--pressure (p) in atmospheres; </p>
      <p>(d) Fourth column--ratio by weight of total ammonia (dissolved
        and undissolved) to water plus total ammonia (RATIO); </p>
      <p>(e) Fifth column--weight (w) in kilograms; and </p>
      <p>(f) Sixth column--Enthalpy (E) in kcal/g. <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>From the above theoretical calculations, the total heat
        supplied to the four evaporator stages amounted to 1258.35
        kcals, while the total heat removed from the four absorption
        stages mounted to 1200.8 kcals. </p>
      <p>The difference of 57.55 is the work put in per kilogram of
        working fluid regenerated and thus the theoretical amount of
        work which is available. </p>
      <p>The energy required to operate the pumps was calculated to be
        2.08 kcals/kg of working fluid regenerated. </p>
      <p>The theoretical amount of work available is therefore 55.47
        kcal/kg of working fluid. </p>
      <p>If it is assumed that the efficiency of the turbine is 85%, the
        theoretical thermal efficiency will be 4.408%. </p>
      <p>The theoretical thermal efficiency of an ideal Carnot cycle
        system operating with a cooling medium at a constant temperature
        of 4° C. and with a heating medium at a constant temperature of
        27° C., would be 7.04%. However, considering that the
        temperature of the heating and cooling mediums must change in
        such a process, the efficiency of the theoretical ideal
        thermodynamical cycle will be only about 4.9%. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the ratio of the efficiency of a system in
        accordance with this invention on the basis of the theoretical
        calculations, would be: </p>
      <p>(a) 62.55% in relation to an ideal Carnot cycle system; </p>
      <p>(b) about 82% in relation to an ideal thermodynamical cycle
        under corresponding conditions. </p>
      <p>It is an advantage of the embodiment of the invention as
        illustrated with reference to the drawing, that an effective
        system can be provided for generating energy by using the
        relatively low temperature differential between surface ocean
        water as heating medium and deep ocean water as cooling medium.
      </p>
      <p>It is a further advantage of this embodiment that a system can
        be provided for regeneration of spent gaseous ammonia at a
        relatively low level of about one atmosphere or less. </p>
      <p>It is a further advantage of the embodiment of the invention as
        illustrated, that because the regeneration range of the gaseous
        working fluid has been increased, the gaseous working fluid can
        be expanded from a high pressure level of about nine
        atmospheres, to a low pressure level of about one atmosphere or
        less. Thus, the quantity of energy available for release is
        substantially greater than would be the case if the working
        fluid were expanded from a pressure of about nine atmospheres to
        a pressure of only about four or five atmospheres. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the drawing
        can provide a further advantage arising from the fact that the
        cold water requirements need only be sufficient to provide a
        final temperature in each absorber of about 6° C. The
        temperature of the cold water cooling medium can thus increase
        across each absorber as indicated in the above tables. Thus, the
        cooling medium requirements will be substantially less than
        would be the case if it were necessary to supply a sufficient
        quantity of cooling water at a sufficient rate to approach the
        Carnot cycle ideal where the cooling medium would remain at the
        constant minimum temperature. The same considerations apply to
        the heating medium, where the hot water is allowed to cool from
        about 27° C. to the temperature indicated in the above tables
        across each evaporator stage thereby again providing a
        substantially reduced heating water requirement over that
        required by the ideal Carnot cycle operation. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that since, in each absorber, the
        cooling range for the solvent solution and working fluid is
        substantially the same, and the temperature range for the
        cooling medium is substantially the same, the absorbers of the
        four regeneration stages can conveniently be combined into a
        single composite absorber through which the lines 1-1, 2-1, 3-1
        and 4-1 pass separately for cooling by means of a single
        circulating supply of cold water. In the same way, all the
        evaporators can be combined in a single composite evaporator
        heated by means of the circulating hot water from a single
        source. </p>
      <p>It will further be appreciated that, theoretically, the
        quantity of solvent solution in each regeneration stage should
        remain constant, and that the initial concentration of ammonia
        in water to constitute the solvent solution, should also remain
        constant for constant minimum cooling water temperatures and
        constant maximum heating water temperatures. </p>
      <p>In practice, however, the quantity of solvent solution will
        have to be adjusted during use to compensate for varying
        conditions and for losses. In addition, the concentration of
        ammonia in water in each regeneration stage, will have to be
        adjusted periodically in relation to seasonal variations in the
        minimum temperature of cold water and maximum temperature of hot
        water. </p>
      <p>It will also be appreciated that where heating of the hot water
        can economically be achieved, such as by solar heating or the
        like, the effectiveness of the process of this invention can be
        improved. Such supplemental heating will, therefore, be employed
        under appropriate conditions if dictated by economic
        considerations. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 2 of the drawings, numeral 150 refers
        generally to an alternative embodiment of the method and
        apparatus of this invention to the embodiment illustrated in
        FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 150 corresponds substantially with the apparatus
        50 and corresponding parts are indicated by corresponding
        reference numerals. </p>
      <p>In the apparatus 150, in place of the single turbine 52 of the
        apparatus 50, a two-stage turbine system is employed comprising
        a first turbine 152 and a second turbine 153. </p>
      <p>The charged working fluid is partially expanded across the
        first turbine 152 into a heat exchange vessel 170. </p>
      <p>From the heat exchange vessel 170 the partially expanded
        working fluid is led along separate conduits 171 and 172 through
        the absorber A2 and through the absorber A1 respectively in heat
        exchange relationship with the cooling water. </p>
      <p>Thereafter the partially spent working fluid is further
        expanded across the second turbine 153 to its final spent level.
        It is then fed, as before, along the spent line 56 to the
        influent line 1-1. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that by utilizing a two-stage turbine system
        with heat exchange of the partially expanded working fluid, the
        effectiveness of the system can be improved particularly where
        the system includes a number of regeneration stages. Applicant
        believes that it will tend to be less significant where fewer
        stages are employed. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3 of the drawings, the drawing shows, to
        an enlarged scale, the apparatus of FIG. 1 which has been
        adapted in the first and second regeneration stages for the
        pressure of the recycled solvent solution to be utilized in
        increasing the pressure of the influent spent working fluid into
        the absorption stage A1 and the absorption stage A2
        respectively. </p>
      <p>As indicated in FIG. 3, the absorption stage A1 incorporates an
        injection system for injecting the recycled solvent solution at
        a pressure substantially higher than the pressure of the spent
        working fluid into the absorber A1. </p>
      <p>The injection system is in the form of an injection nozzle 180
        having an intermediate restricted zone to generate a zone of low
        pressure. </p>
      <p>The spent line 56 joins the nozzle 180 at the restricted zone
        and, as is known those skilled in the art, in an attitude where
        the reduced pressure generated at the restricted zone by the
        solvent solution being injected through the nozzle 180 into the
        absorber A1, will draw the spent working fluid into the nozzle
        180 and thus into the absorber A1. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the effectiveness of this system
        will depend upon the mass ratio between the solvent solution
        being recycled and the working fluid being regenerated. </p>
      <p>If the ratio is to low, it will not be possible to introduce
        the total quantity of working fluid being regenerated by means
        of the flow of the solvent solution being recycled. </p>
      <p>In practice therefore, depending upon conditions, it may be
        necessary to partially reduce the pressure of the solvent
        solution being recycled before entry into the nozzle 180, or it
        may be necessary to introduce some of the working fluid being
        regenerated through the nozzle 180, and the remainder directly
        into the absorber A1. </p>
      <p>While the absorber A2 has not been illustrated in FIG. 3, it
        will be appreciated that the working fluid being regenerated in
        the second regeneration stage will be introduced into the
        absorber A2 by means of an injection system corresponding to
        that of the absorber A1. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of the invention as illustrated in FIG. 3 of the
        drawings, can provide the advantage that the pressure of the
        solvent solution being recycled in the first and second stages
        respectively can be at least partially utilized to introduce the
        working fluid being regenerated, and to increase the pressure in
        the first and second absorbers A1 and A2. </p>
      <p>This affect can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of
        absorption in the first and second absorbers A1 and A2.
        Alternatively, or in addition, this feature can be utilized to
        permit expansion of the charged working fluid to a yet lower
        pressure across the turbine 52, with reliance being placed on
        the pressure contribution of the solvent solution being recycled
        to raise the pressure in the absorber A1 to a level where
        effective absorption of the working fluid being regenerated can
        be effected. Similarly, if employed in relation to the second
        regeneration stage, the same considerations will apply where the
        working fluid introduced into the absorber A2 can be at a lower
        pressure, and reliance is placed on the pressure of the solvent
        solution being recycled into the absorber A2, to increase the
        pressure to a level for effective absorption in the absorber A2.
      </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that the injection system can be
        advantageous in the apparatus 50 particularly in the first and
        second stages, but would tend to have lesser value in subsequent
        stages. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 4 of the drawings, reference numeral 450
        refers generally to yet a further alternative embodiment of the
        method and apparatus of this invention. </p>
      <p>The system 450 as illustrated in FIG. 4, is designed for use
        where the charged working fluid is expanded to a relatively
        higher level than the level described with reference to FIGS. 1
        to 3, but regeneration of the spent working fluid is effected in
        accordance with this invention to provide an economical system
        with high efficiency. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 450 includes a turbine 452, and absorber A, a
        pump P, a regenerator R, an evaporator E and a separator S. </p>
      <p>The spent working fluid expanded across the turbine 452 is fed
        along spent line 456 to influent line 464. Solvent solution
        which is recycled from the separator S along solvent solution
        recycle line 465 is fed through a pressure reducing valve V to
        reduce the pressure of the solvent solution to that of the spent
        working fluid, and then into the absorber A through the influent
        line 464. </p>
      <p>As described with reference to FIG. 1, cooling medium in the
        form of cold deep ocean water is circulated in heat exchange
        relationship through the absorber A by means of conduit 461,
        while heating surface water is circulated through evaporator E
        in heat exchange relationship therewith, along conduit 463. </p>
      <p>The spent working fluid is absorbed by the solvent solution in
        the absorber A whereafter the solvent solution containing the
        absorbed working fluid has its pressure increased by the pump P.
      </p>
      <p>The solvent solution containing the absorbed working fluid is
        fed from the pump P along line 466 through the regenerator R and
        then to the evaporator E for evaporation of the dissolved
        working fluid being regenerated. </p>
      <p>The solvent solution being recycled along the line 465, is
        passed in heat exchange relationship with the solvent solution
        passes through the regenerator R to effect heat exchange. </p>
      <p>From the evaporator E, the evaporated fluid being regenerated
        and the solvent solution passes to the separator S for
        separation, whereafter the separated charged working fluid is
        fed along charged line 454 to the turbine 452. </p>
      <p>To illustrate this embodiment of the invention, typical
        parameters of the process of the system of FIG. 4, are now
        indicated with reference to specific theoretical calculations
        performed on the basis of 1 kilogram of gaseous ammonia working
        fluid, and on the basis of deep ocean water at a minimum
        temperature of 4° C. as cooling medium, and surface ocean water
        at a maximum temperature of 27° C. as heating medium. </p>
      <p>These parameters as calculated are set out in Table V below.
        The particular point at which the parameter has been calculated,
        has been indicated by the appropriate reference numeral in FIG.
        4. These points are listed in the first column of Table V. </p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>It will be noted from Table V that the working fluid is
        expanded from a charged level of 9 atmospheres to a spent level
        of 5.5 atmospheres. It will further be noted that the spent
        working fluid and solvent solution enter the absorber A at a
        temperature of 12° C., and that the solvent solution containing
        the absorbed working fluid being regenerated, leaves the
        absorber A at a temperature of about 8° C. </p>
      <p>By using an absorber A for absorbing the spent ammonia working
        fluid, and by having an appropriate initial concentration of
        ammonia in water for the solvent solution being recycled,
        absorption of the ammonia working fluid can commence in the
        absorber A at a temperature of 12° C. or slightly higher, and
        complete absorption will have occurred by the time the
        temperature has been reduced to about 8° C. by the cooling
        medium at 4° C. </p>
      <p>There is therefore a significant temperature difference between
        the temperature of the cooling medium and the minimum
        temperatures required for complete absorption of the working
        fluid being regenerated. </p>
      <p>In contrast with a system employing a conventional condensation
        stage for the condensation of a working fluid such as ammonia,
        condensation of gaseous ammonia at 5.5 atmospheres would only
        commence at a temperature of about 5° C. resulting in a marginal
        difference of 1° C. between the temperature of condensation and
        the temperature of the available cooling medium, which is at 4°
        C. </p>
      <p>Thus, before condensation can occur in a condensation stage,
        the temperature of the working fluid would have to be reduced to
        about 5° C. by the cooling medium at 4° C. It will be
        appreciated that because of the marginal temperature difference,
        the requirements of cooling water will be substantial and a
        substantial heat transfer surface will be required. </p>
      <p>In contrast therewith, by utilizing an absorber in accordance
        with this invention, while both the working fluid being
        regenerated and the solvent solution being recycled will have to
        be cooled, because absorption of working fluid can commence at a
        temperature substantially above the temperature of the cooling
        medium, and can be completed at a temperature substantially
        above the temperature of the cooling medium, the amount of
        cooling water required can be reduced substantially and/or the
        heat transfer surface requirement can be reduced substantially.
      </p>
      <p>In practice, on the basis of economics, the cooling water
        requirements, the heat transfer surface area, and the
        temperature difference between the temperature of the cooling
        water and the temperature required for complete absorption of
        the spent working fluid, can be balanced to achieve the most
        economical system in the light of the operating parameters and
        capital costs. </p>
      <p>Because the solvent solution containing the working fluid being
        regenerated would leave the absorber A at a temperature higher
        than the temperature of a condensed working fluid leaving a
        condenser, evaporation in the evaporator E will be facilitated.
        By additionally circulating the solvent solution being recycled
        and the solvent solution containing the absorbed working fluid
        in heat exchange relationship through the regenerator R, both
        absorption in the absorber A and evaporation in the evaporator E
        will be improved. </p>
      <p>The system 450 therefore provides the advantage of an increased
        enthalpy drop across the turbine 452 and provides a system of
        increased efficiency and economy. </p>
      <p>To illustrate the advantages of the system in accordance with
        this invention, calculations have been performed to compare the
        system illustrated in FIG. 4 with a conventional OTEC system
        utilizing a conventional Rankine cycle under the same operating
        parameters imposed by the temperatures of the heating and
        cooling mediums. The parameters for the Rankine cycle system
        were obtained from the publication entitled "OTEC Pilot Plan
        Heat Engine" by D. Richards and L. L. Perini, John Hopkins
        University, OTC 3592, 1979. </p>

      <p>A method of generating energy which comprises utilizing
        relatively lower temperature available heat to effect partial
        distillation of at least portion of a multicomponent working
        fluid stream at an intermediate pressure to generate working
        fluid fractions of differing compositions. The fractions are
        used to produce at least one main rich solution which is
        relatively enriched with respect to the lower boiling component,
        and to produce at least one lean solution which is relatively
        improverished with respect to the lower boiling component. The
        pressure of the main rich solution is increased whereafter it is
        evaporated to produce a charged gaseous main working fluid. The
        main working fluid is expanded to a low pressure level to
        release energy. The spent low pressure level working fluid is
        condensed in a main absorption stage by dissolving with cooling

    <blockquote>The most commonly employed thermodynamic cycle for
      producing useful energy from a heat source, is the Rankine cycle.
      In the Rankine cycle a working fluid such as ammonia or a freon is
      evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available heat source.
      The evaporated gaseous working fluid is then expanded across a
      turbine to release energy. The spent gaseous working fluid is then
      condensed in a condenser using an available cooling medium. The
      pressure of the condensed working medium is then increased by
      pumping it to an increased pressure whereafter the working liquid
      at high pressure is again evaporated, and so on to continue with
      the cycle. While the Rankine cycle works effectively, it has a
      relatively low efficiency. The efficiency of the typical Rankine
      cycle is such that currently the cost of installation is in the
      region of about $1,700 to about $2,200 per Kw.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>A thermodynamic cycle with an increased efficiency over
      that of the Rankine cycle, would reduce the installation costs per
      Kw. At current fuel prices, such an improved cycle would be
      commercially viable for utilizing various waste heat sources.
      Applicants prior patent application Ser. No. 143,524 filed Apr.
      24, 1980 relates to a system for generating energy which utilizes
      a binary or multicomponent working fluid. This system, termed the
      Exergy system, operates generally on the principle that a binary
      working fluid is pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure. It
      is heated to partially vaporize the working fluid, it is flashed
      to separate high and low boiling working fluids, the low boiling
      component is expanded through a turbine to drive the turbine,
      while the high boiling component has heat recovered therefrom for
      use in heating the binary working fluid prior to evaporation, and
      is then mixed with the spent low boiling working fluid to absorb
      the spent working fluid in a condenser in the presence of a
      cooling medium. Applicant's Exergy cycle is compared theoretically
      with the Rankine cycle in applicant's prior patent application to
      demonstrate the improved efficiency and advantages of applicant's
      Exergy cycle. This theoretical comparison has demonstrated the
      improved effectiveness of applicant's Exergy cycle over the
      Rankine cycle when an available relatively low temperature heat
      source such as surface ocean water, for example, is employed.
      Applicant found, however, that applicant's Exergy cycle provided
      less theoretical advantages over the conventional Rankine cycle
      when higher temperature available heat sources were employed. It
      is accordingly an object of this invention to provide an energy
      generating system which would provide an improved efficiency not
      only when lower temperature available heat sources are utilized,
      but also when higher temperature waste or available heat sources
      are utilized. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a
      method of generating energy comprises: (a) subjecting at least a
      portion of an initial multicomponent working fluid stream having
      an initial composition of lower and higher boiling components, to
      partial distillation at an intermediate pressure in a distillation
      system by means of relatively lower temperature heat to generate
      working fluid fractions of differing compositions;
      <p>(b) using the generated fractions to produce at least one main
        rich solution which is relatively enriched with respect to a
        lower temperature boiling component, and to produce at least one
        lean solution which is relatively impoverished with respect to a
        lower temperature boiling component; </p>
      <p>(c) increasing the pressure of the main rich solution to a
        charged high pressure level and evaporating the main rich
        solution by means of a relatively higher temperature heat to
        produce a charged gaseous main working fluid; </p>
      <p>(d) expanding the gaseous main working fluid to a spent low
        pressure level to release energy; and </p>
      <p>(e) condensing the spent gaseous working fluid in a main
        absorption stage by dissolving it with cooling in the lean
        solution at a pressure lower than the intermediate pressure to
        regenerate the initial working fluid. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment of the invention, the relatively lower
        temperature heat may be selected from one or more members of the
        group comprising: </p>
      <p>(a) a lower temperature portion of the relatively higher
        temperature heat; </p>
      <p>(b) a portion of the relatively higher temperature heat which
        is not utilized for evaporating the main rich solution; </p>
      <p>(c) heat from a relatively lower temperature heat source; </p>
      <p>(d) heat recovered from the spent gaseous working fluid; and </p>
      <p>(e) heat recovered from the main absorption stage. </p>
      <p>The relatively lower temperature heat may conveniently be
        distributed between the distillation system and a lower
        temperature portion of a main evaporation stage to preheat the
        main rich solution prior to evaporation thereof in a main
        evaporation stage. </p>
      <p>The method may conveniently include the steps of: </p>
      <p>(a) increasing the pressure of the initial working fluid stream
        to a first intermediate pressure; </p>
      <p>(b) dividing the initial working fluid stream into a first
        neutral stream and a first distillation stream; </p>
      <p>(c) subjecting the first distillation stream to partial
        distillation in the distillation system to produce a first lower
        boiling fraction and a first higher boiling fraction; </p>
      <p>(d) removing the first higher boiling fraction from the
        distillation system to constitute the lean solution; and </p>
      <p>(e) absorbing the first lower boiling fraction in the first
        neutral stream to enrich that stream to produce a first rich
        solution. </p>
      <p>In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the method may
        including the step of withdrawing the first rich solution from
        the distillation system to constitute the main rich solution. </p>
      <p>This embodiment of the invention would be employed in
        appropriate circumstances where the heating and cooling mediums
        which are available and are employed, are such that enrichment
        of the working fluid can be effected sufficiently in a single
        distillation stage to produce a main rich solution which can be
        evaporated effectively with the available relatively higher
        temperature heat source. </p>
      <p>In an alternative embodiment of the invention, where justified
        by the heating and cooling mediums utilized in practicing the
        invention, the method may include two, three or more
        distillation stages in the distillation system with a view to
        producing a main rich solution which is enriched to a greater
        extent than in a single stage distillation system. </p>
      <p>Thus, for example, where the method includes two distillation
        steps in the distillation stage, the method may include the step
        of subjecting the first rich solution to at least one second
        distillation step by: </p>
      <p>(a) mixing with the first rich solution a second higher boiling
        fraction recycled from a succeeding distillation stage of the
        distillation system to produce a second working fluid stream; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the second working fluid stream
        to a second higher intermediate pressure; </p>
      <p>(c) dividing the second working fluid stream into a second
        neutral stream and a second distillation stream; </p>
      <p>(d) subjecting the second distillation stream to partial
        distillation in the distillation system to produce a second
        lower boiling fraction, and to produce the second higher boiling
        fraction which is recycled and mixed with the first rich
        solution; and </p>
      <p>(e) absorbing the second lower boiling fraction in the second
        neutral stream to produce a second rich solution which has a
        greater enrichment than the first rich solution. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the distillation system can be
        adjusted and altered in various ways to accommodate the heat
        sources which are available and to provide the most effective
        production of rich and lean solution streams for use in the
        method of this invention. </p>
      <p>While the main rich solution may be evaporated partially in the
        evaporation stage, it is preferred that the main rich solution
        be evaporated substantially or preferably completely in the main
        evaporation stage. In this way all heat utilized in evaporating
        the main rich solution will be effective in providing the
        charged high pressure working fluid which is available to be
        expanded and thereby release or generate energy. </p>
      <p>If the main rich solution is evaporated only partially, some of
        the main rich solution which is not evaporated, will have been
        heated to a relatively high temperature, but will not be
        available to generate energy. This will therefore reduce the
        efficiency of the process. </p>
      <p>Even if the portion of the main rich solution which is not
        evaporated is utilized for heat exchange purposes to supply heat
        to the main rich solution prior to evaporation and/or to supply
        heat for utilization in the distillation stage, substantial
        energy losses will occur in the heat exchange system because of
        the relatively high temperature heat which is involved. </p>
      <p>By evaporating the main rich solution substantially completely
        in a main evaporation state using a relatively high temperature
        heat, and utilizing all or substantially all of the evaporated
        main rich solution as the charged gaseous working fluid for
        releasing energy, applicant believes high temperature energy
        utilization will be the most efficient. </p>
      <p>By using relatively low temperature heat for partial
        distillation in the distillation system heat losses will be
        substantially less. Heat losses will naturally still occur in
        the heat exchanger systems of the distillation system. However,
        because relatively low temperature heat is being utilized, the
        quantity of heat loss will be substantially less. </p>
      <p>Relatively lower temperature heat for the distillation system
        of this invention may be obtained in the form of spent
        relatively high temperature heat, in the form of the lower
        temperature part of relatively higher temperature heat from a
        heat source, in the form of relatively lower temperature waste
        or other heat which is available from the or a heat source,
        and/or in the form of relatively lower temperature heat which is
        generated in the method and cannot be utilized efficiently or
        more efficiently or at all for evaporation of the main rich
        solution. </p>
      <p>In practice, any available heat, particularly lower temperature
        heat which cannot be used or cannot be used effectively for
        evaporating the main rich solution, may be utilized as the
        relatively lower temperature heat for the distillation system.
        In the same way such relatively lower temperature heat may be
        used for preheating the main rich solution in a preheater or in
        a lower temperature part of the main absorption stage. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the invention, at least part of the lean
        solution may be used as a second working fluid by having its
        pressure increased, by being evaporated in a second main
        evaporator stage, by being expanded to release energy, and by
        then being condensed with the other spent main working fluid and
        with any remaining part of the lean solution in an absorption
        stage. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of the invention, the second working fluid
        and the main working fluid may be expanded independently, for
        example, through separate turbines or the like, to release
        energy. </p>
      <p>This embodiment of the invention may be utilized where the
        higher temperature heat source which is available for use in
        carrying out the process of this invention, is such that the
        pressure of the main rich solution could be increased above the
        capacity of the main evaporator and the turbine or other
        expansion/energy release means, and yet still be capable of
        effective evaporation in the main evaporator. In this event the
        second working fluid which is relatively impoverished with
        regard to the low boiling components, could be heated first by
        the high temperature heat source so that it will be evaporated
        effectively at a lower pressure which is compatible with the
        pressure capacities of the main evaporator and the turbine. The
        spent very high temperature heat from such evaporation can then
        be used in series for evaporating the main rich solution at a
        convenient pressure. Thereafter, the remaining spent lower
        temperature heat can be utilized in the distillation system of
        the invention. </p>
      <p>In a similar embodiment of the invention, the initial working
        fluid stream may be treated in the distillation system to
        produce in addition to the lean solution, a plurality of rich
        solution streams having differing compositions. In this
        embodiment, the rich solution streams may be separately treated
        to increase their pressures, to evaporate them and to expand
        them, with the evaporation of each rich solution stream being
        effected with a heat source temperature range appropriate for
        the specific composition range of the rich solution stream. </p>
      <p>In one preferred application of the method of this invention,
        the enrichment of portion of the working fluid stream may, in
        each distillation stage of the distillation system, be increased
        to the maximum extent possible consistent with effective
        distillation of the distillation stream in that stage with the
        available lower temperature heat source, and consistent with
        effective condensation of the lower boiling fraction in the
        neutral stream with an available cooling medium in each
        distillation stage to produce a main rich solution which may be
        pumped to high pressure prior to effective evaporation. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of
        this invention. Thus, for example, applicant anticipates that
        heat sources may be used from sources as high as say
        1,000.degree. F. or more, down to heat sources such as those
        obtained from ocean thermal gradients. Heat sources such as, for
        example, low grade primary fuel, waste heat, geothermal heat,
        solar heat and ocean thermal energy conversion systems are
        believed to all be capable of development for use in applicant's
        invention. </p>
      <p>The working fluid for use in this invention may be any
        multicomponent working fluid which comprises a mixture of two or
        more low and high boiling fluids. The fluids may be mixtures of
        any of a number of compounds with favorable thermodynamic
        characteristics and having a wide range of solubility. Thus, for
        example, the working fluid may comprise a binary fluid such as
        an ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
        freons, or mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons. </p>
      <p>Enthalpy-concentration diagrams for ammonia-water are readily
        available and are generally accepted. Ammonia-water provides a
        wide range of boiling temperatures and favorable thermodynamic
        characteristics. Ammonia-water is therefore a practical and
        potentially useful working fluid in most applications of this
        invention. Applicant believes, however, that when equipment
        economics and turbine design become paramount considerations in
        developing commercial embodiments of the invention, mixtures of
        freon-22 with toluene and other hydrocarbon or freon
        combinations will become more important for consideration. </p>
      <p>The invention further extends to a method of improving the heat
        utilization efficiency in a thermodynamic cycle using a
        multicomponent working fluid having components of lower and
        higher boiling point, which method comprises: </p>
      <p>(a) utilizing relatively lower temperature heat to effect
        partial distillation of at least portion of the working fluid
        for producing working fluid fractions which have differing
        compositions; and </p>
      <p>(b) utilizing relatively higher temperature heat to completely
        evaporate at least an enriched portion of the working fluid
        which has been enriched with respect to a lower boiling
        component, to produce a gaseous working fluid. </p>
      <p>The invention furhter extends to a method of generating useful
        energy from an available heat source, which comprises: </p>
      <p>(a) subjecting a multicomponent working fluid having components
        of differing boiling points, to partial distillation in a
        distillation stage to produce an enriched working fluid liquid
        stream which is enriched with respect to a lower boiling point
        component; </p>
      <p>(b) evaporating the stream substantially completely to produce
        a vaporized charged working fluid; and </p>
      <p>(c) expanding the charged working fluid to release energy. </p>
      <p>Still further in accordance with the invention there is
        provided a method of generating energy, which comprises: </p>
      <p>(a) feeding an initial multicomponent working fluid stream to a
        partial distillation system; </p>
      <p>(b) increasing the pressure of the stream to an intermediate
        pressure; </p>
      <p>(c) separating the stream into a neutral stream and a
        distillation stream; </p>
      <p>(d) subjecting the first distillation stream to partial

      <p>(i) expanding the charged working fluid vapor to release energy
        and produce a spent working fluid vapor; and </p>
      <p>(j) mixing the spent vapor with the lean liquid solution and
        condensing it therein in an absorption stage to regenerate the
        initial working fluid stream. </p>
      <p>In general, standard equipment may be utilized in carrying out
        the method of this invention. Thus, equipment such as heat
        exchangers, tanks, pumps, turbines, valves and fittings of the
        type used in a typical Rankine cycles, may be employed in
        carrying out the method of this invention. Applicant believes
        that the constraints upon materials of construction would be the
        same for this invention as for conventional Rankine cycle power
        or refrigeration systems. Applicant believes, however, that
        higher thermodynamic efficiency of this invention will result in
        lower capital costs per unit of useful energy recovered,
        primarily saving in the cost of heat exchange and boiler
        equipment. In applications such as geothermal and solar sources,
        where heat conversion equipment would tend to be a small part of
        the total investment required to produce or collect heat, the
        high efficiency of the invention would produce a greater energy
        output. Therefore, it would reduce the total cost per unit of
        energy produced. </p>
      <p>The expansion of the working fluid from a charged high pressure
        level to a spent low pressure level to release energy may be
        effected by any suitable conventional means known to those
        skilled in the art. The energy so released may be stored or
        utilized in accordance with any of a number of conventional
        methods known to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the working fluid
        may be expanded to drive a turbine of conventional type. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments of the invention are now described by way
        of example with the reference to the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p>With reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings, reference numeral
        10.1 refers generally to one embodiment of a thermodynamic
        system or cycle in accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system or cycle 10.1 comprises a main evaporation stage
        12.1, a turbine 16.1, a main absorption stage 20.1, a
        distillation system 24.1, and a main rich solution pump 28.1. </p>
      <p>In use, using an ammonia-water working solution as the binary
        working fluid, an initial working fluid stream at an initial low
        pressure will flow from the main absorption stage 20.1 to the
        distillation system 24.1 along line 22.1. In the distillation
        system 24.1, the initial working fluid stream would have its
        pressure increased to an intermediate pressure and would be
        split into a neutral stream and a distillation stream (not shown
        in FIG. 1). The distillation stream would be subjected to
        partial distillation using a low temperature heat source to
        generate working fluid fractions of differing composition. The
        fraction which is enriched with respect to the low boiling
        component, namely enriched with respect to ammonia, would then
        be added to the first neutral stream and would be condensed in a
        condenser within the distillation system 24.1 to produce a main
        rich solution stream leaving the distillation system along line
        26.1 and flowing to the main rich solution pump 28.1. </p>
      <p>The main rich solution would then be pumped by means of the
        pump 28.1 to a higher pressure, and then flows along the line
        30.1 to the main evaporation stage 12.1 where it is evaporated
        completely with a relatively higher temperature heat source to
        form a charged high pressure gaseous working fluid. </p>
      <p>The charged gaseous working fluid is then conveyed along line
        14.1 to the turbine 16.1 where it is expanded to release energy.
        The spent gaseous working fluid is then discharged from the
        turbine 16.1 along the line 18.1 to the main absorption stage
        20.1. The working fluid is conveniently expanded to the initial
        low pressure level. </p>
      <p>The fraction of working fluid which is produced in the
        distillation system 24.1 which is impoverished with respect to
        the lower boiling component, namely the ammonia, constitutes a
        high temperature boiling or lean solution stream which leaves
        the distillation system 24.1 along line 32.1. The lean solution
        has its pressure reduced across a pressure reducing valve 34.1,
        and the reduced pressure lean solution flows along line 36.1 to
        the main absorption stage 20.1. </p>
      <p>In the main absorption stage 20.1 the spent gaseous working
        fluid is condensed by being absorbed into the lean solution
        while heat is extracted therefrom in the main absorption stage
        20.1 by utilizing a suitable available cooling medium. </p>
      <p>The relatively higher temperature heat from the waste or other
        heat source utilized in carrying out the system or cycle of this
        invention is indicated by reference numeral 40.1. The relatively
        higher temperature heat 40.1 is fed to the main evaporation
        stage 12.1 for evaporating the main rich solution completely. </p>
      <p>The spent relatively higher temperature heat from the main
        evaporation stage 12.1 which, because of the conventional pinch
        point, cannot be utilized efficiently in the main evaporation
        stage 12.1, now becomes relatively lower temperature heat. This
        spent heat may therefore be fed along dotted line 42.1 to
        constitute relatively lower temperature heat 44.1 which is fed
        to the distillation system 24.1 for effecting partial
        distillation of the portion of the working fluid in the
        distillation system. </p>
      <p>In addition to the spent relatively higher temperature heat
        which is fed to the distillation system as the relatively lower
        temperature heat 44.1, relatively lower temperature heat may
        also be obtained from another relatively lower temperature
        available heat source and/or from the heat extracted from the
        main absorption stage 20.1 as indicated by dotted line 46.1
        and/or from heat recovered from the spent gaseous working fluid
        between the turbine 16.1 and the main absorption stage 20.1 as
        indicated by dotted line 48.1. </p>
      <p>The available heat can be used in a large number of
        combinations to provide for effective utilization thereof. The
        way in which the heat will be utilized both for evaporation of
        the working fluid and for partial distillation in the
        distillation system 24.1, will therefore vary depending upon the
        apparatus employed, the capacity of the turbine 16.1, the
        working fluid employed, the type of heat utilized as the heat
        source, and the availability of relatively low temperature heat
        and relatively high temperature heat. </p>
      <p>Thus, for example, in the embodiment of FIG. 1, the main
        evaporation stage 12.1 may include a preheater stage or a low
        temperature stage 13.1. Relatively lower temperature heat may be
        fed to the stage 13.1 to preheat the main rich solution prior to
        evaporation. </p>
      <p>Such relatively lower temperature heat may be: </p>
      <p>(a) at least portion of the relatively low temperature heat
        44.1 which is diverted from dotted line 42.1 and fed to the
        stage 13.1 along line 43.1; </p>
      <p>(b) at least portion of the heat extracted from the higher
        temperature portion of the main absorption stage 20.1 and fed to
        the stage 13.1 along line 45.1; </p>
      <p>(c) at least portion of the heat recovered from the spent
        gaseous working fluid downstream of the turbine 16.1 and fed to
        the stage 13.1 along line 47.1; and/or </p>
      <p>(d) relatively lower temperature heat from an available heat
        source and fed to the stage 13.1 along line 49.1. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 2 of the drawings, reference number 10.2
        refers to a more detailed schematic representation of a first
        embodiment of the system of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The system or cycle 10.2 corresponds essentially with the
        system 10.1. Corresponding parts are therefore indicated by
        corresponding reference numerals except that the suffix "0.1"
        has been replaced by the suffice "0.2." </p>
      <p>In the system 10.2, the distillation system 24.2 has been
        enclosed in a chain dotted line to identify the portions of the
        system forming the distillation system 24.2. </p>
      <p>The initial working fluid stream at an initial low pressure
        flows along the line 22.2 from the main absorption stage 20.2
        into the distillation system 24.2. The initial working fluid
        stream flows to an intial pump 50.2 where the pressure of the
        stream is increased to an intermediate pressure. </p>
      <p>On the downstream side of the initial pump 50.2, the initial
        working fluid stream is separated into a first neutral stream
        which flows along line 52.2, and a first distillation stream
        which flows along line 54.2. </p>
      <p>The distillation system 24.2 includes a first distillation
        stage D1 which is in the form of a heat exchanger to place the
        first distillation stream flowing along the line 54.2 in heat
        exchange relationship with spent gaseous working fluid flowing
        along the line 18.2. </p>
      <p>Relatively lower temperature heat from the spent gaseous
        working fluid causes partial distillation of the first
        distillation stream in the first distillation stage D1 to
        generate working fluid fractions of differing compositions which
        flow along the line 56.2 to a first separator stage S1. </p>
      <p>The first separator stage S1 may be provided by a separator
        stage of any conventional suitable type known to those skilled
        in the art. </p>
      <p>In the separator stage S1 the working fluid fractions become
        separated into a lower boiling fraction and a higher boiling
        fraction. The higher boiling fraction which is impoverished with
        respect to the ammonia, flows out of the distillation system
        24.2 along line 32.2 through the pressure release valve 34.2 and
        then through the line 36.2 to the main absorption stage 20.2. </p>
      <p>The lower boiling fraction which is enriched with respect to
        the ammonia flows along line 58.2 and is mixed with the first
        neutral stream flowing along line 52.2 to enrich the first
        neutral stream. The lower boiling fraction is therefore absorbed
        in the first neutral stream in a first condensation stage C1 to
        form a first rich solution stream which leaves the first
        condensation stage C1. </p>
      <p>In the system 10.2, the distillation system 24.2 comprises only
        a single distillation unit. The first rich solution stream which
        leaves the first condensation stage C1 therefore constitutes the
        main rich solution stream which leaves this distillation system
        24.2 along the line 26.2 and flows to the main rich solution
        pump 28.2 where its pressure is increased prior to evaporation
        in the main evaporation stage 12.2. </p>
      <p>In the cycle 10.2, cooling water at ambient temperature is
        employed both in the main absorption stage 20.2 and in the first
        condensation stage C1 to effect absorption of gaseous fractions
        into liquid fractions in these two stages. For the relatively
        higher temperature heat to effect evaporation of the main rich
        solution in the main evaporation stage 12.2, exhaust gases from
        a De Laval diesel engine is utilized to flow along the line
        40.2. </p>
      <p>A case study was prepared to illustrate the recovery of waste
        heat from a De Laval diesel engine. Waste heat is available from
        such an engine in the form of exhaust gas, jacket water and
        lubrication oil. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2 of the
        drawings, only the heat available from the exhaust gas was
        utilized as a heat source since the lower temperature heat was
        not required. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, however, heat
        available in the form of exhaust gas as well as heat available
        in the form of jacket water was utilized as the heat source. </p>
      <p>The De Laval engine was a model DSRV-12-4 of Transamerica De
        Laval, Inc. "Enterprise". It had a gross bhp rating of 7,390 and
        a net bhp rating of 7,313. </p>
      <p>The available heat sources which could be utilized from the
        waste heat of the De Laval diesel engine are as follows: </p>

        first column of Table 1 are those specifically identified by the
        corresponding numbers in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>This case study generated the following data: </p>
      <p>(1) turbine output (at 75% efficiency) --- 774.7 Kw; </p>
      <p>(2) total pump work --- 11.3 Kw; </p>
      <p>(3) net output --- 763.4 Kw or 656.400 Kcal/hr; </p>
      <p>(4) thermal efficiency --- 21.2%; </p>
      <p>(5) second law efficiency --- 53.9%; </p>
      <p>(6) exergy utilization efficiency --- 42.7%; </p>
      <p>(7) internal cycle efficiency 71.9%; and </p>
      <p>(8) name plate energy recovery ratio --- 14.6%. </p>
      <p>As compared to a conventional Rankine cycle, the second law
        efficiency was calculated to be 53.9% for the system 10.2 as
        opposed to 42.8% for a conventional Rankine cycle. Similarly,
        the exergy utilization efficiency was calculated to be 42.7% for
        the system 10.2 of FIG. 2, as opposed to 34.2% for the
        conventional Rankine cycle. This improvement in efficiency would
        therefore allow for a reduction of installed cost per Kw of
        between about 40 and 60%. </p>
      <p>In calculating the parameters for the system 10.2 of FIG. 2,
        the starting point was taken as point 11, namely the pressure of
        the spent gaseous working fluid. This was taken to be one
        atmosphere which is the lowest pressure which can conveniently
        handled without being concerned about subatmospheric sealing
        problems, etc. </p>
      <p>Utilizing this pressure as the starting point, the temperature
        at point 15 would be 35° C. based on the temperature of the
        cooling water utilized. The concentration of the initial working
        fluid stream at point 15 would therefore be fixed from the
        water-ammonia enthalpy/concentration diagrams. </p>
      <p>The pressure of the initial working fluid stream would
        therefore be increase by the initial pump 50.2 to a high
        pressure at which the first distillation stream may be
        evaporated effectively in the first distillation stage D1,
        thereby insuring that the pressure is high enough for effective
        condensation in the first condensation stage C1. </p>
      <p>The design studies which were performed, were not optimized
        either from the thermodynamic or from an economic point of view.
      </p>
      <p>The parameters would, in practice, be varied to balance the
        effective utilization of high temperature and low temperature
        heat sources while balancing equipment and installation costs. </p>
      <p>The theoretical calculations which were prepared for the case
        study, have demonstrated the embodiment of the invention as
        illustrated in FIG. 2, can provide substantial advantages over
        the conventional Rankine type cycle even where extremely high
        temperature waste heat sources are employed as the heating
        medium. Without wishing to be bound by theory, applicant
        believes that these advantages are provided by the effective
        utilization of high temperature heat in the evaporation stage,
        and low temperature heat in the distillation system thereby
        effectively utilizing the heat and limiting the magnitude of
        heat losses. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3 of the drawings, reference numeral
        10.3 refers to an alternative embodiment of a cycle or system in
        accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system 10.3 corresponds substantially with the systems 10.1
        and 10.2. Corresponding parts are therefore indicated by
        corresponding reference numeral except that the suffix "0.3" has
        been employed in place of the suffix "0.2". </p>
      <p>The system 10.3 again has a distillation system 24.3 which has
        been encircled in chain dotted lines to highlight the portions
        which constitute the distillation system 24.3. </p>
      <p>The distillation system 24.3 includes two distillation units
        with the first distillation unit having a distillation stage D1,
        a separation stage S1 and a condensation stage C1, while the
        second distillation unit has a distillation stage D2, a
        separator stage S2 and a condensation stage C2. </p>
      <p>In the system 10.3, cooling jacket water from the De Laval
        diesel engine would be utilized as the lower temperature heat
        source to cause partial distillation of the first distillation
        stream flowing along the line 54.3 into the distillation stage
        D1. </p>
      <p>The partially distilled distillation stream flowing from the
        distillation stage D1, flows along the line 56.3 to the first
        separator stage S1. As before, the higher boiling fraction flows
        along the line 32.3 through the pressure reducing valve 34.3 and
        then through the line 36.3 to the main absorption stage 20.3.
        The first lower boiling fraction mixes with the first neutral
        stream flowing along the line 52.3 and is absorbed in the first
        neutral stream in the condensation stage C1. </p>
      <p>A second high boiling fraction from the second distillation
        unit flows along line 63.3 through a pressure reducing valve
        65.3 to the first condensation stage C1. </p>
      <p>The first condensation stage C1 is cooled by means of cooling
        water at ambient temperature to ensure absorption of the first
        lower boiling fraction which is enriched with ammonia. </p>
      <p>A second working fluid stream is therefore produced in the
        first condensation stage C1 and flows along the line 67.3 to a
        second pump 69.3. The second pump 69.3 increases the pressure of
        the second working fluid stream whereafter the stream is
        separated into a second neutral stream flowing along the line
        71.3, and a second distillation stream flowing along the line
        73.3. </p>
      <p>The second distillation stream flows through the second
        distillation stage D2 in heat exchange relationship with the
        spent gaseous working fluid flowing along the line 18.3. Partial
        distillation occurs in the stage D2 so that the partially
        distilled second distillation stream flows along the line 75.3
        to a second separator stage S2. The higher boiling fraction from
        the separator stage S2 constitutes the second higher boiling
        fraction which flows along line 63.3 to the first condensation
        stage C1. The second lower boiling fraction flows along line
        77.3 and is absorbed into the second neutral stream in the
        second condensation stage C2. The second condensation stage C2
        is again cooled with cooling water at ambient temperature. </p>
      <p>The resultant main rich solution emerges from the distillation
        system 24.3 along line 26.3 and enters the pump 28.3 where it is
        pumped to an appropriate pressure for complete or substantially
        complete evaporation in the main evaporation stage 12.3 where it
        is evaporated with exhaust gases from the DeLeval engine. </p>
      <p>As in the case of the system 10.2, a design study was performed
        on the system 10.3 utilizing not only the exhaust gases from the
        De Laval engine as the high temperature heat source, but also
        utilizing the jacket water from the DeLaval engine as the low
        temperature heat source for use in the distillation system 24.3.
      </p>
      <p>The parameters for the theoretical calculations which were
        performed again utilizing standard ammonia-water
        enthalpy/concentration diagrams, are set out in Table 2 below. </p>
      <p>In Table 2 below, points 1 through 35 in the first column
        correspond with the specifically marked points in FIG. 3. </p>

        <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>In relation to this case study, the following data was
        calculated: </p>
      <p>1. Turbine output (at 75% efficiency)--875.4 Kw. </p>
      <p>2. Total pump work--14.5 Kw. </p>
      <p>3. Net output--860.9 Kw or 740,159 Kcal/hr. </p>
      <p>4. Thermal efficiency--15.2%. </p>
      <p>5. Second law efficiency--51.9%. </p>
      <p>6. Exergy utilization efficiency--48.2%. </p>
      <p>7. Internal cycle efficiency--69.2%. </p>
      <p>8. Name plate energy recovery ratio--16.5%. </p>
      <p>In comparing the theoretical calculation for the cycle of
        system 10.3 with that of a conventional Rankine cycle, it was
        found that the second law efficiency of the cycle 10.3 was 51.9%
        as opposed to 42.8% for the conventional Rankine cycle. It was
        further calculated that the exergy utilization efficiency for
        the cycle 10.3 was 48.2% as opposed to 34.2% for the
        conventional Rankine cycle. This improvement over the cycle 10.2
        is believed to be as a result of the more effective utilization
        of the lower temperature waste heat generated by the DeLaval
        diesel engine during use. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of the cycle illustrated in FIG. 3 would
        therefore again provide the advantage that the cost per
        installed kilowatt would be reduced by about 50 to 60% in
        relation to a typical conventional Rankine cycle. It must be
        appreciated that this is based essentially on theoretical
        calculations and that the actual installed cost per kilowatt
        will vary depending upon, design, location and size of plant. </p>
      <p>The design studies performed on the cycles 10.2 and 10.3,
        nevertheless indicate that waste heat from internal combustion
        engines could be converted economically to useful energy output
        in a quantity ranging from about 15 to 20% of nameplate capacity
        of the primary engine using conventionally available component
        equipment, but using applicant's improved heat utilization in
        applicant's thermodynamic cycles or systems. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 4 of the drawings, reference numeral
        10.4 refers generally to yet a further alternative embodiment in
        accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system 10.4 corresponds generally with the system 10.1.
        Corresponding parts are therefore indicated by corresponding
        reference numerals except that the suffix "0.4" has been
        employed in place of the suffix "0.1". </p>
      <p>The cycle or system 10.4 would be utilized where the waste heat
        source available for use, is available at such a high
        temperature that it could evaporate the main rich solution even
        where the pressure of that solution has been increased to a
        pressure far in excess of that which can conveniently be handled
        by the main evaporator 12 or by the turbine 16. </p>
      <p>The cycle 10.4 is therefore designed to utilize such heat in an
        effective manner without providing pressure which cannot
        conveniently be handled by the evaporator and turbine. </p>
      <p>In the system 10.4, the distillation system 24.4 produces, as
        before, a lean solution which emerges from the distillation
        system 24.4 and flows along line 32.4, through pressure reducing
        valve 34.4, along line 36.4 and into the main absorption stage
        20.4. </p>
      <p>In addition, however, the distillation system 24.4 produces two
        rich solution streams having differing compositions. The one
        rich solution liquid stream which is the least enriched with the
        low boiling ammonia, and is therefore a higher boiling solution
        than the remaining rich solution, is fed along line 26.4 to the
        pump 28.4 and is evaporated in the main evaporation stage 12.4
        using the very high temperature available heat source. The
        evaporated charged gaseous working medium produced in the main
        evaporation stage 12.4 is fed through a first turbine 16.4 to
        release energy therein. </p>
      <p>The second rich solution liquid stream which is produced in the
        distillation system 24.4, and which is more enriched with the
        low boiling ammonia and is therefore a lower boiling fluid than
        the other rich solution stream, flows along line 27.4 to a pump
        29.4 where its pressure is increased. From there it flows along
        line 80.4 through a preheater 82.4 where it flows in heat
        exchange relationship with the spent working fluid from the
        turbine 16.4. Thereafter it flows along line 84.4 into a second
        main evaporation stage 13.4 where it is evaporated with slightly
        lower temperature high temperature heat which is recovered from
        the main evaporation stage 12.4, to evaporate it. Since it is
        more enriched with low boiling ammonia than the remaining rich
        solution stream, it can be evaporated effectively utilizing a
        lower temperature heat source than utilized in the main
        evaporation stage 12.4. </p>
      <p>The evaporation stage 13.4 therefore produces a second charged
        working fluid which is fed to a second turbine 17.4 to release
        energy. This spent working fluid flows with the spent working
        fluid from the turbine 16.4 to the main absorption stage 20.4
        for absorption in the lean solution. </p>
      <p>The one rich solution stream which flows along the line 26.4
        may, in an embodiment of the invention, have the same
        composition as the stream which leaves the absorption stage 20.4
        depending upon the available heat source and the operating
        conditions. </p>
      <p>The system 10.4 is set out in more detail in FIG. 5 and is
        identified therein by reference numeral 10.5. </p>
      <p>The distillation system 24.5 is again identified by being
        encircled with chain dotted lines. The distillation system 24.5
        includes a plurality of distillation units comprising main
        distillation stages D1 and D2, main condensation stages C1 and
        C2, and a plurality of separation stages S1, S2 and S3. </p>
      <p>A design calculation was performed upon the system 10.5
        utilizing exhaust gas, jacket water and lubricating oil from a
        DeLaval diesel engine as available heat sources. This design
        calculation provided a calculated second law efficiency of 52.6%
        as opposed to a second law efficiency for a conventional rankine
        cycle of 42.8%. It further provided a calculated exergy
        utilization efficiency of about 51.8% as opposed to a
        conventional rankine cycle exergy utilization efficiency of
        34.2%. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of FIG. 5 illustrates how the parameters of the
        system of this invention may be varied to effectively utilize a
        large range of available heat sources ranging from very high
        temperature available heat to low temperature available heat. </p>
      <p>For each application of the invention, available heat sources
        will have to be balanced against specific equipment costs, to
        arrive at the most appropriate parameters for each application
        utilizing appropriate multicomponent diagrams for the particular
        working fluid employed. </p>
      <p>The embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the
        drawings, indicate that the invention can effectively utilize a
        plurality of different temperature heat sources to produce
        energy thereby providing for effective heat utilization and
        reduced heat loss. </p>
      <p>Further calculations have been done with the system in
        accordance with applicant's invention as compared to a
        conventional rankine system. With a typical system in accordance
        with this invention, applicant found a second law efficiency of
        59.7% as opposed to a second law efficiency of 29.7% for a
        typical rankine cycle when utilizing surface ocean water and
        deep ocean water as the heating and cooling mediums for a
        typical ocean thermal energy conversion system. </p>
      <p>In further calculations performed on a heat source in the form
        of a solar pond, applicant calculated a second law efficiency
        for applicant's invention of about 80% and an exergy utilization
        efficiency of about 80% as compared to a second law efficiency
        and an exergy utilization efficiency of a typical Rankine cycle
        of about 56%. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 6 of the drawings, FIG. 6 indicates a
        typical cycle in accordance with applicant's invention employed
        for utilizing waste heat in the form of geothermal heat. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of FIG. 6 corresponds essentially with the
        embodiment of FIG. 2. Corresponding parts have therefore been
        indicated by corresponding reference numerals except that the
        suffix "0.6" has been used in place of the suffix "0.2". </p>
      <p>The system or cycle 10.6 was designed on a theoretical basis
        for utilization of a heat source in the form of geothermal heat
        from a site in the United States known as the East Mesa
        geothermal site. </p>
      <p>The relatively high temperature heat is fed to the main
        evaporation stage 12.6 as indicated by reference numeral 40.6 in
        the form of a hot geothermal brine solution which cools from
        335° F. (168.3° C.) to 134.8° F. (56.0° C.). </p>
      <p>The cycle 10.6 includes a single distillation unit which
        includes two partial distillation stages D1 and D2. </p>
      <p>The relatively lower temperature heat for the distillation
        system is provided by the spent gaseous working fluid which
        flows along line 18.6 and passes through the distillation stage
        D2. Thereafter, the higher boiling fraction from the separator
        S1 joins this flow where line 36.6 joins the line 18.6. This
        combined flow thereafter flows in heat exchange relationship
        with the first distillation stream through the partial
        distillation heat exchanger D1. </p>
      <p>As in the prior systems, the expansion of the charged working
        fluid across the turbine 16.6 is controlled to achieve a reduced
        pressure corresponding to the pressure to which the pressure of
        the lean solution is reduced by the pressure reducing valve
        34.6. </p>
      <p>As in the case of the other systems, a design study was
        performed on the system or cycle 10.6 utilizing geothermal heat
        as the relatively high temperature heat source and utilizing
        ambient air as the cooling medium in the main absorption stage
        20.6 and in the condensation stage C1. </p>
      <p>The parameters for the theoretical calculations which were
        performed again utilizing standard ammonia-water
        enthalpy/concentration diagrams are set out in Table 3 below. <br>

      <p>This embodiment indicates a substantial theoretical improvement
        over the conventional Rankine cycle. It further illustrates the
        effective utilization of geothermal heat as a relatively higher
        temperature heat source for effecting complete evaporation of a
        high pressure liquid working fluid which has been enriched, and
        utilizing relatively lower temperature heat from spent gaseous
        working fluid as the low temperature heat source for causing
        partial distillation of portion of the initial working fluid
        stream to achieve effective enrichment thereof. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that by having working fluids of markedly
        different composition in the evaporation stage and in the main
        absorption stage, effective evaporation and heat utilization can
        be achieved in the evaporation stage for effective and complete
        evaporation of an enriched portion of a working fluid.
        Thereafter by utilizing a substantially impoverished fluid in
        the main absorption stage, the spent working fluid can be
        effectively condensed and thus regenerated for reuse. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that heat sources can be obtained from
        various points in the system and from various heat and waste
        heat sources to provide for effective evaporation utilizing
        relatively higher temperature heat, and then utilizing spare
        relatively higher temperature heat and relatively lower
        temperature heat from other sources to effect partial
        distillation and thus enrichment of portion of the working fluid
        for effective evaporation. </p>

      <b>Abstract --- </b>A method of generating energy in which
      working fluid fractions of differing compositions are generated,
      are subjected to heating in a first evaporator stage, are
      combined, the combined stream is then evaporated and is expanded
      to convert its energy into usable form. Thereafter the combined
      stream is processed to regenerate the differing working fluid
      fractions for reuse.</blockquote>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the generation of energy. More
        particularly, this invention relates to a method of transforming
        the energy of a heat source into usable form by using a working
        fluid which is expanded and regenerated. The invention further
        relates to a method of improving the heat utilization efficiency
        in a thermodynamic cycle and thus to a new thermodynamic cycle
        utilizing the method. </p>
      <p>The most commonly employed thermodynamic cycle for producing
        useful energy from a heat source, is the Rankine cycle. In the
        Rankine cycle a working fluid such as water, ammonia or a freon
        is evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available heat
        source. The evaporated gaseous working fluid is then expanded
        across a turbine to transform its energy into usable form. The
        spent gaseous working fluid is then condensed in a condenser
        using an available cooling medium. The pressure of the condensed
        working medium is then increased by pumping it to an increased
        pressure whereafter the working liquid at high pressure is again
        evaporated, and so on to continue with the cycle. While the
        Rankine cycle works effectively, it has a relatively low
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>A thermdynamic cycle with an increased efficiency over that of
        the Rankine cycle, would reduce the installation costs per Kw.
        At current fuel prices, such an improved cycle would be
        commercially viable for utilizing various waste heat sources. </p>

        relates to a system for generating energy which utilizes a
        binary or multicomponent working fluid. This system, termed the
        Exergy system, operates generally on the principle that a binary
        working fluid is pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure.
        It is heated to partially vaporize the working fluid, it is
        flashed to separate high and low boiling working fluids, the low
        boiling component is expanded through a turbine to drive the
        turbine, while the high boiling component has heat recovered
        therefrom for use in heating the binary working fluid prior to
        evaporation, and is then mixed with the spent low boiling
        working fluid to absorb the spent working fluid in a condenser
        in the presence of a cooling medium. Applicant's Exergy cycle is
        compared theoretically with the Rankine cycle in Applicant's
        prior patent to demonstrate the improved efficiency and
        advantages of Applicant's Exergy cycle. This theoretical
        comparison has demonstrated the improved effectiveness of
        Applicant's Exergy cycle over the Rankine cycle when an
        available relatively low temperature heat source such as surface
        ocean water, for example, is employed. Applicant found, however,
        that Applicant's Exergy cycle provided less theoretical
        advantages over the conventional Rankine cycle when higher
        temperature available heat sources were employed. Applicant then
        devised a further invention to provide an improved thermodynamic
        cycle for such applications. This invention utilizes a
        distillation system in which part of a working fluid is
        distilled to thereby assist in regeneration of the working fluid
        component. This invention is the subject matter of Applicant's
        prior patent application Ser. No. 405,942 which was filed on
        Aug. 6, 1982, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563. Applicant believes
        that a thermodynamic cycle can be improved if effective steps
        can be taken to reduce the effect of the pinch point problem
        when a working fluid is evaporated with a heating source. It is
        accordingly one of the objects of this invention to provide a
        thermodynamic cycle in which the effect of the pinch point
        problem can be reduced. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a method of
        generating energy comprises: </p>
      <p>(a) subjecting at least a portion of an initial composite
        stream having an initial composition of higher and lower boiling
        components, to distillation at an intermediate pressure in a
        distillation system to distill or evaporate part of the stream
        and thus generate an enriched vapor fraction which is enriched
        with a lower boiling component relatively to both a rich working
        fluid fraction and a lean working fluid fraction; </p>
      <p>(b) mixing the enriched vaor fraction with part of the
        composite stream and absorbing it therein to produce at least
        one rich working fluid fraction which is enriched relatively to
        a composite working fluid with a lower boiling component; </p>
      <p>(c) generating at least one lean working fluid fraction from
        part of the composite stream, the lean working fluid fraction
        being impoverished relatively to such a composite working fluid
        with a lower boiling component; </p>
      <p>(d) using a remaining part of the initial composite stream as a
        condensation stream; </p>
      <p>(e) condensing vapor contained in the rich and lean working
        fluid fractions to the extent that it is present in either; </p>
      <p>(f) increasing the pressures of the rich and lean working fluid
        fractions in liquid form to a charged high pressure level; </p>
      <p>(g) feeding the rich working fluid fraction and the lean
        working fluid fraction separately to a first evaporator stage to
        heat the lean working fluid fraction towards its boiling point,
        and to evaporate at least part of the rich working fluid
        fraction; </p>
      <p>(h) mixing the lean and rich working fluid fractions to
        generate a composite working fluid; </p>
      <p>(i) evaporating the composite working fluid in a second
        evaporator stage to produce a charged composite working fluid; </p>
      <p>(j) expanding the charged composite working fluid to a spent
        low pressure level to transform its energy into usable form; and
      </p>
      <p>(k) condensing the spent composite working fluid in an
        absorption stage by cooling and absorbing it in the condensation
        stream at a pressure lower than the intermediate pressure to
        regenerate the initial composite stream. </p>
      <p>The lean and rich working fluid fractions, to the extent that
        they are not generated in liquid form, are cooled to condense
        them, preferably completely or substantially completely, into
        liquid form before their pressures are increased to the charged
        high pressure level. </p>
      <p>The rich and lean working fluid fractions will usually both
        require condensation to generate them in liquid form before they
        are pumped to the charged high pressure level. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the invention the entire initial composite
        stream may be subjected to distillation in the distillation
        system to produce the enriched vapor fraction, and to produce a
        stripped liquid fraction from which the enriched vapor fraction
        has been stripped. </p>
      <p>In one example of this embodiment of the invention the enriched
        vapor fraction may be divided into first and second enriched
        vapor fraction streams, and the stripped liquid fraction may be
        divided into first, second and third stripped liquid fraction
        streams. The first enriched vapor fraction stream may then be
        mixed with the first stripped liquid fraction stream to produce
        the rich working fluid fraction, the second enriched vapor
        fraction stream may be mixed with the second stripped liquid
        fraction stream to generate the lean working fluid fraction, and
        the third stripped liquid fraction stream may comprise the
        remaining part of the initial composite stream which is used as
        the condensation stream. </p>
      <p>In an alternative example of this embodiment of the invention,
        the stripped liquid fraction may be divided into first, second
        and third stripped liquid fraction streams, the enriched vapor
        fraction may be mixed with the first stripped liquid fraction
        stream to produce the rich working fluid fraction, the second
        stripped liquid fraction stream may be used as the part of the
        initial composite stream comprising the lean working fluid
        fraction, and the third stripped liquid fraction stream may be
        used as the remaining part of the initial composite stream to
        constitute the condensation stream. </p>
      <p>In an alternative embodiment of the invention, only portion of
        the initial composite stream may be subjected to distillation in
        the distillation system to produce the enriched vapor fraction,
        and to produce a stripped liquid fraction from which the
        enriched vapor fraction has been stripped. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of the invention the enriched vapor fraction
        may, for example, be divided into first and second enriched
        vapor fraction streams and the stripped liquid fraction may be
        used to constitute or comprise the condensation stream. In this
        example of the invention, the remaining part of the initial
        composite stream which is not subjected to distillation may be
        divided, for example, into first and second composite streams.
        The first and second enriched vapor fraction streams may be
        mixed with the first and second composite streams respectively
        to produce the rich working fluid fraction and the lean working
        fluid fraction. </p>
      <p>It will readily be appreciated that depending upon conditions
        and circumstances including available heating and cooling
        sources, the rich and lean working fluid fractions may be
        generated by mixing varying proportions of the enriched vapor
        fraction with varying proportions of one or more stripped liquid
        fractions, one or more initial composite stream fractions which
        are not subjected to distillation, or by making any combination
        which will achieve the desired rich and lean working fluid
        fractions for reducing the pinch point problem in accordance
        with this invention. </p>
      <p>It will further be appreciated that by making appropriate
        selections from the enriched vapor fraction, from the stripped
        liquid fraction and from the initial composite stream two, three
        or more working fluid fractions may be produced which have a
        range of low boiling component concentrations and which are of
        appropriate quantities to allow effective separate heating in a
        first evaporator stage, followed by combining two or more of the
        streams, followed by separate heating in a subsequent evaporator
        stage, again followed by mixing of the fluid streams to reduce
        the number of streams, again followed by evaporation in a
        subsequent evaporator stage, and so on until a single composite
        working fluid has been produced which can then be evaporated and
        expanded to convert its energy into usable form. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the condensation
        stream will be throttled down to the pressure of the spent
        composite working fluid for absorbing the spent composite
        working fluid therein in the absorption stage. </p>
      <p>The condensation stream and the spent composite working fluid
        may be cooled in the absorption stage utilizing any appropriate
        and available cooling medium. <br>
        The initial composite stream generated in the absorption stage,
        or the portion thereof which is to be subjected to distillation,
        may be subjected to distillation by heating in one or more heat
        exchangers using any suitable and available heating medium. </p>
      <p>Applicant's presently preferred method of subjecting the
        initial composite stream, or portion thereof, to distillation is
        by means of relatively low temperature heat. This provides the
        advantage that the quantity of heat loss in the heat exchanger
        system will be substantially less, and that low temperature heat
        may be used for this purpose which cannot conveniently be
        utilized in other aspects of the cycle. </p>
      <p>In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention,
        distillation may be effected by passing the initial composite
        stream, or portion thereof, in heat exchange relationship with
        one or more of the following heating sources: </p>
      <p>(a) the spent composite working fluid; </p>
      <p>(b) the condensation stream; </p>
      <p>(c) the lean working fluid fraction; </p>
      <p>(d) the rich working fluid fraction; and </p>
      <p>(e) an auxiliary heating source. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that in many applications of the cycle of
        this invention, no auxiliary heating source will be required.
        Applicant thus believes that sufficient heat can be extracted
        from the spent composite working fluid, from the condensation
        stream, and from the lean and rich working fluid fractions to
        provide for effective distillation or evaporation of part of the
        initial composite stream to produce the enriched vapor fraction
        which is enriched with respect to the lower boiling component or
        components of the composite stream. </p>
      <p>When the initial composite stream is subjected to such
        distillation, the lower boiling component or components will
        naturally evaporate or distill first thereby producing the
        enriched vapor fraction. </p>
      <p>The compositions of the rich working fluid and lean working
        fluid fractions are preferably selected so that they can be
        heated most effectively in the first evaporator stage with the
        available heating medium. The first evaporator stage will
        generally be the low temperature stage of the evaporator. </p>
      <p>Thus, for example, the composition should be selected, and the
        relative quantities should be selected, such that the lean
        working fluid fraction will be heated towards its boiling point
        in the first evaporator stage, while the rich working fluid
        fraction will be heated towards its saturated vapor stage. </p>
      <p>Preferably the rich working fluid fraction should be enriched
        as much as possible with the lower boiling component or
        components, consistent with the use of a lean working fluid
        fraction which can have a boiling point at the dew point of the
        rich working fluid fraction. </p>
      <p>In a presently preferred embodiment, the compositions and
        quantities will be selected so that the lean working fluid will
        be heated to its boiling point or to substantially its boiling
        point in the first evaporator stage, while the rich working
        fluid fraction will be evaporated substantially or completely to
        be in the form of a saturated vapor in the first evaporator
        stage. </p>
      <p>While both the lean working fluid fraction and the rich working
        fluid fraction may be heated to a higher temperature in the
        first evaporator stage, Applicant believes that this will not
        provide any real thermodynamic advantage in the cycle of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>The rich and lean working fluid fractions are thus selected so
        that after they have passed through the first evaporator stage,
        they are substantially or at least generally in equilibrium both
        in temperature and pressure to reduce any thermodynamic losses
        which may occur during mixing. </p>
      <p>When lean and rich working fluid fractions are first generated
        in accordance with this invention, they will usually both
        contain vapor and must therefore be cooled to condense them
        completely. They are then pumped separately to the charged high
        pressure level before being fed to the first evaporator stage.
        While the lean working fluid fraction may sometimes contain no
        vapor and will therefore not have to be cooled, the rich working
        fluid fraction will usually contain vapor and will have to be
        cooled to condense the vapor and provide the fraction in liquid
        form for effective pressure increase. </p>
      <p>They may be cooled utilizing any available cooling medium. In
        accordance with Applicant's presently preferred embodiment of
        the invention, the lean working fluid fraction will be cooled by
        passing it in heat exchange relationship with the initial
        composite stream which is being subjected to distillation. </p>
      <p>Similarly, in accordance with Applicant's presently preferred
        embodiment, the rich working fluid fraction will be cooled by
        passing it in heat exchange relationship with an auxiliary
        cooling source. A preheater system may also be employed between
        the cooled rich working fluid fraction and the rich working
        fluid fraction which has not yet been cooled with the cooling
        medium of the auxiliary cooling source. </p>
      <p>In the preferred application of the invention, the rich and
        lean working fluid fractions will be cooled so that their
        temperatures will be generally equal or close before they are
        fed to the first evaporator stage. </p>
      <p>After the lean and rich working fluid fractions have passed
        through the first evaporator stage, and have been mixed to
        constitute the composite working fluid, they may be heated in
        the second evaporator stage to evaporate the composite working
        fluid completely or at least substantially completely. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that the best thermodynamical advantages
        will be provided if the composite working fluid is evaporated
        completely in the second evaporator stage. Applicant believes
        that it will be less advantageous if the composite working fluid
        is not evaporated completely. </p>
      <p>If the composite working fluid is evaporated only partially,
        some of that fluid, which will have been heated to a relatively
        high temperature, will not be available to generate energy. This
        will therefore reduce the efficiency of the process. By
        evaporating the composite working fluid completely in the second
        evaporation stage using a relatively high temperature heat, and
        utilizing all or substantially all of the evaporated composite
        working fluid as the charged composite working fluid, Applicant
        believes that high temperature energy utilization will be the
        most efficient and effective. </p>
      <p>In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the
        composite working fluid from the second evaporator stage, will
        be superheated in a superheater stage. </p>
      <p>The charged composite working fluid may be expanded to a spent
        low pressure level to transform its energy into usable form,
        utilizing any suitable and available device for this purpose.
        Devices of this nature are generally in the form of turbines and
        will generically be referred to in the specification as
        turbines. </p>
      <p>Various single and multi-stage turbines are available and can
        be selected to provide the appropriate pressure and temperature
        ranges for effective utilization of this invention. </p>
      <p>In an embodiment of the invention a multi-stage turbine system
        may be used, and at least part of the composite working fluid
        may be recycled to the superheater stage after passing through a
        high pressure stage of the turbine, and before entering a low
        pressure stage of the turbine. </p>
      <p>It will readily be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
        relatively low temperature heat for the distillation system of
        this invention may be obtained from various sources depending
        upon circumstances. It may be obtained in the form of spent
        relatively high temperature heat, in the form of the lower
        temperature part of relatively higher temperature heat from a
        heat source, in the form of relatively lower temperature waste
        or other heat which is available from the or from a heat source,
        and/or in the form of relatively lower temperature heat which is
        generated in the method of this invention and cannot be utilized
        efficiently or more effectively or at all for evaporation of the
        composite working fluid. </p>
      <p>Various types of heat sources may be used in the evaporator
        stage of the cycle of this invention to evaporate the composite
        working fluid. In each instance, depending upon available heat
        sources, the cycle can be adjusted to utilize such heat sources
        in the most effective manner. For example, Applicant anticipates
        that heat sources may be used from sources as high as 1,000° F.
        or more, down to heat sources such as those obtained from ocean
        thermal gradients. Heat sources such as, for example, low grade
        primary fuel, waste heat, geothermal heat, solar heat and ocean
        thermal energy conversion systems are believed all to be capable
        of development for use in this invention. </p>
      <p>The working fluid for use in this invention may be any
        multi-component working fluid which comprises a mixture of two
        or more low and high boiling fluids. The fluids may be mixtures
        of any of a number of compounds with favorable thermodynamic
        characteristics and having an appropriate or wide range of
        solubility. Thus, for example, the working fluid may comprise a
        binary fluid such as an ammonia-water mixture, two or more
        hydrocarbons, two or more freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and
        freons, or the like. </p>
      <p>Applicant's presently preferred working fluid is a
        water-ammonia mixture. </p>
      <p>Enthalpy-concentration diagrams for ammonia-water are readily
        available and are generally accepted. The National Bureau of
        Standards will supply upon request an article published in the
        National Bureau of Standards list as Project 758-80. This paper
        was prepared by Wiltec Research Company, Inc., 488 South 500
        West, Provo, Utah, 84601 in 1983 and deals with the experimental
        study of water-ammonia mixtures and their properties in a wide
        range of temperatures and pressures. A copy of this paper is
        attached to this specification and is incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>Ammonia-water provides a wide range of boiling temperatures and
        favorable thermodynamic characteristics. Ammonia-water is
        therefore a practical and potentially useful working fluid in
        many applications of this invention. Applicant believes,
        however, that when equipment economics and turbine design become
        paramount considerations in developing commercial embodiments of
        the invention, mixtures of freon-22 with toluene or other
        hydrocarbon or freon combinations will become more important for
        consideration. </p>
      <p>In general, standard equipment may be utilized in carrying out
        the method of this invention. Thus, equipment such as heat
        exchangers, tanks, pumps, turbines, valves and fittings of the
        type used in typical thermodynamic cycles such as, for example,
        Rankine cycles, may be employed in carrying out the method of
        this invention. Applicant believes that the constraints upon
        materials of construction would be the same for this invention
        as for conventional Rankine cycle power or refrigeration
        systems. Applicant believes, however, that higher thermodynamic
        efficiency of this invention will result in lower capital cost
        per unit of useful energy recovered, primarily saving in the
        cost of heat exchanger and boiler equipment. Applicant believes
        that this invention will provide a reduction in the total cost
        per unit of energy produced. </p>
      <p>The invention is now described in detail with reference to
        certain preferred embodiments invention and with reference to

      <p>With reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings, reference numeral
        50.1 refers generally to one embodiment of a thermodynamic
        system or cycle in accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system of cycle 50.1 comprises an absorption stage 52, a
        heat exchanger 54, a recuperator 56, a main heat exchanger 58, a
        separator stage 60, a preheater 62, pumps 64 and 66, a first
        evaporator stage 68, a second evaporator stage 70, a superheater
        section 72, and a multi-stage turbine comprising a high pressure
        stage 74 and a low pressure stage 76. </p>
      <p>The system or cycle of this invention will now be described by
        way of example by reference to the use of an ammonia-water
        working solution as the initial composite stream. </p>
      <p>This is a continuous system where a charged composite working
        fluid is expanded to convert its energy into usable form, and is
        then continually regenerated. A substantially constant and
        consistent quantity of composite working fluid will therefore be
        maintained in the system for long term use of the system. </p>
      <p>In analyzing the system it is useful to commence with the point
        in the system identified by reference numeral 1 comprising the
        initial composite stream having an initial composition of higher
        and lower boiling components in the form of ammonia and water.
        At point 1 the initial composite stream is at a spent low
        pressure level. It is pumped by means of a pump 51 to an
        intermediate pressure level where its pressure parameters will
        be as at point 2 following the pump 51. </p>
      <p>From point 2 of the flow line, the initial composite stream at
        an intermediate pressure is heated consecutively in the heat
        exchanger 54, in the recuperator 56 and in the main heat
        exchanger 58. </p>
      <p>The initial composite stream is heated in the heat exchanger
        54, in the recuperator 56 and in the main heat exchanger 58 by
        heat exchange with the spent composite working fluid from the
        turbine sections 74 and 76. In addition, in the heat exchanger
        54 the initial composite stream is heated by the condensation
        stream as will be hereinafter described. In the recuperator 56
        the initial composite stream is further heated by the
        condensation stream and by heat exchange with lean and rich
        working fluid fractions as will be hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The heating in the main heat exchanger 58 is performed only by
        the heat of the flow from the turbine outlet and, as such, is
        essentially compensation for under recuperation. </p>
      <p>At point 5 between the main heat exchanger 58 and the separator
        stage 60 the initial composite stream has been subjected to
        distillation at the intermediate pressure in the distillation
        system comprising the heat exchangers 54 and 58 and the
        recuperator 56. If desired, auxiliary heating means from any
        suitable or available heat source may be employed in any one of
        the heat exchangers 54 or 58 or in the recuperator 56. This is
        shown, for example, by dotted line 59 in the heat exchanger 54.
      </p>
      <p>At point 5 the initial composite stream has been partially
        evaporated in the distillation system and is sent to the gravity
        separator stage 60. In this stage 60 the enriched vapor fraction
        which has been generated in the distillation system, and which
        is enriched with the low boiling component, namely ammonia, is
        separated from the remainder of the initial composite stream to
        produce an enriched vapor fraction at point 6 and a stripped
        liquid fraction at point 7 from which the enriched vapor
        fraction has been stripped. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the enriched vapor
        fraction from point 6, is divided into first and second enriched
        vapor fraction streams as at points 9 and 8 respectively. </p>
      <p>Further, in the FIG. 1 embodiment, the stripped liquid fraction
        from point 7 is divided into first, second and third stripped
        liquid fraction streams having parameters as at points 11, 10
        and 14 respectively. </p>
      <p>The enriched vapor fraction at point 6 is enriched with the
        lower boiling component, namely ammonia, relatively to both a
        rich working fluid fraction and a lean working fluid fraction as
        discussed below. </p>
      <p>The first enriched vapor fraction stream from point 9 is mixed
        with the first stripped liquid fraction stream at point 11 to
        provide a rich working fluid fraction at point 13. </p>
      <p>The second enriched vapor fraction stream at point 8 is mixed
        with the second stripped liquid fraction stream at point 10 to
        produce a lean working fluid fraction at point 12. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction is enriched relatively to the
        composite working fluid (as hereinafter discussed) with the
        lower boiling component comprising ammonia. The lean working
        fluid fraction, on the other hand, is impoverished relatively to
        the composite working fluid (as hereinafter discussed) with
        respect to the lower boiling component. </p>
      <p>The third stripped liquid fraction at point 14 comprises the
        remaining part of the initial composite stream and is used to
        constitute the condensation stream. <br>
        The difference in composition of the lean and rich working fluid
        fractions at points 12 and 13 is achieved by using difference
        proportions of vapor to liquid in forming these two fractions. </p>
      <p>The lean working fluid fraction is cooled between points 12 and
        15 in the recuperator 56 to condense it completely and provide a
        condensed lean working fluid fraction at point 15. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction at point 13 is partially
        condensed in the recuperator 56 to point 16. Thereafter the rich
        working fluid fraction is further cooled and condensed in the
        preheater 62 (from point 16 to 18), and is finally condensed in
        the absorption stage 52 by means of heat exchange with a cooling
        water supply through points 47 to 48. </p>
      <p>The lean working fluid fraction at point 15 is then pumped to a
        charged high pressure level by means of the pump 64 to provide
        it with parameters as at point 24. Likewise the rich working
        fluid fraction is pumped to the same or substantially the same
        charged high pressure level by means of the pump 66. Thereafter
        it passes through the preheater 62 to arrive at point 25 where
        it is substantially at the same pressure and temperature as the
        lean working fluid fraction which is at point 24. </p>
      <p>In practice the temperatures at points 24 and 25 should be
        sufficiently high to prevent water precipitation on the surface
        of the tubes in the evaporator stage 68. <br>
        The flows at points 24 and 25 are then fed separately to the
        first evaporator stage 68. This is the low temperature stage of
        the evaporator system where the rich and lean working fluid
        fractions are heated with the lower temperature portion of a
        heating source supplied originally from point 43 at high
        temperature, and leaving the system at point 46. </p>
      <p>In the first evaporator stage 68 the rich working fluid
        fraction is preferably heated from point 25 to point 27 so that
        it is evaporated entirely and is preferably, at point 27, in the
        form of a saturated vapor at its dew point. Applicant believes
        that this will be the most effective heat utilization in the
        first evaporator stage 68 and that while the rich working fluid
        fraction could be heated to a lower or higher temperature in
        this stage, this will provide no advantage and may lead to
        losses. </p>
      <p>The lean working fluid fraction is likewise heated in the first
        evaporator stage 68 from point 24 to point 26. This is
        preferably heated such that the lean working fluid fraction is
        heated to or substantially to its boiling point by the time it
        reaches point 26. Again Applicant believes that this will be the
        most effective utilization of heat in relation to the lean
        working fluid fraction in the first evaporator stage 68, and
        that heating to a lower or higher temperature will reduce the
        efficiency of the cycle. </p>
      <p>The lean and rich working fluid fractions 26 and 27 are then
        mixed to form, at point 28, a composite working fluid. When they
        are mixed they are in thermodynamical equilibrium both in regard
        to temperature and pressure. Thermodynamical losses on mixing
        should therefore be very low. <br>
        The charged composite working fluid from point 28 is then fed
        through the second evaporator stage 70 where it is preferably
        evaporated completely to produce the charged composite working
        fluid in gaseous form. This is at point 29. From point 29 to
        point 30 the charged composite working fluid is superheated in
        the superheater stage 72. </p>
      <p>The composite working fluid, with parameters at point 30 is
        then sent through the high pressure stage 74 of the turbine to
        transform its energy into usable form. <br>
        Both the high pressure stage 74 and the low pressure stage 76 of
        the turbine are shown to comprise four separate stages. Any
        appropriate turbine system may, however, be used instead. </p>
      <p>After passing through the high pressure stage 74 of the turbine
        the composite working fluid has parameters as at point 34, with
        a lower pressure and lower temperature than it had at point 30.
        From point 34 the composite working fluid is sent back into the
        superheater section 72 of the evaporator stage, where it is
        reheated from point 34 to point 35 and is then fed into the low
        pressure stage 76 of the turbine, where it is fully expanded
        until it reaches the spent low pressure level at point 39. At
        point 39 the composite working fluid preferably has such a low
        pressure that it cannot be condensed at this pressure and at the
        available ambient temperature. From point 39 the spent composite
        working fluid flows through the main heat exchanger 58, through
        the recuperator 56 and through the heat exchanger 54. Here it is
        partially condensed and the released heat is used to preheat the
        incoming flow as previously discussed. </p>
      <p>The spent composite working fluid at point 42 is then mixed
        with the condensation stream at point 20. At point 20 the
        condensation stream has been throttled from point 19 to reduce
        its pressure to the low pressure level of the spent composite
        working fluid at point 42. The resultant mixture is then fed
        from point 21 through the absorption stage 52 where the spent
        composite working fluid is absorbed in the condensation stream
        to regenerate the initial composite stream at point 1. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 2 of the drawings, reference numeral
        50.2 refers generally to an alternative embodiment of an energy
        system or cycle in accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system 50.2 corresponds in all respects with the system
        50.1, except that the superheater stage 72 of FIG. 1 has been
        omitted, and that there is no recycle of the partially expanded
        composite working fluid through such a superheater stage. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3 of the drawings, reference numeral
        50.3 refers to yet a further alternative embodiment of a system
        or cycle in accordance with this invention. </p>
      <p>The system 50.3 corresponds substantially with the system 50.1
        of FIG. 1, and corresponding parts are identified with
        corresponding reference numerals. </p>
      <p>In the system 50.3 the stripped liquid fraction at point 7 is
        divided into first, second and third stripped liquid fractions
        at points 11, 15 and 10 respectively. Further, in this
        embodiment, only one enriched vapor fraction is produced at
        point 6. It is not split into two vapor fraction streams as in
        the case of the cycles 50.1 and 50.2. </p>
      <p>The enriched vapor fraction at point 9 is mixed with the first
        stripped liquid fraction stream from point 11 to produce the
        rich working fluid fraction at point 13. </p>
      <p>The rich working fluid fraction at point 13 is condensed and
        cooled in the same way as discussed with reference to FIG. 1
        through the recuperator 56, the preheater 62 and the absorption
        stage 52. It is then pumped to the charged high pressure level
        by means of the pump 66, passes through the preheater 62 and
        arrives at point 25. </p>
      <p>The second stripped liquid fraction stream is obtained at point
        15 after passing, together with the third stripped liquid
        fraction stream, through the recuperator 56. After point 17, the
        second and third stripped liquid fraction streams are split with
        the one being conveyed to point 15 to constitute the lean
        working fluid fraction. The third stripped liquid fraction
        stream from point 10 passes through the heat exchanger 54, is
        throttled from point 19 to point 20 to reach the spent low
        pressure level, and thus constitutes the condensation stream for
        absorbing the spent composite working fluid from point 42 in the
        absorption stage 52. </p>
      <p>The lean working fluid fraction at point 15 is pumped to the
        charged high pressure level by means of the pump 64 and arrives
        at point 24 where it has substantially the same pressure and
        temperature parameters as the rich working fluid fraction at
        point 25. </p>
      <p>The remainder of the process is then exactly the same as
        described with reference to FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 4 of the drawings, reference numeral
        50.4 refers to yet a further alternative embodiment of a
        thermodynamic system or cycle in accordance with this invention.
      </p>
      <p>The cycle 50.4 corresponds generally with the cycle 50.2 and
        thus with the cycle 50.1 as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 1 of the
        drawings. Corresponding parts are therefore indicated by
        corresponding reference numerals. </p>
      <p>In the system 50.4, unlike the embodiments of the previous
        figures, only portion of the initial composite stream which is
        at the intermediate pressure at point 2 is subjected to
        distillation in the distillation stage. </p>
      <p>In the system 50.4 the enriched vapor fraction at point 6 is
        again, as in the case of the system 50.1, divided into first and
        second enriched vapor fraction streams at points 9 and 8
        respectively. These streams flow through the recuperator 56
        where they are cooled for partial condensation. </p>
      <p>The stripped liquid fraction from point 7, comprises the
        condensation stream. It flows from point 14 through the
        recuperator 56 to point 17, through the heat exchanger 54 to
        point 19, and then through the throttle valve to point 20 to
        absorb therein, in the absorption stage 52, the spent composite
        working fluid to regenerate the initial composite stream at
        point 1 as described with reference to FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>After point 2 the remaining part of the initial composite
        stream which is not subjected to distillation in the
        distillation system, is extracted and divided into first and
        second composite streams 11 and 10 respectively. </p>
      <p>The second enriched vapor fraction stream from point 8, after
        passing through the recuperator 56, is mixed with the second
        composite stream from point 10, to constitute the lean working
        fluid fraction at point 15. This is then again pumped by means
        of the pump 64 to the charged high pressure level to yield the
        lean working fluid fraction at point 24. </p>
      <p>The first enriched vapor fraction stream from point 9 is fed
        through the recuperator 56 and through the preheater 62.
        Thereafter, from point 18, it is mixed with the first composite
        stream from point 11. This then yields the rich working fluid
        fraction at point 13 which passes through the absorption stage
        52, through the pump 66, and through the preheater 62 to arrive
        at point 25 with the appropriate temperature and pressure
        parameters. </p>
      <p>As in the case of the embodiment of FIG. 1, these two streams
        then pass through the first absorption stage, are then mixed at
        point 28, and are then evaporated in the second absorption stage
        70. </p>
      <p>The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4 corresponds with the cycle
        50.2. It may also, of course, include a superheater stage 72 and
        a recycle loop 34 to 35 as illustrated in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>Persons of ordinary skill in this art will appreciate that for
        appropriate circumstances and conditions, a plurality of lean
        working fluid fractions or rich working fluid fractions can be
        generated by selecting quantities of enriched vapor fractions
        from zero up, and by selecting stripped liquid fractions and/or
        initial composite stream fractions in appropriate quantities as
        may be desired. </p>
      <p>Applicant will now, without wishing to bound by theory, try to
        explain the theoretical basis for this invention with reference
        to the graph of FIG. 5. In this graph temperature is plotted
        against enthalpy for what Applicant believes would be a typical
        water-ammonia system in accordance with this invention. The
        points given in this graph correspond with the points used for
        the various parameters in the cycle 50.1 of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The first evaporator stage 68 or the low temperature evaporator
        stage 68 can be considered as being divided into two portions.
        In the first portion the rich working fluid fraction and the
        lean working fluid fraction are heated from points 25 and 24
        respectively up to the point designated t.sub.br. Both the rich
        and the lean working fluid fractions are below their boiling
        points. In the second part of the first evaporator stage 68,
        beyond the point t.sub.br the temperatures of both the rich and
        lean working fluid fractions are above their bubble point
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>If one were to introduce into the first separation stage only
        the rich working fluid fraction at its given pressure, such a
        fluid would begin to boil at point t.sub.br. This is a
        relatively low temperature and will permit the use of the
        available heat source in full. However, the whole boiling
        process will take place at a relatively low temperature which
        would result in increased temperature differences in most parts
        of the evaporator stage and consequently would result in
        relatively high thermodynamic losses. This theoretical process
        is shown in FIG. 5 by the line between point 25 and t.sub.br, by
        the dotted line from point t.sub.br to point 29a and by the
        dotted line from point 29a to point 29. </p>
      <p>The cooling of the heat source is designated with a chain
        dotted line from point 43 through to point 46. </p>
      <p>If a person were now trying to introduce the composite working
        fluid, comprising the mixture of the rich working fluid fraction
        at point 25 and the lean working fluid fraction at point 24, at
        the same given pressure, while trying to use the available heat
        source in full, this fluid would only begin to boil at a
        temperature t.sub.b. This is a temperature which is higher than
        the temperature of the heat source in the corresponding part of
        the evaporator stage 68. This would consequently make the
        process impossible. This impossible process is demonstrated in
        FIG. 5 by the line 24-t.sub.br -t.sub.b -28-29. Such a process
        would only be possible if incomplete use is made of the
        available heat source and the corresponding thermodynamic losses
        are incurred. </p>
      <p>When, however, the rich working fluid fraction and lean working
        fluid fraction are introduced separately into the first
        evaporation stage 68 in accordance with this invention, the rich
        working fluid fraction will start to boil at the relatively low
        temperature t.sub.br, thereby reducing the "pinch point"
        problem. At the same time, because the rich working fluid
        fraction and lean working fluid fraction have been combined at
        point 28, when they are in thermodynamical equilibrium, the
        boiling process will take place at a relatively high
        temperature. The thermodynamic losses are therefore reduced.
        This, in turn, permits the system to accommodate an increased
        pressure in the evaporator stage and consequently at the turbine
        inlet. This combined process is shown in FIG. 5 by the solid
        line 24-29. </p>
      <p>This resultant summary of the enthalpy of the two systems,
        demonstrates that the curve followed by the system of this
        invention through the first evaporator stage 68, is further away
        from the heating medium line in the pinch point zone to thereby
        reduce the pinch point problem, while it approaches the heating
        medium line more closely after point 28 to reduce the
        thermodynamic losses. </p>
      <p>Applicant believes that by using more than two working fluid
        fractions of varying composition which are combined in
        successive stages as they pass through successive evaporator
        stages, and by using superheating in an effective number of
        stages, the heating curve of the working fluid fraction can be
        smoothened to approach that of the heating fluid more closely
        and thereby lead to a reduction in thermodynamic losses. </p>
      <p>In certain embodiments of the invention where the composite
        working fluid has been expanded from a very high pressure to a
        spent low pressure level, the working fluid may, at point 39,
        have a temperature which is too low. It may also have a
        significant content of condensed liquid. As a result it can have
        an adverse effect on the performance of the last stages of the
        turbine 76. In addition, the quantity and quality of heat
        remaining in this stream after point 39 may not be sufficient to
        provide for distillation of the initial composite stream and
        thus for regeneration of the working fluid fraction. Applicant
        believes that this potential disadvantage may overcome by the
        superheater stage 72 and by the recycle loop as employed between
        points 34 and 35 in FIGS. 1 and 3. </p>

          A method and apparatus for implementing a thermodynamic cycle
          involves utilizing partial distillation of a multi-component
          working fluid stream. At least one main enriched solution is
          produced which is relatively enriched with respect to the
          lower boiling temperature component, together with at least
          one lean solution which is relatively impoverished with the
          respect of lower boiling temperature component. The main
          working fluid is expanded to a low pressure level to convert
          energy to a usable form. This spent low pressure level working
          fluid is condensed by dissolving with cooling in the lean
          solution to regenerate an initial working fluid for reuse. A
          portion of the impoverished fraction may be injected into the
          charged gaseous main working fluid in order to obtain added
          work and to increase system efficiency by decreasing the
          temperature of the output fluid flow when the fluid flow would
          otherwise have been superheated. A low pressure, low
          temperature expanded spent fluid may be distilled using low
          quality heat to create an enriched solution which has a
          significantly higher concentration of the lower boiling
          component. For this enriched solution, a reduced temperature
          and pressure is sufficient to enable distillation. The
          efficiency of the cycle may be enhanced by charging the spent
          fluid with the lower boiling temperature component prior to
          distillation. This may be accomplished by lowering the
          pressure of the impoverished fraction to separate an
          additional lower boiling temperature fraction. </div>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">BACKGROUND OF
          THE INVENTION </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">1. Field of
          the Invention </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">This invention
          relates generally to methods and apparatus for transforming
          energy from a heat source into usable form using a working
          fluid that is expanded and regenerated. This invention further
          relates to a method and apparatus for improving the heat
          utilization efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">2. Brief
          Description of the Background Art </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In the Rankine
          cycle, the working fluid such as water, ammonia or a freon is
          evaporated in an evaporator utilizing an available heat
          source. The evaporated gaseous working fluid is expanded
          across a turbine to transform its energy into usable form. The
          spent gaseous working fluid is then condensed in a condenser
          using an available cooling medium. The pressure of the
          condensed working medium is increased by pumping, followed by
          evaporation, and so on to continue the cycle. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The basic
          Kalina cycle, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,561, utilizes a
          binary or multi-component working fluid. This cycle operates
          generally on the principle that a binary working fluid is
          pumped as a liquid to a high working pressure and is heated to
          partially vaporize the working fluid. The fluid is then
          flashed to separate high and low boiling working fluids and
          the low boiling component is expanded through a turbine to
          drive the turbine, while the high boiling component has heat
          recovered for use in heating the binary working fluid prior to
          evaporation. The high boiling component is then mixed with the
          spent low boiling working fluid to absorb the spent working
          fluid in a condenser in the presence of a cooling medium. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">A theoretical
          comparison of the conventional Rankine cycle and the Kalina
          cycle demonstrates the improved efficiency of the new cycle
          over the Rankine cycle when an available, relatively low
          temperature heat source such as ocean water, geothermal energy
          or the like is employed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In applicant's
          further invention, referred to as the Exergy cycle, the
          subject of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 405,942, filed
          Aug. 6, 1982, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,563 relatively lower
          temperature avilable heat is utilized to effect partial
          distillation of at least a portion of a multicomponent working
          fluid stream at an intermediate pressure to generate working
          fluid fractions of differing compositions. The fractions are
          used to produce at least one main rich solution which is
          relatively enriched with respect to the lower boiling
          component, and to produce at least one lean solution which is
          relatively impoverished with respect to the lower boiling
          component. The pressure of the main rich solution is
          increased; thereafter, it is evaporated to produce a charged
          gaseous main working fluid. The main working fluid is expanded
          to a low pressure level to convert energy to usable form. The
          spent low pressure level working fluid is condensed in a main
          absorption stage by dissolving with cooling in the lean
          solution to regenerate an initial working fluid for reuse. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The inventor
          of the present invention has appreciated that it would be
          highly desirable to enable the efficient use of a very low
          pressure and temperature fluid at the turbine outlet, in the
          Exergy cycle. Regardless of the temperature of the cooling
          water in the condenser, the higher the pressure of
          condensation in the Exergy cycle, the higher is the
          concentration of the lower boiling component in the basic
          solution. However, the higher the pressure of condensation,
          the higher the pressure at the turbine outlet and the higher
          the concentration of the lower boiling component at the
          turbine outlet. This higher concentration basic solution
          requires for distillation, heat of a lower temperature. Thus,
          by reducing the pressure, and consequently the temperature at
          the turbine outlet, the concentration of the lower boiling
          component of the basic solution may be lowered and a higher
          temperature may be required at the turbine outlet to provide
          for distillation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">This
          contradiction might be addressed by balancing the pressure at
          the turbine outlet with the cooling water temperature.
          However, to achieve the maximum power output, the turbine
          outlet pressure must be as low as possible. When the turbine
          outlet pressure and temperature are reduced, as described
          above, the concentration of the lower boiling component of the
          basic solution decreases. This results in a cycle requiring
          exactly the opposite action to increase the turbine outlet
          pressure and temperature. The situation worsens with higher
          available cooling water temperature. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The inventor
          of the present invention has also appreciated the desirability
          of controlling the outlet temperature of the fluid exiting the
          turbine in the Exergy cycle. The efficiency of a thermodynamic
          cycle such as the Exergy cycle may be improved by heating the
          fluid in the boiler to the highest possible temperature with
          the available heat source. However, it is still desirable that
          the fluid exiting from the turbine be at a temperature and
          pressure close to that of a saturated vapor. To the extent
          that the exiting vapor is superheated, exergy is wasted. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It is
          particularly desirable in the Exergy cycle to obtain only
          slightly superheated vapor or saturated vapor from the turbine
          while inputting fluid at the highest possible temperature to
          the turbine. This is because in the Exergy cycle the output
          from the turbine is not simply condensed, but instead is used
          for distillation. The superheating of the fluid outletted from
          the turbine may cause unnecessary exergy losses in the cycle
          as a whole. For example, since the spent fluid from the
          turbine may be used to pre-heat the condensed fluid in a heat
          exchanger prior to regeneration, as described in the
          aforementioned patent application, an inefficiently high
          temperature difference may exist in the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">If one
          attempts to overcome this problem by further fluid expansion
          in the turbine, one obtains a lower temperature at the turbine
          outlet but a lower pressure as well. This lower pressure fluid
          is more troublesome to distill because more heat is required
          and this lower pressure fluid requires a larger quantity of
          lean solution to absorb it. Thus, this approach to the
          solution of the problem of exergy losses arising from the high
          temperature of the fluid exiting the turbine is not desirable.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">SUMMARY OF THE
          INVENTION </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It is a
          primary object of one aspect of the present invention to
          provide a method and apparatus for increasing the efficiency
          of the Exergy cycle by enabling the selection of a low
          pressure and temperature basic solution at the turbine outlet
          through enrichment of the basic solution from the turbine
          prior to its regeneration by partial distillation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It is a
          further object of the present invention to provide such a
          method and apparatus that lessens the heat loading on the
          condenser. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It is a
          primary object of another aspect of the present invention, to
          decrease the exergy losses arising from the superheating of
          the fluid exiting from the turbine without unduly lowering the
          pressure of the fluid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It is another
          object of the present invention to provide a method and
          apparatus that efficiently regulates the temperature of the
          fluid exiting from a turbine in the Exergy cycle and uses any
          extra heat to obtain extra energy in the turbine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">These and
          other objects of the present invention may be achieved by a
          method of generating usable energy including the step of
          vaporizing at an upper intermediate pressure, only part of an
          initial multi-component working fluid stream having lower and
          higher temperature boiling components to form a first vapor
          fraction. The first vapor fraction is therefore enriched with
          the lower boiling temperature component. The vapor fraction is
          mixed with part of the initial working fluid stream and
          absorbed therein to produce a rich solution, enriched
          relatively to the initial working fluid stream with respect to
          the lower temperature boiling component. The remaining part of
          the initial working fluid stream is used as a lean solution
          which is impoverished relatively to the main solution with
          respect to the lower temperature boiling component. The
          pressure of the rich solution is increased to a charged high
          pressure level. The rich solution is evaporated to produce a
          charged gaseous main working fluid that is expanded to a spent
          low pressure level to transform its energy into usable form.
          The spent main working fluid is cooled and condensed by
          absorbing it in a part of the lean solution. An enriched
          fraction is separated from a part of the lean solution. The
          enriched fraction is enriched relatively to the lean solution
          with respect to the lower boiling temperature component. The
          enriched fraction is mixed with the condensed main working
          fluid to form an initial multi-component working fluid stream.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In accordance
          with another preferred embodiment of the present invention a
          method of generating usable energy includes the step of
          generating a vapor fraction by vaporizing only part of an
          initial multi-component working fluid stream having lower and
          higher temperature boiling components. The vapor fraction is
          enriched with the lower boiling temperature component. The
          vapor fraction is mixed with part of the initial working fluid
          stream and absorbed therein to produce a rich solution
          enriched relatively to the working fluid stream with respect
          to the lower temperature component. The remaining part of the
          initial working fluid stream is used as a lean solution
          impoverished relatively to the rich solution with respect to
          lower temperature boiling component. The pressure of the rich
          solution is increased to a charged high pressure level. The
          rich solution is evaporated to produce a charged, superheated
          gaseous main working fluid and expanded to a spent low
          pressure level to convert energy into a usable form. The spent
          main working fluid is cooled and condensed by dissolving it in
          a portion of the lean solution. A portion of the lean solution
          is also injected into the charged gaseous working fluid to
          lower the temperature of the gaseous working fluid. This
          injection may be made into the charged gaseous working fluid
          while the main working fluid is continuing to expand or it may
          be made into the gaseous main working fluid after the fluid
          has been completely expanded. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In accordance
          with still another preferred embodiment of the present
          invention an apparatus for generating usable energy with a
          multi-component working fluid includes a turbine with a gas
          inlet and a gas outlet. A distilling device is in fluid
          communication with the turbine gas outlet. This device is
          adapted to separate a lower boiling temperature component from
          a higher boiling temperature component of the multi-component
          working fluid using the heat of the outlet gas from the
          turbine. The distilling device includes a mixing section
          arranged to mix separated lower boiling temperature fraction
          with the working fluid to form a rich solution. A condenser is
          arranged to condense the rich solution and an evaporator
          communicates with the condenser and the inlet to the turbine.
          The injector is arranged to inject lean solution from the
          distilling device into the superheated fluid near the outlet
          of the turbine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In accordance
          with yet another preferred embodiment of the present
          invention, an apparatus for generating usable energy with a
          multi-component working fluid includes a turbine having a gas
          inlet and a gas outlet and a condenser connected to condense
          the spent fluid from the turbine. A first distilling device is
          in fluid communication with the turbine gas outlet. This
          device is adapted to separate a lower boiling temperature
          component from a higher boiling temperature component and the
          multi-component working fluid. The distilling device includes
          a mixing section arranged to mix a separated lower boiling
          temperature fraction with the working fluid to form a rich
          solution. The second distilling device is arranged to separate
          a lower boiling temperature fraction from the fluid remaining
          after the lower boiling temperature component has been
          separated in the first distilling device. The second
          distilling device includes a mixer section adapted to mix a
          lower boiling temperature fraction separated by the second
          distilling device into the spent fluid from the condenser. An
          evaporator communicates with the condenser and the inlet to
          the turbine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In accordance
          with another preferred embodiment of the present invention a
          regenerator for spent multi-component working fluid having a
          temperature and pressure too low for condensation by
          conventional means with an available cooling medium includes a
          first pump for increasing the pressure of the spent fluid. A
          concentrator increases the concentration of the lower boiling
          temperature component of the working fluid. A second pump
          increases the pressure of the concentrated fluid. A heat
          exchanger, communicating with the concentrator, is arranged to
          transfer heat from the unconcentrated spent fluid and to
          transfer heat to the concentrated spent fluid. A first
          separator communicates with the heat exchanger for separating
          a portion of the lower boiling temperature component from the
          concentrated fluid and for recombining the separated portion
          of the lower boiling temperature component with a portion of
          the remainder of the concentrated fluid so as to form a
          regenerated working fluid that may be condensed by the
          available cooling system. A second separator for extracting a
          lower boiling temperature component from a portion of the
          remainder of the concentrated fluid is arranged to supply
          lower boiling temperature component to the concentrator. The
          second separator may include a fluid pressure lowering device
          for extracting the lower boiling temperature component. </p>

          A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Referring to
          the drawing wherein like reference characters are utilized for
          like parts throughout the several views, a system 10, shown in
          FIG. 1, implements a thermodynamic cycle, in accordance with
          one embodiment of the present invention, using a boiler 102, a
          turbine 104, a condenser 106, a pump 108, and a distilling
          subsystem 126. The subsystem 126 includes a recuperator 110, a
          distilling gravity separator 112, a heater 114, a preheater
          116, a deconcentrating separator 118, and a concentrator 120.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Various types
          of heat sources may be used to drive the cycle of this
          invention. Thus, for example, heat sources with temperatures
          as high as, say 500° C. or more, down to low heat sources such
          as those obtained from ocean thermal gradients may be
          utilized. Heat sources such as, for example, low grade primary
          fuel, waste heat, geothermal heat, solar heat or ocean thermal
          energy conversion systems may be implemented with the present
          invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">A variety of
          working fluids may be used in conjunction with this system
          including any multi-component working fluid that comprises a
          lower boiling point fluid and a relatively higher boiling
          point fluid. Thus, for example, the working fluid may be an
          ammonia-water mixture, two or more hydrocarbons, two or more
          freons, mixtures of hydrocarbons and freons or the like. In
          general the fluid may be mixtures of any number of compounds
          with favorable thermodynamic characteristics and solubility.
          The system or cycle of this invention may be described by way
          of example by reference to the use of an ammonia-water working
          solution. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In an
          ammonia/water working solution, the ammonia constitutes the
          lower boiling component with a boiling point of -33° C., while
          water is the higher boiling component with a boiling point of
          100° C. Then the higher the concentration of ammonia, the
          lower the boiling point of the water/ammonia composite. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The charged
          composite working fluid implements a continuous system wherein
          the fluid is expanded to convert energy into an usable form
          followed by continuous regeneration. A substantially constant
          and consistent quantity of the composite working fluid may
          therefore by maintained in the system for long term use. </p>

          increased by the pump 122 to point 2 where the fluid exists as
          a subcooled liquid at a lower intermediate pressure, which is
          intermediate which respect to the pressure at the turbine
          inlet 30 and outlet 38. From point 2 the subcooled liquid is
          directed through the top of the concentrator 120 where it is
          mixed, for example by spraying, with the flow of saturated
          vapor having a higher concentration of the lower boiling point
          component arriving from point 28. The pressure at point 28 is
          made essentially the same as the pressure at point 2. Because
          of the increase in the pressure provided by the pump 122 the
          distillation fluid more easily absorbs the saturated vapor
          arriving from the point 28. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">As a result of
          mixing in the concentrator 120, a saturated liquid passes
          outwardly from the concentrator 120 through the point 41. This
          saturated liquid has a higher concentration of the lower
          boiling component than the liquid existing at the point 2 so
          that the liquid at point 41 may be termed an "enriched"
          liquid. This enriched liquid is pumped by the pump 124 to an
          upper intermediate pressure at point 42. The liquid is then
          successively heated in preheater 116, heater 114, and
          recuperator 110. The heating processes in the preheater 116
          and heater 114 are performed by recuperation of the heat of
          counterflowing outlet fluid from the turbine 104 as well as
          the heat from other fluids utilized in the system. However,
          the heating in the recuperator 110 is performed only by the
          heat of the flow from the turbine 104 outlet 38 and, as such,
          is compensation for under recuperation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The enriched
          flow at point 5, for example, is partially evaporated and
          passes into the distilling gravity separator 112. Vapor,
          strongly enriched by the lower boiling point component is
          separated and passes through point 6. A lean stripped liquid,
          impoverished with respect to the lower boiling component which
          is substantially removed, exits from the separator 112 through
          point 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The lean
          liquid flow from the separator 112 is divided into three flow
          paths, identified by the points 8, 10, and 40. The flow of
          liquid passing through point 8 is proportionately mixed with
          the vapor from point 6. As a result, the generated mixture,
          passing point 9, has the necessary concentration of lower
          boiling and higher boiling components, to be used as the
          working fluid for the remainder of the cycle. The proportion
          of lower and higher boiling components forming the working
          fluid is selected to minimize the energy losses during
          operation. Generally, the fluid at point 9 is enriched with
          the lower boiling component with respect to the fluid at point
          5. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">In order to
          achieve the greatest possible efficiency it is also
          advantageous to choose the working composition concentration
          to get the minimum exergy losses in the boiler 102. As a
          practical matter, the applicable optimal range lies between 50
          to 70 percent by weight of the low boiling component in most,
          but not necessarily all cases. Generally, it is advantageous
          to include at least 20 to 25% by weight of the higher boiling
          component. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">This enriched
          working fluid is cooled in the heater 114, thereby providing
          the heat for the heating of the fluid passing from the point 3
          to the point 4, as described above. In the boiler preheater
          130, the flow is further cooled so that the fluid is
          completely condensed in the condenser 106, by cooling water
          flowing along the line 24 to 23. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The condensed
          working fluid is pumped by the pump 108 from the point 14 to
          the point 21 so that it moves counterflow through the
          preheater 116. The working fluid then flows through the boiler
          102 where it is heated and preferably substantially
          evaporated. Most preferably the working fluid is completely
          evaporated, and superheated at point 30. The flow of boiler
          heating fluid is indicated by the line 25 to 26. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The
          superheated vapor is then expanded in the turbine 104
          outputting the desired mechanical power. If the working fluid
          at point 38 is still superheated vapor, lean liquid from the
          distilling gravity separator 112 may be injected into the
          expanding working fluid in the turbine 104. This injection is
          most practical into the inlet to the last or the next to the
          last turbine stage. However, this result may also be
          accomplished by injection into fluid stream following exit
          from the turbine 104, for example at the point 38, as
          indicated in a dashed line in FIG. 1. As a result of this
          injection near the turbine outlet, the working fluid from the
          previous stage of the turbine 104 has its concentration
          changed in travelling from the point 36 to the point 39. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">When the
          saturated liquid injection is accomplished before the last
          turbine stage it must be done in such proportions that the
          state of the working fluid in the following stage of the
          turbine 104 is still a superheated vapor. However, the
          temperature of the mixed gas at the point 39 is lower than the
          temperature of the gas in the turbine preceeding injection.
          Also, the concentration of the lower boiling point component
          at the point 39 is lower than the concentration at the point
          preceeding injection. The enthalpy at the point 39 is also
          lower than the enthalpy at the point preceding injection.
          Similarly the enthalpy, temperature and lower boiling
          component concentration at the outlet of the turbine 104 are
          lower than they would have been without injection. In
          addition, the weight flow rate at the turbine outlet is higher
          than at the point preceeding injection, since this flow rate
          is equal to the sum of the flow rates into the juncture 132. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The injection
          is most advantageously proportioned so that the outlet of the
          last stage of the turbine 104 has the characteristics of a
          saturated or wet vapor instead of superheated vapor.
          Alternatively, where injection is performed into the gas that
          has already exited from the turbine, the gas becomes a
          saturated vapor upon mixing with the injected fluid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The pressure
          of the inlet fluid in the line 136 is made substantially equal
          to the pressure in the line 137 preceeding injection. To
          achieve this result, a pressure equalizing device 138 is
          utilized. The pressure equalizing device 138 may take the form
          of a throttle valve, when it is necessary to decrease the
          pressure of the incoming fluid to match that of the turbine.
          The device 138 may be totally omitted when the pressure of the
          inlet flow happens to equal that of the flow within the
          turbine 104. The pressure equalizing device 138 may take the
          form of a pump when it is necessary to increase the pressure
          in the line 136 to equal that in the line 137. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The turbine
          outlet flow passes from the point 38 consecutively through the
          recuperator 110, heater 114, and preheater 116 so that the
          flow is cooled and partially condensed. However, the pressure
          at the turbine outlet and consequently, at the recuperator 110
          outlet, the heater 114 outlet, and the preheater 116 outlet
          may be so low that it may not be possible to condense the
          fluid at that pressure with the available cooling water
          temperature. While this result may appear to be unfortunate at
          first glance, in fact, this means that the energy of the fluid
          has been fully utilized in the turbine 104. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">To overcome
          this problem, a portion of the stripped liquid flow removed
          from the distilling separator 112 is cooled in the heater 114
          as it flows from the point 10 to the point 12. This process
          provides the heat necessary for the heating process of the
          fluid moving from point 3 to point 4. The stripped liquid flow
          is throttled by the throttle valve 140 to the lower
          intermediate pressure, at the point 27 (so that pressure at
          point 27 equals pressure at point 2). This fluid, at the lower
          intermediate pressure, is directed into the de-concentrating
          separator 118 where it is separated into two streams due to
          the lowering of the fluid pressure by the valve 140. The first
          stream is a saturated vapor which extends through the point
          28, and is relatively enriched with respect to the lower
          boiling component. The second stream is an absorbing, lean
          solution passing through point 29, that is relatively
          impoverished with respect to the lower boiling component and
          therefore tends to readily absorb the low boiling component.
          The vapor passing through the point 28 is directed into the
          concentrator 120 where it is mixed with subcooled liquid flow
          from point 2 to increase the lower boiling component
          concentration of the fluid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The absorbing
          lean solution passes the point 29 with the same pressure as
          the enriched flow at point 42 (upper intermediate pressure),
          but the lean solution has a much lower concentration of the
          lower boiling component than the flow at point 42. As a
          result, the temperature at the point 29 is always higher than
          the temperature at the point 42. Therefore the absorbing, lean
          flow at point 29 is sent through the preheater 116 where it is
          cooled, providing part of the heat necessary for heating the
          fluid flowing from the concentrator 120 through the preheater
          116. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The cooled,
          absorbing, lean solution is throttled by the throttle valve
          142 to a low pressure substantially equal to the pressure at
          the turbine outlet with parameters similar to those at the
          point 17. The turbine outlet flow at point 17 and the
          absorbing, lean solution flow at point 19 are mixed,
          generating a flow of a basic solution at point 18. The
          concentration of the higher boiling component in the flow at
          the point 18 is such that the fluid can be completely
          condensed at the available cooling water temperature.
          Therefore, this flow is fully condensed in the condenser 106
          to reach the parameters of the fluid at point 1, after which
          the above-described process is repeated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Those skilled
          in the art will appreciate that it is desirable in terms of
          thermal efficiency to have the highest possible fluid
          temperature at the inlet to the turbine. This is because it
          always beneficial to have the working fluid and the heating
          fluid at relatively close temperatures. By maximizing the
          temperature at the inlet to the turbine 104, a greater power
          output may be obtained from the turbine 104 with a
          consequently greater enthalpy drop than would be obtained if a
          lower temperature were utilized. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Nevertheless,
          the temperature at the turbine outlet must increase
          corresponding to the increased temperature at the turbine
          inlet. This may mean that the working fluid flow leaving the
          turbine 104 may still be in a superheated vapor state.
          However, this extra energy existing in the form of superheated
          vapor is essentially useless in the distillation process and
          is generally useless in the cycle as a whole. This means that
          there is an incomplete use of the energy potential of the
          working fluid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">To achieve the
          highest possible cycle efficiency, a relatively high
          concentration of the lower boiling point component in the
          working fluid passing through the boiler 102 and the turbine
          104 is desirable. However, at the same time, it is preferable
          to have a lower concentration of the lower boiling component
          in the turbine output flow passing through the distillation
          subsystem 126. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Thus the
          injection of liquid into the turbine 104 through the injector
          139, immediately reduces the lower boiling component
          concentration of the flow passing through the last stages of
          the turbine 104, causing thermodynamic losses. Those losses
          are compensated for by the higher weight flow rate of the flow
          through the last stages of the turbine 104. Absent this
          accommodation, the potential energy in the fluid flow through
          the turbine would be unused and would be essentially wasted in
          the heat exchange processes of the distillation subsystem 126.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">It should be
          understood that the present cycle may be operable without the
          use of injection of liquids from the separator 112 into the
          turbine 104. Specifically if the fluid exiting from the outlet
          of the turbine 104 is not superheated, injection may be
          wasteful and is generally unnecessary. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">When injection
          of liquid into the turbine 104 is appropriate, the point of
          injection is determined by the point where the smallest
          possible exergy losses result in the cycle. One of ordinary
          skill in the art will be capable of determining this point. It
          generally will lie somewhere in the latter stages of the
          turbine or after exit from the turbine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Through the
          use of the liquid injection system, additional power may be
          gained from the turbine 104. This arises primarily from the
          higher flow rate through the turbine 104. However, it can be
          appreciated that the available energy is utilized in a more
          efficient manner to increase the output from the turbine 104.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">The
          concentrator 120 and related components enable the
          concentration of the basic solution to be chosen to
          accommodate a relatively low pressure and temperature at the
          turbine outlet. Thus, even where the pressure and temperature
          at the turbine outlet are seemingly insufficient to enable
          distillation of the basic solution, the operation of the
          system is not adversely affected. This is because an enriched
          solution, having a significantly higher concentration of the
          lower boiling component, is the one that is subjected to the
          distillation process. For this enriched solution a lower
          turbine outlet temperature is sufficient to enable
          distillation to proceed on an efficient basis. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">However, it
          should also be appreciated that this result is achieved while
          decreasing the heat loading on the condenser 106. This is
          because part of the hot liquid from the separator 112 is
          diverted to other processes, without condensation, and
          therefore less condensation is necessary. In other words, the
          fluid outletted from the turbine 104 is mixed, before
          condensation, with absorbing, lean flow which is even leaner
          than the liquid flow coming from the distilling separator 112.
          Therefore, after absorption, the leaner portion of the flow
          which is coming into the condenser 106 is in the form of
          liquid, and thus a lower quantity of heat has to be removed to
          produce condensation. This presumably lowers condenser surface
          requirements and increases the efficiency of the system. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Overall, with
          present invention using the injector 139, the average
          temperature of the fluid flow from the point 38 to the point
          17 is effectively increased. At the same time the average
          temperature of the required heat from the point 42 to the
          point 5 is decreased by injecting the enriched vapor in the
          concentrator 120. Thus, separately and in combination, these
          effects serve to increase overall system efficiency. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Relatively
lower




            temperature heat for the distillation subsystem 126 of this
            invention may be obtained in the form of spent relatively
            high temperature heat, the lower temperature part of
            relatively higher temperature heat from a heat source, the
            relatively lower temperature waste or other heat which is
            available from a heat source, and/or the relatively lower
            temperature heat that cannot be utilized efficiently for
            evaporation in the boiler. In practice, any available heat,
            particularly lower temperature heat which cannot be used
            effectively for evaporation, may be utilized as the
            relatively lower temperature heat for the distillation
            subsystem 126. In the same way such relatively lower
            temperature heat may be used for preheating. </span><br
