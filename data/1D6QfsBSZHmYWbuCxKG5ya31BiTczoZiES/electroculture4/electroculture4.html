            System</b><br>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      The “Plantricity” system was developed by David MacZura and
      published to the world via his friend Mark Fancher’s website,
      BroadrOOt.com.&nbsp; David has been developing 2 methods of
      growing, one called MultirOOting, and another called
      Plantricity.&nbsp; Plantricity is David’s way of stimulating
      plants by planting a portion of the plant other than it’s normal
      root system into a separate container and electrifying both
      containers with a switched electric current.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, the results of his experiments stand for
      themselves:<br>
      <br>
      In the photo below, the electrified Pothos plant on the right side
      has much larger leaves that are also much greener than the
      multiRooted plants on the left.<br>

        Electrically-Stimulation via Custom Fish-House </b><br>
      <br>
      For those interested in aquaculture, the photo below shows a small
      group of fish that are congregating around a custom powered
      fish-house that houses an electric-field.&nbsp; It turns out that
      the stimulated house was a popular place for the fish to
      congregate.<br>
      <br>
      The author writes, “Over a period of time, the loss of fish was
      drastically less on the electrically stimulated setup.&nbsp; The
      appetite and size of the fish electrically stimulated setup was
      also much greater than the non-electric tank.” – Plantricity

      This is an experimental arrangement developed by the author to
      test certain theories relative to stimulating plant growth in a
      very high voltage electro-static field. Details on the equipment
      built for the experiment are detailed and some of the background
      on the "why" of electro-culture is discussed.<br>
      <br>
      HANGING your pet geranium upside down in the cellar all winter
      isn't necessarily all it takes to grow a beautiful plant next
      spring. Of course, amateur horticulturists — as well as
      professionals — have any number of theories about how you can
      automatically have a green thumb; but several historical and many
      more recent experiments have shown that successful gardening isn't
      just a matter of fertilizing, watering, and tender loving care.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, only a handful of people realize the role that natural
      electricity plays in the development of plant life. Yet, in 1902,
      physics professor S. Lemstroem, after a trip to the northern polar
      regions, decided that the rapid growth of vegetation during the
      short arctic summer was due to the unique electrical conditions of
      the atmosphere in those latitudes. Back in his laboratory,
      Professor Lemstroem reproduced the assumed arctic conditions by
      increasing the atmospheric current (which normally flows from the
      air to the plant) by placing a wire with a high static charge on
      it (generated by a Wimshurst machine) over a plant. An increase in
      plant yield was noticed.<br>
      <br>
      Study of electro-culture (as the science is called) began with
      basic experiments by a Dr. Mambray in England in 1746. Later, in
      1879, a French scientist, L. Grandeau, saw dramatic possibilities
      in the field which he described in a paper "Influence de
      l'Electricite Atmospherique sur la Nutritio des Vegeaux." But the
      real break came in 1902 with the Lemstroem experiments.<br>
      <br>
      In more recent times, other experimenters extended the work to
      treatment of viable seeds using radio-frequency and ultrasonic
      methods. The r-f techniques involved frequencies above 30 MHz
      applied for a few seconds to seed bag placed into r-f tank
      circuits. Ultrasonic schemes involved the brief dipping of bags
      into bath agitated at frequencies up to 1 MHz. Plants grown from
      seeds treated in this way had yield profiles ranging from fair to
      excellent.<br>
      <br>
      Fertilizers Spoil Picture. It was the invention and use of cheap
      chemical fertilizers that effectively suppressed electro-cultural
      engineering. Today, however, we are in the position where nitrate
      pollution by these very fertilizers threatens not only our water
      supply but the entire ecological panorama as well. Thus it would
      appear that the revival of electro-culture is not only desirable
      but imminently necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Experimenting with electro-culture is largely the same as building
      a stereo amplifier or a digital voltmeter. For one thing, high
      static voltages are involved and a good degree of professionalism
      is required to obtain good results. (Keep in mind that we are
      concerned with living plants, which have their own peculiarities
      and may not always respond as expected - only large-scale trends
      are important.)<br>
      <br>
      Typical electro-culture systems frequently operate unattended for
      long periods of time in an open-air environment. This requires
      heavy-duty construction in both the electrical and mechanical
      aspects of the equipment.<br>
      <br>
      However, expenditures can be kept low by using surplus-type
      materials. In the case of an experimental electro-culture system
      using high-voltage discharge, the cost of a typical exciter unit
      can be below $35.00.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 1.</b> This is system originally used by Dr. Lemstroem who
      got the idea from rapid growth of vegetation during the short
      arctic spring and summer. He believed that the natural high
      atmospheric current was responsible for extremely rapid growth.<br>

      Basic System. A schematic of a Lemstroem type of electro-culture
      system is shown in Fig. 1. Here, the positive terminal of the
      high-voltage power supply is connected to the overhead wire, with
      current return through a ground path. Potentials are as high as
      20,000 volts — up to 60,000 volts for short periods of time. While
      natural atmospheric currents range between 10-16 and 10-15
      amperes, the excitation provided by the high-voltage wire provides
      currents around 10-12 or 10-11 A, as measured by a sensitive
      electrometer. In open-air experimental fields, the height of the
      overhead discharge wires with respect to ground may be front 3 to
      10 feet. The height above ground naturally affects the amount of
      atmospheric current. Remember that the high voltage essentially
      serves as a "current carrier" — appropriate current values cannot
      be generated under other than high-tension conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 2.</b> Provision must be made to prevent animals,
      children, or strangers from touching the high-voltage lead. A
      simple wooden barrier is sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      High-voltage electro-culture systems may take the form shown in
      Fig. 2. The apparatus was designed to investigate the
      susceptibility of many different plants to stimulation. The
      equipment generates ozone (O2) and must be used in well-ventilated
      areas only.<br>
      <br>
      An electrical schematic of this system is shown in Fig. 3.
      Transformer T1 has an output of 3000 volts rms. After
      rectification, the effective dc is approximately 4200 volts. A
      dropping resistor may be necessary on the filament winding to
      obtain the correct voltage for the rectifier. If leakage current
      in the reverse mode can be tolerated, a high-voltage rectifier
      diode may be used instead of the tube and filament winding.<br>
      <br>
      The 3000 volts dc generated is highly dangerous to touch.<br>
      <br>
      Resistor R1 (made up of several resistors in series) serves as a
      current limiter and can be anywhere from 5 to 20 megohms, the
      latter value limiting the current to 210 µA in the event of an
      accidental short circuit. Resistor R1 may be in series with either
      the positive or negative output terminal.<br>
      <br>
      Resistor R2 is connected to two pieces of high-voltage cable with
      the connections and resistor thoroughly wrapped with high-voltage
      insulation so that the resistor is actually imbedded in the cable.
      Put insulated alligator clips on each end of the cable. This
      resistor forms a safety discharge shunt and must be connected
      across the output terminals when the apparatus is shut off to
      discharge capacitor C1 and the antenna structure ("discharge
      element" in Fig. 3).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 3. </b>A high-voltage diode may be used in place of V1
      and R3 can then be omitted.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V1 — Half-wave, high-voltage rectifier tube<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note — Alternate rectifier diode D1 (IR 67
      D-050H55FNN) can be used as shown by dotted line. See text.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misc. — Large plastic container, 3-lead power
      line, mounting plate, insulators, high-voltage cable (10-kV test),
      hookup wire, hardware, ground plate for pot.<br>
      <br>
      The power supply's physical layout is shown in Fig. 4. For
      safety's sake and good appearance, the entire power unit is
      mounted on the lid of a plastic camping chest. Ceramic insulators
      are fastened to the lid to provide connections for the discharge
      element and ground wires. A simple ground electrode is inserted
      into the moist dirt (earth mixed with moss is good) in the pot and
      the pot sirs in a metallic basket which is connected to the
      negative terminal of the supply. The antenna or discharge element
      is connected to the positive terminal and consists of a simple
      metal rod.<br>
      <br>
      The 117-volt line cord is a grounded 3-wire type, with the green
      (ground) wire connected to the perforated-steel mounting plate on
      which the plant basket sits. The high-voltage transformer is
      mounted on insulators and the rectifier tube socket is mounted on
      insulators on a Bakelite terminal board. The string of resistors
      comprising R1 is fastened to stand-off insulators of the ceramic
      type. In the model shown in Fig. 4, a separate transformer was
      used for the tube filament supply with dropping resistor R3
      mounted on the Bakelite terminal board. The entire high-voltage
      section is wired with high-voltage cable tested to 10,000 volts
      dc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 4.</b> Because the relatively weak plastic chest cover
      will not support much weight, a perforated metal base plate is
      used to mount the heavy components. Feedthroughs are used to
      couple to the 'antenna' and the main ground plate that supports
      the flower pot.<br>

      R-F High-Voltage Supply. A schematic for a radio-frequency
      high-voltage unit is shown in Fig. 5. It is an inexpensive and
      slightly less dangerous alternate to the supply described above.<br>
      <br>
      Effective dc output of this supply is 5000 volts at 200
      microamperes maximum. Thus, should the supply's output electrodes
      be touched accidentally, an unpleasant, but non-lethal, shock will
      be experienced.<br>
      <br>
      Electronically, the supply is comprised of a straightforward
      feedback oscillator. Optimum oscillator frequency is approximately
      225 kHz. Tube V2 is a half-wave rectifier. The supply may be
      constructed on a simple chassis and installed in a manner similar
      to the one shown in Fig. 2.<br>
      <br>
      Note, however, that the transformer specified for T1 does not have
      a filament winding for the rectifier. A filament loop may be added
      simply by placing one turn of No. 20 insulated high-voltage wire
      around T1's ceramic base, being careful to maintain spacing from
      the tuned r-f circuit. (Follow the instructions packaged with the
      transformer.) A VTVM or similar high-impedance meter my be used to
      measure output voltages without excessive loading. After wiring is
      complete, remove rectifier tube V2 and adjust the oscillator for
      maximum output power by tuning capacitor C5 with an insulated
      alignment tool. Place a "gimmick" or single-turn coupling loop
      with a neon lamp on the output of T1 as shown in Fig. 5 and tune
      the circuit until the lamp attains maximum brilliance. Remove the
      neon lamp and gimmick after tuning is complete. In operation, it
      is proper for the filament of the 1B3-GT to glow a dull red.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 5.</b> An r-f type of power supply can be used instead of
      the power line version. It also delivers 5000 volts.<br>

      <b>Safety Precautions. </b>Due to the inherent shook hazards
      involved in either of the systems described here, they should be
      operated behind a simple wooden barrier marked to keep away
      "unauthorized personnel." The experiment may then be operated near
      a window or other well-lit area indoors. The equipment may also be
      operated outdoors, preferably in a fenced-in private garden,
      provided it is protected from rain and moisture and the proper
      precautionary measures are employed. With component values shown,
      an "antenna" height of three feet is suggested — depending on
      local wind conditions and ambient aerobic moisture content.<br>

      When it is necessary to work on a plant or water it, turn off the
      power and connect safety shunt R2 across the high-voltage
      terminals. When watering, avoid wetting the electronic equipment
      and the high-voltage discharge element. When you are through
      working on the plant, remove the safety shunt, get out of the way,
      and turn the power back on.<br>
      <br>
      Always keep safety uppermost. in your mind. Physically protect the
      electro-culture experiment from strangers, children and animals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Can You Expect? </b>According to data advanced by Dr. K.
      Stern and others, a true increase in yield of 45 percent for a
      well-cultivated field can be expected. Yield differences are
      determined by comparing results against non-treated control
      cultures of the same type. Some plants give very low yield unless
      well-watered. Peas ant carrots are in this group. Further,
      electric treatment must be stopped if days are hot and sunny. A
      simple photoelectric relay circuit, connected in series with the
      power line, provides adequate control for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Note that plants are mavericks in many ways and do not necessarily
      show uniform yield patterns. Electronically peaking, being living
      organisms, species utilize the energy contained in the phosphate
      bonds of adenosine tripitosphate (ATP) to drive reactions which
      lead to maintenance and growth of cells, tissues, etc. This ATP is
      produced from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by processes involved in
      aerobic respiration, fermentation, and electromagnetic bionuclear
      constituents of photosynthesis. In many ways, plants are organic
      semiconductors and apparently feature electron transport systems
      which, in higher plant mitochondria, are exactly the same as those
      for animal mitochondria in ways of generating enzyme.<br>
      <br>
      However, taken together, science has only a vague idea why plants
      react applied electro-culture and related methods mentioned
      earlier. The field is wide open for experimentation and
      improvement, and it certainly has exceptional hopes for the
      future.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The effects of direct-electric-current (DC) on secondary plant
      compounds and antioxidant activity in harvested tomato fruits were
      investigated. A new technology was developed to supply DC to the
      tomatoes. Different intensities of DC (100–500 mA) with varied
      application times (15–60 min) were applied during postharvest.
      Almost all DC treatments significantly affected the secondary
      metabolism, resulting in an accumulation of carotenoids, phenolic
      compounds, and antioxidant activity in tomatoes. In the present
      study, optimal DC treatments were found in order to obtain the
      highest content of all investigated secondary plant compounds.
      After an adaptation time (AT) of 2 h, the maximum contents of
      lycopene (122.4%), ß-carotene (140.4%), total phenol (120.0%), and
      antioxidant activity (126.5%) were attained with a DC treatment of
      500 mA for 15 min. The results changed after an adaptation time of
      24 h (AT 24 h), where the highest contents of lycopene (128.7%),
      ß-carotene (129.6%), total phenol (113.6%), and antioxidant
      activity (120.9%) were obtained using the same DC treatment (500
      mA), but with an application time of 30 min. Therefore, the
      application of DC in harvested tomato fruits may be appropriate to
      improve the health-promoting properties of tomatoes.<br>

      Science and Technology, London.<br>
      <br>
      Four years' additional experimental work on the application of a
      high tension discharge to the growth of field crops is described.
      Ten experiments with spring-sown oats and barley, two with
      winter-sown wheat, one with spring-sown wheat, and four with
      clover-hay have now been described.<br>
      <br>
      The discharge was usually given at the rate of 0·5 to 1·0
      milliamp. per acre from thin insulated wires stretched above the
      crop at a height of about 7 ft. and charged to a voltage of 40,000
      to 80,000 (crest value). The discharge was usually given for 6
      hours a day in two periods, 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in
      the afternoon.<br>
      <br>
      If the two experiments with spring-sown oats described in previous
      papers are included and the experiment of 1919 with spring-sown
      wheat (which yielded only 8 bushels to the acre) is excluded a
      series of 18 results is available spread over a period of 6 years.
      Of these 18 field experiments with various crops, 14 gave positive
      results in favour of the electrified plots, while 4 showed
      negative results, i.e. decreased yields compared with the
      controls. Of the 14 positive results only 3 show increases of less
      than 10 per cent, while 9 show increases of 30 per cent, and over,
      some reaching 50 per cent, and over. Of the 4 negative none shows
      a decrease of as much as 10 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      Of the 12 experiments with spring-sown cereals 10 were positive
      and 2 negative. Of the positive results only 2 show increases of
      less than 10 per cent, while 6 show increases of 30 per cent, to
      57 per cent.; on the other hand both the negative results are
      quite small, being 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of electrification in increasing the yield of
      spring-grown oats and barley has thus been demonstrated. The mean
      increase in yield for such crops was 22 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      A beneficial effect of the discharge on clover-hay is probable
      while the effect on winter-sown wheat is still uncertain.<br>
      <br>
      Our knowledge of the proper conditions under which the discharge
      should be given is still so meagre that there is no reason to
      believe that the increased yields here described are the maximum
      obtainable as a result of electrification.<br>
      <br>
      The mode of action of the current in producing increased growth
      and yield is still obscure. In several cases the electrified field
      crops showed a deeper green tint than that of the controls, and
      work already published has shown that in the case of the
      coleoptile (plumule sheath) of barley minute electric currents are
      able to bring about an increase in the rate of growth.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of the discharge is of the nature of a stimulus. The
      additional energy available from the current is too small to have
      any direct effect since it is only about 1/1000th, or less, of the
      energy which the plant obtains from sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      There is no evidence that gaseous products of the discharge play
      any part in the stimulation of growth. The additional supply of
      nitrogen brought to the soil from oxides of nitrogen produced as a
      result of electrification must be exceedingly small.<br>

      The paper is divided into two parts, the first dealing in a
      general manner with the subject of electricity in agriculture, the
      second with electro-culture in particular. In Part 1 the condition
      of the agricultural industry is considered, and it is concluded
      that its present depression is mainly due to two causes: (a) cost
      of labour, and (b) reduced area of arable land and stationary
      yields of crops per acre. It is suggested that an increased
      application of electricity to agriculture supplies that an
      increased application of electricity to agriculture supplies a
      means of correcting the depression, and increased application of
      machinery being required to obtain the maximum output per head of
      labour; whilst electroculture affords a means of increasing crop
      yields per acre of land. The special knowledge and abilities
      required by engineers who undertake to supply electricity to rural
      areas are outlined. Distribution by underground cables in
      preference to overhead lines is discussed, as are also outdoor and
      brick substationa. Probable lines of load-development in rural
      areas are suggested, whilst the applications of electricity on
      farms are briefly dealt with, and tariffs are considered. In Part
      2 electro-culture is classified under: (a) Air-earth currents, (b)
      Earth currents, (c) Seed treatment, and (d Other methods.
      Air-earth current or the discharge method is dealt with in detail
      and empirical rules for its application are given. Some
      experiments with an alternation-current discharge are described.
      It is suggested that the simplicity of this system and the success
      of the experiments justifies further investigation along similar
      lines but on a larger scale. Other systems of electro-culture ar e
      dealt with more briefly, emphasis being placed on the value of a
      successful seed-treatment process. For the elctricity supply
      industry electro-culture will provide excellent propaganda, whilst
      meeting an urgent need in the agricultural industry. An extensive
      bibliography is appended.<br>

          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
          <br>
          [0004] One aspect of the invention relates to an electrical
          system for promoting growth of a plant and/or other organisms.
          The system includes a body, one or more conductive wires, and
          a current source. The body includes two intertwined helically
          wound runners arranged in at least two complete revolutions
          per runner. A first runner is coupled to a second runner by
          struts. The body has a periphery. The body is installed around
          or near a plant. The first wire is carried by the first
          runner. The first wire is conductive. The current source is
          arranged to electrically couple with two leads of the first
          wire causing a first current through the first wire along the
          first runner. The current source is configured to cause the
          first current through the first wire such that an
          electromagnetic field is created in and around the body that
          promotes growth of the plant disposed within or near the
          periphery of the body...<br>
          <br>
          [0018] For alternating currents, operating frequencies ranging
          from 0 Hz to 100 GHz are contemplated. Operating currents
          ranging from 1 pA to 10 A are contemplated. Operating voltages
          ranging from 1 mV to 20 kV are contemplated. In some
          embodiments, a root mean square voltage of about 12 V is
          supplied to wire 86. In a preferred embodiment, the frequency
          of the alternating current supplied to wire 86 is between 0 Hz
          and 20 kHz. In some embodiments, the current is less than
          about 1 pA, 1 nA, 1 mA, 100 mA, 250 mA, 500 mA, and/or other
          amounts of current. ..<br>

          [0005] Briefly described, embodiments of the present
          disclosure include methods for enhancing photosynthetic
          efficiency, among others, including: applying pulsed light to
          a photosynthetic organism; using a chlorophyll fluorescence
          feedback control system to determine one or more
          photosynthetic efficiency parameters, wherein the
          photosynthetic efficiency parameters are used to adjust one or
          more of the following: a pulse rate, pulse on/off duration,
          light intensity, light spectrum, or a combination thereof; and
          adjusting one or more of the photosynthetic efficiency
          parameters to drive the photosynthesis by the delivery of an
          amount of light to optimize light absorption of the
          photosynthetic organism while providing enough dark time
          between light pulses to prevent oversaturation of the
          chlorophyll reaction centers. ..<br>

          0010] FIG. 2 is a graph that illustrates the absorption maxima
          of chlorophyll a are lambda=430 and lambda=662 nm, that of
          chlorophyll b are at 453 and 642 nm. Royal Blue Luxeon K2 LED
          emits in the 440 nm to 460 nm range with a peak emission at
          455 nm, with spectral half-width of 20 nm, very appropriate to
          excite chlorophyll a and nearly an exact match to excite
          chlorophyll b. Red Luxeon K2 LED emits in the 620.5 nm to 645
          nm, with peak emission at 627 nm and spectral half-width of 20
          nm, appropriate to excite chlorophyll b. Therefore, it is NOT
          obvious, based solely on Chlorophyll a and b spectra, that
          green light would enhance algae growth and metabolism...<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          0038] In high density algal cultures, high agitation and
          turnover rates can be used to provide more cells a better
          opportunity to absorb light energy for photosynthesis. As the
          density of algae, or concentration of chlorophyll in a given
          area increases, the color of actinic light can be adjusted
          from blue (440-490 nm), which is strongly absorbed, to cyan
          (505 nm) or green (530 nm), which is more weakly absorbed but
          has higher internal reflection allowing the light energy to
          penetrate deeper into the culture or canopy. This can allow an
          overall increase in photosynthesis in the given area. As
          photosynthetic organisms age, the distribution of pigments may
          change, which can alter the optimal absorption spectra for a
          given organism. Measuring the changes in pigment density and
          optimal color absorption in real-time, allows for an automated
          optimization (e.g., adjust wavelength, pulse rate, light
          intensity, and the like) of light absorption by a given
          photosynthetic organisms culture or canopy... <br>
          <br>
          0053] It has long been known that the “Flashing Light Effect”
          in Photosynthesis can enhance the light utilization efficiency
          leading to better productivity (Kok, 1953; Phillips and Myers,
          1954). The goal is to apply a photon flux density that is just
          enough to excite the majority of the light harvesting
          complexes to attain the maximum rate of growth, while
          simultaneously minimizing trapped surplus light, which renders
          losses in the form of heat and fluorescence. The excess
          absorbed light energy can cause damage to the photosynthetic
          apparatus from the reactive free oxygen radicals generated,
          known as photoinhibition. Thus, by using intermittent light,
          the number of excitations arriving at a closed reaction center
          decreases when flashes are shortened, permitting more
          efficient usage of light and less photodamage repair (Matthijs
          et al., 1995). The major potential boosts in bioproductivity
          stems from improving flux tolerance rather than from
          augmenting intrinsic photosynthesis efficiency. The ultimate
          rate limiting process for improving photonic flux tolerance
          and thus bioproductivity is the time scale for the dark
          reactions in algal photosynthesis. The matching of time
          pattern, spectrum and instantaneous intensity of pulsed LED
          photonic input to the dark reaction kinetics is the key to
          realizing superior flux tolerance (Gordon and Polle, 2007)…<br>
          <br>
          1. It was found that pulsed LED's can dramatically affect the
          Chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics leading to decreased NPQ,
          and enhanced photosynthetic yield and photochemistry.<br>
          2. Many of the modulated treatments exhibited similar
          decreases in excess energy dissipation and increases in
          photosynthetic capacity probably due to the similarities in
          the provided dark periods. These dark periods allow the dark
          reactions of photosynthesis time to process and the reaction
          centers time to re-oxidize to a fully open state offering
          maximal capacity for exciton capture and electron transfer
          efficiency.<br>
          3. The PAM's ability to detect small changes in the way energy
          is transferred through photosystem II demonstrates how this
          sensitive technique could be used to optimize artificial
          illumination for cultivation of plants or algae.<br>
          4. This study found that the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)
          is optimally minimized by a dark period duration no less than
          300 μs, then gradually increase above 1 ms.<br>
          5. An increase in the effective photosynthetic efficiency
          (Yield) of approximately &gt;400% and an additional increase
          in photochemical quenching (qP) ranging from ̃200-500% was
          exhibited by all samples treated with pulsed light than the
          control using continuous illumination.<br>
          6. These results not only confirm the highly beneficial nature
          of the flashing light effect in terms of chlorophyll reaction
          kinetics, but also open exciting new applications for
          optimizing photosynthesis in real-time with a PAM fluorometric
          monitoring system..<br>

          [0031] FIG. 1 is a plan view of an exemplary embodiment of a
          seed priming and treatment system of the present invention
          100. Depicted in FIG. 1 is a first electrode 101 and a second
          electrode 103. The first electrode 101 is electrically
          connected to ground (for example, but not limited to the
          ground reference of the high voltage supply 105), and the
          second electrode 103 is electrically connected to the high
          voltage supply 105. In some embodiments of the present
          invention, the second electrode 103 is connected to a negative
          high voltage supply, and in other embodiments of the present
          invention the second electrode 103 is connected to a positive
          high voltage supply. In some embodiments of the present
          invention, the second electrode 103 is connected to a negative
          high voltage supply, and in other embodiments of the present
          invention the second electrode 103 is connected to a positive
          high voltage supply. The order and naming of the first and
          second electrodes is arbitrary, where the second electrode 103
          may be the ground connection. The high voltage supply 105 may
          be a simple buck-boost circuit to provide high voltage, or it
          may be a commercial high voltage power supply such as the high
          voltage supplies manufactured by Emco High Voltage, Inc. In
          one embodiment of the present invention, the voltage provided
          by the high voltage power supply 105 may be in the range of
          3,000-7,000 volts D.C., however, other high voltage values may
          also be suitable. In some embodiments of the present
          invention, the high voltage power supply 105 may provide
          pulsed D.C. or A.C., or high voltage with a frequency
          component, or various high voltage waveforms and frequencies
          with various associated current components. In some
          embodiments of the present invention, the high voltage
          provided to the electrodes is electrostatic, where there is
          low current but high voltage and there is no arcing or related
          breakdowns such as corona discharge. In other embodiments of
          the present invention, arcing or corona discharge may be
          applied either for the duration of the treatment of the seeds
          107, or for a portion of the electrostatic treatment time with
          the remainder of the electrostatic treatment time being
          electrostatic. As seen in FIG. 1, the seeds 107 are resting on
          the first electrode 101.<br>
          <br>
          ...Green Bean seeds (Earliserve Bush from Livingston Seed
          Company) were hydro-primed for 24 hours before undergoing
          electrostatic treatment, 16 hydro-primed green bean seeds were
          exposed to 7,000 volts for 7 minutes with an electrode spacing
          of 3.5 cm., and then placed on a wet cloth in a Petri dish,
          where the water in the Petri dish contained 10-15-10
          fertilizer. As a control, 16 hydro-primed green bean seeds
          from the same lot (no electrostatic treatment) were also
          simultaneously placed on a wet cloth in a Petri dish where the
          water in the Petri dish contained 10-15-10 fertilizer. Growing
          conditions for both sets was the same. In two days, in the
          group of electrostatically treated seeds, all seeds had
          sprouted and there were 6 of the total of 16 seeds that
          possessed a reticle greater than 0.3 inches long. By contrast,
          the control set (no electrostatic field exposure) had only 2
          of the 16 total seeds with reticles greater than 0.3 inches
          long. After five days, all of the green bean seeds were
          sprouted. Generally, by visual Inspection, the green bean
          seeds that were electrostatically treated after hydro-priming
          had slightly thinner reticles than the green bean seeds that
          were not electrostatically treated.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] In another experiment using Mung Bean seeds, 5 grams of
          mung bean seeds were hydro-primed for 29.5 hours, and 5 grams
          of mung bean seeds (control) were also hydro-primed for 29.5
          hours. The mung bean seeds had sprouted by 24 hours in both
          instances. At 29.5 hours, the 5 grams of hydro-primed mung
          bean seeds that, had sprouted were exposed to 7,000 volts for
          7 minutes with an electrode spacing of 3.5 cm. The control of
          5 grams of hydro-primed mung bean seeds was not exposed to any
          high voltage electric field. Both the electrostatically
          treated mung bean seeds and the control group of mung bean
          seeds were maintained in separate Petri dishes on moist tissue
          paper with identical growing conditions next to each other. In
          72 hours, it was observed that the electostatically treated
          mung bean sprouts were more advanced, with longer and
          generally larger sprouts, lire sprouts were allowed to grow
          for one week, and each day it was observed that the
          electrostatically treated sprouts were larger and generally
          more vigorous. Photos were taken to document this observed
          difference.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] In a similar experiment using alfalfa seeds, 0.5 grams
          of alfalfa seeds were hydro-primed for 29.5 hours, and 0.5
          grams of alfalfa seeds (control) were also hydro-primed for
          29.5 hours. The alfalfa seeds sprouted by 24 hours in both
          instances. At 29.5 hours, the 5 grams of hydro-primed alfalfa
          seeds that had sprouted were exposed to 7,000 volts for 7
          minutes with an electrode spacing of 3.5 cm. The control of 5
          grams of hydro-printed alfalfa seeds was not exposed to any
          high voltage electric field. Both the electrostatically
          treated alfalfa seeds and the control group of alfalfa seeds
          were maintained in separate Petri dishes on moist tissue paper
          with identical growing conditions next to each other. In 72
          hours, it was observed, that the electostatically treated
          alfalfa seed sprouts were more advanced, with longer and
          generally larger sprouts. The sprouts were allowed to grow for
          one week, and each day it was observed that the
          electrostatically treated sprouts were larger and generally
          more vigorous...<br>

          [0036] Further experimentation continued, and in January of
          2013 wheat seeds were treated for five and ten minutes at 3
          kilovolts, 6 kilovolts, and 11 kilovolts using the same
          experimental setup as before. The electrode spacing was 3.5
          cm. and a control of 0 kilovolts was also used. Each sample
          set consisted of 200 wheat seeds in a Petri dish with adequate
          water. The seeds were soaked overnight before treatment. Six
          clays later, there was a noticeable height difference in the
          wheat grass sprouts, with 3 kilovolts for 5 minutes resulting
          in approximately 4.5 cm. sprouts, and 6 kilovolts for 10
          minutes resulting in approximately 4.5 cm. sprouts. While the
          control (no voltage) produced sprouts of approximately 3.0 cm.
          and exposure to 11 kilovolts for five and ten minutes resulted
          in approximately 2.5 cm. sprouts. The sprouts exposed to 3
          kilovolts for 5 minutes and 6 kilovolts for 10 minutes also
          had more extensive root systems.<br>

          </b><b>Inventor: Jacques Rene Alphons de Koning</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Abstract: </b>The invention is directed to a method
          for separating two or more seed fractions having different
          germination quality, to a method for preparing a seed fraction
          enriched in seed quality, and to the use of a magnetic field.
          The method for separating two or more seed fractions having
          different germination quality comprises: mixing a feed of
          seeds comprising seeds with at least two densities with a
          magnetic fluid thereby obtaining a mixture, and applying a
          magnetic field to the mixture such that the mixture is exposed
          to a magnetic gradient so as to separate two or more seed
          fractions with different densities.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] The invention is based on the underlying idea that the
          quality of the seeds is correlated to the density of the
          seeds. The method of the invention advantageously requires
          only one separation step of mixing the seeds with the liquid
          and thereby considerably shortens processing speed, but
          nevertheless allows the separation of multiple fractions of
          seeds having different densities. It is surprising that the
          density gradient in the magnetic fluid (brought about by the
          gradient in force of the magnetic field, herein also referred
          to as the magnetic gradient) can be set sufficiently accurate
          and sufficiently small in order to satisfactorily separate the
          seeds with low germination quality from the seeds with high
          germination quality. This accuracy of the claimed method
          allows to separate seeds with different germination quality
          wherein the seeds are from the same kind. Thus one batch of
          the same seeds, but with different germination quality can be
          separated. To be able to separate seeds with lower germination
          quality from seeds with better germination quality has
          enormous commercial impact...<br>
          <br>
          ..Preferably, the magnetic fluid comprises iron oxide
          particles. The magnetic particles can suitably have an average
          particle diameter in the range of 1 nm to 1 mm, preferably 10
          nm-100 μm.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The magnetic fluid can suitably have a concentration of
          magnetic particles in the range of 0.001%-99%, preferably
          0.1%-50%. The concentration used may depend of the density
          required. Vegetable seed such as tomato seed can be separated
          in a density brought about by a concentration of between
          1%-5%. Preferably the magnetic particles are coated so that
          they do not stick together under the influence of a magnetic
          field. Such coated particles are commercially available. The
          magnetic fluid can further comprise one or more additives.
          Suitable fluids include commercially available ferrofluids
          such as for instance available from Ferrotec GmbH,
          Unterensingen, Germany...<br>
          <br>
          [0035] The general principle of separation based on density in
          a magnetic medium is known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,765. This
          principle can be used in aspects of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] Suitable magnets for use in aspects of the present
          invention that are capable of generating a density gradient in
          a magnetic fluid are for instance disclosed in EP 1878505 and
          EP 1800753. The magnet may for instance be a magnet is a
          dipole magnet, more preferably a cylindrical dipole magnet. A
          suitable strength is for instance a magnetic field strength of
          about 0.001-1, more preferably 0.10-0.15 Tesla at the location
          of the magnetic fluid. The magnetic field may also be a
          rotating magnetic field as described in WO 0040336...<br>

          elevated voltage, such that a potential difference is
          maintained between the primary and secondary coils. The
          primary and secondary coils are preferably concentric, but can
          alternatively be coaxial, offset, or arranged in any other
          suitable configuration. The primary and secondary coils are
          preferably electrically connected together in parallel, but
          can alternatively be electrically connected in series.
          However, the Tesla coil 240 can include any suitable number of
          coils electrically connected in parallel, in series, or a
          combination thereof. The Tesla coil 240 can additionally
          include a conducting wire electrically connected to the
          primary and/or secondary coil that functions to direct the
          electrical discharge. The conducting wire is preferably
          flexible, such that a linear segment of the plant (e.g.,
          selected for electric discharge application) is capable of
          contacting a linear segment of the conducting wire, but can
          alternatively be substantially rigid, such that a segment of
          the plant contacts a point of, a small segment of, or does not
          contact the conducting wire, or such that the conducting wire
          is capable of mechanically penetrating a portion of the stem
          or branch. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 12, the electric
          discharge mechanism 230 can include a first electrode 243 and
          second electrode 244 biased at different electrical
          potentials, or include any other suitable electric discharge
          mechanism...<br>

          growth, germination and yields are significantly increased in
          an environmentally friendly manner. Resistance to diseases is
          increased...<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The inventive method consists in the treatment of
          plants using electromagnetic fields and is characterized in
          that a pulse generator applies pulse sequences to growing
          plants or the seeds thereof in a pulsed electromagnetic field,
          wherein the individual pulses have a frequency ranging from 1
          to 100 Hz and the amplitude of each individual pulse
          corresponds to an exponential function or the pulses have
          envelope curves rising and falling in the form of an arc,
          wherein the individual pulses are emitted in synchronous or
          asynchronous groups of pulses having different magnetic flux
          densities, and wherein a first pulse group has a pulse time of
          0.1 to 0.3 seconds with a magnetic flux density of 35 to 100
          μT and a second pulse group has a pulse time of 10 to 30
          seconds with a magnetic flux density of 2 to 40 μT, and
          wherein the plants are exposed to the pulsating
          electromagnetic field once to 30 times a day for 1 to 120
          minutes each time or continuously for several days.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] The magnetic flux density is advantageously 3 to 99 μT
          altogether, preferably 3 to 55 μT, and particularly 10 to 60
          μT.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] The frequency range is preferably 8 to 60 Hz and
          particularly 8 to 40 Hz...<br>
          <br>
          [0028] In contrast to a large-surface mat applicator (about 70
          cm×170 cm), an intensive applicator has a supporting surface
          of only about 20 to 250 cm&lt;2 &gt;and can therefore have a
          magnetic flux density that is 2.5 to 3 times as high. A
          so-called coil cushion of 20-30 cm×30-50 cm can generate this

          </b><b>Abstract: </b>The present invention relates to a
          method for controlling pathogen growth on live plants and
          mushrooms using UV-C light and an apparatus for use in the
          method. Also provided are methods for removing surplus leaves
          and methods for destroying aerial plant parts prior to harvest
          of underground roots, tubers or bulbs.<br>
          <br>
          ...The amount of UV-C light is between 0.002 (or 0.0025) and
          0.16 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;during a period of 24 hours, more
          preferably between 0.002 (or 0.0025) and 0.15 J/cm&lt;2&gt;,
          especially equal to or below 0.16 or 0.15 J/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] It has been found that a fluence in this range in a
          tissue of a plant is suitable to control the pathogens and
          that surprisingly only very low UV-C dosages are required to
          achieve and effective control. The optimal value of fluence
          depends on the plant species, the growth stage, type of
          pathogen and growth stage of the pathogen.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] The present finding allows for the first time the
          effective control of pathogens on live, actively growing
          and/or photosynthesizing plant and/or mushroom tissues.
          Dosages of 0.16 or 0.15 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;of tissue surface (i.e.
          160 or 150 mJ/cm&lt;2&gt;) or even significantly lower dosages
          may be used according to the invention. For example,
          Phytophthora infestans damage can be reduced significantly
          using as little as 0.002-0.01 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;tissue (2-10
          mJ/cm&lt;2&gt;) applied over a period of 24 hours, with an
          optimal dosage being about 0.01 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;(10
          mJ/cm&lt;2&gt;)...<br>
          <br>
          [0049] In particular, it has been found that amounts of UV-C
          light between 0.002 (or 0.0025) and 0.16 or 0.15 J/cm&lt;2
          &gt;during a period of 24 hours enables not to induce any, or
          at least not to induce plant tissue damage which has a
          negative effect on growth and yield of the plants, while still
          having an anti-pathogenic effect, i.e. controlling pathogen
          growth. Thus, especially, the normal growth and yield of the
          plurality of plants are not affected negatively, while
          pathogen growth is controlled...<br>
          <br>
          ...The dosage may need to be lower for younger tissue than for
          older tissue, but the skilled person can easily determine the
          appropriate dosage and frequency of application. Also tissue
          type may influence the optimal dosage. A stem may for example
          tolerate a higher dosage than a young leaf. Routine
          experimentation can be used to determine the optimal dosage or
          minimum/maximum dosage range. The dosage may thus be at least
          about 0.002, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, 0.01,
          0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.16
          J/cm&lt;2 &gt;or more, but less than about 0.17, 0.2 or 0.25
          J/cm&lt;2 &gt;during a period of 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] Preferred ranges of UV-C light include therefore
          0.002-0.15 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;or 0.16; 0.0025-0.15 or 0.16
          J/cm&lt;2&gt;; 0.002-0.006 J/cm&lt;2&gt;; 0.002-0.01
          J/cm&lt;2&gt;; 0.0025-0.006 J/cm&lt;2&gt;; 0.0025-0.01
          J/cm&lt;2&gt;. Such specific dosage ranges which apply a low
          dosage of a narrow wavelength (UV-C light of 240-260 nm or the
          end-points or any specific value in between this wavelength
          such as 254 nm, i.e. essentially without wavelengths below 240
          and above 260 nm and without ozonized water or ozone
          production) per cm&lt;2 &gt;to one or more pre-selected parts
          of the plants are particularly advantageous because they are
          particularly effective and do neither harm the plants nor harm
          the environment around the plants, such as humans or animals.
          In addition energy is saved and the possibility to fully
          automate the application reduces labor costs.<br>

          0073] The method is particularly effective when carried out
          with a UV-C lamp having an intensity of between 2 and 100
          Watts that periodically travels through the crop, with an
          effective exposure period of between one second and one
          minute, and a proximity to the pathogen growth of between 2 cm

          </b><b>Abstract: </b>Process and device for treating seeds in
          order to combat harmful organisms. According to the invention,
          in an initial stage of the process, the seeds are separated
          and distributed evenly in a free-fall process, subjected in a
          vacuum to irradiation by low energy electron beams and then
          immediately treated with fungicides and/or microbial
          antagonists or metabolic products and spores thereof and/or
          synergists.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly enough it has been found that when the seed
          treatment to combat harmful organisms is carried out in two
          steps immediately following each other, namely the irradiation
          of the seeds with low energy electrons on all sides thereof in
          a first step and the immediately following treatment of the
          seeds irradiated in this way with an application of active
          chemical substances and/or biological material in a second
          step, this has a synergistic effect and produces an
          unexpectedly good result when seed- and/or soil-borne harmful
          organisms are combated. This surprisingly good effect of the
          process according to the present invention is explained by the
          fact that the low energy electron beams first help to combat
          the fungal harmful organisms on the surface and in the near
          surface region of the seeds or seed corns. Harmful organisms
          that have not been killed are sensitized in said regions and
          can more effectively be combated due to this sensitization
          immediately after electron dressing with active chemical
          substances and/or with biological material (especially
          microbial antagonists). When active chemical substances are
          used, it is possible to achieve a higher combating rate even
          if the amounts used are smaller. Since the sensitivity
          accomplished through electron dressing will not last forever,
          the procedure of treating the seeds in accordance with the
          invention in a continuous treatment process divided into
          immediately subsequent steps produces especially good results
          when harmful organisms are combated. Moreover, an improved
          deposition of the chemical and/or biological application and
          an improved depth action for chemical agents or microbial
          antagonists are achieved through the inventive process. The
          penetration depth can additionally be controlled through the
          selection of the pressure stage for the application of the
          active chemical substances and/or the biological material.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the seeds
          are separated in a first step and moved through an irradiation
          chamber in a free-fall process and in vacuum, i.e.
          substantially evenly distributed in spaced-apart relationship,
          and are subjected, immediately thereafter in a second step, to
          an application with fungicides or the active substances and/or
          microbial antagonists thereof or the metabolic products and
          spores thereof and/or microorganisms (synergists) conducive to
          plant growth, possibly in conjunction with nutrients.<br>
          <br>
          The seeds are preferably irradiated in the first step in a
          free-fall process in the irradiation region with
          quasi-monoenergetic electron beams on all sides, electrons of
          substantially reduced energy (scatter electrons) and plasma
          particles which act on the surface of the seed and a near
          surface layer outside the embryo.<br>

          of up to several feet that uses specially-shaped electrically
          conductive metal shanks that are pulled through the soil

          U.S. Pat. No. 2,429,412 describes a system for applying
          electrical treatment to the soil in order to destroy
          pestiferous organic matter, as well as sterilize and cultivate
          the soil. This patent describes an apparatus that includes a
          generator and transformer connected to a box-like structure
          containing electrically conductive plates that penetrate the
          soil as the structure is pulled through a field. However, this
          device has no separate or leading soil ripper so that the
          horizontally oriented electrical plates located at the bottom
          of the box structure must themselves tear open the soil. The
          box-like structure containing the electrical conductors is
          small and provides very shallow soil treatment, and the top of
          the box structure must be kept in contact with the soil
          surface to provide proper conductivity which is difficult to
          maintain.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 2,588,561 applies electricity to the soil
          through a series of cultivation discs having conductive rings
          which are alternately charged in sequence. However, the discs
          do not provide deep soil treatment since less than half of
          their diameter penetrates the soil, and the conductive rings
          do not provide broad or complete electrical coverage
          especially since they only come into contact with loosened
          soil. Moreover, the conductive rings must constantly be
          replaced since they are part of the soil cultivation
          structure, and because they tend to deteriorate after
          prolonged contact with the soil. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,758,318 and
          6,237,278 suffer from similar drawbacks in that the conductive
          discs of these inventions are shallow and must themselves
          break the soil, leading to incomplete electrical coverage

          itself. In addition, it may be used to increase propagation
          from tissue culture, while at the same time decreasing the use
          of nutrients...<br>

          </b><b>Abstract:</b> A device for the manipulation of a
          biological material by a magnetic field is presented. The
          device comprises a magnetic field source coupled to a current
          source. The current source is of a kind supplying an electric
          current of at least two electrical degree shifted phases. The
          magnetic field source comprises a two-part inductor, each
          inductor part producing a coordinate varying magnetic field
          (CVMF). Each inductor part is formed by at least two
          conductors aligned in a spaced-apart relationship, wherein
          each of the at least two conductors is connectable to a
          different phase of the current source, and has two
          spaced-apart parts arranged such that when the conductor is
          connected to the current source, the electric current flows in
          its two parts in opposite directions, respectively. The
          conductors of each inductor part are arranged such that each
          two locally adjacent conductor parts are associated with two
          different phases of the electric current source.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract: </b>Weed seeds are controlled by high
          voltage pulses with short duration which electropermeabilize
          the cell membranes of weed seeds in the ground. The device is
          selective and damages only germinating weed seeds and plants
          early in their life cycle. The required amount of energy is
          small; with rectangular pulses the optimal field strength is
          between 100-300 kV/m with a duration of (10-100 microseconds).
          A transformer placed on a sowing machine transforms electrical
          energy to high voltage pulses. The energy may be taken from
          the pulling tractor via a transmission or from an integrated
          power source. The high voltage pulses are applied to
          electrically conducting via applicators to two or more fixedly
          spaced plates to the soil around newly sown seeds.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract:</b> A high frequency power source (4) and (5)
          supplies electromagnetic waves (10-100 MHz) that are supplied
          to a single or a pair of plates (10) that surround a trunk of
          the infested tree. The electromagnetic waves are used to kill
          red palm weevils and trees stem borers within the trunk of the
          tree. The plates are cylindrical, half cylindrical or flat,
          with insulated metal sheets that surround the trunk and upper
          roots of the infected tree.<br>

          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          It is well known since a very long time that high frequency
          electromagnetic waves, when directed on various subjects yield
          a variable amount of thermal energy directly determined by the
          substances of these subjects and the frequency of the magnetic
          waves. Some substances are highly affected by the waves. They
          heat up more and faster than others. Substances not vulnerable
          to those waves pass them through. This is the basic principle
          on which the molecular electromagnet resonance device is
          based. Exposing pests within palm trees stem to high
          frequency, high energy and highly selective electromagnetic
          waves (from 10 to 100 MHz frequency / 5-15 kW is backward
          proportional with selectivity, increasing frequency decreases
          selectivity and substances become with almost equal
          capabilities of absorbing energy) will lead to selective fast
          increase in pests temperature, without affecting the stem.
          Increasing pests temperature to around 60 degrees for duration
          of minutes results in their death. Luckily, palm trees stem
          bears higher temperatures, and it is well known that dates
          require high temperatures to ripen. In addition, frequency
          selectivity palm trees stem substances and precaution
          procedures such as stopping irrigation for some days will
          enable us to expose stems to electromagnetic waves for longer
          time without worrying about the tree...<br>
