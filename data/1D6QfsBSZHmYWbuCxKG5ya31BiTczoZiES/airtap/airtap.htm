            <p><i>AirGenerate</i> is the manufacturer and distributor of
              the most energy-efficient water heating system that can
              retro-fit onto any existing water heater. The company’s
              first product, AirTap, converts “air energy” to heat and
              plugs directly into any 30-80 gallon water tank.&nbsp;
              This technology results in 250% improved efficiency and
              60%-80% energy savings. In addition to these benefits,
              AirTap releases cool air which can be ducted using AirVent
              (our duct kit) into a household or outside and also acts
              as a dehumidifier. </p>
            <p>Our customers include home owners, home builders,
              business operators, utility companies and government
              agencies. We currently sell our products directly on our
              website and through our distribution network consisting of
              plumbing, HVAC, and eco-product wholesalers and retailers.
              We also leverage our partners that include electric
              cooperatives and green builders. </p>
            <p>The Department of Energy (DOE) considers heat pump water
              heaters to be the most functional and cost effective water
              heaters.&nbsp; AirGenerate has solved technical and
              manufacturing hurdles related to supplying low-cost,
              efficient, and quality heat pumps making AirTap the most
              competitive water heater. </p>
            <p>Our key differentiators are: </p>
            <p>* Technology: Our patent-pending technology does not
              require water pumps or electronics making it nearly
              maintenance-free. </p>
            <p>* Cost: Smart design and efficient sourcing makes our
              units very affordable (&lt;$500). </p>
            <p>* Installation: There is no need for plumbers anymore.
              End users can install our units on their own within 1-2
              hours. In addition, it has provision for ducting its free
              cold air for space cooling in hot seasons and venting out
              in winter. </p>
            <p>* Ease of Use: AirTap connects to any existing electric,
              gas, or propane water heaters using regular 110V electric
              outlet and uses 6 amps to operate. </p>
            <p>* ROI: AirTap’s one year payback and 5-year limited
              warranty ensures that the hot water system operates for at
              least 5 years and gets a high ROI along with energy
              savings. </p>
            <p>* Support: We have a training program for plumbers and
              offer a dedicated support personnel in case they need
              assistance in the field. We also provide team leads for
              bigger projects with utilities and co-ops. </p>
            <p>* Multiple Industry Certifications: NTS, GAMA, CSA.
              According to GAMA, we are the most energy-efficient water
              heater in the country. </p>
            <p>On average, Americans spend 14%-25% of their energy
              consumption on heating water. Consumers purchase about 10
              million water heaters and spend over $10 billion each
              year. With the energy prices increasing rapidly, the
              “green” market in the United States, currently at $228
              billion, expects an annual growth of over 50%. The global
              market and opportunity is exponentially larger. </p>
            <p>We raised our first round of funding from family and
              friends. We just started shipping our products and expect
              to support our existing operations through cash flow. </p>
            <p>Our co-founder and CEO, Rick Pal, is an award-winning
              serial entrepreneur and investor. Our management team has
              over 20 years of combined experience in the field of
              energy-efficiency, software, and retail. We plan to use
              the award money to fund research on new products and add
              personnel to our operations and sales team.</p>

            <p align="left"><i>Connected to water heater, AirTap
                maximizes efficiency</i> </p>
            <p align="left">HOUSTON – A lot of businesses are talking
              “green” nowadays and looking for ways to capitalize on the
              growth industry of energy-efficiency products. Rick Pal
              and Sunil Sinha have their entry into the ring with
              AirGenerate Inc., but they are also going one more with
              their overall goal of making an energy-saving product that
              everyone can afford. </p>
            <p align="left">The Houston-based AirGenerate has developed
              a product, called AirTap, which dramatically improves the
              efficiency of standard hot water heaters. AirTap is a
              metal, square-shaped device that can be attached to the
              top of any 30-80 gallon water tank and then used to heat
              water, not with gas or electricity, but through the air
              surrounding it. AirTap does this by acting as a
              conventional heat pump, using a compressor (powered by a
              low-wattage electric current) to extract heat from the
              surrounding air, and then sending this heat through long
              copper tubes into an adaptor where it is dispersed into
              the water tank. This heats the water to the same degree as
              would a gas burner or electric heating component. </p>
            <p align="left">According to the company, AirTap results in
              300 percent improved efficiency and up to 80 percent
              energy savings and it has been certified by GAMA under
              Department of Energy guidelines as the most energy
              efficient water heater in the United States. AirTap uses
              about one-fourth of the standard amount of energy to heat
              water, by drawing three-fourths of the energy from the
              surrounding air. It can reduce energy consumption by
              approximately two-and-a-half times that of a standard
              water heater or tankless water heater unit. </p>
            <p align="left">To put it in perspective, the company offers
              the example that AirTap uses less power than an 8-cup
              coffee machine to run the compressor, and its energy
              consumption level is equivalent to keeping two coffee
              machines on for a day. </p>
            <p align="left">When faced with the numbers AirTap seems
              like a no-brainer and an easy sell. And, as Pal and Sinha
              admit, it is. The problem is exposure. <br>
              &nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">“The technology is extremely cool and highly
              applicable. The challenge is getting to the consumer,”
              said Pal, AirGenerate’s chief executive officer. “The
              challenge is not selling it. The challenge is getting to
              the masses.” </p>
            <p align="left">Officially launched in January 2008,
              AirGenerate took to trade shows after “green consumers,”
              as Pal calls them and also began selling online. Another
              strategy was to work with product resellers in the water
              and heating industry and to work with plumbers to show
              them how to install AirTap. </p>
            <p align="left">“It is a new product from a new company and
              it needed a non-traditional way of selling it as well,”
              Pal said. </p>
            <p align="left">Currently, there are more than 700 AirTap
              units installed in 40 states, according to AirGenerate.
              The company has six employees in Houston and works with
              about 20 contractors. </p>
            <p align="left">Recently, it scored some big exposure when
              it successfully conducted a heat pump water heater pilot
              program with Southern Company. </p>
            <p align="left">With nearly 4.4 million customers and more
              than 42,000 megawatts of generating capacity,
              Atlanta-based Southern Company is the premier energy
              company serving the Southeast. It operates four retail
              companies -- Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and
              Mississippi Power, serving 120,000 square miles in four
              states. </p>
            <p align="left">After a successful round of testing in their
              labs, Southern Company invited AirGenerate to install
              their energy-efficient water heaters in several of their
              customers’ homes. The pilot was conducted over a 2-week
              period in October and included customers from Alabama,
              Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. Correct Plumbing of
              Houston supervised the installations and worked closely
              with several local contractors invited by Southern Company
              to watch and learn from the pilot, according to
              AirGenerate. </p>
            <p align="left">Pal said that such pilot programs are
              crucial to AirGenerate’s success because it generates
              believers in the efficiency of AirTap and provides a
              growing base of users. The next key strategy is to set up
              a distribution network for AirTap in wholesale plumbing
              supply stores and at “big-box” chains, such as Home Depot.
            </p>
            <p align="left">“Now we are getting validation and that
              makes reps start to believe that there is a demand for
              this,” Pal said. “We have proven there is a market for
              it.” </p>
            <p align="left">Pal and Sinha also believe AirGenerate could
              get a boost from a federal tax rebate for using energy
              efficient products. AirTap qualifies for this rebate and
              its price tag of $499 can be drastically cut into when
              consumers get $300 back from the government for using it.
            </p>
            <p align="left">This kind of cost savings, as well as the
              energy cost savings consumers can register using AirTap is
              exactly what drove Sinha to develop such a product. </p>
            <p align="left">He has over 25 years of engineering and
              management in the renewable energy, energy conservation
              and software development. He has paired academic degrees
              in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology,
              Kharagpur, and the University of Hawaii with extensive
              research in refrigeration technology, solar thermal
              electricity generation, biomass chemical conversion to
              useful fuels, methanol fuel cells and integrated renewable
              energy systems. </p>
            <p align="left">He has worked with organizations such as the
              Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, the Gujarat Energy
              Development Agency and the Indian Institute of Management
              on energy projects looking for alternative energy
              products. He also previously developed a self-sustaining
              model of energy consumption for a village in India using
              local energy resources. </p>
            <p align="left">In 2002, he founded Sunlit, a solar
              photovoltaic company based out of the San Francisco Bay
              Area in California. In 2005, he started a company called
              Beyond Pollution, which was the genesis for AirGenerate. </p>
            <p align="left">Sinha can lay claim to being the inventor of
              AirTap and he says it directly relates to following his
              dream of creating commercially-viable, energy-efficient
              products. </p>
            <p align="left">“My desire was coming up with something that
              everybody can afford – so that everybody can save energy
              and save money,” he said. </p>
            <p align="left">According to Sinha, the need for these types
              of products really struck him when a friend asked him to
              come up with a solar energy system for his small business.
              Sinha said he came up with a system, but it costs
              $100,000, which struck him as too expensive and
              impractical. Even though the system would work the price
              tag made it essentially a failure, in his opinion. </p>
            <p align="left">“I asked myself, ‘How can I give a solution
              to a close friend that is not really appropriate from a
              financial point of view?’” he said. </p>
            <p align="left">Taking this experience into the invention of
              AirTap, Sinha said it was all about cost and making sure
              consumers could get their money back in a year or so. “The
              feeling was green is coming … but unless it is a solution
              that is very affordable and people can have it, and afford
              it, it is not going to be popular,” he added. </p>
            <p align="left">Pal’s and Sinha’s paths crossed while each
              was working in the Bay Area. Sinha revealed his AirTap
              concept to Pal in the fall of 2007, looking for possible
              investment, and Pal liked the technology so much, he
              convinced Sinha to move to Houston, where Pal resides, to
              start AirGenerate only a few months later. </p>
            <p align="left">Prior to AirGenerate, Pal was the president
              of marketingO, a promotional products company. He also
              owned master franchisee rights for Liberty Tax Service in
              the Greater Houston Area which he expanded to over 44
              offices and 22,000 customers. </p>
            <p align="left">A graduate of the University of Texas at
              Austin with a business degree, Pal also held several
              product management positions at Commerce One, Webify
              Solutions, Navis and Iconixx. </p>
            <p align="left">He was also a co-founder of iBlitz.com that
              was incubated by Garage Ventures and IBM in 2000. </p>
            <p align="left">Pal first met Sinha while working at
              Commerce One. </p>
            <p align="left">Both Pal and Sinha are convinced the time is
              now for AirGenerate, in the midst of what they both view
              as a green revolution. </p>
            <p align="left">“There is a lot of interest in this
              technology right now and everybody is thinking about
              energy savings,” Pal said. </p>
            <p align="left">“It is almost the perfect storm,” Sinha
              added. “It is kind of like being at the right place at the
              right time.” </p>

              <b>Abstract</b>&nbsp; --&nbsp; A heat pump liquid heater
              for heating a liquid comprising: a heat pump; a liquid
              tank in heat communication with the heat pump, wherein the
              liquid tank comprises the liquid; and at least one metal
              condenser tube immersed into the liquid, wherein the metal
              condenser tube forms at least one coil. The metal
              condenser tube has a flattened double-tube configuration
              and a cross-section defined by concentric ovals such that
              at least a portion of the concentric ovals is in contact
              with one another thereby minimizing space between the
              flattened double-tubes. The heat pump comprises a
              tube-in-tube heat exchanger and a compressor, wherein the
              tube-in-tube heat exchanger recovers heat from refrigerant
              returning from the liquid tank and transfers the recovered
              heat to refrigerant going to the compressor thereby
              superheating the refrigerant. </p>

            <p align="left">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
            <p align="left">[0001]The present invention is related to
              heat pump liquid heating systems and methods of heating a
              liquid. </p>
            <p align="left">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
            <p align="left">[0002] A Heat Pump Liquid Heater ("HPLH")
              uses a refrigeration system to extract heat from the
              surrounding environment to heat a liquid. An HPLH system
              typically consumes less than half the energy relative to a
              conventional, electric-resistance or gas burner liquid
              heater. An HPLH system is based on a reverse refrigeration
              cycle with the HPLH system using an electrical compressor
              to compress the refrigerant to a liquid state which is at
              a high pressure and temperature. The refrigerant at high
              temperature and pressure transfers heat to a liquid and
              then goes though an expansion process where the
              temperature and pressure of the refrigerant are reduced to
              form a low temperature refrigerant. The low temperature
              refrigerant passes through an evaporator absorbing heat
              from the surrounding air and converts into a gaseous
              state. The gaseous refrigerant is re-compressed in the
              compressor and the aforementioned process continues. The
              liquid is heated by both the heat transferred from the
              ambient air and the electricity used to operate the
              compressor making HPLH more than 100% efficient. </p>
            <p align="left">[0003] There are basic two types of HPLH
              systems described in the references: (i) integrated with a
              liquid tank, and (ii) a standalone without a liquid tank.
              In both types of systems, the condenser coil is either
              immersed into the liquid in the tank where a pump is not
              required or the liquid is pumped from the tank to the heat
              pump condenser coil. HPLH systems are attached with backup
              heating system like electrical elements or gas heaters if
              the HPLH system fails, has reduced performance levels, or
              if the demand for hot liquid surpasses the capacity of the
              HPLH system. </p>
            <p align="left">[0004] An HPLH system with a liquid pump
              adds to costs, complexity, and maintenance. It also
              reduces efficiency because pumps need additional
              electrical energy to run. An integrated HPLH system with a
              tank is limited to serve only new constructions or to
              replace old water heater tanks. There are a few references
              of standalone HPLH systems without using liquid pumps
              (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,946,927 and
              6,233,958). U.S. Pat. No. 5,946,927 discloses a condenser
              coil rapped around the water tank on the outside for heat
              transfer to the liquid inside the tank. Such a system has
              a high cost of manufacturing and reduces the efficiency of
              heat transfer from the condenser coil to the liquid
              because the condenser coil is not in direct contact with
              the liquid. </p>
            <p align="left">[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,958 describes a
              standalone heat pump water heater for residential use with
              a condenser assembly having a tube-in-tube cylinder
              configuration such that an outer cylinder carries a
              superheated refrigerant and an inner cylinder returns the
              refrigerant to an expansion process. The condenser
              assembly is inserted into the water tank though an
              existing opening in the top of the tank. As the
              refrigerant condenses along the interior surface of the
              outer cylinder, the heat from the refrigerant is
              transferred to the water. This heat pump water heater has
              a limitation of heat transfer to the water because of the
              limited surface area provided by the cylindrical condenser
              exposed to the water. The limited heat transfer reduces
              the efficiency of the system. The diameter of the outer
              cylinder should be smaller than the size of the opening in
              the tank. The typical size of the opening in residential
              water tanks is about 3/4 inches and the height of tank is
              typically about 3-5 ft. Therefore, the maximum heat
              transfer area is limited by these dimensions. Another
              limitation of the heat pump water heater is the reduction
              in efficiency due to heating the returning refrigerant by
              entering hot refrigerant. The heat gained in the return
              refrigerant is wasted. Such a heat pump water heater is
              typically suited for a low capacity compressor but will
              significantly reduce the efficiency of a typical
              residential heat pump water heater. </p>
            <p align="left">[0006] Therefore, there is a need for
              efficient HPLH systems where liquids such as water can be
              heated in a shorter period of time while reducing the
              amount of energy used to heat the liquid. Further, there
              is a need for HPLH systems that can be easily installed or
              easily retrofitted onto preexisting liquid tanks while
              providing reduced heating times along with reduced power
              consumption. There is also a need for HPLH systems with
              increased efficiencies that further provide reduced costs
              related to materials and installation of the HPLH systems.

              pump; a liquid tank in heat communication with the heat
              pump, wherein the liquid tank comprises the liquid; at
              least one metal condenser tube immersed into the liquid,
              wherein the metal condenser tube comprises a refrigerant;
              and a tube-in-tube heat exchanger in fluid communication
              with a compressor, wherein the tube-in-tube heat exchanger
              recovers heat from refrigerant returning from the liquid
              tank and transfers the recovered heat to refrigerant going
              to the compressor thereby superheating the refrigerant. </p>
            <p align="left">[0046] The heat pump comprises a compressor,
              and wherein the tube-in-tube heat exchanger recovers heat
              from refrigerant returning from the liquid tank and
              transfers the recovered heat to refrigerant going to the

            <p align="left">[0047] According to a fifth embodiment, an
              adaptor assembly is disclosed. The adaptor assembly
              comprises a metal nipple fixedly attached to an opening in
              a liquid tank; a metal union fixedly attached onto the
              metal nipple; and a metal tube fixedly attached to the

              at least one condenser tube and/or a thermostat bulb. </p>
            <p align="left">[0048] The attachment between the metal
              nipple and the opening in the liquid tank is substantially
              air tight. A commercial small-scale or large-scale air
              conditioning unit comprises the liquid tank thereby

            <p align="left">[0049] Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1
              illustrates a schematic diagram of a heat pump water
              heating system according to one embodiment of the
              invention. The heat pump water heating system includes a
              heat pump 5 having a compressor 1, an evaporator 2 with a
              fan 3, an expansion device 4, a thermostat controller 6,
              and a thermostat knob 7. </p>
            <p align="left">[0050] Compressed refrigerant 9 exits the
              compressor 1 at a temperature controlled via the
              thermostat controller 6 when a user adjusts a thermostat
              knob 7. The compressed refrigerant 9 exits the compressor
              1 at a high pressure and a high enthalpy. The refrigerant
              then flows into the liquid tank 10 at a high pressure via
              a single coiled condenser tube 16. A liquid such as water
              11 flows into the liquid tank 10 and exchanges heat with
              the compressed refrigerant 9 flowing through the single
              coiled condenser tube 16, which is immersed into the
              liquid in the liquid tank 10. In the liquid tank 10, the
              compressed refrigerant 9 transfers heat into the liquid,
              and the refrigerant exits the liquid tank 10 via the
              returning single coiled condenser tube 15 as cooled
              refrigerant 8. The cooled refrigerant 8 is at a low
              enthalpy and a high pressure. The coiled condenser tubes
              15 and 16 form a coiled bundle 17 which remains immersed
              in the liquid. </p>
            <p align="left">[0051] The cold liquid 11 enters the liquid
              tank 10 and gets heated by superheated refrigerant in the
              coiled condenser tube generally defined by 15, 16 and 17
              in FIG. 1. Hot water 12 exits the liquid tank 10 via an
              adaptor assembly 13 fixedly attached to the opening in the
              liquid tank 10 by a union 19 (see FIG. 2 for more
              description on the adaptor assembly 13). Most of the heat
              transfer from the single coiled condenser tube occurs
              towards the bottom of the liquid tank 10 wherein cold
              liquid tends to settle towards the bottom as heated liquid
              tends to rise towards the top of the liquid tank 10
              providing a more homogenized liquid temperature in the
              liquid tank 10 compared to similar conventional HPLH
              systems. This homogenizing process enhances the heating
              efficiency of the HPLH. </p>
            <p align="left">[0052] The refrigerant 8 has higher
              temperature than liquid in the tank and its heat can be
              recovered before it passes though the expansion process in
              4 for better efficiency. The refrigerant 8 passes though a
              tube-in-tube heat exchanger (also referred to as the
              economizer) 47 (shown in FIG. 4) where the heat from the
              returning refrigerant 8 is transferred to the refrigerant
              43 (shown in FIG. 4) and passed to the compressor. </p>
            <p align="left">[0053] FIG. 2 illustrates an exploded view
              of the adaptor assembly 13 shown in FIG. 1. The adaptor
              assembly 13 is a pipe fitting which connects the heat pump
              5 and the liquid tank 10. The adaptor assembly 13 also
              facilitates flow of liquid 12 exiting the liquid tank 10.
              The adaptor assembly 13 also facilitates refrigerant flow
              via the coiled condenser tubes 15 and 16. Moreover, the
              adaptor assembly 13 facilitates the attachment of a
              thermostat immersion bulb 14 (also shown in FIG. 1) such
              that the bulb can be immersed into the liquid in the
              liquid tank 10 for accurate and efficient monitoring of
              the liquid temperature. </p>
            <p align="left">[0054] The adaptor assembly 13 is fixedly
              attached by thread fitting a metal nipple 23 to a threaded
              hole in the liquid tank 10. A metal union 19 is thread
              fitted on the nipple 23. A metal tube 13 is either thread
              fitted or compression fitted to the union 19 depending on
              the type of union. The metal tube 13 has two holes 22
              through which the coiled condenser tubes 15 and 16 can
              pass. An air tight weld is formed at the two holes 22
              making the adaptor assembly substantially air tight. A
              tube 13 has an open notch 21 at one end. </p>
            <p align="left">[0055] The thermocouple capillary tube 20
              having the thermostat bulb 14 is inserted through the
              notch 21. As the thermostat bulb 14 is usually
              substantially large and cannot bend, the notch 21 aids in
              the insertion of the thermostat bulb into the liquid tank
              10. A metal pipe fitting with female solder sup and male
              thread 24 is connected to the tube 13. The cup of fitting
              24 is welded to the tube 13 in such a way that the notch
              21 is sealed. The adaptor assembly 13 enhances the
              efficiency of the HPLH system by accommodating the coiled
              condenser tubes and the thermostat bulb 14. Moreover, the
              adaptor assembly 13 including the coiled condenser tubes
              15, 16, and 17 and the thermostat bulb 14 can be inserted
              into the threaded hole in the liquid tank without
              requiring to move the heat pump 5. </p>
            <p align="left">[0056] In another embodiment, the thermostat
              can be a non-immersion type thermostat which is externally
              mounted on a wall of the liquid tank 10 as in the case of
              conventional electrical water heater tanks. </p>
            <p align="left">[0057] The coiled condenser tubes 15, 16 and
              17 can be made of any metal. In another embodiment, the
              coiled condenser tubes 15, 16, and 17 can be made of
              copper or an alloy of copper. The coiled condenser tubes
              can be made from a single tube forming coils or multiple
              tubes forming coils. The coiled condenser tubes can each
              be made of a single wall tube or double walls in order to
              prevent any contamination of the liquid in the liquid tank
              10 with refrigerant due to a rupture in a single tube
              configuration. </p>
            <p align="left">[0058] FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic
              diagram of coiled condenser tubes 15, 16 and 17 for double
              wall configuration. Double wall condenser tube 15, 16 and
              17 may be required for some building code. In a preferred
              embodiment, the metal tubes 15 and 16 are made of
              concentric metal tubes so as avoid the contamination of
              the liquid with the refrigerant. A cross-section of the
              concentric metal tubes is shown in FIG. 3(a). FIG. 3(a)
              shows the cross-section of concentric metal tubes, wherein
              an outer tube 32 envelopes an inner tube 33. A gap 35 is
              formed between the outer tube 32 and the inner tube 33
              such that air is trapped in the gap 35. The air trapped in
              the gap 35 conducts heat from the inner tube 33 to the
              outer tube 32. Due to the presence of air in the gap 35 as
              an intermediary for heat conduction between the inner tube
              33 and the outer tube 32, some heat is lost in heating the
              air in the gap. Further, air is not as good of a conductor
              of heat as the metal tubes therefore the efficiency of
              heating the liquid is decreased. </p>
            <p align="left">[0059] In a more preferred embodiment, the
              metal tubes 15 and 16 are each made of concentric metal
              tubes, wherein the concentric metal tubes are shown in
              FIGS. 3(b)1 and (b)2. FIG. 3(b)1 shows a flattened tube
              and FIG. 3(b)2 shows a cross-section of the flattened tube
              shown in FIG. 3(b)1. The cross-section shown in FIG. 3(a)
              shows two concentric circles wherein the gap between the
              two concentric circles is substantially the same
              throughout the circumference of the two concentric
              circles. However, the cross-section shown in FIG. 3(b)2
              shows two concentric ovals wherein the gap between the two
              concentric ovals is such that the gap between the two
              ovals is substantially minimized while still providing a
              double tube configuration. The oval double-tube
              configuration exemplified in FIG. 3(b)2 not only provides
              protection against contamination of the liquid with any
              leaked refrigerant but also conducts heat more efficiently
              than the double tube configuration shown in FIG. 3(a) as
              the amount of air in the gap between the concentric tubes
              in FIGS. 3(b)1 and 3(b)2 is minimized. </p>
            <p align="left">[0060] The condenser of the HPLH is attached
              to the liquid tank using an adaptor assembly of the
              present invention. The adaptor assembly fits into a
              preexisting hole in the tank cover preferably on a hot
              liquid outlet. The adaptor assembly can also be fitted
              onto a hole on a side wall or any other opening on the
              liquid tank. The bottom of the adaptor assembly is screwed
              into the hole in the liquid tank and the top of the
              adaptor assembly is fixedly attached to the hot liquid
              outlet pipe. </p>
            <p align="left">[0061] As mentioned above, the condenser is
              a single continuous tube or multiple loops with a sharp
              bend at the middle making a loop. The surface area of the
              condenser tube, which is determined by the length and the
              diameter of the condenser tube, can be designed to heat
              the liquid in the liquid tank to a predetermined
              temperature in a predetermined time period. The two ends
              of the looped condenser tube along with an immersion
              thermocouple tube pass through the adaptor assembly and
              protrude out of the adaptor wall. </p>
            <p align="left">[0062] Moreover, condenser tube length can
              be designed to be of any predetermined length depending on
              the capacity of the compressor. The larger the compressor
              capacity the longer the length of the condenser tube will
              be in order to maximize heat transfer from superheated
              refrigerant to the liquid in the liquid tank. The diameter
              of the condenser tube is designed to have enough
              flexibility so that it can be inserted into tank easily.
              The metal condenser tube has a length and diameter and
              wall thickness of any dimension. The metal condenser tube
              has a length and diameter to heat the liquid to a
              predetermined temperature in a predetermined time period.
              The metal condenser tube has a surface area to heat the
              liquid to a predetermined temperature in a predetermined
              time period. </p>
            <p align="left">[0063] The condenser tube curls towards the
              bottom of the liquid tank wherein as liquid at a lower
              temperature is heated to form hot liquid, the hot liquid
              rises towards the top of the liquid tank. This process
              aids in homogenizing the liquid temperature in the liquid
              tank and improves efficiency of the HPLH. </p>
            <p align="left">[0064] The condenser tube is coiled so as to
              form a bundle. The primary purpose of bundling the
              condenser tube is to aid in easy removal of the condensing
              tube from the liquid tank and thereby aiding in easy
              disconnection of the heat pump from the liquid tank. The
              condenser tube bundle can be tied together at the top for
              ease in pulling out from the hole of the tank cover. The
              bundle is scattered towards the bottom of the liquid tank
              for improved heat transfer by exposing the condenser to a
              large surface area of the liquid in the liquid tank. </p>
            <p align="left">[0065] A traditional short length straight
              or un-coiled condenser tube is difficult to insert into
              the liquid tank through a hole while holding the HPLH. In
              contrast, the long bundle of the condenser tubes of the
              present invention are easy to insert into the liquid tank
              through a hole in the liquid tank as the HPLH can be
              placed on any convenient surface while inserting the
              bundled condenser tube into the liquid tank. Once the
              bundled condenser tube is inserted into the liquid tank,
              the HPLH can be placed in any desired position such as on
              the top of the liquid tank. </p>
            <p align="left">[0066] FIG. 4 illustrates an exploded view
              of the heat pump 5 shown in FIG. 1. The returning
              refrigerant 8 is carried out from a liquid tank 10 to the
              expansion device 4. The returning refrigerant 8 passes
              through the expansion device 4 after it exits the
              tube-in-tube heat exchanger 47. The expansion device 4
              expands and reduces the pressure of the refrigerant. The
              expansion device 4 can be capillary tube or Automatic
              Expansion Valve ("AEV") or Thermostatic Expansion Valve
              ("TEV") or Electric or Electronic Expansion Valves ("EXV")
              or other known type of expansion device. </p>
            <p align="left">[0067] After expansion, the refrigerant
              flows into the evaporator 2 equipped with a fan 3 and
              exits at a high enthalpy and a low pressure. In the
              evaporator 2, the refrigerant absorbs heat from
              surrounding air thereby heating the refrigerant. The flow
              of the surrounding air is aided by the fan 3 such that the
              surrounding air exchanges heat with the refrigerant
              passing through the evaporator 2. The temperature
              difference between the surrounding air and the refrigerant
              in the evaporator 2 drives the thermal energy transfer
              from the surrounding air to the refrigerant as the
              refrigerant flows through the evaporator 2. The fan 3
              moves the surrounding air across the evaporator 2,
              maintaining the temperature difference and evaporating the
              refrigerant. The refrigerant 44 and 45 goes through extra
              superheating in tube-in-tube heat exchanger 47 then
              reenters the compressor 1, completing the cycle. </p>
            <p align="left">[0068] The heating capacity of a compressor
              1 is defined as the capacity of the compressor 1 to heat
              the liquid 11 in the liquid tank 10. The heat pump 5 can
              include an auxiliary electric heater in another embodiment
              that can further heat the liquid 12 exiting the liquid
              tank 10 to increase the heating capacity of the heat pump
              5. The auxiliary electric heater can be located anywhere
              on the liquid line exiting the liquid tank 10. The
              auxiliary heating element can also be the existing one
              with the typical electrical liquid tank or new one may be
              attached anywhere in the body of the tank. The auxiliary
              electric heater can be activated to further heat the
              liquid 12 exiting the liquid tank 10 when the heating
              capacity of the heat pump 5 does not meet demand. The
              auxiliary electric heater can also be activated using
              cold-temperature thermostat for freezing cold air
              conditions or activated when there is excess demand of hot
              liquid. </p>
            <p align="left">[0069] Further to the description of the
              heat pump 5 with respect to FIG. 1, a heat recovery heat
              exchanger 47 (also referred to as an economizer) adds to
              increasing the efficiency of the HPLH of the present
              invention. The reason for this is that most of the latent
              heat in returning refrigerant 8 is normally lost in the
              expansion process, however, according to one embodiment of
              the present invention, a substantial portion of the latent
              heat in the returning refrigerant 8 is recovered and
              transferred to refrigerant 41 as "superheat". The recovery
              and use of this additional heat increases the efficiency
              of the HPLH of the present invention. The heat exchanger
              47 can be a tube-in-tube heat exchanger and can be
              substituted with any other heat exchanger in the system. </p>
            <p align="left">[0070] In the evaporator 2, the refrigerant
              absorbs heat from surrounding air thereby heating the
              refrigerant. The flow of the surrounding air is aided by
              the fan 3 such that the surrounding air exchanges heat
              with the refrigerant passing through the evaporator 2 in a
              known manner. The temperature difference between the
              surrounding air and the refrigerant in the evaporator 2
              drives the thermal energy transfer from the surrounding
              air to the refrigerant as the refrigerant flows through
              the evaporator 2. The fan 3 moves the surrounding air
              across the evaporator 2, maintaining the temperature
              difference and evaporating the refrigerant. Refrigerant 44
              extracts heat from air in the evaporator 2 and then
              reenters the compressor 1 by first passing through the
              heat exchanger 43 for superheating the refrigerant to a
              superheated refrigerant 45. </p>
            <p align="left">[0071] FIG. 5 illustrates a preferred
              embodiment of the present invention and shows a schematic
              diagram of a heat pump water heating system including a
              solar power source. The various components and functions
              have been described herein above with respect to FIG. 1,
              except FIG. 5 electrical energy input is from solar energy
              rather than a traditional electric source. Solar energy is
              inputted to the compressor 1 from a storage battery 55
              that stores solar energy. A solar photovoltaic panel 51
              collects solar energy this collected solar energy is
              transferred to a solar charge controller 53 for the
              storage battery 55 via a connecting wire 57. HPLH system
              can run directly from batteries or thought an alternating
              current inverter depending on the electrical requirement
              of the components of HPLH. </p>
            <p align="left">[0072] Solar energy can be used to power the
              auxiliary electric heater, the economizer, and/or any
              other component requiring electricity. The conversion of
              solar energy to thermal or electrical energy through the
              use of systems such as photovoltaic arrays, passive
              absorbers of solar energy, solar furnaces, trough
              concentrating collectors with sun trackers is well
              established in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,163 describes
              a multipower electrical system for supplying electrical
              energy to a house including a solar photovoltaic array, a
              battery charger and DC to AC inverter. U.S. Pat. No.
              4,147,157 describes an active solar energy system
              comprising an array of solar collectors for both
              generating power for a pump and for heating a liquid, a
              pumping device powered by the array to circulate the
              heated liquid and a storage tank to contain the heated
              liquid. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,447 describes a
              system for heating water using solar energy comprising a
              photovoltaic array, a water heater and a controller.
              Systems have also been proposed for simultaneously
              converting solar energy to thermal and electrical. For
              example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,392,008 describes a flat plated
              solar thermal collector below and in spaced conductive
              relationship to a plate-mounted array of photovoltaic
              cells. U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,944 describes an apparatus with
              an array of photovoltaic cells and a plurality of
              interconnected heat collecting tubes disposed on the same
              plane with the array. </p>
            <p align="left">[0073] FIG. 6A shows a flowchart of how
              solar energy is traditionally supplied to an HPLH. First,
              a solar photovoltaic panel collects solar energy in the
              form of DC electricity. This DC electricity is then
              directly supplied to an HPLH. FIG. 6B shows a flowchart of
              supplying solar energy to an HPLH according to one
              embodiment of the present invention. Solar energy is
              collected by a solar photovoltaic panel in the form of DC
              electricity. The DC electricity is stored in an
              electricity storage device such as a rechargeable battery
              or a combination of such batteries using a charge
              controller. The DC electricity stored in the battery or
              combination of batteries can then be supplied on demand
              directly to an HPLH or can first be converted into AC
              electricity using an inverter before being supplied on
              demand to the HPLH. The use of a battery or a combination
              of batteries to store collected solar energy enables the
              HPLH to have a substantially consistent availability of
              electricity to power the HPLH. Moreover, when the HPLH is
              not in use the battery or combination of batteries can
              store the collected power until the HPLH is in use again.
              Similarly, stored solar energy enables the HPLH to be used
              substantially consistently during heavy use. </p>
            <p align="left">[0074] Further, the heating efficiency of
              the HPLH is improved by recovering heat from the returning
              refrigerant from the condenser. The returning refrigerant
              from the condenser has equal or higher temperature than
              the liquid in the liquid tank. The heat in the returning
              refrigerant is traditionally lost during an expansion
              process. However, the HPLH of the present invention
              recovers this heat by the heat exchanger (i.e.,
              economizer) or by using any other type of heat exchanger,
              wherein heat from the returning refrigerant is transferred
              to the refrigerant going into the compressor. </p>
            <p align="left">[0075] Moreover, according to one
              embodiment, a retrofitting method is disclosed. In the
              retrofitting method the HPLH of the present invention can
              be used with a portable air conditioning (heating or
              cooling) unit available in the market. Such retrofitting
              can be achieved by first either removing the evaporator
              coil or condenser coil from the air conditioning unit and
              the remaining coil can be used as the evaporator of the
              HPLH. Second, the bundled condenser tube is attached at
              one end to the high pressure opening of the compressor and
              the other end of the condenser tube is attached to the
              existing expansion device of the system such that the
              middle portion of the condenser tube is inserted into the
              liquid tank and is immersed into the liquid. Third, the
              expansion device can be attached on the other end to an
              evaporator with an existing fan. Fourth, the other end of
              the evaporator can be attached to a low pressure end of a
              compressor making the system a closed cycle. Optionally,
              as a fifth step, the cold temperature thermostat switch
              can be removed and instead a high temperature thermostat
              switch can be added to the circuit for complete on/off
              switch capability of the system. The thermostat can be an
              immersion type or a traditional thermostat attached to the
              outside wall of the tank. An air filter can be attached on
              air inlet vents of the retrofitted HPLH. </p>
            <p align="left">[0076] In another embodiment, the HPLH of
              the present invention can be used for retrofitting onto
              commercial air conditioning units. The condenser unit with
              compressor, expansion device and fan is used as evaporator
              in commercial HPLH. The tube connections are changed so
              that one end of condenser tube is connected to the high
              pressure opening of the compressor. Condenser tube is
              inserted through the opening of the liquid tank and is
              immersed in liquid. The other end of the condenser is
              attached to the existing expansion device of the system.
              The expansion device is attached to one end of evaporator
              with the existing fan. The other end of the evaporator is
              attached to the low pressure end of compressor making the
              system a closed cycle. The cold temperature thermostat
              switch is removed and instead a high temperature
              thermostat switch is added to the circuit for complete
              on/off of the system. The thermostat is preferably
              immersion type. An air filter can be attached on air inlet
              vents of the system. </p>
            <p align="left">[0077] Although air surrounding the HPLH
              generally contains enough heat to allow efficient
              operation of the HPLH, there can be occasions when the wet
              bulb air temperature approaches freezing, in which case
              frost begins to form on the evaporator. In such an event
              the HPLH can become inefficient. In one embodiment, an
              electric heater can be used to heat the air going through
              the evaporator causing defrosting which substantially
              removes any blockage caused by the frost. In another
              embodiment, the evaporator can be heated directly by an
              electric heater to defrost the evaporator and thereby
              substantially remove any blockage caused by the frost. In
              another embodiment, a low temperature thermostat can be
              added to the evaporator of the HPLH so that the thermostat
              can sense the formation of frost on the evaporator and a
              control means can be automatically activated when the
              frost is sensed so as to defrost the evaporator by
              switching on the electric heater. Similarly, the control
              means can turn the heater off when the defrosting is
              completed as sensed by the thermostat. See, for example,
              U.S. Pat. No. 4,517,807 for further information regarding
              defrosting an evaporator using a thermostat and a control
              means. </p>
            <p align="left">[0078] Further, the HPLH improves heating
              efficiency, saves space, reduces system and installation
              costs, removes need of liquid circulating pump and its
              controllers, reduces the maintainable parts in the system
              and is easy to install. The HPLH can be added to an
              existing liquid tank or can be integrated with a new
              liquid tank. Furthermore, altering the length of the
              condenser aids in tailoring the use of the HPLH for
              smaller-scale residential use as well as for larger-scale
              commercial use. </p>
            <p align="left">[0079] All the above embodiments of HPLH are
              further enhanced to use adaptors to channel inlet air flow
              and outlet cool air flow to desired space for air
              conditioning. </p>
            <p align="left">[0080] All the above embodiment of HPLH
              includes a drain hole and tube attachment for the removal
              of condensate from the evaporator. </p>

            <p align="left">[0082] The refrigerant is R22. The Energy
              Factor ("EF") in the above table is defined as the ratio
              of heat output to energy input divided by conventional
              electrical liquid heater efficiency factor. Conventional
              electric resistance water heater efficiency factor is
              0.86. A scatter plot of the above data is shown in FIG. 7
              with a trendline. The higher the EF, the more efficient
              the water heater, and therefore FIG. 7 shows that the
              efficiency of the water heater increases as the ambient
              temperature of the water increases. </p>
