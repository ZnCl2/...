    <blockquote>The universe can be broadly divided into space and
      dynamic matter with its motion governed by an intelligent scheme
      that permits an organized movement of all cosmic material bodies
      like moons, planets, stars and galaxies In addition to space and
      matter, another basic entity, energy, was shown to be the
      constituent of all universal matter as per Einstein's Theory of
      Relativity, propounded at the start of this century. The
      interconvertibility of matter and energy extended the domain of
      universal reality from visible matter to invisible energy. Some
      recent experiments performed in USA and India and possibly in
      other countries too, have produced certain astonishing results as
      per which electrical power can be generated from absolute vacuum
      or space which is a phenomenon hitherto unknown. This new finding
      shall force a positive conclusion on substantial reality of space
      and will further enlarge the domain of basic reality from matter
      and energy, as known today, to the whole of the universal space.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Electric power is a phenomenon of current flow in an electrical
        conductor at some voltage or electric pressure. On the nature of
        electric current, it was discovered by the close of 19th
        century, that it is constituted of electrons, the subatomic
        particles that carry basic unit of electric charge. In electric
        power generators, electrons are produced from atoms of a
        conductor as it cuts through a magnetic field, and external
        power is therefore required to produce electrons and make them
        flow in load circuit. The external sources of power in modern
        technology of power generation, are mainly thermal,
        hydroelectric and nuclear. Electric power production, today is a
        process of conversion of energy from one form to another rather
        than 'generation' in a true sense. Whereas the newly discovered
        process of generation of electric power from 'absolute vacuum'
        does not need any raw material like coal, nuclear fuel or a
        hydrogen source. </p>
      <p>At the face of it, it sounds unbelievable, that vacuum which is
        considered by current scientific theories as a void or a state
        of nothingness can ever generate energy out of its own
        substratum. As per modern physics while 'absolute vacuum' or
        'space' can no doubt transmit electromagnetic energy, in the
        absence of universal matter and its associated energy fields,
        there can be no energy-content that is ‘reality’ in space. The
        concept of ether filling all space and atoms as 'vortices of
        ether' introduced by Rene Descartes(1596-1650) and developed to
        a great extent by the close of 19th century found no favour in
        the early 20th century. Though the domain of reality was
        extended from matter to energy by Einstein's Relativity Theory,
        yet space devoid of universal matter ceased to have any
        substantiality. In the new phenomenon of space power generation
        (SPG) electrical power is produced by rotating at high speed
        conducting disc magnets or electromagnets, named as N-Generator
        by Bruce De Palma, a U.S. inventor. In 1978 he discovered that
        electrical power produced by such a device did not require an
        equivalent energy input to the drive motor that rotated the
        N-Generator. The experimental results are in violation of the
        'law of conservation of energy' unless it is supposed that the
        additional energy is generated within the interatomic vacuum or
        space in the rotating body of the N-Generator. A new theory on
        space, energy and matter, Space Vortex Theory (SVT) which posits
        the concept of dynamic space as the most fundamental substratum
        of reality, and electrons as 'vortices of space' explains the
        principles behind SPG phenomenon. As per SVT, all universal
        matter is created from substantial space, just as bubbles,
        vortices and waves are produced in an ocean of water. It is
        space that has manifested as planets, stars and galaxies is the
        conclusion of SVT. Space is more fundamental than matter. There
        is no point in space that is devoid of reality. Thus the domain
        of reality already extended from matter to energy by Relativity
        Theory encompasses the whole of the universal space as per SVT.<br>
        <br>
        A space power generator consists of a soft-iron core on which
        electromagnet coils are wound. Both the coils and the iron core
        are rotated together, there being no relative motion between the
        magnetic field and the soft iron conductor of the core. A vortex
        of space is formed in the rotating iron, due to which electrical
        charge is produced, which interacts with orbital electrons of
        the iron atoms and sets them free. The free electrons are
        interacted with the magnetic field creating positive and
        negative polarities between which output power at high current
        and few volts is drawn. </p>
      <p>In the future when the newly discovered principles of SPG are
        made technically viable, electrical generators of capacity in
        tens of kilowatts and of sizes comparable with conventional
        electrical generators will be providing electrical power to
        remote regions, presently with no power distribution network and
        for such installations where power requirement of each unit is
        limited to say about 10~ kW. </p>
      <p>The space power generators will require initial drive before
        becoming self-sustaining, for which conventional diesel engines
        or battery power will be needed. A number of units of
        N-generators installed at one location can meet larger load
        requirements for rural electrification and may be smaller towns
        as well. Modern technology is well advanced to undertake
        construction of these new machines that do not require any such
        specialized items of materials that need long time development.
        High speed rotation of machines and collection of power at few
        volts but very large currents will require special attention in
        the development of space power generators. </p>
      <p>On space being filled with energy that created matter,
        Michelson in 1899 had remarked, "Suppose that an ether strain
        corresponds to an electric charge, an ether displacement to the
        electric current, ether vortices to the atoms; if we continue
        these suppositions, we arrive at what may be one of the grandest
        generalization of modern science, namely, that all the phenomena
        of the physical universe are only different manifestations of
        the various modes of motion of one all pervading substance, the
        ether". At the close of 19th century, the concept of ether
        filling all space as introduced by Descartes was about to be
        recognized as the basic reality. Earlier to Descartes, Thales
        (624-546 B.C) a Greek philosopher considered water as the
        primary substance in the universe. The Upanishadic Rishis of
        Bharat, however, thousands of years ago, proclaimed that
        'Akasha’ or space is the first element that gave birth to air.
        From air was born fire or heat and their various combinations
        produced water and earth. Very rightly indeed, did the
        Upanishads discriminate among the five elements pinpointing the
        akasha as the most fundamental entity potent with energy. This
        experiment on generation of power from space will reestablish
        Vedantic philosophy of eternal existence of Akasha as a
        substratum, the ‘one reality' out of which the cosmic worlds
        arose. The new science of space power generation will
        scientifically vindicate the vedantic science on the evolution
        of the universe. </p>
      <p>The N-Generator has been further developed in the USA by De
        Palma, Trombly and Kahn, who could generate about 45 Kw of power
        with an input of only 9 Kw, thus getting an incremental power
        ratio of output further to input, about 5. Bruce De Palma is
        also further developing his N- generator, trying to achieve
        perpetual motion. He is quite close to success. The model of
        space power generator built at Tarapur Atomic Power Station for
        demonstration of the new principle gave an incremental power
        ratio of output to input about 2.5. This machine is proposed to
        be taken to West Germany for demonstration at Hannover in an
        International Conference for Gravity Field Energy, that will be
        held there in mid-March 1987. From letters received from USA,
        West Germany and many other countries, it is evident that the
        'over-unity' system which is the name given to space power
        generation, is catching attention of world scientists and
        engineers. Being an entirely new technology, it has presently
        some controversy too associated with its development, especially
        in USA. The proposed conference at Hannover being organised by
        Dr Hans Nieper, President, German Association of Gravity Field
        Energy, West Germany, Hannover, to which I have been invited to
        deliver a talk on 'Space Vortex Theory' will hopefully be an
        interesting forum to discuss with scientists and engineers, the
        new and novel phenomenon of Space Power generation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp; <br>
        Today's need for power is met by man at the cost of ecological
        balance that nature inherently devises through its forests,
        rivers, mountains end oceans, and atmospheric belt of air. The
        pollution of planet through excessive combustion of coal, oil
        and gases, deforestation and other hazards to the maintenance of
        clear environment in populated areas, will be prevented to a
        good extent with the development of power generation from
        Vacuum. </p>
      <p>Maybe it is the final jump of progress in power generation
        technology that energy is produced from space, which is not only
        the cleanest resource for power, but will also outlive all forms
        of cosmic matter both inanimate and animate. </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been hitherto
          believed in physics that the total electric charge in the
          Universe is a constant quantity, and if additional charge
          appears in some region, it is only at the expense of the
          charge deficit in some other regions. It is a basic law that
          electric charge is conserved and cannot be destroyed or
          created. Precise experiments on a Space Power Generator (SPG)
          which has been now further developed to demonstrate the
          commercial viability of the newly discovered phenomenon of
          space power generation however, totally violate the existing
          law of conservation of charge, by generating output electrical
          power much in excess of the input electrical power. Since
          electric charge is a form of basic energy, the law of
          conservation of energy will need to be enlarged to incorporate
          in it the dynamics of absolute vacuum (Ref. 1), which in a
          state of rotation generates fundamental field to produce
          electrical charge and energy.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description of the SPG ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The SPG shown in <b><a
              href="#figa">Figure (1)</a></b> is a further developed
          form of the machines described (Ref. 2,3) in earlier issues of
          this magazine. A non-magnetic shaft interconnects two mild
          steel rotors on which two electromagnets are mounted. Electric
          power at 1.5 volt dc and high amperes is drawn fro each unit,
          with the help of copper-graphite brushes when the machine runs
          at 2860 rpm directly coupled and driven by an induction motor.
          The power is drawn between the inner rotor’s cylindrical
          surface and the shaft through dc shunts that enable
          measurements of high dc current. The SPG weighs about 150 kg
          and is fabricated out of 120 mm thick mild steel plate. The
          two units enable generation of power at more than 3 volts dc
          by appropriate series connections between the two coils. The
          electromagnet’s coils are 16 swg super enameled wire with 216
          turns in each coil. The feature that brings improvements (Ref.
          4) in this machine is the larger diameter of the rotors that
          produce higher dc voltage at comparatively lower speed, not
          exceeding 3000 rpm. Also the twin units with a single coil in
          each unit double the amount of power.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Test Results ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The drive motor (DM) takes
          no-load current of 2.6 amperes (1300 watts) to rotate itself
          and the SPG to overcome windage and friction at 2870 rpm. The
          no-load voltage internally generated in each unit of the SPG
          is adjusted to 1.5 volts dc between the shaft and the inner
          rotor by the control of the dc excitation current in the two
          electromagnets’ coils connected in series. The excitation
          current is 31 amperes, the total dc resistance of the two
          coils being 2.5 ohms. The power given to the electromagnets is
          31 x 31 x 2.5, that is, 2400 watts. The two shunts with
          calibration of 200 amperes for 75 mV are now connected across
          the two output circuits. The dc currents measured in each
          circuit are almost equal to 2613 amperes corresponding to 98
          mV reading of the shunt. The output electrical power of each
          unit is 2613 x 1.5 watts, that is 3919 watts. Total electrical
          power from the two units is 7839 watts. As the SPG is
          electrically loaded, the current of DM rises to 10 amperes,
          showing a rise of 7.4 amperes over the no-load current, and
          corresponding to a rise in input electrical power of 3700
          watts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The load current of the DM
          of 10 amperes amounts to the total electrical input to the DM
          of 5000 watts, out of which 1300 watts is utilized to overcome
          the no-load losses. The remaining electrical input of 3700
          watts generates 7839 watts of electrical output power, giving
          the efficiency of space power generation in this particular
          machine as 211.8%. Assuming electromagnetic efficiency of the
          DM as 80%, the efficiency of the electrical energy generation
          of the SPG will rise to 264.75%</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the excitation power of
          2400 watts given to the SPG is deducted from the SPG of 7839
          watts, the balance electrical output of 5439 watts still
          exceeds the total electrical input of 5000 watts by 439 watts,
          giving the total system efficiency of 105.9% while, in
          addition the DM-SPG set runs as a perpetual system drawing
          1300 watts of power from space.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quantum of Space Power ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The quantum of electrical
          charge produced due to the rotation of space in a rotating
          electromagnet and the electrical power produced when the power
          is withdrawn through an electric circuit, as discussed in an
          earlier article (Ref 2), is given by:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P =
          (1.8) LNr<sup>2</sup>10<sup>-5</sup> kW</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">where, P is the power in kW,
          L is the axial length of the SPG in centimeters, N is the
          revolutions per second, and ‘r’ is the radius in centimeters
          of the SPG on the inner rotor surface.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The derivation of the above
          relation was based on the assumption that the radius of the
          spherical void at the center of the electron as discussed in
          space vortex theory (Ref. 1, 2) is 1.5 x 10<sup>-11</sup> cm.
          More precise measurements in space power generation
          experiments, however, show that the coefficient 1.8 in
          equation (1) should be 2.5, and the void radius at the
          electron’s center should be taken as 10<sup>-11</sup> cm. With
          these corrections the space power equation (1) now becomes:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P =
          (2.5) LNr<sup>2</sup>10<sup>-5</sup> kW</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Substituting the values, L =
          12, N = 47.6, and r = 11.43 in Eq. (2), P = 5.85 kW.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since there are two units of
          the SPG on the shaft, total power from the two units will be
          11.7 kW, which is 1.5 times the output power drawn from the
          machine in the above test. With additional brushes and reduced
          brush contacts at about 3000 rpm, the above machine will have
          capacity to produce about 12 kW of power. If the SPG is driven
          at 6000 rpm both the voltages and currents will be doubled,
          producing 4 times output of about 48 kW. Since the excitation
          power remains constant, much higher total system efficiency is
          expected though the efficiency of the SPG as computed above
          will remain constant at 211.8%.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mass-energy equation of
          Einstein brought forth a universal law that an electron like
          all matter contains energy in its structure. A further
          enlargement of this law is that the electron itself is energy,
          where "energy" in physical terms is a state of vacuum in
          rotation. Even at ordinary speed of rotation of an
          electromagnet, the interatomic space of the iron core develops
          velocity fields of vacuum that qualitatively act like
          additional charge within the rotating system and liberate
          orbital electrons of the iron atoms. The interaction of the
          magnetic field and free electrons form polarities (Ref. 2, 3).
          It is possible to commercially develop a machine that can not
          only rotate itself perpetually but also generate additional
          electrical energy in kilowatts and higher range. The law of
          conservation of charge and the law of conservation of energy
          are applicable within the systems confined to material
          interactions alone and not to the medium of space which is a
          dynamic entity that can rotate and create charge at ordinary
          speeds, and can rotate and create electrons at the speed of
          light.</font> </p>

        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">In 1974 a generalized theory of matter and energy which
          showed that energy can be developed in vacuum by positing
          electron’s structure was proposed by the writer and the same
          was registered with the Copy Right Office, Government of India
          (Registration number L6823/ 74).&nbsp; The writer also had
          published his works entitled, "The Substantial Space and
          Void-nature of Elementary Material Particles", in 1977, and
          "Space Vortices of Energy and Matter", in 1978. Bruce DePalma,
          erstwhile lecturer, MIT, USA, having learnt then on above
          theoretical works wrote to the writer in May 1978 and sent
          some details of his experiments on rotation of conducting disc
          magnets by which electrical power could be generated at high
          efficiency.&nbsp; Since then and more vigorously since 1985,
          the writer performed many experiments to pinpoint the source
          of generation of additional power, and named the machines
          developed by the writer as "Space Power Generator". Bruce
          DePalma had named his own system of rotating magnets as
          "N-Generator" based on his discovery of "N-effect". In an
          article, "On the possibility of Extraction of Electrical
          Energy Directly from Space", Bruce DePalma wrote in April
          1990, "A parallel program of Space Power Generators (SPG) has
          been taking place in India since 1978.&nbsp; P. Tewari of the
          Indian Atomic Board had developed a generalized theory of
          matter and energy, which showed that energy could be developed
          from the vacuum by positing a structure for electron.&nbsp;
          Having received the experimental results of the ‘Sunburst’
          machine he instituted an R&amp;D program to develop practical
          versions of the SPG for general use.&nbsp; Tewari has
          constructed N-machine/SPG apparatus which produces excess
          output power over that required to rotate the generator when
          all losses have been subtracted from the output generated
          power". </p>

          the writer to an International Conference held at Hannover in
          1987 to deliver a lecture on his research on "Space Power
          Generation" and awarded the first prize for the demonstration
          of a working model of SPG.&nbsp; Also, on his new field of
          research, many papers by the writer have been published in the
          Proceedings of the International Conferences in USA and Italy
          where he was invited to deliver invited talks.&nbsp; The

          left;">In electromagnetic induction, which is the principle
          used in conventional dc generators, electromotive force (EMF)
          is induced when magnetic flux cuts a conductor due to motion
          of the conductor relative to the flux or vice-versa.&nbsp;
          Also, EMF is induced when flux linkage with the conductor
          changes with time.&nbsp; Faraday in 1832 rotated together a
          copper disc and a magnet with the magnetic field at right
          angles to the surface of the copper disc, and noticed the
          generation of EMF between the periphery of the disc and its
          axis, thought here was no relative motion between the copper
          disc and the magnetic field.&nbsp; The effect noticed by
          Faraday does not appear in engineering textbooks and therefore
          is not known to many.&nbsp; DePalma’s experiments too are
          similar to Faraday’s in the sense that an electromagnet, with
          a cylindrical core and the electric coil integrally mounted on
          it, is rotated to produce EMF between its periphery and the
          axis of rotation.&nbsp; In this system the efficiency of
          electrical power produced as discovered by Bruce DePalma is at
          very high efficiency.&nbsp; The writer discovered through his
          experiments that in a rotating integral assembly of
          cylindrical iron core and electric coil mounted around it, EMF
          is induced also in radial conductors in the core and without
          being in contact with the core except at the central axis of
          rotation, despite the fact that it has no contact with the
          steady magnetic field in the core.&nbsp; This unique effect of
          magnetic induction was published by the write in an article
          entitled "Electromagnetic Induction of Space Substratum", page
          16, Jan-Feb 1992, Journal of Borderland Research, CA, USA, and
          is the basic concept utilized in the development of the
          present invention.&nbsp; To summarize: </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">1. Faraday discovered that electromagnetic induction,
          in a co-rotating assembly of conducting disc and disc magnet
          is possible. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">2. Bruce DePalma discovered the above effect of Faraday
          and also that electrical power produced through such a
          co-rotating magnet field-conductor system is at very high
          efficiency. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">3. The writer discovered that electromagnetic induction
          in such a co-rotating magnetic-conductor system can take place
          even when the radial conductor embedded in the conducting disc
          is neither in contact with the magnetic field nor is cut by
          the magnetic field. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">The development of this invention took place due to the
          above new phenomena of electromagnetic induction. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;"><b>Brief description of the Invention:</b> </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">Refer to <b><a href="#figm">Figure 12</a></b>.&nbsp;
          An electric coil (15) is rigidly mounted on a cylindrical iron
          core (17) and rotated with a drive motor.&nbsp; Radial
          non-magnetic stainless steel studs (7, 16), welded to the
          shaft, pass through the inner cylindrical rotors (5, 17)
          without touching the same.&nbsp; The stainless steel studs are
          grouped in pairs, and each pair shares a common hole in the
          inner rotor.&nbsp; Half the stainless steel studs in one plane
          terminate on a common non-magnetic metal ring (inner
          ring)&nbsp; (8) encircling the inner rotor (5).&nbsp; Fixed
          carbon brushes (12) slide on this ring and form one of the
          output terminals (10) of the SPG.&nbsp; The remaining
          stainless steel studs, also in one plane, terminate on another
          non-magnetic metal ring (outer ring) (11) encircling the inner
          core (17) and also the end cover (14) and mounted in between
          the air gap (28) created due to the two halves of the outer
          iron covers (9, 14).&nbsp; Fixed brushes (29) on this outer
          ring form the other output terminal (13) of the SPG.&nbsp; The
          iron core is magnetized by feeding excitation power to the
          electrical coil through slip rings (18) on the shaft
          (3).&nbsp; Thought the steady magnetic field does not pass
          through the non-magnetic stainless steel studs and also does
          not change with time, yet the stainless steel studs (7, 16)
          develop dc voltage that appears between the inner and outer
          rings (8, 11).&nbsp; When power is drawn between the above
          rings through fixed brushes on them, both the outgoing and
          incoming dc currents pass through the air gap (18), thereby
          canceling the magnetic effect due to the load current to a
          good extent.&nbsp; Similarly, the pair of stainless steel
          studs in common holes in the inner core carry dc currents in
          opposite directions and thus cancel their magnetic effects
          within the core.&nbsp; The above cancellation of magnetic
          effects due to load current in the outer air gap and the slots
          in the inner core leads to high efficiency of power production
          in the SPG. </p>

          the SPG, which should preferably be made with non-magnetic
          material.&nbsp; The shaft has a central longitudinal hole to
          thread wires for the electromagnet.&nbsp; It also has eight
          numbers of radial tapped holes in which non-magnetic stainless
          steel studs are fixed.&nbsp; The shaft is stepped to
          accommodate the inner rotors as discussed below and also to
          accommodate bearings. <b><a href="#figc">Figure 2</a></b> and
          <b><a href="#figd">Figure 3</a></b> show details of the inner
          rotors that are made of high magnetic permeability mild steel
          and are shrunk fit on the aforesaid shaft.&nbsp; Inner rotor-2
          in <b><a href="#figc">Figure 2</a></b> has provision of a
          slant hole for threading wires to the electric coil.&nbsp;
          Radial slots as shown in the end views of <b><a href="#figc">Figure





              2</a></b> and <b><a href="#figd">Figure 3</a></b> are cut
          to accommodate four numbers of stainless steel studs in each
          inner rotor.&nbsp; The inner rotors mounted on the stainless
          steel shaft are so disposed with each other that four common
          holes are formed by eight numbers of slots to accommodate
          eight numbers of stainless steel studs, two studs falling in
          each hole.&nbsp; The assembly of inner rotors on the shaft is
          carried out after fixing the studs to the shaft.&nbsp; All the
          eight studs are so fixed that they do not touch the side of
          the slots in the inner rotors and make contacts only with the
          shaft to which they are tightly screwed.&nbsp; The studs after
          fixing to the shaft should be tack welded to the shaft for
          better electrical continuity between the pair of studs
          occupying a common hole. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">The rotors butt at each other and their mating surfaces
          should be smoothly finished so as to avoid any air gap in
          between.&nbsp; Four numbers of through bolts of mild steel and
          with good magnetic permeability hold the two inner rotors
          together to avoid splitting of the inner rotors during
          high-speed rotation.&nbsp; After heat shrunk fitting on the
          shaft, the inner rotors may be tack welded to the shaft to
          provide rigid mechanical connection between the shaft and the
          inner rotors. </p>

          mounted in such a way that an air gap is left in between them
          for the current collecting system (to be described below) to
          pass through the air gap.&nbsp; The cross section of the end
          covers at the air gap and throughout should be not less than
          the cross section of the iron core.&nbsp; After assembly, the
          end covers are locked with suitable mild steel bolts (6)
          joining them with the respective inner rotors so as to avoid
          unscrewing the end covers during rotation. </p>

          rigidly mounted on the inner rotor when energized magnetizes
          the iron core and end covers, setting up in the core an axial
          magnetic field that has a return path through the end covers
          and passes through the air gap (28).&nbsp; The air gap should
          be just sufficient to accommodate the parts of the current

        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">The generation of voltage in the SPG is discussed in
          the writer’s article, "Space Power Generation" in <i>Explore!</i>
          3 (4): 62-65 (1992), and in other articles by the writer. In
          brief, the axial magnetic field B in the core during rotation
          of the inner rotors, electric coil and end covers, induces in
          the rotating studs dc voltage V<sub>1</sub> with respect to
          the shaft.&nbsp; The voltage is given by: </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">V<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 WBR<sup>2</sup> 10<sup>-4 </sup>(cgs




          units) </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">Where W is the angular rotational velocity, R is the
          radius of the inner rotor and B is the axial magnetic field
          strength in the inner rotor.&nbsp; In all the eight studs, V<sub>1</sub>
          is induced.&nbsp; The brush-assembly plate through sliding
          brushes is in contact with the inner ring jointed to the studs
          and therefore also has the voltage V<sub>1 </sub>on it. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">The outer ring passing through the air gap and being in
          rotation develops dc voltage V<sub>2</sub> with respect to the
          shaft, which is given by, </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">V<sub>2</sub> = B<sub>0</sub>W (R<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)10<sup>-4</sup>(cgs
units)





        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">Where B<sub>0</sub> is the magnetic field in the air
          gap, W is the angular velocity and R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>1</sub>
          are the outer and inner radii of the end covers. The dc
          voltage appearing on the rotating outer ring with respect to
          the shaft is given by V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub> </p>
        <div style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align:
          left;">. Thus the difference of dc potential between the two
          fixed brush-assemblies is V<sub>1</sub> - (V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub>),




          that is, V<sub>2 </sub>which is the open circuit dc terminal
          voltage of the SPG.
          <p>When load is connected between the terminals of the SPG,
            both the outgoing current and the return current pass
            through the air gap and also through the common holes in the
            inner rotor.&nbsp; The magnetic fields created by oppositely
            flowing load currents cancel each other to a good extent as
            the studs are closely spaced in the slotted holes.&nbsp; The
            outer ring (with radial slots) within the air gap has its
            current in a direction opposite to the current flowing in
            the brush-assembly plate in its close vicinity, and
            therefore appreciable nullification of magnetic effects
            takes place within the air gap also.&nbsp; In a conventional
            homopolar generator, unlike in the SPG, there is relative
            motion between the conductor and the magnetic field.&nbsp;
            Also, there is no nullification of the magnetic fields due
            to the outgoing and return load current, and hence the
            efficiency of the SPG is very high compared to a
            conventional homopolar generator. </p>
          <p>The dimensions in the drawings pertain to an existing SPG
            on which experiments have been conducted.&nbsp; However, if
            the diameter of the inner rotor is chosen to be nine inches
            and the electromagnet is excited to produce 1.6 Tesla in the
            iron core, the voltage developed between the terminals of
            the machine when it is run at 6000 rpm will be about six
            volts dc.&nbsp; Experiments show that the SPG produces
            steady dc current of about three kilo amperes at three volts
            dc with carbon-graphite brushes.&nbsp; The dc current
            produced at 6000 rpm will be about 6000 amps and therefore
            power produced by the SPG will be 36 kW at very high
            efficiency. </p>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b> </p>
            <p>Scientific debates on the nature of space (absolute
              vacuum) around the start of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
              took a general view that space serves to transmit fields
              (electromagnetic, gravitational) and, beyond that, it has
              no independent existence of its own as an entity that can
              generate energy in some form which enables it to be termed
              as a "real" physical entity. In other words, the generally
              accepted position then taken was that space is an empty
              extension of ""nothingness without any physical attributes
              in which fields are somehow transmitted at enormous speed.
              Many refutations to the above view both experimental and
              theoretical, and claims on the existence of ether, that
              is, space with physical attributes, could not provide an
              alternative theory so as to change the widely accepted
              position of the nonphysical nature of space. </p>
            <p>A search for the most basic and universal source of
              fields of matter in general, and electron in particular,
              has led to the formulation (by the writer) of space vortex
              theory (SVT) in which physical; space has been postulated
              (Ref. 1), and it has been shown that the primary function
              of space is to generate cosmic matter. Thus as per SVT,
              quite contrary to the modern view of physics, mater apart
              from space has no independent existence. </p>
            <p><b>Basics of Space Vortex Theory (SVT):</b> </p>
            <p>The absolute vacuum in SVT is a nonmaterial and mobile
              entity -- an incompressible, nonviscous, massless and
              continuous medium and its dynamical field equations or
              laws are formulated introducing the concept of velocity
              fields, that is, velocity of space points in a vortex of
              mobile space. An electron is postulated to be an
              irrotational vortex of space with a spherical central void
              of sub-microscopic radius of about 10<sup>-11</sup>
              centimeter, within which the space with physical
              attributes develops discontinuity of energy field (<b><a
                  href="#fign">Figure 1</a></b>). The property of
              electric charge of electron and its electrostatic field
              can be shown to be the effect of rotation of space around
              the electron’s center. The mass property of electron is
              seen to be arising due to the creation of a fieldless
              spherical void (hole) at the electron’s center where space
              rotates at the limiting speed of light. New equations that
              quantify mass and charge of electrons and enable the
              computation of energy for its creation and annihilation
              are derived. It also follows from the theory that the
              electron is the only fundamental particle that can build
              all the other stable particles of matter of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>The generation of mass of electron from the mass-less
              medium of space is the unique feature of SVT, as it does
              away with the normal trend of scientific convention that
              every conceivable entity must necessarily have mass if it
              has to be real, that is, if it has to possess energy. An
              irrotational vortex of space with maximum speed of
              rotation less than the speed of light will possess zero
              mass, and yet it will have electric charge due to velocity
              fields produced by space rotation. The creation of mass is
              essentially creation of void at electron’s center due to
              limiting speed of rotation and breakdown of space. The
              velocity field at a point in the neighborhood of electron
              determines the electric potential there. The breakdown of
              space at electron’s center gravitationally energizes the
              whole universe creating gravity field and gravity
              potential. The decrease in gravity potential at a space
              point due to oscillation/movement of electron/matter
              creates electromagnetic field (light) at that point. When
              an electron is annihilated, it is decaying gravity
              potential at each point in space that is seen as light. </p>
            <p>The property of zero viscosity and mobility of space up
              to the speed of light in combination with the central void
              of electron, results in inertia property of electron in
              its motion. The inertia property for all matter also
              arises due to the above effect since the electrons are the
              fundamental particles of all stable particles of matter. </p>

              void-vortex structure of the electron (Ref. 1) are
              relevant to the computation of rotational charge energy
              produced due to rotation of space in the interatomic
              region of a rotating electromagnet as shown in <b><a
                  href="#figo">Figure 2</a></b>. </p>
            <p>Refer to <b><a href="#fign">Figure 1</a></b>, which
              shows spin of space at void-space interface. At the
              elemental surface, tangential velocity of space is: </p>
            <p>wr<sub>e</sub>sin q, </p>
            <p>which increases to its limiting value c at the
              diametrical section of the interface. The basic
              definitions for electron's charge, rest-mass and
              dielectric constant for vacuum are: </p>
            <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<sub>e</sub> = (pi /4)(4pi r<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>c)






            </p>
            <p>where </p>
            <p>q<sub>e</sub> is the electron's charge </p>
            <p>r<sub>e</sub> is the radium of spherical void </p>
            <p>c is the light speed in vacuum. </p>
            <p>Hence, it follows that the dimensions of q<sub>e&nbsp;</sub>
              are: </p>
            <p>[q<sub>e</sub>] = L<sup>3</sup>/T </p>

            </p>
            <p>where m<sub>e </sub>is the electron's rest mass. </p>
            <p>Hence, it follows that the dimensions for mass m<sub>e </sub>are:






            </p>
            <p>[m<sub>e</sub>] = L<sup>4</sup>/T </p>
            <p>Dielectric constant for vacuum E<sub>o</sub> is given by

            <p>Dimensions for E<sub>o</sub>are: </p>

            <p>Substituting in Eq. (1) experimentally determined value,
              q<sub>e</sub> = 4.8 x 10<sup>-10</sup> CGSE units, and
              supposing the value of void radius r<sub>e</sub> = 10<sup>-11</sup>
              cm, </p>
            <p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cm<sup>3</sup>/s = (16) CGSE. </p>
            <p><b>Generation of Space Power:</b> </p>
            <p>As shown in <b><a href="#fign">Figure 1</a></b>, for
              computation of electron's charge at the interface, the
              product of speed of spinning space at the elemental
              surface and its area dA is taken. This indicates that for
              all values of VF varying from zero to c, charge is
              produced. Therefore rotation of cylindrical surface A of
              an iron core (<b><a href="#figo">Figure 2</a></b>) of an
              electromagnet will create in its interatomic space

              relationship as for electronic charge. Neglecting the area

            </p>
            <p>Energy in the electrostatic field of N<sub>e</sub>
              electrons is computed as below: </p>
            <p>Electrostatic energy (U) of a point-charge as per

            <p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U = [q<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>/2(4
              pi E<sub>o</sub>)][1/r]<sub>0</sub><sup>ºº</sup> </p>
            <p>where r, the radial distance from the charge center,
              varies from zero to infinity. With void-center of
              electron, the minimum value of r is taken as r<sub>e</sub>
              (and not zero) since void is a fieldless zone (The present
              difficulty in physics of infinite quantity of energy in
              the field of a point-charge is avoided with void-center
              structure of electron). </p>

            <p>The electric charge energy developed in any rotating body
              due to space rotation within the body is given to (10). If
              the body in rotation is an electrical conductor (iron,
              copper) then the orbital electrons of the atoms are
              liberated and will move under the action of a magnetic
              field to form electrical polarities (Ref. 2). </p>
            <p><b>Experimental Proof:</b> </p>
            <p>The above structure of the electron is substantiated
              through some recent experiments on electromagnetic
              induction. These experiments have brought to light a new
              phenomenon in which electromotive force is generated in an
              electrical conductor even if there is no relative motion
              between the conductor and the magnetic field which is
              unlike the principle behind the operation of modern
              electrical generators for which relative motion between
              the conductor and the magnetic field is a must. Further,
              the electrical power generation in the newly discovered
              phenomenon does not fully reflect in a proportionate
              increase of the input power, thereby giving an efficiency
              of more than unity, and revealing a new vital fact that
              absolute vacuum in the interatomic space of matter can
              generate electrical charge and power when it is set in a
              dynamic state. An experiment somewhat similar to above was
              done by Michael Faraday in the year 1830. He discovered
              the above phenomenon as regards the production of
              electromotive force even when the relative motion between
              the magnetic field and the conductor was zero. He,
              however, does not appear to have made measurements on the
              incremental power ratio from such a device. The writer
              first learned of this effect from Bruce DePalma’s letters
              (Ref. 5) to him (1978-79). DePalma made an extensive study
              of this effect and named it as N-effect. The experimental
              machines he built, he termed as N-generators. </p>
            <p>A series of tests on this unique phenomenon of space
              power generation have been carried out as outlined briefly
              in References 2, 3, and 4. The space power generator (SPG)
              shown in <b><a href="#figp">Figure 3</a></b>has produced
              efficiency of electrical power generation to more than
              250%, and precise test results on other models show that
              higher efficiencies for output currents in kiloamperes are
              possible. </p>
            <p><b>Conclusion:</b> </p>
            <p>Building of space power generators of about 100 kW size
              should be possible to be achieved with conventional
              technological methods in the near future. </p>
            <p>In addition to the discovery of a novel technology for
              power generation, the following crucial changes in the
              scientific and philosophical outlook that would be brought
              about with the new phenomenon of space power generation
              are: </p>
            <p>1) The fundamental state of universal energy is eternally
              latent in the dynamic space of the universe. </p>
            <p>2) The cosmic mater is generated from the energy of space
              in repeated cycles of creation and annihilation. </p>
            <p>3) Space is not an empty extension but rather the most
              fundamental entity which alone gives reality to the cosmic
              world. </p>
            <p>The present industrial culture demands a continually
              increasing growth of electrical power. Since the limited
              resources of thermal, hydroelectrical and nuclear power
              cannot last for centuries, the need that has now become
              vital is to discover a power source which is independent
              of all material resources, so that a regulated generation
              of power from the present known technologies is
              supplemented to a good extent from this eternal source. </p>
            <p>A technological breakthrough, which will enable
              generation of energy directly from space, is in the
              offing. Nature has, however, already achieved this
              conversion from space energy to matter in the generation
              of the cosmic matter of the universe (Ref. 3). </p>

            constitute the electrical output current with the magnetic
            field in the rotating iron rotor of the SPG is such that the
            effect described above takes place. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The mechanism of generation of
            continuous electrical power in the inter-atomic space
            (absolute vacuum) of the iron rotor was analyzed in the
            paper referred to above with the use of the fundamental
            equations of Space Vortex Theory which postulate non-viscous
            nature of space (<b><a href="#fig1a">Figure 1a</a></b>).
            Further tests on a SPG have revealed that it is the rotation
            of space within the rotor along with the source of magnetic
            field in it which shows a "reduced anti-torque" or
            "dragless" feature unlike the conventional generators. The
            paper discusses the fundamental physics of interaction of
            electrons with the magnetic field with the void vortex
            structure (Ref. 2) of electron as given in SVT (<b><a

          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Generation of Magnetic Field
              by Electron’s Motion Relative to Space:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In <b><a href="#figs">Figure 2</a></b>,
            a vortex ring is shown to have a preferred direction of
            rotation (Ref. 3) due to circulation around the vortex lines
            as shown in <b><a href="#figs">Figure 2b</a></b>. If the
            circulation around the top of the ring (<b><a href="#figs">Figure




                2c</a></b>) is extended to the bottom of the ring, there
            will be decrease of VF at D, and increase at C. Similarly,
            if the circulation from the bottom of the ring (<b><a
                href="#figs">Figure 2d</a></b>) is extended to the top
            of the ring, VF will decrease at A, and increase at B. The
            vortex ring therefore moves along the direction shown with
            increased VF at B and C with its clockwise spin when viewed
            along the direction of its motion. On similar reasoning it
            is concluded that the electron vortex (<b><a href="#figt">Figure




                3a</a></b>) will have a specific direction of motion
            along the positive direction of angular momentum vector. <br>

            (Ref. 2) and shown to be a reaction from space against the
            change in the magnitude of VF in the vortex of the electron
            when it is set in motion relative to space. The clockwise
            spin of VF in the direction of electron produces
            anti-clockwise concentric circles of magnetic field in an
            electron moving relative to space as shown in <b><a

            Two Volumes of Space Within &amp; Outside the Rotor:</b> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In <b><a href="#figv">Figure 4</a></b>,
          the interatomic space within the rotor of the SPG is shown
          under rotation. Since the electromagnets are mounted rigidly
          with the rotor, the magnet field lines (<b><a href="#figv">Figure





              4b</a></b>) shown confined within the rotor, also rotate
          with the rotor’s space, there being no relative motion between
          B and the rotor’s space. The rotation of the rotor produces an
          irrotational vortex and VF within the rotor. The VF of the
          irrotational vortex interacts with the atomic vortexes and
          releases conduction electrons from the iron atoms (Ref. 1). A
          free electron is imparted velocity v along a VF vector (<b><a
              href="#figv">Figure 4a</a></b>) and thus moving relative
          to the rotor’s space produce magnetic field B<sub>e</sub> as
          shown in <b><a href="#figt">Figure 3a</a></b>. The
          interaction of B and B<sub>e</sub> (<b><a href="#figt">Figure
              3b</a></b>) deflects the released electrons towards the
          center (<b><a href="#figv">Figure 4a</a></b>) under a radial
          force (B q<sub>e</sub> v) directing a dc voltage between the
          center and the periphery of the rotor. </p>
        <dl>
          The load current drawn from the rotor sets up a magnetic field
          within the rotor body due to its electron (

          ) that interacts with B. The force produced on each electron
          in the current results in a reaction on B and the source of B,
          i.e., the electromagnets that are rotating with the rotor’s
          space relative to which B is stationary. The reaction from the
          electrons of the current is thus taken by the rotating space
          of the rotor, and kept confined within it without transmission
          to the external static space.

          <p style="text-align: left;">In <b><a href="#figv">Figure 4c</a></b>,
            the electromagnets are separately mounted due to which B has
            relative motion with respect to the rotor’s space. The
            external space outside the rotor is now coupled through the
            magnetic field B with the rotor’s rotating space. The force
            experienced by the electrons of the current reacts on B, and
            on the external space in which the source of B is located.
            There is a force now through B on the electrons in the
            rotor’s rotating space in a direction opposite to the
            rotation and thereby creating an "anti-torque" or "drag" in
            direct proportion to the output power. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The "dragless" feature of the SPG
            is thus seen to be due to the electromagnet’s rotation with
            the rotor. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Tests on SPG:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The SPG shown in <b><a

                1c</a></b> was tested for incremental power ratio. Tests
            were taken at low speed of 2000 rpm since the brushes caused
            vibration at higher speeds giving improper contacts. The
            voltage buildup was however checked at the higher speed of
            4325 rpm, when 1440 mV was observed between the inner rotor
            surface and the shaft. The dc current input to the
            electromagnets mounted in the rotor remained constant from
            the no-load to the loaded condition of the SPG. The rise in
            the ac input power to the drive motor, from the no-load
            input and corresponding to the various dc electrical outputs
            was recorded. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">On the same shaft as the SPG, a
            Faraday disc motor (FM) was mounted with stationary
            electromagnets (<b><a href="#figq">Figure 1b</a></b>). As
            the output dc current from the SPG passed through the disc
            of the FM, due to the torque developed the rise in the ac
            input power to the drive motor was seen to reduce
            proportionately. The incremental power ratio was higher
            (about 7.26) with the FM mounted with the SPG, than the
            results obtained with the SPG alone (about 1.75 to 2.5). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">For all the above tests, an
            airgap in the outer rotor flux path of the SPG was
            maintained. An interesting phenomenon was noticed in which
            the dc voltage between the outer rotor surface and the shaft
            reduced to zero when the airgap was closed and an electrical
            continuity existed between the outer two halves of the rotor
            surfaces. The following is the likely explanation: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Consider the voltage buildup at
            the two halves of the outer rotor surface A in <b><a
                href="#figr">Figure 1c</a></b>. The electrons that
            become free due to rotation of the rotor are pushed radially
            out due to the interaction with the magnetic field from the
            surfaces A’ towards the surfaces A, thus making A negative
            relative to A’ and also B (The electrons are pushed radially
            down from B towards the shaft). Due to the airgap in the
            outer rotor, the electrons accumulated at surfaces A do not
            find return paths to A’, and therefore voltages are
            maintained there. If the two halves of the outer rotors are
            brought together by eliminating the airgap, the electrons at
            either o the surfaces A will find return paths to A’ through
            the other half f the outer rotor. The following pattern of
            flow of electrons will be established: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">1. Conduction electrons from
            surface A from either half of the rotor will flow through
            the other half to surfaces A’. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">2. Free electrons from surfaces
            A’ will travel towards surfaces A due to magnetic
            interaction. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Since the above two modes of
            electron flow are opposite in direction, the voltage buildup
            at the surfaces A cannot take place. It can similarly be
            shown that the electrons pushed towards the shaft from the
            surface B, will find return paths through the outer rotor
            surfaces A, thereby preventing any voltage buildup at B. The
            voltage between A and the shaft will be the difference of
            the voltages between B and shaft, and A and B. In the
            absence of voltage buildup at A and B, as discussed above,
            the voltage between A and the shaft will reduce to zero as
            experimentally observed. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Space Power Perpetual Machine:</b>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It should be possible to feed the
            electrical power generated in the inner core of the SPG
            through liquid metal contact brushes and rotating copper
            rings mounted on either half of the outer rotor of the SPG (<b><a
                href="#figw">Figure 5</a></b>) and into the outer rotor
            surfaces and develop torque in a Space Power Perpetual
            Machine (SPPM). The fixed electromagnets provide magnetic
            field for motor action that produces torque in the direction
            of rotation of the SPPM. The reduced airgap will decrease
            the power requirement to the electromagnets appreciably.
            Also, the penetration of the non-magnetic copper rods into
            the outer iron flux return paths and electrically insulated
            from it, should reduce drag on N-generators without the
            modification suggested above. The tests on SPPM are yet to
            be taken. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Introduction:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A cylindrical electromagnet,
            rotated on its axis, develops dc voltage between the axis
            and the periphery though there is no relative motion between
            the magnetic field in the core parallel to the axis and the
            iron conductor of the core. Refer to <b><a href="#figx">Figure




                1</a></b>. Faraday (Ref. 1) had discovered this effect
            by rotating together a permanent magnet and a copper disc
            integral with it. Bruce DePalma (Ref. 2) while carrying out
            the experiments on rotation of magnets independently
            discovered this phenomenon and named it "N-Effect".
            Development of the N-generator by DePalma, homopolar
            generator by Adam Trombley (Ref. 3) and Space Power
            Generator (SPG) by the writer operating at "overunity"
            efficiencies and in violation of the "Law of Conservation of
            Energy" in its existing form is based on this new system of
            rotating assembly of magnet and disc conductor, in which the
            magnetic field and the conductor have zero relative motion.
            It gets evident that there are more basic aspects to
            Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction than what has so
            far been recognized. <br>

          In , a conductor C is placed transverse to a magnetic field B
          from a magnet M. electromotive force (emf) is generated in C
          if it is moved as shown in the figure. Also if C is kept at
          rest and M is moved, emf is generated in C. In another case,
          if current is changed in a nearby conductor C’, the changing
          magnetic flux of C’ will induce an emf in C. In the above
          cases, there is either relative motion between C and B, and B
          thus cuts the conductor or there is a change in the magnetic
          field B’ of the nearby circuit conductor C’ and the changing
          field B’ interacts with C to produce emf. In SPG also the
          magnetic field is in contact with the rotating iron core
          conductor and emf is produced without relative motion between
          the conductor and the magnetic field. The common feature in
          all the above cases is that for the generation of emf in a
          conductor, interaction with the conductor of either steady
          magnetic field or changing magnetic field is essential.
          <p style="text-align: left;">An experiment with rotating
            electromagnet described below has, however, shown that emf
            can be induced within a rotating conductor even when it has
            no direct interaction with steady or changing magnetic
            field. With this experiment, a conclusive proof is had that
            the absolute vacuum (space) is the fundamental substratum of
            reality that can undergo magnetic induction and transmit the
            emf induced in it to the conductor rotating relative to it.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Experiment:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Refer to <b><a href="#figx">Figure





                1</a></b>. The magnetic circuit of a rotating
            electromagnet completes its path through static iron limbs
            on either side and the base. In the four slots cut in the
            cylindrical iron core, provision is made for non-magnetic
            stainless steel (ss) rods that are welded with the
            non-magnetic ss ring surrounding the core. The magnetic
            field produce by the dc current in the coil, which is
            integral with the core and rotates with it, does not pass
            through either the four slots or the rods mounted within the
            slots. When the assembly is rotated, the magnetic field
            remains confined to the core, air gaps on either side of the
            core, and the base. Measurements show however that the ss
            ring develops the same dc voltage as the cylindrical core’s
            surface on its periphery (although the ss ring and the rods
            are neither in contact with the periphery of the core nor
            have magnetic fields in them). Even when four thin slots are
            cut in the ss ring making the rods independent, the same
            voltage is induced in the ring. It is inferred that the zone
            in which voltage is induced in the rods is within the slots
            and since the magnetic field in the core surrounding the
            slots is a steady field due to dc current in the
            electromagnet’s coil, electromagnetic induction as
            conventionally understood cannot induce emf in the rods. The
            space surrounding the rods in the slots has to be a real
            medium that has to somehow generate emf in itself so as to
            transmit the same to the rods. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>"Static" &amp; "Dynamic" Space
              Substratum:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The effect of generation of emf
            in the above experiment can be explained by introducing
            "static" and "dynamic" aspects of space substratum as
            discussed elsewhere in the writer’s works (Ref. 4). The
            interatomic space within the iron core along with the "space
            vortices" that constitute the atoms of the iron core, the ss
            ring and the rods form one system of dynamic space that
            rotates relative to the static space. Within the iron core,
            however, the rotating space is super-imposed on the
            stationary space, and, therefore, the magnetic field there
            is common to both the rotating as well as the stationary
            spaces. As the space of the rotating iron due to rotation
            shifts along with its magnetic field, it leaves behind
            within the slots static space with magnetic field falling to
            zero there. This causes induction effect in the static space
            of the slots. The ss rods moving through the stationary
            space within the slots pick up the emf induced there and are
            thus raised to the same potential as the periphery of the
            core. If the space medium within the slots around the ss
            rods is considered an "emptiness", in the absence of any
            magnetic field there, no electromagnetic induction is
            possible and hence the ss ring cannot develop emf with
            steady magnetic field in the core contrary to experimental
            evidence. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Conclusion:</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The following conclusions are
            drawn from the above experiment: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A rotating electromagnet carried
            with it during rotation the magnetic field in interatomic
            space of the core produced due to the coil integrally
            mounted on the core of the electromagnet (as the source of
            the magnetic field [coil] rotates, the field also rotates
            with the source). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The steady magnetic field in the
            iron core in its transverse motion of rotation produces emf
            in the neighboring space (within the slots) due to
            electromagnetic induction of space caused when the magnetic
            field in the core shifts relative to the stationary space
            substratum in the slots. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The radial flow of load current
            in the electromagnet’s iron core and the magnetic field in
            the core transverse to this current, interact within the
            rotating pace system of the core which is independent of the
            external stationary space system. The resultant force
            between the current and the magnetic field is thus contained
            within the rotating space system and does not produce torque
            opposite to that of the prime mover that rotates the
            electromagnet. </p>
