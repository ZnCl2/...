      <br>
      <b>RELATED APPLICATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional
      patent application No. 61/960,752, filed Sep. 26, 2013, in the
      name of Paramahamsa Tewari, the disclosure of which is
      incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a rotating alternating
      current generator whose structural characteristic provide for a
      reduction in the amount force running counter to the rotation of
      the machine as a reaction to the induced alternating current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Michael Faraday discovered the principles of
      electromagnetic induction and invented the rotating electrical
      generator in 1832. The generator was known as the Unipolar
      Generator, Acyclic Generator and Disk Generator. This generator
      operated on the principle that voltage is induced in a conductor
      in relative motion to an external magnetic field. Moreover, when
      the conductor is configured as a closed circuit and is in relative
      motion with an external magnetic field, a current will be induced
      to flow through that circuit. The induced current itself will
      generate an induced magnetic field surrounding the conductor. The
      direction of the induced current is determined by Fleming's right
      hand rule which states that the magnetic field produced by the
      current induced in the conductor will repel the external magnetic
      field which induced the current in the conductor. As such, the
      induced magnetic field surrounding the conductor and the external
      magnetic field repel each other so as to create a torque on the
      conductor which counters that conductor's movement relative to the
      external magnetic field. Faraday's generator and all subsequent
      generators have in common the production of this counter or back
      torque.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The efficiency of an electrical generator is governed by
      mechanical and electrical limitations. The mechanical limitations
      include windage and friction of the generator's rotor and
      bearings. The electrical limitations include electrical impedance
      within the windings of the generator as well as the
      above-described counter or back torque.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A prime mover is attached to a generator so as to cause the
      rotation of the generator's rotor resulting in the production of
      either a direct or an alternating current within the generator's
      conductor and a back torque which counters the rotation caused by
      the prime mover. The prime mover may be powered by steam, wind or
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therefore, the problem with standard generators is that
      their efficiency is limited due to back torque generated as a
      result of current induced within the generator's conductor
      windings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] The following definitions are provided for convenience and
      are not to be taken as a limitation of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Fleming's Left Hand Rule refers to the effect that when a
      current flows in a conductor and an external magnetic field is
      applied across that current flow, the conductor will experience a
      force perpendicular to both the external magnetic field and the
      direction of the current flow. The Left Hand Rule can be used to
      represent three mutually orthogonal axes using the thumb to
      represent a mechanical force, the first finger to represent a
      magnetic field and the middle finger to represent the current,
      each finger positioned at right angles to each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Synchronous generator refers to an electrical generator
      which turns at the same speed as the drive mechanism, also known
      as the synchronous speed. A synchronous generator produces an
      alternating current and voltage at a frequency proportional to the
      rotation speed and to the number of excitation poles internal to
      the generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Asynchronous generator refers to an alternating current
      generator that uses the principles of induction to produce power.
      Asynchronous generators operate by mechanically turning their
      rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Low carbon steel refers to steel containing less carbon
      than other steels. This steel is inherently easier to cold-form
      due to its soft and ductile nature.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Grain oriented electrical steel refers to sheet steel used
      for laminations in power transformers having a silicon level of 3%
      or less.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] It is the primary purpose of the present invention to
      obviate the above problems by providing a reduced reaction
      rotating alternating current generator providing improvement in
      efficiency characteristics not currently available in standard
      alternating current generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] To accomplish this objective, according to one embodiment
      of the present invention a reduced reaction alternating current
      generator is disclosed comprising a hollow stator core having an
      axis comprised of longitudinally positioned sheets laminated with
      a high permeability magnetic material, the laminated sheets
      including longitudinally embedded slots in which a conductor
      winding is laid parallel to the axis, a cylindrical rotor
      concentric with and positioned inside the hollow stator core
      comprised of a high permeability magnetic material and a shaft
      coupled to the rotor and driven by an external source so as to
      freely rotate the rotor relative to the hollow stator core. The
      generator furthermore comprising a first set of magnets in which
      the south pole of each magnet is coupled to the surface to the
      rotor and the north pole of each magnet is facing the inner
      surface of the hollow stator core, a second set of magnets in
      which the north pole of each magnet is coupled to the surface of
      the rotor and the south pole of each magnet is facing the inner
      surface of the hollow stator core and a set of silicon steel
      pieces coupled to the outer surface of the rotor comprised of
      individual silicon steel pieces positioned adjacent to and
      longitudinally in line with each individual magnet within the
      first set of magnets and each individual magnet within the second
      set of magnets.<br>
      <br>

      advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0024] The present invention relates to a reduced reaction
      rotating alternating current generator providing improvement in
      efficiency characteristics not currently available in standard
      alternating current generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 1 depicts a longitudinal cross sectional view of a
      reduced reaction alternating current generator according to an
      exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown by FIG. 1,
      the induction machine 100 comprises a shaft 101, a rotor 102, a
      stator 103, a first set of magnets 104, a second set of magnets
      105 (not shown), a conductor winding 106 and silicon steel pieces
      107.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The rotor 102 is a cylinder of high permeability magnetic
      material attached directly to the shaft 101 using any conventional
      known method that provides for a secure and permanent bonding
      under normal operating conditions. The rotor 102 is sized to be
      fully encompassed within the stator 103 while the shaft 101 is
      sized to extend beyond at least one end of the stator 103.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The shaft 101 is mounted within the stator 103 so as to
      allow the shaft 101 and the attached rotor 102 to rotate freely
      within the stator 103 when the shaft 101 is driven by an external
      drive source. The external drive source is coupled to one end of
      the shaft 101 that extends beyond the stator 103. The external
      drive source may be driven either at a variable speed or at a
      synchronous speed. As such the drive source may be an alternating
      current (AC) based source or a direct current (DC) based source.
      The drive source may also be a non-electric based drive source
      such as a hydro, wind or an internal combustion based source. The
      means of coupling the drive source to the shaft 101 will be
      dependent on the type drive source and any conventional know means
      appropriate to the drive source type may be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In an exemplary embodiment, the shaft is two 30 mm diameter
      1018 steel, the rotor is 370 mm diameter 1018 steel and the stator
      has a 570 mm diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Provisions are made on the cylindrical surface of the rotor
      102 for the mounting of the first set magnets 104 and for the
      mounting of the second set of magnets 105 near each of the ends of
      the rotor 102. Provisions are also made for the mounting of the
      silicon steel pieces 107 on the rotor at positions near the center
      of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The first set of magnets 104 and the second set of magnets
      105 (not shown) are attached to the ends of the rotor 102 cylinder
      using any conventionally method known to provide for a secure and
      permanent bonding under normal operating conditions. Each end of
      the rotor 102 contains one of the first set of magnets 104 and one
      of the second set of magnets 105, for a total of four magnets. The
      first set of magnets 104 are oriented with their north poles
      facing the stator 103 and their south poles coupled to the rotor
      102. The second set of magnets 105 (not shown) are oriented with
      their south poles facing the stator 103 and their north poles
      coupled to the rotor 102. The magnets may be permanent magnets or
      electromagnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an exemplary embodiment, the permanent magnets are
      Neodymium magnets with a maximum energy product (BHmax) of 48 to
      50 MGOe. Moreover, in another exemplary embodiment the
      electromagnets are radial pole and are attached to the rotor in a
      manner generally known in the industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The silicon steel pieces 107 are also attached to the rotor
      102 using any conventionally method known to provide for a secure
      and permanent bonding under normal operating conditions. There is
      a single silicon steel piece 107 corresponding to each magnet of
      the first and second sets of magnets 104 attached to the rotor
      102. Each silicon steel piece 107 is positioned in line with its
      corresponding magnet leaving a predefined distance 109 between
      silicon steel piece and its corresponding magnet. Each silicon
      steel piece 107 is comprised of silicon steel which is a specialty
      steel tailored to have a small magnetic hysteresis area and high
      magnetic permeability. A high magnetic permeability is defined as
      having a magnetic saturation level above 1.8 Teslas.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second sets of
      magnets 104, 105 and the silicon steel pieces 107 are each sized
      to have approximately the same surface area and the distance 109
      between silicon steel piece and a corresponding magnet is no more
      than the length of the magnet in the axial plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The rotor 102 and the attached magnets 104, 105 and steel
      pieces 107 are each sized as to provide for an air-gap 108 of a
      predefined size between the outer surfaces of the attached magnets
      104, 105 and silicon steel pieces 107 and the inner surface of the
      stator 103. The air gap is sized to provide for the free rotation
      of the rotor 102 and the attached first and second sets of magnets
      104, 105 within the stator 103 as well as the efficient flow of
      magnetic flux into and out of the stator 103 across the air-gap
      108.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In an exemplary embodiment, the air-gap 108 is within a
      range of 3 mm to 10 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The stator 103 is composed of longitudinally placed silicon
      steel laminates having grains oriented along the path of the
      magnetic flux that enters and exits the stator 103. The stator 103
      also includes longitudinally oriented slots in which the conductor
      winding 106 is laid, the conductor winding 106 positioned such as
      to be cut through by the rotating magnetic flux originating from
      the first and second sets of magnets 104 attached to the rotating
      motor 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In an exemplary embodiment, the stator is comprised of a
      magnetically inert material, such as PVC piping, of suitable
      strength to support grain oriented steel lamination sheets.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an exemplary embodiment, the magnetic flux emanating
      from the first and second magnets is approximately 10,000 Gauss.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 2 depicts an end cross sectional view of a reduced
      reaction alternating current generator according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown by FIG. 2, the first
      set of magnets 104 with their north poles facing the stator 103
      and their south poles coupled to the rotor 102 are positioned at
      opposing in-line positions on one end of the rotor 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Similarly, the second set of magnets 105 with their south
      poles facing the stator 103 and their north poles coupled to the
      rotor 102 are positioned at opposing in-line positions on the same
      end of the rotor 102 at a ninety degree offset from the first set
      of magnets 104. An identical first set of magnets 104 and second
      set of magnets 105 are coupled to the other end of the rotor 102
      at similar positions.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 3 depicts a center cross sectional view of a reduced
      reaction alternating current generator according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown by FIG. 3, a single
      silicon steel piece 107 is positioned longitudinally in line with
      each magnet of the first and second sets of magnets 104, 105 (not
      shown). The position of each silicon steel piece 107 provides for
      a predefined distance 108 between a silicon steel piece 107 and
      its corresponding magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an exemplary embodiment, the distance between a silicon
      steel piece 107 and its corresponding magnet is equal to the
      longitudinal length of the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring again to FIG. 1, an electromagnetic force (EMF)
      is created across the conductor winding 106 embedded within the
      stator 103 when the magnetic flux emanating from the first set of
      magnets 104 and from the second set of magnets 105 cut through the
      conductor winding 106 as the rotor 102 rotates. Looking in the
      direction of arrow C in FIG. 1, with the rotor 102 turning in a
      clockwise direction and the magnetic flux emanating in a
      vertically upward direction from the north poles of the first set
      of magnets 104, the current generated as a result of the induced
      electromagnetic force will travel from left to right 110 within
      the conductor winding 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The current direction is as per Lenz's Law which states
      when an electric current is induced in a conductor, the direction
      of the induced current is such that its magnetic effect will
      oppose the action that gives rise to the induced current. As such,
      the direction of the induced current 110 results in a torque such
      as to oppose the clockwise rotation of the rotor 102.
      Specifically, looking in the direction of the arrow C in FIG. 1,
      the interaction between the counter-clockwise magnetic field
      surrounding the conductor as a result of the induced
      electromagnetic force and the upward magnetic flux emanating from
      the north poles first pair of magnets 104 will create a
      counter-clockwise torque opposing the clockwise rotation of the
      rotor 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 4 depicts a longitudinal cross sectional view of the
      flow of magnetic fields emanating from the first set of magnets
      within a reduced reaction generator according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown by FIG. 4, the
      magnetic flux 401 emanating from the north poles of the first set
      of magnets 104 travels vertically upward, across the air gap 108
      and into the stator 103 as the magnetic flux 401 rotates with the
      rotor 102 relative to the stator 103. As this rotating magnetic
      flux 401 enters the static stator 103, it cuts sideways across the
      conductor winding 106 embedded within the stator 103 and induces a
      current within the conductor winding 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Within the stator 103, a portion of magnetic flux 402 is
      now trapped within the grain stampings within the stator 103 and
      flows longitudinally in an effort to return to a corresponding
      south pole of the first set of magnets 104. This portion of the
      magnetic flux 402 is now static relative to the stator 103 and the
      embedded conductor winding 106. As such, this portion of the
      magnetic flux 402 flows through and exits the stator 103 without
      any sideways movement relative to the embedded conductor winding
      106 and therefore without inducing a current within the conductor
      winding 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Outside of the stator 103, a portion of the magnetic flux
      403 crosses the air gap 108 and reaches the surface of a
      corresponding steel piece 107. The steel piece 107 focuses the
      magnetic flux 403 within the air gap 108 providing a more
      efficient and specifically designed path for the magnetic flux 403
      to return to a corresponding first set of magnets 104. The
      magnetic flux 403 passes through the steel piece 107 and returns
      to a corresponding south pole of the first set of magnets 104
      thereby closing the magnetic flux loop between north and south
      poles of each magnet of the first set of magnets 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIGS. 5 and 6 depict the interaction between the magnetic
      flux originating from the north poles of the first set of magnets
      and the magnetic flux resulting from an induced current in the
      conductor winding according to an exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. In both FIGS. 5 and 6, the current 110 induced
      in the conductor winding 106 by the clockwise rotation of the
      rotor 102 is shown coming out of the page. Moreover, in accordance
      with the application of the right hand rule, the magnetic flux 501
      surrounding the conductor winding 106 as a result of the induced
      current 110 is shown as having a counter-clockwise rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In FIG. 5, the magnetic flux originating from the first set
      of magnets is shown traversing the air gap in an upward direction
      and interacting with the magnetic flux surrounding the conductor
      winding. As shown by FIG. 5, the magnetic field 401 originating
      from the first set of magnets 104 is strengthened on the right
      side of the conductor winding 106 due to the superimposition of
      the magnetic field 501 induced in the conductor winding 106 in the
      same direction. However, the magnetic field 401 origination from
      the first set of magnets 104 is weakened on the left side of the
      conductor winding 106 due to the superimposition of the magnetic
      field 501 induced in the conductor winding 106 in the opposite
      direction. As a result of this interaction, the net magnetic field
      in the air-gap 108 over the surfaces of the first set of magnets
      104 results in the application of a counter-clockwise torque 502
      to the rotor 102 which opposes the clockwise rotation of the rotor
      102. This is in accordance with Lenz's Law and is confirmed by the
      right hand rule which shows that a conductor within an upward
      directed magnetic field and carrying a current in the induced
      direction (coming out of the page) will experience a
      counter-clockwise force.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In FIG. 6, the portion of the magnetic flux that is routed
      back from the stator, downward across the air gap and through a
      silicon steel piece is shown interacting with the induced magnetic
      flux surrounding the conductor winding. As shown by FIG. 6, the
      magnetic field 403 routed down through the silicon steel piece 107
      is strengthened on the left side of the conductor winding 106 due
      to the superimposition of the magnetic field 501 induced in the
      conductor winding 106 in the same direction. However, the magnetic
      field 403 is weakened on the right side of the conductor winding
      106 due to the superimposition of the magnetic field 501 induced
      in the conductor winding 106 in the opposite direction. As a
      result, on the surface of the silicon steel piece 107, the
      magnetic field 403 develops a gradient from left to right thus
      creating a clockwise torque 602 which supports the clockwise
      rotation of the rotor 102. This is in accordance with Lenz's Law
      and is confirmed by the right hand rule which shows that a
      conductor winding 106 within a downward directed magnetic field
      403 and carrying a current 110 in the induced direction (coming
      out of the page) will experience a clockwise force.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Therefore, as a result of this configuration, the conductor
      winding 106 embedded within the stator 103 is cut at two places by
      each magnetic flux originating from the north pole of the first
      set of magnets 104. Specifically, a first time when the magnetic
      field 401 enters the stator 103 in an upward direction and a
      second time when the magnetic field 403 exits the stator 103 in a
      downward direction through a silicon steel piece 107. The net
      effect is that the clockwise torque generated by the magnetic
      field 403 rerouted through the silicon steel pieces 107 partially
      cancels the counter-clockwise torque generated by the magnetic
      field 401 originating from the north poles of the first set of
      magnets 104. This results in a partial nullification of the back
      torque reaction caused by the effect of Lenz's Law reaction and
      results in a corresponding increase in the efficiency of the
      machine because the external drive source has to supply less
      torque to overcome the reduced reaction of the machine.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 7 depicts a longitudinal cross sectional view of the
      flow of magnetic fields emanating from the second set of magnets
      within a reduced reaction generator according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown by FIG. 7, the
      magnetic flux 701 flowing into the south pole of the second set of
      the magnets 105 travels vertically downward from within the stator
      103 and across the air gap 108 as the magnetic flux 701 rotates
      with the rotor 102 relative to the stator 103. As this rotating
      magnetic flux 701 exits the static stator 103, it cuts sideways
      across the conductor winding 106 embedded within the stator 103
      and induces a current within that conductor winding 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Within the stator 103, a portion of the magnetic flux 702
      flows longitudinally along the grain stampings within the stator
      103 from a position where the magnetic flux 702 enters the stator
      103. This portion of the magnetic flux 702 is static relative to
      the stator 103 and to the conductor winding 106 embedded within
      the stator 103. As such, this portion of the magnetic flux 702
      enters and flows through the stator 103 without any sideways
      movement relative to the embedded conductor winding 106 and,
      therefore, without inducing a current within the conductor winding
      106.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Outside of the stator 103, a portion of the magnetic flux
      703 flows from a north pole of the second set of magnets 105,
      through a corresponding silicon steel piece 107, upward across the
      air gap 108 and into the stator 103. The silicon steel piece 107
      focuses the magnetic flux 703 within the air gap 108 providing a
      more efficient and specifically designed path for the magnetic
      flux 703 originating from a corresponding second set of magnets
      105. The magnetic flux 703 exists the steel piece 107 and enters
      the stator 103 thereby closing the magnetic flux loop between the
      south and north poles of each magnet of the second set of magnets
      105.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIGS. 8 and 9 depict the interaction between the magnetic
      flux originating from the south poles of the second set of magnets
      and the magnetic flux resulting from an induced current in the
      conductor winding according to an exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. In both FIGS. 8 and 9, the current 110 induced
      in the conductor winding 106 by the clockwise rotation of the
      rotor 102 is shown as going into the page. Moreover, in accordance
      with the application of the right hand rule, the magnetic flux 801
      surrounding the conductor winding 106 as a result of the induced
      current 110 is shown as having a clockwise rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In FIG. 8, the magnetic flux originating from the second
      set of magnets is shown traversing the air gap in a downward
      direction and interacting the magnetic flux surrounding the
      conductor winding. As shown by FIG. 8, the magnetic field 701
      originating from the second set of magnets 105 is strengthened on
      the right side of the conductor winding 106 due to the
      superimposition of the magnetic field 801 induced in the conductor
      winding 106 in the same direction. However, the magnetic field 701
      originating from the second set of magnets 105 is weakened on the
      left side of the conductor winding 106 due to the superimposition
      of the magnetic fields 801 induced in the conductor winding 106 in
      the opposite direction. As a result of this interaction, the net
      magnetic field in the air-gap over the surfaces of the second set
      of magnets 105 results in the application of a counter-clockwise
      torque 802 to the rotor 102 which opposes the clockwise rotation
      of the rotor 102. This is in accordance with Lenz's Law and is
      confirmed by the right hand rule which shows that a conductor
      within a downward directed magnetic field and carrying a current
      in the induced direction (going into the page) will experience a
      counter-clockwise force.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In FIG. 9, the portion of the magnetic flux originally
      routed through the steel pieces 107, across the air gap 108 and
      into the stator is shown interacting with the induced magnetic
      flux surrounding the conductor winding. As shown by FIG. 9, the
      magnetic field 703 routed upwardly through a steel piece 107 and
      across the air gap 108 is strengthened on the left side of the
      conductor winding 106 due to the superimposition of the magnetic
      field 801 induced in the conductor winding 106 in the same
      direction. However, the magnetic field 703 is weakened on the
      right side of the conductor winding 106 due to the superimposition
      of the magnetic field 801 induced in the conductor winding 106 in
      the opposite direction. As a result, on the surface of the silicon
      steel piece 107, the magnetic field 703 develops a gradient from
      left to right thus creating a clockwise torque 902 which supports
      the clockwise rotation of the rotor 102. This is in accordance
      with Lenz's law and is confirmed by the right hand rule which
      shows that a conductor winding 106 within an upward directed
      magnetic field 703 and carrying a current 110 in the induced
      direction (going into the page) will experience a clockwise force.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Therefore, as a result of this configuration and as
      described above for the first set of magnets, the conductor
      embedded within the stator is cut at two places by each magnetic
      field terminating at the south pole of the second set of magnets.
      Specifically, a first time when the magnetic field 701 exits the
      stator 103 in a downward direction and a second time when the
      magnetic field 703 enters the stator 103 in an upward direction
      through a silicon steel piece 107. The net effect is that the
      clockwise torque generated by the magnetic field 703 rerouted
      through the silicon steel pieces 107 partially cancels the
      counter-clockwise torque generated by the magnetic field 701
      terminating at the south pole of the second set of magnets 105.
      This results in a partial nullification of the back torque
      reaction caused by the effect of Lenz's Law reaction and results
      in a corresponding increase in the efficiency of the machine
      because the external drive source has to supply less torque to
      overcome the reduced reaction of the machine.<br>
