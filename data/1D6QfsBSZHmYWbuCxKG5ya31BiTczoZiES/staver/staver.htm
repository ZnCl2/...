      <p class="text">COGAN STATION — “American Inventor,” a popular ABC
        television show, aired its second season finale this week, but
        area residents may not know that there are inventors right here
        in Williamsport and the surrounding areas. </p>
      <p>Blaine Staver, of Cogan Station may be on to something with his
        invention, the automatic gear ratio reduction system, a new type
        of highly efficient transmission. </p>
      <p>Staver is working with the Williamsport-Lycoming Keystone
        Innovation Zone to get his invention into the hands of people
        who can help him. </p>
      <p>Staver worked on his own to secure a patent for the invention,
        which acts as a highly efficient transmission by supplying the
        perfect amount of power needed in any situation. </p>
      <p>“It can go as fast or as slow as you as want it to, and it does
        it with the least amount of energy that is needed,” Staver
        explained. </p>
      <p>Staver said gear systems in cars today work with hydraulics and
        his new invention does not need them. </p>
      <p>Currently, he only has one demonstration model, and he showed
        the Sun-Gazette the gear system had enough strength to pull the
        weight of a car, only using a cordless drill as a power source.
      </p>
      <p>Staver said he is marketing to the lawn tractor and mower
        industry, hopefully providing them with a more efficient
        transmission for those machines. </p>
      <p>Staver said he hopes it changes the way people see
        transmissions and wants to see his invention in cars and trucks
        someday. </p>
      <p>“If this invention acted as a transmission in cars, it would
        greatly increase fuel economy and decrease the nation’s
        dependency on foreign oil,” Staver said. </p>
      <p>But Staver, isn’t the only inventor to hail from the area. </p>
      <p>Katie Bell of the Keystone Innovation Zone, who works with both
        Staver and many other clients, said she is currently working
        with over 60 inventors and start-up companies and said she
        encourages them to all evaluate whether a patent is worthwhile
        or feasible regarding their specific concepts. </p>
      <p>“Depending on the concept it may or may not benefit an
        individual to pursue a patent,” Bell said. </p>
      <p>“For example, Coca-Cola’s recipe is a trade secret — something
        they keep secret within their company. They did not patent the
        recipe because in 20 years the patent would have expired and
        anyone could have reproduced Coke exactly,” Bell added. </p>
      <p>Bell said it can take up to two years or even longer to get a
        patent. “This depends on if claims are ‘rejected’ and need to be
        re-written or adjusted,” she said. </p>
      <p>Patents are received through the United States Patent and
        Trademark Office. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A system for automatically lowering an effective gear ratio
        between an input gear, driven by a rotary power source, and an
        output gear that drives a driven load. A variance gear is
        interposed coaxially between the input gear and output gear. The
        input gear normally drives the output gear through an upper
        motion transfer gear, an upper variance gear, a lower variance
        gear, and a lower motion transfer gear. When resistance to
        rotation is presented to the output gear the upper and lower
        variance gear begin planetary motion around the lower motion
        transfer gear, rotate the lower motion transfer gear and output
        gear more slowly, and thereby lower the effective gear ratio
        between the input and output gears. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to an automatic gear ratio reduction
        system. In particular, the invention relates to a system that
        automatically adjusts a gear ratio between a drive source and a
        driven load sufficiently to maintain rotation of the driven
        load, in accordance with the resistance to rotation presented by
        the load. </p>
      <p>A rotary power source, such as a motor, is generally not
        coupled directly with a load. Typically the motor has an
        operating rotational speed and torque. It is rare that this
        rotational speed is directly matched with the requirements of
        the load. For a given power, rotational speed and torque are
        inversely proportional. Thus, Accordingly, various transmission
        systems are employed to either reduce or increase the ratio
        between speed and torque to achieve a compromise, which best
        suits the load. </p>
      <p>Many applications, however, will vary the torque/rotational
        speed requirements under different operating conditions. For
        example, an automobile initially begins motion with low
        rotational speed of the tires, but supplies high torque to the
        tires that allows the automobile to accelerate to a higher speed
        of travel. When the automobile reaches its cruising speed, the
        tires must be rotated at a higher speed, while less torque is
        necessary to accelerate the automobile. Accordingly, automobile
        transmissions have several gear ratios. The lowest gears are
        suitable for lower travel speeds and for a greater ability to
        accelerate, while the highest gears are suitable for cruising at
        higher speeds while keeping the engine within its designed range
        of rotational speed. Naturally, less torque and thereby less
        ability to accelerate is available when using the highest gears.
        Generally, automobiles have three to six fixed gear ratios
        between the engine and the `final drive`. Picking one of the
        gear ratios requires `shifting gears`, either manually, or
        through an automatic mechanism. </p>
      <p>In addition, common power tools undergo a similar battle for
        torque and rotational speed. A drill, for example, will commonly
        rotate at a high speed while it travels with little resistance
        through a workpiece. At times, however, the drill bit will
        encounter considerable resistance, which has a tendency to stall
        the drill. A stalled electric drill motor will draw considerable
        current, may overheat, and will shorten the useful life of the
        motor. Ordinarily, a drill stall causes the worker to halt
        working to prevent damaging the drill. </p>
      <p>Various transmissions have been proposed which seek to allow
        the gear ratio to be altered continuously. So-called
        `continuously variable transmissions` supposedly allow infinite
        gear ratios to be achieved within a range. Such systems however,
        generally rely on belts, selective friction, and slippage, which
        thereby greatly decrease their efficiency and useful life. </p>
      <p>While these units may be suitable for the particular purpose
        employed, or for general use, they would not be as suitable for
        the purposes of the present invention as disclosed hereafter. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the invention to provide a gear ratio
        adjustment system that automatically adjusts the gearing ratio
        to achieve the necessary torque to maintain rotational motion at
        the load. Accordingly, the system reacts in response to
        increased resistance at the load to lower the gear ratio,
        increase the torque at the load, and thereby maintain motion. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the invention to provide a gear ratio
        adjustment system which substantially operates using gears in
        mesh, and does not require `shifting of gears` or otherwise
        altering the arrangement of gears in mesh to achieve different
        gear ratios. Accordingly, the system effectively lowers the gear
        ratio while all gears remain in mesh. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a gear ratio
        adjustment system, which quickly adapts to changes in resistance
        upon the output gear, without stopping motion. Accordingly, the
        configuration of gears according to the present invention
        according to a primary embodiment employs an input/output gear
        set that allows the gear ratio to be lowered by the automatic
        commencement of planetary motion of the lower variance
        determining gear around the lower motion transfer gear mounted
        radially off center on a variance gear coaxial with the input
        and output gears, to compensate for the increased resistance at
        the output gear, wherein the lower variance gear is in part
        rotating the output gear through the lower motion transfer gear
        and in part orbiting around the lower motion transfer gear. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a gear
        ratio adjustment system, which allows continuous gear ratios to
        be achieved. Accordingly, the amount of resistance presented to
        the output gear will vary the degree to which the lower variance
        determining gear directly turns the lower motion transfer gear
        and the degree to which the lower variance determining gear
        revolves around the lower motion transfer gear. The partial
        direct rotation of the lower variance determining gear and
        revolution around the lower motion transfer gear by the lower
        variance determining gear will depend on the amount of
        resistance and will thereby achieve a `comfortable` gear ratio
        by which rotation may continue. </p>
      <p>It is a still further object of the invention to help ensure
        that the lower gear ratio associated with planetary motion only
        occurs when the resistance to rotation renders it necessary to
        lower the gear ratio. Accordingly, pressure can be applied to
        the variance gear of the input/output gear set to help ensure to
        increase the resistance necessary to begin lowering the
        effective gear ratio between the input and output gear set. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of the invention to provide a feedback
        loop which automatically increases the range of gear ratios
        achievable by the system. Accordingly, a variance control gear
        set is provided which is a substantial clone of the input/output
        gear set, except wherein the input gear is known as a speed gear
        which is driven by the output gear of the input/output gear set;
        and the output gear is a control gear which drives the variance
        gear of the input/output gear set. </p>
      <p>To the accomplishment of the above and related objects the
        invention may be embodied in the form illustrated in the
        accompanying drawings. Attention is called to the fact, however,
        that the drawings are illustrative only. Variations are
        contemplated as being part of the invention, limited only by the
        scope of the claims. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1-5 illustrate a first embodiment of the automatic gear
        reduction system according to the present invention 10. In
        particular, an input/output gear set 20 is illustrated. The
        input/output gear set 20 can function as a stand-alone
        embodiment of the invention, or can be used as a building block
        in a further embodiment of the invention, described below,
        wherein further feedback is implemented to more efficiently
        control the automatic gear reduction of the input/output gear
        set 20--which will be described in further detail below. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of the following discussion, "shaft drives" or
        "shaft driven" means that two components are mounted on the same
        axis and linked by a shaft therebetween so that both components
        rotate together. Further "mesh drives" or "mesh driven" means
        that two components are tangentially engaged at their respective
        circumferences either frictionally or with gear teeth so that
        they rotate together. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, the input/output gear set 20 has a central
        axis 20C, and has an input gear 22 and output gear 24 coaxially
        mounted on the central axis 20C but not connected thereon. The
        central axis 20C contains a series of shafts and bearings, such
        that various gears and spacers coaxially mounted on the central
        axis do not rotate together. With the interconnection and lack
        of connection of the gears described in detail hereinbelow,
        specific details regarding the shafts, bearings, and spacers for
        mounting of such gears is well within the knowledge of those
        skilled in the art--yet is to a large extent illustrated in the
        drawing figures. Accordingly, full details regarding the same
        are beyond the scope of this discussion. </p>
      <p>The input gear 22 is driven by a rotary drive power source 12,
        which includes a motor 13, and the output gear 24 drives a load
        14, which by example herein includes a drill bit 15. In typical
        fixed gearing arrangements, the torque supplied to the output
        gear 24, and thus the load 14 is fixed. As will be illustrated
        herein, however, additional torque will be supplied, by lowering
        the effective gear ratio between the input gear 22 and output
        gear 24 when resistance to the output gear 24 from the load 14
        would otherwise stall the output gear 24, and thus the input
        gear 22 and rotary drive power source 12. A variance gear 26
        forms a part of the input/output gear set 20, and allows control
        over conditions under which the input/output gear set 20 lower
        the gear ratio between the input 22 and output gear 24. The
        variance gear 26 can be controlled by a variance gear control
        16, which is diagrammatically illustrated in FIG. 1, and will be
        the subject of further discussion and further examples
        subsequent to the complete discussion of the input/output gear
        set 20. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 illustrates ganging of various gears of the input/output
        gear set 20. In particular, an input gear assembly 23 includes
        the input gear 22 and upper motion transfer gear 28, which are
        both coaxial with the central axis 20C and mechanically ganged
        such that the upper motion transfer gear 28 is shaft driven by
        the input gear 22. An output gear assembly 25 includes the
        output gear 24 and a lower motion transfer gear 30, which are
        both coaxial with the central axis 20C and mechanically ganged
        such that the output gear 24 is shaft driven by the lower motion
        transfer gear. Accordingly, the input gear assembly 23 and
        output gear assembly 25 are coaxial on the central axis 20C, but
        are not mechanically ganged, and thus do not rotate together. </p>
      <p>A middle motion transfer assembly 27 includes the variance gear
        26, a upper variance determining gear 32, a lower determining
        variance gear 34, and a xx plate 35. The variance gear 26 and
        the xx plate 35 are coaxially mounted on the central axis 20C
        with the input gear assembly 23 and output gear assembly 25. The
        upper variance determining gear 32 and lower variance
        determining gear 34 are located on a variance determining gear
        axis 36 that is not coaxial with the input gear assembly 23 and
        output gear assembly 25 but is located radially outward on the
        variance gear 26 on a variance determining gear shaft 33. In
        particular, the variance determining gear shaft 33 extends
        between the variance gear 26 and the xx plate, parallel to the
        central axis 20C. The upper variance gear 32 and lower variance
        gear 34 are coaxial with each other and are ganged for rotation
        together on the variance determining gear axis 36 with the
        variance determining gear shaft 33. The variance gear 26 and the
        xx plate 35 are further connected by a post 39 extending
        parallel to the central axis 20C to stabilize the middle motion
        transfer assembly 27 into a single `piece` that can selectively
        rotate together around the central axis 20C although during
        typical operation the variance gear 26 remains stationary. </p>
      <p>Now, referring to FIG. 3, the upper motion transfer gear 28 is
        in mesh with the upper variance determining gear 32, and the
        lower variance determining gear 34 is in mesh with the lower
        motion transfer gear 30. However, the upper motion transfer gear
        28 and lower motion transfer gear 30 are not mechanically linked
        such that they do directly drive each other or rotate together.
        Accordingly, during typical operation, the input gear 22 shaft
        drives the upper motion transfer gear 28, the upper motion
        transfer gear 28 mesh drives the upper variance determining gear
        32; the upper variance determining gear 32 shaft drives the
        lower variance determining gear 34; the lower variance gear 34
        mesh drives the lower motion transfer gear; and the lower motion
        transfer gear 30 shaft drives the output gear 24. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 illustrates the assembled device 10 during typical
        operation. Note that an additional transfer plate 35A, omitted
        for clarity in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, is mounted substantially
        parallel with transfer plate 35, immediately beneath the
        variance gear 26 to stabilize the middle motion transport
        assembly 27, and similarly rotates therewith. </p>
      <p>During such typical operation, the input gear 22 and output
        gear 24 rotate in the same direction, the drive source 12
        rotates the input gear 22, the lower variance determining gear
        34 rotates the lower motion transfer gear 30 to rotate the
        output gear 24 and thereby rotate driven load 14. Accordingly,
        the output gear 24 is rotated at a relatively high rate of speed
        and there is a relatively high gear ratio between the input gear
        22 and output gear 24. During such typical operation, the
        variance gear 26 and plate 35 is substantially stationary as
        motion of the lower variance determining gear 34 is
        substantially transferred to the lower motion transfer gear 30
        through direct meshed rotation. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 5, however, when resistance is placed on the
        output gear 24 by the driven load 14, tension occurs at the
        interface of the lower motion transfer gear 30 and lower
        variance determining gear 34, which causes the lower variance
        determining gear 34 to revolve or orbit around the lower motion
        transfer gear 39, causing the variance gear 26 to rotate, such
        that the variance gear axis 36 rotates around the central axis
        20C (in the same direction as the input gear 22 and output gear
        24). At this point, motion of the lower variance determining
        gear will be partially translated to direct rotation of the
        lower motion transfer gear, albeit with greater leverage due to
        rotation around the central axis 20C; and partially translated
        to orbital motion around the lower motion transfer gear 30.
        Accordingly, the input gear will continue rotating, and the
        drive source 13 will not be unduly taxed. In addition, to the
        extent possible, the lower motion transfer gear 30 and thus the
        output gear 24 will still rotate--although at a lower speed but
        with greater torque being delivered to the driven load 14. An
        equilibrium point (speed) will be reached by which the lower
        variance determining gear 34 rotates the output gear 24 to the
        extent possible, and revolves around the lower motion transfer
        gear 30 as well. Accordingly, a input gear 22 to output gear 24
        overall gear ratio will be achieved at which motion of the
        output gear 24 will continue. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, as the resistance is increased, the motion of the
        variance gear axis 36 around the central axis 20C will increase.
        This is because the upper and lower variance gears 32, 34 are on
        a common axis and must rotate together, yet the upper motion
        transfer gear 28 (see FIG. 3) are also in mesh but are at
        different but complementary gear ratios so that the lower
        variance gear 34 will begin revolving around the lower motion
        transfer gear 30 to maintain rotation. </p>
      <p>To facilitate the actual reduction in gear ratio, rather than a
        simple planetary cavitation of the lower variance determining
        gear 34 around the output gear, the ratio between the upper
        motion transfer gear 28 and upper variance determining gear 32
        is preferably equal to the ratio between the lower variance
        determining gear 34 and the lower motion transfer gear 30. See
        FIG. 3, where the motion transfer gears 28, 30 and the variance
        determining gears 32 and 34 are clearly "reversed"--i.e. large
        upper motion transfer gear 28 and lower variance determining
        gear 34, and small lower motion transfer gear 30 and upper
        variance determining gear 32. This relationship helps the
        input/output gear set 20 "find" an equilibrium overall gear
        ratio to help maximize the maintenance of speed at the output
        gear 24 when encountering resistance thereat. </p>
      <p>Naturally when the middle motion transfer assembly 27 is in
        planetary motion, the lower motion transfer gear 30 will rotate
        more slowly--subtracting the planetary motion of the lower
        variance gear therearound. The input gear 22 will continue to
        rotate at the same speed--however by virtue of the planetary
        motion, lower speed and greater torque will be imparted to the
        lower motion transfer gear 30, and thus the output gear 24.
        Accordingly, a lower gear ratio between the input gear 22 and
        output gear 24 will be automatically achieved upon the output
        gear 24 encountering sufficient resistance. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of the "sufficient resistance" necessary to begin
        such planetary motion can be further controlled with the
        variance gear, by giving it a tendency against planetary motion.
        This can be accomplished by restraining the variance gear 26
        with the auxiliary variance gear control assembly 16 shown in
        FIGS. 1-5, or by actually rotating the variance gear 26 in the
        opposite direction as the input gear 22 and output gear 24.
        Restraint of the variance gear 26 can be accomplished with
        magnetism, friction, or any other means well known to those
        skilled in the art. In addition, a feedback loop can be
        established to help maximize the efficiency of the device 10 by
        maximizing the speed achievable at a given resistance. Such can
        be achieved by externally rotating the variance gear can be
        accomplished with a variance control gear set 50, illustrated in
        FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>In particular, the variance control gear set 50 which is
        analogous in structure to the input/output gear set 20, such
        that the variance control gear set 50 has a substantially
        identical structure as the input/output gear set 20 except that
        its components are spaced along its central axis 50C in a
        slightly different manner, and the variance control gear set 50
        herein is illustrated upside down for convenience of appropriate
        interconnection with the input/output gear set 20. Regarding
        nomenclature, the variance control gear set 50 has a speed gear
        62 which is analogous to the input gear 22 of the input/output
        gear set 20, and it has a variance control gear 64 which is
        analogous to the output gear 24 of the input/output gear set 20.
      </p>
      <p>The variance control gear set 50 effectively provides a
        feedback loop between the output gear 24 and variance gear 26 of
        the input/output gear set 20. Accordingly, the speed gear 62 of
        the variance control gear set 50 is connected to be rotate with
        the output gear 24 of the input/output gear set 20; and the
        variance control gear 64 connected to rotate the variance gear
        26 of the input/output gear set. The result is that the output
        gear 24 rotates the speed gear 62. The speed gear 62 causes the
        variance control gear 64 to following the same principles by
        which both the input gear 22 and output gear 24 of the
        input/output gear set rotate together. The variance control gear
        64 attempts to rotate the variance gear 26 of the input/output
        gear set 20 in the opposite direction as its input gear 22 and
        output gear 24. Accordingly, the middle motion transfer assembly
        27 is given a `reverse incentive` to rotate and lower the gear
        ratio. Thus, rotational speed is actually increased at the
        output gear 24, the gear ratio between the input gear 22 and
        output gear 24 is increased, and the sensitivity of the middle
        motion transfer assembly toward beginning planetary motion in
        the face of "some resistance" at the output gear is lowered.
        Accordingly, the effective range of gear ratios achievable
        between the input and output gear 24 increased, such that more
        than just "a little resistance" at the output gear is required
        before planetary motion is initiated to lower the effective gear
        ratio between the input and output gears 22, 24. </p>
      <p>Note that the system may grow modularly by the additional of
        further variance control gear sets 50. In addition, auxiliary
        variance control gears 70 may be employed to engage the
        analogous variance gear 26A of the variance control gear set 50
        to further tune the "sensitivity" toward changing gear ratios
        between the input gear 22 and output gear 24 of the input/output
        gear set 20. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, herein is provided a system for automatically
        achieving an idealized gear ratio, by lowering the overall gear
        ratio between a rotary drive source and an output load to
        maintain motion at the output load when resistance is
        encountered thereat. The invention is illustrated by example in
        the foregoing description and in the accompanying drawings.
        Numerous variations, however, are possible while adhering to the
        invention concept. Such variations are contemplated as being a
        part of the present invention. </p>
