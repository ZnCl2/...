      Xergy’s technology for a new class of clean, green compressor for
      refrigeration and cooling (code named <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Kuel-cell</span> ) is potentially transformational and
      disruptive for the conventional refrigeration industry. It uses
      stable and well-understood technology from the Fuel-cell industry,
      in a novel fashion that simply requires electricity to produce
      refrigeration without the need for motors or CFC refrigerants.
      Devices utilizing such technology could be deployed in any number
      of commercial, residential and automotive applications in a
      cost-effective, efficient and environmentally-friendly manner.<br>
      <br>
      Xergy’s green refrigeration technology devices would produce
      small-volume, lightly pressurized hydrogen from electricity, in a
      sealed unit to drive a motor-less, non-CFC refrigeration cycle. It
      leverages existing proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) technology, and
      hydrogen’s excellent thermodynamic characteristics and ability to
      co-exist with other fluids, to create a refrigeration-cycle. Xergy
      refers to this refrigeration approach as Electro-chemical (EC)<br>
      <br>
      An electrochemical (EC) compressor and heat pump system includes
      an EC cell and a mixed gas refrigerant-based cooling system. The
      EC cell is capable of producing high pressure hydrogen gas from a
      mixed fluid system including an electrochemically-active component
      such as hydrogen and at least one refrigerant fluid. The cooling
      system can include a condenser, compressor, and evaporator in
      thermal communication with an object to be cooled. Hydrogen gas is
      pressurized across the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The hydrogen gas enters a gas space, where it is compressed into a
      vapor refrigerant. As the vapor refrigerant is compressed, it is
      forced through the condenser where the refrigerant is liquefied.
      The liquid refrigerant then passes through the evaporator where
      the liquid refrigerant is evaporated by absorbing heat from the
      object to be cooled. The mixed fluids then enter the EC cell where
      hydrogen is pressurized again.<br>
      The core technology in the device is a PFSA membrane as the
      compressor component in a typical 4-stage refrigeration cycle
      system. The surface being cooled will act as an evaporator
      component. A micro-machined orifice in the device will act as a
      refrigeration-cycle expansion valve. Condensation will occur above
      the PFSA membrane surface, on a heat exchanger surface elsewhere
      in the device (see Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      Heat absorption: Cool Liquid mixture + hydrogen gas circulate
      internally at the interface between the item to be cooled and the
      device itself (and absorb heat).<br>
      <br>
      Compression: Above, the membrane and electrode assembly absorbs
      the liquid and hydrogen gas and transports them both to the other
      side, pressurizing the mixture. The pressure of Hydrogen gas is
      several PSI above atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Condensation: The slightly pressurized fluids release energy to
      the environment at a higher rate than the surface of the heat
      absorption region, in a high surface-area, heat exchanger.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Expansion: The slightly pressurized Gas/Liquid fluid mixture is
      conveyed through an orifice where it expands and cools down with
      higher liquid content.<br>
      <br>
      ElectroChemical Compression ...<br>

      Xergy Inc. a high technology company based in Georgetown Delaware
      is proud to announce that it has been selected as one of five
      winners of GE’s ecomagination global innovation award.<br>
      <br>
      GE is driving a global energy transformation with a focus on
      innovation and R&amp;D investment to accelerate the development
      and deployment of clean energy technology. Since its inception in
      2005, 110 ecomagination-approved products have been brought to
      market with revenues reaching $18 billion in 2010. The company
      will invest $10 billion in R&amp;D over five years and double
      operational energy efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas
      emissions and water consumption. As part of the initiative, GE
      launched “GE ecomagination Challenge: Powering the Grid”, a $200
      million financial commitment challenging innovators to join in
      developing clean energy technologies. It is extending this
      Challenge with the “GE ecomagination Challenge: Powering Your
      Home,” to develop technologies that help households manage their
      energy usage. For more information, visit the ecomagination
      website at http://ge.ecomagination.com/index.html.<br>
      <br>
      Bamdad Bahar, co-founder and inventor of Xergy’s technology
      visited New York on June 24rd to formally receive the award with
      co-founder Richard L. Williams. Bamdad made the following
      statement to industry media during the internationally televised
      event:<br>
      <br>
      “I am very proud of our team, and GE’s recognition of our hard
      work. This has been a very long process for us of quietly doing
      our work while operating our other businesses. Quite frankly
      without an incredible business community in Delaware, it would
      have been impossible to get this far. First of all Delaware is
      home to the global leaders in the solid state ion exchange
      membrane technology with Dupont, Gore, and Ion-Power all based
      there. Secondly, it is also home to the University of Delaware
      that has one of the leading Chemical Engineering Departments in
      the world. It is astounding that we were able to access renowned
      Professors like Stanley Sandler with a simple phone call and ended
      up very quickly conducting very complex thermodynamic modeling
      that supported our development. It is important to note too, that
      without the opportunities afforded to us by many local companies
      such as Perdue Farms, who strongly believe in supporting local
      communities, we simply would not have been able to devote the
      resources to bring our inventions to this stage. The Delaware
      Economic Development Office was instrumental in assisting us with
      permitting for our labs; and our local community bank, County Bank
      of Rehoboth has been pivotal with further assistance to accelerate
      our programs. In truth, this really is a tribute not to us, but to
      the whole commercial infrastructure in Delaware. We hope to be
      able to place Delaware on the leading edge of a new global
      industrial revolution creating a sustainable future for our planet
      and transforming how the world creates, connects to and uses
      energy.”<br>
      <br>
      Xergy Inc was founded in 2009 to commercialize a series of patents
      based on “electrochemical compression” to launch a new class of
      clean, green compressors for the refrigeration and cooling
      industry. Xergy’s technology is based on utilizing <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">electrochemical compression of clean
        non-GHG (non-Green-House-Gas) depleting refrigerants. This
        technology provides for highly-efficient, noiseless, vibration
        free, modular and scalable Cooling Systems</span>. This
      technology is potentially transformational and disruptive for the
      conventional refrigeration industry. It uses stable and
      well-understood technology from the Fuel-cell industry in a novel
      fashion that simply uses electricity to produce refrigeration
      without the need for motors or polluting refrigerants. Devices
      utilizing this technology could be deployed in any number of
      commercial, residential and automotive applications in a
      cost-effective, efficient and planet-friendly manner. It leverages
      existing <span style="font-weight: bold;">proton-exchange-membrane</span>
      technology with hydrogen’s excellent thermodynamic characteristics
      and ability to co-exist with other fluids, to operate a clean and
      efficient refrigeration cycle.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> TECHNICAL FIELD</span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The disclosed subject matter relates to a self-contained
      heat transfer system having an electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The function of both heat transfer systems such as
      refrigeration cycles and heat pumps is to remove heat from a heat
      source or reservoir at low temperature and to reject the heat to a
      heat sink or reservoir at high temperature. While many
      thermodynamic effects have been exploited in the development of
      heat pumps and refrigeration cycles, the most popular today is the
      vapor compression approach. This approach is sometimes called
      mechanical refrigeration because a mechanical compressor is used
      in the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Mechanical compressors account for approximately 30% of a
      household's energy requirements and thus consume a substantial
      portion of most utilities' base load power. Any improvement in
      efficiency related to compressor performance can have significant
      benefits in terms of energy savings and thus have significant
      positive environmental impact. In addition, there are increasing
      thermal management problems in electronic circuits, which require
      smaller heat pumping devices with greater thermal management
      capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Vapor compression refrigeration cycles generally contain
      five important components. The first is a mechanical compressor
      that is used to pressurize a gaseous working fluid. After
      proceeding through the compressor, the hot pressurized working
      fluid is condensed in a condenser. The latent heat of vaporization
      of the working fluid is given up to a high temperature reservoir
      often called the sink. The liquefied working fluid is then
      expanded at substantially constant enthalpy in a thermal expansion
      valve or orifice. The cooled liquid working fluid is then passed
      through an evaporator. In the evaporator, the working fluid
      absorbs its latent heat of vaporization from a low temperature
      reservoir often called a source. The last element in the vapor
      compression refrigeration cycle is the working fluid itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In conventional vapor compression cycles, the working fluid
      selection is based on the properties of the fluid and the
      temperatures of the heat source and sink. The factors in the
      selection include the specific heat of the working fluid, its
      latent heat of vaporization, its specific volume and its safety.
      The selection of the working fluid affects the coefficient of
      performance of the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] In some general aspects, a self-contained heat transfer
      system conveys heat from a first heat reservoir at a relatively
      low temperature to a second heat reservoir at relatively high
      temperature, the heat transfer system defining a closed loop that
      contains a working fluid. The self-contained heat transfer system
      includes a hermetically-sealed housing that defines an enclosure;
      a first heat transfer device having an exposed surface configured
      to be in thermal communication with the first heat reservoir; a
      second heat transfer device having an exposed surface configured
      to be in thermal communication with the second heat reservoir; and
      an electrochemical compressor within the enclosure and between the
      first and second heat transfer devices, wherein the
      electrochemical compressor includes one or more electrochemical
      cells, each electrochemical cell including a gas pervious anode, a
      gas pervious cathode, and an electrolytic membrane disposed
      between and in intimate electrical contact with the cathode and
      the anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Implementations can include one or more of the following
      features. For example, the first heat transfer device can include
      at least a part of the housing. The exposed surface of the first
      heat transfer device can be a surface of the housing. The first
      heat transfer device can be at least partly within the enclosure.
      The second heat transfer device can include at least a part of the
      housing. The exposed surface of the second heat transfer device
      can be a surface of the housing. The second heat transfer device
      can be at least partly within the enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The first heat transfer device can be configured to
      transfer heat from the first heat reservoir to the working fluid.
      The second heat transfer device can be configured to transfer heat
      from the working fluid to the second heat reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The system can also include an expansion space fluidly
      coupled to the first and second heat transfer devices and
      configured to reduce a pressure of the working fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The working fluid can contain one or more components that
      pass through the electrochemical compressor. The working fluid can
      contain one or more components that bypass the electrochemical
      compressor. In this case, the system can also include a mixing
      system that combines the one or more components that pass through
      the electrochemical compressor with the one or more components
      that bypass the electrochemical compressor. The one or more
      components that bypass the electrochemical compressor can include
      a condensable refrigerant. The condensable refrigerant can be
      configured to not participate in the electrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The one or more components that pass through the
      electrochemical compressor can include an electrochemically active
      fluid that participates in the electrochemical process within the
      electrochemical compressor. The one or more components that pass
      through the electrochemical compressor can include one or more of
      methanol, ethanol, and water.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The working fluid can contain a single component that
      passes through the electrochemical compressor and that is both
      electrochemically active and is a refrigerant<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The first heat transfer device can include comprise a
      condenser. The second heat transfer device can include an
      evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The exposed surfaces of the heat transfer devices can be
      planar. The exposed surfaces of the heat transfer devices can be
      cylindrical such that the housing is annular.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In other general aspects, self-contained heat transfer
      system is manufactured by preparing a first portion of a housing,
      where the first housing portion includes a thermally-conductive
      wall; preparing a second portion of the housing, where the second
      housing portion is sized and shaped to mate with the first housing
      portion and includes a thermally-conductive wall; inserting an
      electrochemical compressor between interior surfaces of the
      thermally-conductive walls of the first and second housing
      portions; pressing the first and second housing portions together
      to form an enclosure that receives the electrochemical compressor
      such that the exterior surface of the first housing portion
      thermally-conductive wall is able to be exposed to a first heat
      reservoir and the exterior surface of the second housing portion
      thermally-conductive wall is able to be exposed to a second heat
      reservoir; inserting a working fluid into the enclosure through an
      opening; and hermetically sealing the first and second housing
      portions together and sealing the opening to define a closed loop
      that contains the working fluid in the enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Implementations can include one or more of the following
      features. For example, an expansion fluid passage can be formed in
      the first housing portion and an expansion fluid passage can be
      formed in the second housing portion, where the expansion fluid
      passages are fluidly linked to each other when the first and
      second housing portions are pressed together. The expansion fluid
      passage in the first housing portion can be fluidly coupled to a
      cavity formed between the first housing portion and the
      electrochemical compressor. The expansion fluid passage in the
      second housing portion can be fluidly coupled to a cavity formed
      between the second housing portion and the electrochemical
      compressor. The closed loop can be formed such that fluid passes
      through the expansion fluid passage in the second housing portion,
      through the expansion fluid passage in the first housing portion,
      through the cavity in the first housing portion, through the
      electrochemical compressor, through the cavity in the second
      housing portion, and back to the fluid passage in the second
      housing portion. The expansion fluid passages can be formed by
      forming the expansion fluid passages to have a size that enables a
      reduction in pressure of the working fluid as it passes through
      the expansion fluid passages.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The first and second housing portions can be hermetically
      sealed together by welding the first and second housing portions
      together, curing adhesive between the first and second housing
      portions, soldering the first and second housing portions
      together, and inserting a gasket between the first and second
      housing portions before pressing the first and second housing
      portions together.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The opening can be sealed by filling the opening with a
      leak-free adhesive.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The first housing portion can be prepared by forming the
      first housing portion into an annular shape. The second housing
      portion can be prepared by forming the second housing portion into
      an annular shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The first housing portion can be prepared by forming the
      first housing portion into a planar shape. The second housing
      portion can be prepared by forming the second housing portion into
      a planar shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Each of the housing portions can be prepared by die casting
      each of the housing portions. Each of the housing portions can be

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0040] Referring to FIG. 1, a self-contained electrochemical heat
      transfer system 100 is used to convey heat from a first heat
      reservoir 102 at a relatively low temperature to a second heat
      reservoir 104 at a relatively high temperature. The heat transfer
      system 100 is self-contained since it constitutes a complete and
      independent unit in and of itself including all necessary
      components to function as a heat transfer system with merely a
      connection to a power supply 106. The power supply 106 can be a
      source of direct current electric power such as a battery or a
      rectifier or any other electric source capable of delivering
      direct current.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The heat transfer system 100 is a complete and independent
      unit because it is designed as a hermetically-sealed housing 108
      having an internal enclosure that is impervious to fluids outside
      the housing 108. The heat transfer system 100 is sized
      proportionally to a required cooling capacity and the size and
      shape of the system 100 is also be determined by the size and
      shape of the first heat reservoir. The heat transfer system 100
      defines within its internal enclosure a closed loop that contains
      a working fluid (which is represented by the block arrows in FIG.
      1).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The heat transfer system 100 is an electrochemical system
      in that it includes an electrochemical compressor 110 within its
      internal enclosure. The electrochemical compressor 110 lacks
      moving parts and receives all of its energy from the power supply
      106.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The heat transfer system 100 includes a first heat transfer
      device 112 that transfers heat from the first heat reservoir 102
      (which is any heat source or object to be cooled) to the working
      fluid, a second heat transfer device 114 that transfers heat from
      the working fluid to the second heat reservoir 104 (which is a
      heat sink), and an expansion space 116 fluidly linking the first
      and second heat transfer devices. The first heat transfer device
      112 includes an evaporator that acts as a heat exchanger that
      places the working fluid in a heat exchange relationship with the
      first heat reservoir 102. The second heat transfer device 114
      includes a condenser that acts as a heat exchanger that places the
      working fluid in a heat exchange relationship with the second heat
      reservoir 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] To enable the heat transfer, the first heat transfer device
      112 has an exposed surface that is configured to be in thermal
      communication with the first heat reservoir 102 and the second
      heat transfer device 114 has an exposed surface that is configured
      to be in thermal communication with the second heat reservoir 104.
      The exposed surface of either or both of the heat transfer devices
      112, 114 can be an exposed surface of the housing 108; in such a
      design, the wall of the housing 108 with the exposed surface is a
      thermally-conductive wall that would be considered a part of the
      respective heat transfer device so that the housing wall is an
      integral part of the heat transfer. The heat transfer devices 112,
      114 can also include portions that are within the enclosure, so
      that they extend from exposed surface inward toward the compressor
      110. Some exemplary designs of the heat transfer devices 112, 114
      are shown and discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The expansion space 116 is an orifice or opening that
      controls the amount of working fluid flow. The expansion space 116
      can include a temperature sensing bulb filled with a similar gas
      as in the working fluid that causes a valve to open against the
      spring pressure in the valve body as the temperature on the bulb
      increases. As the temperature in the first heat transfer device
      112 decreases, so does the pressure in the bulb and therefore on
      the spring causing the valve to close.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The power supply 106 is controlled by a control system 118,
      which is connected to at least one sensor that measures or
      estimates a temperature of the first heat reservoir 102. In this
      way, the control system 118 provides closed-loop control of the
      operation of the power supply 106 and therefore the amount of
      cooling provided by the system 100 based on the temperature of the
      first heat reservoir 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The working fluid contained within the closed loop of the
      heat transfer system 100 includes at least a component (which can
      be referred to as a first component if other components are
      present in the working fluid) that is electrochemically active and
      therefore takes part in the electrochemical process within the
      compressor 110. If the working fluid includes only one component,
      then this component would also provide a heat transfer function in
      the closed loop. Thus, the component would also have to undergo a
      transformation as it is transferred between the first heat
      transfer device 112 and the second heat transfer device 114, such
      transformation can include a phase change, though a phase change
      is not necessary to fulfill the heat transfer function.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] One particular suitable single-component working fluid is
      hydrogen. While hydrogen is being used primarily as the
      electrochemically active component of the working fluid, hydrogen
      also possesses useful heat transfer properties. Hydrogen's low
      density, high specific heat, and thermal conductivity make it an
      acceptable coolant. Thus, the presence of hydrogen gas within the
      working fluid (either within a single-component working fluid or a
      multi-component working fluid) enhances the performance of the
      condensable refrigerant; and provides thermal exchange
      opportunities at points away from thermally conductive surfaces of
      the fluid conduits and the heat transfer devices. Other suitable
      single-component working fluids are possible, for example, water,
      methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol, or any polar fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In some implementations (one of which is shown in FIG. 19),
      the working fluid includes at least a second component that is a
      condensable refrigerant that can be used for the heat transfer
      application under consideration. The condensable refrigerant is
      any suitable condensable composition that does not include water.
      As discussed below, the condensable refrigerant bypasses the
      electrochemical process within the compressor 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Additionally, the working fluid can include a third
      component such as water to hydrate an ion exchange membrane within
      the compressor 110 (as discussed below). Water can be considered a
      contaminant of some standard refrigerants, and it can negatively
      impact heat exchange performance of the refrigerant. Thus water as
      a component of the working fluid can be reduced for example, to a
      minimal amount that is needed to provide enough hydration to one
      or more components of the compressor 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In some implementations, the first component (which is
      electrochemically active) includes hydrogen (H2), the second
      component (which is a condensable refrigerant) includes methanol,
      and the third component is water. In this implementation, all
      components would be able to pass through the compressor 110,
      though some may not engage in electrochemical activity. The
      components can be present in the proportion of approximately 5%
      hydrogen and 95% methanol by weight. The relative proportions of
      hydrogen and methanol are governed by the desired relative
      efficiency of the electrochemical compressor 110 and the system
      100. The quantity of water maintained in the working fluid is
      governed by the thickness of membranes employed in the compressor
      110, the equivalent weight (acidity) of the ion exchange media
      employed in the compressor 110, and the amount of hydrogen in the
      system 100. Thinner membranes of higher equivalent weight (that
      is, lower acidity) employed in systems with lower proton
      capability require less water. In general, the working fluid
      includes less than 50% of water, but can include less than 20%,
      less than 10%, or less than 1% water, depending on the
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] If hydrogen is used as a multi-component working fluid that
      also includes a condensable refrigerant that bypasses
      electrochemical compression, then the hydrogen would be compressed
      by the compressor 110 to a much higher pressure than the final
      working fluid pressure, and would then mix with the lower pressure
      component of the working fluid (the one that bypasses the
      compressor 110). Such a design is shown in FIG. 19. The exact
      pressure requirements for the hydrogen stream depends on the
      volume of condensable component being pressurized in relation to
      the volume of hydrogen, the desired final pressure requirements of
      the mixed stream, and the targeted energy efficiency. In some
      implementations, check valves can be employed to make sure the gas
      flows are maintained in the intended directions and that no back
      flow is allowed towards the compressor 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The working fluid can include chlorine as a component;
      chlorine could be used advantageously in an anionic exchange
      membrane cell. The choice of the refrigerant depends on the exact
      application under consideration and other external regulatory
      factors. Care should be taken in the selection of the refrigerant
      to ensure that the refrigerant does not degrade the
      electrochemical performance of the system or poison the
      electrocatalyst employed in the compressor 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Generally, the refrigerant used in the working fluid should
      have good thermodynamic properties, be noncorrosive, stable, and
      safe. The desired thermodynamic properties are at a boiling point
      somewhat below the target temperature, a high heat of
      vaporization, a moderate density in liquid form, a relatively high
      density in gaseous form, and a high critical temperature. Since
      boiling point and gas density are affected by pressure,
      refrigerants can be made more suitable for a particular
      application by choice of operating pressure. The refrigerant can
      be electrochemically active, in which case it could take part in
      electrochemical compression.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The electrochemical compressor 110 is a device that raises
      the pressure of at least one component of the working fluid by an
      electrochemical process. Accordingly, at least one component of
      the working fluid must be electrochemically active. In particular,
      the electrochemically active component (the first component) must
      be ionizable. For example, the electrochemically active component
      is oxidized at a gas pervious anode 120 of the compressor 110 and
      is reduced at a gas pervious cathode 122 of the compressor 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In this implementation, the compressor 110 includes only
      one exemplary cell. However, the electrochemical compressor 110
      can include a plurality of electrochemical cells, as shown in
      FIGS. 3A-C of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/626,416, filed Nov. 25,
      2009 and entitled "Electrochemical Compressor and Refrigeration
      System," which is incorporated herein by reference in its
      entirety. In some implementations, the electrochemical compressor
      110 is an annular stack of electrochemical cells electrically
      connected in series such as, for example, the cells generally
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,913,511 (Grubb); in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,432,355 (Neidrach); and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,489,670 (Maget).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The compressor 110 includes an electrolyte 124 that serves
      to conduct the ionic species (EC&lt;+&gt;) from the anode 120 to
      the cathode 122. The electrolyte 124 can be an impermeable solid
      ion exchange membrane having a porous microstructure and an ion
      exchange material impregnated through the membrane such that the
      electrolyte 124 can withstand an appreciable pressure gradient
      between its anode and cathode sides. The examples provided here
      employ impermeable ion exchange membranes, and the
      electrochemically active component of the working fluid is remixed
      with the working fluid after compression and thus the pressure of
      the working fluid is elevated prior to the condensation phase of
      the refrigeration process. However, a permeable ion exchange
      membrane is also feasible with the working fluid traversing in a
      unidirectional and sequential path through electrode assemblies
      with increasing pressure. The active components of the working
      fluid dissolve into the ion exchange media of the ion exchange
      membrane and the gas in the working fluid traverses through the
      ion exchange membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] As another example, the electrolyte 124 can be made of a
      solid electrolyte, for example, a gel, that is, any solid,
      jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and
      weak to hard and tough and being defined as a substantially dilute
      crosslinked system that exhibits no flow when in the steady-state.
      The solid electrolyte can be made very thin, for example, it can
      have a thickness of less than 0.2 mm, to provide additional
      strength to the gel. Alternatively, the solid electrolyte can have
      a thickness of less than 0.2 mm if it is reinforced with one or
      more reinforcing layers like a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      membrane (having a thickness of about 0.04 mm or less) depending
      on the application and the ion exchange media of the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Each of the anode 120 and the cathode 122 can be an
      electrocatalyst such as platinum or palladium or any other
      suitable candidate catalyst. The electrolyte 124 can be a solid
      polymer electrolyte such as Nafion (trademark for an ion exchange
      membrane manufactured by the I. E. DuPont DeNemours Company) or
      GoreSelect (trademark for a composite ion exchange membrane
      manufactured by W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc.). The catalysts
      (that is, the anode 120 and the cathode 122) are intimately bonded
      to each side of the electrolyte 124. The anode 120 includes an
      anode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 126 and the cathode 122
      includes a cathode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 128. The
      electrodes (the anode 120 and the cathode 122) of the compressor
      110 can be considered as the electrocatalytic structure that is
      bonded to the solid electrolyte 124. The combination of the
      electrolyte 124 (which can be an ion exchange membrane) and the
      electrodes (the anode 120 and the cathode 122) is referred to as a
      membrane electrode assembly or MEA.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Adjacent the anode gas space 126 is an anode current
      collector 130 and adjacent the cathode gas space 128 is a cathode
      current collector 132. The anode collector 130 and the cathode
      collector 132 are electrically driven by the power supply 106
      through respective meshes 134, 136. The anode collector 130 and
      the cathode collector 132 are porous, electronically conductive
      structures that can be woven metal screens (also available from
      Tech Etch) or woven carbon cloth or pressed carbon fiber or
      variations thereof. The pores in the current collectors 130, 132
      serve to facilitate the flow of gases within the gas spaces 126,
      128 adjacent to the respective electrodes 120, 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As mentioned, outer surfaces of the collectors 130, 132 can
      be electrically connected to and pressed against respective meshes
      134, 136, which are electrically connected to respective outputs
      138, 140 of the power supply 106. If the meshes 134, 136 are not
      used, then the outputs 138, 140 would be directly connected to the
      collectors 130, 132. The meshes 134, 136 are electrically
      conductive structures having pores that are generally larger than
      the pores of the collectors 130, 132. The meshes can be woven
      metal screens, woven carbon cloth, or pressed carbon fiber. The
      meshes 134, 136 also provide structural support to the compressor
      110.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Additionally, subassemblies of components of the
      electrochemical compressor or cells (if the compressor includes a
      plurality of cells) can be commercially obtained from
      manufacturers such as W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc. under the
      PRIMEA trademark or Ion Power Inc. Commercially available
      assemblies are designed for oxygen reduction on one electrode and
      therefore the electrodes (the anode 120 and cathode 122) may need
      to be modified for hydrogen reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Hydrogen reduction at the cathode 122 actually requires
      lower loadings of precious metal catalysts and also is feasible
      with alternative lower cost catalysts such as palladium. Thus, the
      eventual production costs of assemblies employed in the system 100
      are substantially lower than typical fuel cell components.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As mentioned above, the control system 118 is coupled to
      one or more temperature sensors placed near the first heat
      reservoir 102 to monitor or measure the temperature of first heat
      reservoir 102. Additionally, the control system 118 sends a signal
      to the power supply 106 to control an amount of power to drive the
      electrochemical compressor 110 based at least in part on the
      feedback obtained from the temperature sensors. The control system
      118 can be a general system including sub-components that perform
      distinct steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The control system 118 can include one or more of digital
      electronic circuitry, computer hardware, firmware, and software.
      The control system 118 can also include appropriate input and
      output devices, a computer processor, and a computer program
      product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device for
      execution by a programmable processor. A procedure embodying these
      techniques may be performed by a programmable processor executing
      a program of instructions to perform desired functions by
      operating on input data and generating appropriate output.
      Generally, a processor receives instructions and data from a
      read-only memory and/or a random access memory. Storage devices
      suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and
      data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including, by way
      of example, semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM,
      and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard
      disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM
      disks. Any of the foregoing may be supplemented by, or
      incorporated in, specially-designed ASICs (application-specific
      integrated circuits).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The control system 118 receives information from the
      temperature sensor and controls operation of a procedure that can
      either maintain the heat source or the heat sink at a relatively
      constant temperature condition. Additionally, controlling the
      operation of an electrochemical compressor 110 consists of turning
      its current on or off through the power supply 106. Alternatively,
      the voltage applied to the electrochemical compressor 110 can be
      set to be in proportion to the heat source fluid temperature or
      the heat sink fluid temperature (if fluids are used in the heat
      source or heat sinks). In some applications, such as electric cars
      without internal combustion engines, there may be an advantage in
      operating the vehicle air conditioning system electrically and
      driving each wheel independently without a central motor (required
      to drive the air conditioning system).<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Referring also to FIG. 2, the hermetically-sealed housing
      108 is designed with two portions 250, 252, each portion 250, 252
      including one or more walls including at least one
      thermally-conductive wall. The portions 250, 252 are each designed
      with an internal opening or cavity to receive the compressor 110
      and the respective meshes 134, 136, as shown below in the
      exemplary system shown in FIG. 3. The two portions 250, 252 are
      sized and shaped to mate with each other at an interface 254. At
      least one of the portions 250, 252 includes an opening 256 through
      which the working fluid is initially inserted into the enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The closed loop is formed such that the working fluid
      passes through the expansion space 116, then through a cavity in
      the first heat transfer device 112 (which is within the first
      housing portion 250), through the electrochemical compressor 110,
      then through a cavity in the second heat transfer device 114
      (which is within the second housing portion 252), and back to the
      expansion space 116. Heat is transferred using the working fluid
      as it is circulated through and contained within the closed loop
      of the heat transfer system 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Low pressure (that is, unpressurized) working fluid (which
      can be a mixture of hydrogen, methanol, and water) enters the
      compressor 110 after it exits the expansion space 116. If the
      working fluid includes a condensable refrigerant that does not
      engage in electrochemical activity, then the electrochemically
      active component(s) (such as hydrogen and water) is dissociated
      from the condensable refrigerant. In this case, the
      electrochemically active component(s) dissolve into the ion
      exchange media while the condensable refrigerant is diverted along
      a path separate from the electrochemical path through the membrane
      electrode assembly. In any case, the electrochemically active
      component(s) is pumped across the membrane electrode assembly of
      the compressor 110. In particular, electrons are stripped from the
      component(s) at the anode collector 130, and the ions are
      transported across the anode 120, the electrolyte 124, and toward
      the cathode 122 due to the electrical potential applied across the
      collectors 130, 132 from the power supply 106. Next, the ions are
      recombined with the electrons at the cathode collector 132 to
      reform the gas at a higher pressure, and this higher pressure gas
      is recombined with any diverted condensable refrigerant (if
      diverted condensable refrigerant is present, as shown in FIG. 19)
      to thereby raise the pressure of the working fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Thus, the electrochemical compressor 110 raises the
      pressure of the working fluid and delivers the higher pressure
      working fluid to the second heat transfer device 114, where the
      condensable refrigerant is precipitated by heat exchange with the
      sink fluid. The working fluid is then reduced in pressure in the
      expansion space 116. Subsequently, the low pressure working fluid
      is delivered to the first heat transfer device 112 where the
      condensed phase of the working fluid is boiled by heat exchange
      with the source fluid. The effluent working fluid within the first
      heat transfer device 112 may be partially in the gas phase and
      partially in the liquid phase when it is returned to the
      electrochemical compressor 110. In the process, heat energy is
      transported from the first heat transfer device 112 (the
      evaporator) to the second heat transfer device 114 (the condenser)
      and consequently, from the heat source at a relatively lower
      temperature to the heat sink at relatively higher temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Concurrently, the control system 118 controls the amount of
      electrical potential applied to the current collectors 130, 132 of
      the compressor 110, and therefore also controlling the amount of
      heat energy transported from the evaporator to the condenser. The
      control system 118 receives information from the one or more
      sensors at the heat reservoir 102 or at the heat reservoir 104
      indicating physical characteristics at key locations. The control
      system 118 analyzes the information and determines whether
      physical properties of the heat transfer system 100 need to be
      adjusted based on the analyzed information. For example, the
      control system 118 can determine that a current applied to the
      compressor 110 (and therefore the current applied to the electrode
      collectors 130, 132) needs to be adjusted. As another example, the
      control system 118 can determine that a flow rate of one or more
      of the heat sink fluid and the heat source fluid that transport
      heat from and to the devices 112, 114 needs to be adjusted. If the
      control system 118 determines that a physical property of the
      system 100 should be adjusted, then the control system 118 sends a
      signal to the component that is affected to adjust the particular
      property. For example, the control system 118 can send a signal to
      the power supply 106 to adjust the amount of current applied to
      the current collectors 130, 132 in the compressor 110. Otherwise,
      the control system 118 continues to receive information from the
      one or more sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, an exemplary heat transfer
      system 300 is designed with the features of the system 100 in that
      the system 300 is a self-contained electrochemical heat transfer
      system formed between and from first and second housing portions
      350, 352. The first and second housing portions 350, 352 can be
      made of any thermally conductive material such as aluminum, zinc,
      gold, alloys of metals, or thermally-conductive polymers. The
      first and second housing portions 350, 352 receive an
      electrochemical compressor 310 sandwiched between a first heat
      transfer device 312 and a second heat transfer device 314. For
      simplicity, the electrochemical compressor 310 is shown in block
      form in FIG. 3; however, the compressor 310 includes all of the
      components that make up the compressor 110 shown in FIG. 1 and
      described above. The first and second heat transfer devices 312,
      314 are respectively housed in and incorporated in the first and
      second housing portions 350, 352, which are joined along an
      interface 354. The second housing portion 352 also includes an
      opening 356 that is sealed with a suitable sealant such as epoxy
      after working fluid is introduced into the cavity formed between
      the portions 350, 352.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Referring also to FIGS. 5A and 5B, the first housing
      portion 350 includes an opening 500 for receiving the output 338
      from the power supply 106. The first housing portion 350 also
      includes an opening 316A that is one half of the expansion space,
      the other half formed from an opening 316B (shown in FIGS. 3, 6A,
      and 6C) within the second housing portion 352. The opening 316A is
      aligned with the opening 316B when the housing portions 350, 352
      are pressed together, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The first housing portion 350 also includes one or more
      channels 504 that fluidly connect the opening 316A with a cavity
      508 that is sized and shaped to receive the mesh 334, the working
      fluid, and at least part of the electrochemical compressor 310.
      The first housing portion 350 includes a thermally-conductive wall
      512 that defines a surface 518 that is exposed to the first heat
      reservoir. The thermally-conductive wall 512 is an integral part
      of a first heat transfer device 312. The thermally-conductive wall
      512 of the first heat transfer device 312 also includes an inner
      surface having protrusions 520 (only one of which is labeled in
      each of FIGS. 5A and 5B for simplicity) that are separated by gaps
      or spaces 522 (only one of which is labeled in each of FIGS. 5A
      and 5B for simplicity) through which the working fluid flows. The
      mesh 334 makes physical contact with the protrusions 520 when the
      housing portions 350, 352 are pressed together. Much of the
      working fluid likely vaporizes within the spaces 522 since the
      spaces 522 are the areas/regions that place the working fluid the
      closest in distance to the first heat reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Referring also to FIGS. 6A-6C, the second housing portion
      352 includes an opening 600 for receiving the output 340 from the
      power supply 106. The second housing portion 352 also includes the
      opening 316B that is one half of the expansion space. The opening
      316B aligns with the opening 316A when the housing portions 350,
      352 are pressed together, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The second housing portion 352 also includes one or more
      channels 604 that fluidly connect the opening 316B with a cavity
      608 that is sized and shaped to receive the mesh 336, the working
      fluid, and at least part of the electrochemical compressor 310.
      The second housing portion 352 includes an opening 656 through
      which the working fluid is initially inserted into the enclosure;
      the opening 656 is a through opening that extends from an exterior
      of the portion 352 to the opening 316B.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The second housing portion 352 includes a
      thermally-conductive wall 612 that defines a surface 618 that is
      exposed to the second heat reservoir. The wall 612 can be shaped,
      as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6B, with fins to increase the area of the
      surface 618 exposed to the second heat reservoir. The
      thermally-conductive wall 612 is an integral part of a second heat
      transfer device 314. The thermally-conductive wall 612 of the
      second heat transfer device 314 also includes an inner surface
      having protrusions 620 (only one of which is labeled in each of
      FIGS. 6A and 6C for simplicity) that are separated by gaps or
      spaces 622 (only one of which is labeled in each of FIGS. 6A and
      6C for simplicity) through which the working fluid flows. The mesh
      336 makes physical contact with the protrusions 620 when the
      housing portions 350, 352 are pressed together. Much of the
      condensable portion of the working fluid likely condenses within
      the spaces 622 since the spaces 622 are the areas/regions that
      place the working fluid the closest in distance to the second heat
      reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Referring to FIG. 7, a procedure 700 is performed to
      manufacture the self-contained heat transfer system 300. Initially
      the first housing portion 350 is prepared (step 710) and the
      second housing portion 352 is prepared (step 720). Each of the
      housing portions 350, 352 can be prepared by any suitable method,
      such as, for example, die casting each of the housing portions
      350, 352. In die casting, molten metal is forced under high
      pressure into mold cavities (which are machined into dies) and
      then permitted to cool before being removed. The die casting
      method is especially suited in this application since a large
      quantity of small to medium sized parts may be needed with good
      detail, a fine surface quality, and dimensional consistency. In
      other implementations, the housing portions 350, 352 are machined
      from blanks into the appropriate geometries. For example, the
      cavities 508, 608 and the openings 316A, B can be machined into
      respective blanks. In some implementations, it is possible to use
      both methods of die casting and machining to form the housing
      portions 350, 352.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The shapes of the housing portions 350, 352 are determined
      based in part on the heat transfer application and the geometries
      of the heat reservoirs. For example, if the first heat reservoir
      has a planar shape (such as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13), then the
      housing portions 350, 352 would have planar shapes. As another
      example, if the first heat reservoir has a cylindrical shape (such
      as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15), then the housing portions 350, 352
      would have annular shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Next, the electrochemical compressor 310 is inserted
      between the first and second housing portions 350, 352 (step 730)
      and the housing portions 350, 352 are combined or pressed together
      with the compressor 310 positioned partly within each of the
      cavities 508, 608 (step 740), as shown in FIG. 8. After the
      housing portions 350, 352 are pressed together (step 740), the
      housing portions 350, 352 are hermetically sealed at the interface
      354 (step 750).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In some implementations, as shown in FIG. 9A, the housing
      portions 350, 352 are soldered or welded 900 around the perimeter
      of the interface 354 to provide the hermitic seal. In this
      implementation, it is also possible to subsequently saturate the
      interface 354 after it has been soldered or welded 900 with a
      suitable adhesive such as epoxy. In other implementations, as
      shown in FIG. 9B, the housing portions 350, 352 are joined at
      aligned flanges 950, 952 using suitable connectors (such as bolts
      and nuts, not shown) and the hermetic seal is provided along an
      O-ring or a gasket 960 provided in a groove 970 around one or more
      of the housing portions 350, 352.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Next, the working fluid is inserted into the cavity or
      enclosure formed within the housing portions 350, 352 (step 760).
      For example, as shown in FIG. 10, the working fluid 1000 is
      inserted through the opening 356. After the enclosure is filled
      with the working fluid (step 760), the remaining openings of the
      housing portions 350, 352 are hermetically sealed (step 770). For
      example, as shown in FIG. 11, the openings 500, 600 are sealed
      with a suitable adhesive 1100 such as epoxy or solder, and the
      opening 356 is sealed with a suitable adhesive 1110 such as epoxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The self-contained heat transfer systems described herein
      offer a system that integrates all of the components required to
      implement heat transfer, such as the electrochemical compressor, a
      gas mixing device at an output of the compressor (which is needed
      for a multi-component working fluid having a component that
      bypasses the compressor), a power connection, and heat transfer
      devices into a single housing to provide small working devices.
      Such small working devices are therefore inherently modular. These
      systems can be made for a wider range of heat transfer
      applications, for example, for both small and large heat transfer
      applications. Systems employed in a heat transfer application can
      be of different sizes and there is no limitation to how many can
      be used in a particular application. For example, as shown in
      FIGS. 12-15, the heat transfer systems can be combined to provide
      the specific cooling or heating requirements depending on the
      geometry of the device(s) to be cooled. Thus, in FIG. 12, each
      heat transfer system 1200, 1210, 1220, 1230 is placed at a
      distinct location on a surface 1240 of a device 1250 to be cooled
      and because the device to be cooled is planar, the heat transfer
      systems are planar. In FIG. 13, each planar heat transfer system
      1300, 1310, 1320 is placed on surfaces 1330, 1340, 1350 at
      respective distinct devices 1332, 1342, 1352 that is part of a
      master system that has a planar shape. In FIG. 14, a single
      annular heat transfer system 1400 is in thermal communication with
      a surface 1410 of a cylindrically-shaped device 1420 to cool the
      cylindrically-shaped device 1420. While in FIG. 15, three annular
      heat transfer systems 1500, 1510, 1520 are placed in thermally
      communication at distinct locations on a surface 1530 of a
      cylindrically-shaped device 1540 to be cooled.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The heat transfer systems can be operated together or
      separately for specific applications requirements. In some
      implementations, as shown in FIG. 16, a plurality of heat transfer
      systems 1600, 1610, 1620 is connected in parallel with a power
      supply 1630. In other implementations, as shown in FIG. 17, a
      plurality of heat transfer systems 1700, 1710, 1720 is connected
      in series with a power supply 1730. In yet other implementations,
      as shown in FIG. 18, each heat transfer system 1800, 1810, 1820 is
      connected to a respective power supply 1830, 1840, 1850. Each of
      the power supplies 1630, 1730, 1830, 1840, 1850 can be controlled
      by a control system such as the control system 118 shown in FIG.
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Referring to FIG. 19, a self-contained heat transfer system
      1900 is shown in which the working fluid includes at least the
      second component 1920 that is a condensable refrigerant that
      bypasses the electrochemical process within the compressor 110. In
      this particular implementation, because the condensable
      refrigerant bypasses the electrochemical compressor 110, while the
      first component (the electrochemically-active component) 1930
      passes through the electrochemical compressor 110, a mixing device
      1910 such as that described in U.S. application Ser. No.
      12/768,421, filed on Apr. 27, 2010, entitled "Tubular System for
      Electrochemical Compressor," which is incorporated herein by
      reference in its entirety, can be used to combine the two
      components 1920, 1930 of the working fluid before the working
      fluid is directed to the second heat transfer device (for example,
      the condenser) 114. The other features of the system 1900 are
      similar in design to the features of the system 100 and therefore
      the description of these features in FIG. 19 is omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The energy efficiency of the self-contained heat transfer
      system described herein depends on the available electrode (anode
      and cathode) surface area, and the applied current density and
      operating voltage of the electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The self-contained heat transfer systems are able to be
      integrated because the electrochemical compressor used is reduced
      in size when compared with prior compressors used in heat transfer
      applications. If a heat transfer application requires more
      significant size reductions, the electrode surfaces (the surfaces
      of the anodes and cathodes) can be reduced even more, the applied
      current densities and voltages can be increased, and a smaller
      compressor can be employed. This would result in an almost order
      of magnitude reduction in size and weight for the heat transfer
      system compared to conventional mechanical systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Since cooling capacity is linked to applied current and
      voltage, one advantage of the self-contained heat transfer system
      is that it can modulate from low capacity (that is, low current
      density at a specific voltage) to a high capacity relatively
      easily. A heat transfer system designed to operate at high
      capacities actually becomes more efficient at lower utilizations,
      while, the exact opposite is true for mechanical systems.
      Similarly, in a modular configuration, power can be provided to
      some of the self-contained heat transfer systems (or units), and
      not others to, for example maintain lower levels of cooling
      capability.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] This feature would allow, for example, refrigerators and
      other devices to split their cooling capabilities (and even
      compartment temperatures) without sacrificing system efficiency.
      For example, a vegetable rack of a refrigerator could be kept at a
      different temperature than the top rack for liquids. Thus, a
      control system would operate at two levels; individual units can
      be controlled, as well as a whole body of units can be controlled
      for optimum cooling effect for a specific application.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In some applications, such as in electric cars, individual
      areas of the vehicle can be kept at different temperatures (such
      as a driver area versus passenger areas) with controls provided to
      specific seating areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] As discussed above, controlling the operation of an
      electrochemical compressor within the self-contained heat transfer
      system consists of turning its current on or off. Alternatively,
      one can schedule the voltage applied to the electrochemical
      compressor in proportion to the source or the sink fluid
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In some implementations, the heat transfer system includes,
      though does not necessarily require, one or more one-way valves at
      the output of the electrochemical compressor. The one-way valve
      can be any mechanical device, such as a check valve, that normally
      allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it in only one
      direction (the direction of the arrows). The valves ensure proper
      delivery of the components of the working fluid that exit the
      electrochemical compressor into the rest of the heat transfer
      system by reducing or avoiding back-pressure into the
      electrochemical compressor, and therefore ensure unidirectional
      flow of the fluids (which include gases).<br>

      <br>
      [0002] The disclosed subject matter relates to a tubular system at
      an output of an electrochemical compressor of a heat transfer
      system such as a refrigeration system.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> BACKGROUND</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The function of both refrigeration cycles and heat pumps is
      to remove heat from a heat source or reservoir at low temperature
      and to reject the heat to a heat sink or reservoir at high
      temperature. While many thermodynamic effects have been exploited
      in the development of heat pumps and refrigeration cycles, one of
      the most popular today is the vapor compression approach. This
      approach is sometimes called mechanical refrigeration because a
      mechanical compressor is used in the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Mechanical compressors account for approximately 30% of a
      household's energy requirements and thus consume a substantial
      portion of most utilities' base load power. Any improvement in
      efficiency related to compressor performance can have significant
      benefits in terms of energy savings and thus have significant
      positive environmental impact. In addition, there are increasing
      thermal management problems in electronic circuits, which require
      smaller heat pumping devices with greater thermal management
      capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Vapor compression refrigeration cycles generally contain
      five important components. The first is a mechanical compressor
      that is used to pressurize a gaseous working fluid. After
      proceeding through the compressor, the hot pressurized working
      fluid is condensed in a condenser. The latent heat of vaporization
      of the working fluid is given up to a high temperature reservoir
      often called the sink. The liquefied working fluid is then
      expanded at substantially constant enthalpy in a thermal expansion
      valve or orifice. The cooled liquid working fluid is then passed
      through an evaporator. In the evaporator, the working fluid
      absorbs its latent heat of vaporization from a low temperature
      reservoir often called a source. The last element in the vapor
      compression refrigeration cycle is the working fluid itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In conventional vapor compression cycles, the working fluid
      selection is based on the properties of the fluid and the
      temperatures of the heat source and sink. The factors in the
      selection include the specific heat of the working fluid, its
      latent heat of vaporization, its specific volume and its safety.
      The selection of the working fluid affects the coefficient of
      performance of the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] For a refrigeration cycle operating between a lower limit,
      or source temperature, and an upper limit, or sink temperature,
      the maximum efficiency of the cycle is limited to the Carnot
      efficiency. The efficiency of a refrigeration cycle is generally
      defined by its coefficient of performance, which is the quotient
      of the heat absorbed from the sink divided by the net work input
      required by the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0008] In some general aspects, a heat transfer system defines a
      closed loop that contains a working fluid that is circulated
      through the closed loop. The heat transfer system includes an
      electrochemical compressor including one or more electrochemical
      cells electrically connected to each other through a power supply,
      each electrochemical cell having a gas pervious anode, a gas
      pervious cathode, and an electrolytic membrane disposed between
      and in intimate electrical contact with the cathode and the anode.
      The heat transfer system also includes a tubular system that
      receives at least one electrochemically-active component of the
      working fluid from an output of the electrochemical compressor
      and, if present, other components of the working fluid that bypass
      the electrochemical compressor. The tubular system has a geometry
      that enables at least a portion of the received working fluid to
      be imparted with a gain in kinetic energy as it moves through the
      tubular system.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Implementations can include one or more of the following
      features. For example, the tubular system can be configured to
      prevent the working fluid portion from flowing back into the
      electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The heat transfer system can include a first heat transfer
      device that transfers heat from a first heat reservoir to the
      working fluid; and a second heat transfer device that transfers
      heat from the working fluid to a second heat reservoir. The first
      heat reservoir can be at a lower temperature than the second heat
      reservoir. The electrochemical compressor can be between the first
      and second heat transfer devices. The first heat transfer device
      can include an evaporator and the second heat transfer device can
      include a condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The heat transfer system can also include an expansion
      valve between the first and second heat transfer devices and
      configured to reduce a pressure of the working fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The electrochemical compressor output can be a cathode
      output that receives the electrochemically-active component after
      it has been pressurized. The electrochemical compressor can
      include an anode at which the other working fluid components exit
      the electrochemical compressor without being pressurized. The
      tubular system can be configured to mix the un-pressured working
      fluid components (that is, the other working fluid components that
      exit the compressor without being pressurized) with the
      pressurized electrochemically-active component. The tubular system
      can be configured to transfer kinetic energy from the pressurized
      electrochemically-active component to the un-pressured working
      fluid components.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The other working fluid components can include a
      condensable refrigerant component that bypasses the
      electrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The heat transfer system can include a heat sink in thermal
      contact with the tubular system.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The tubular system can include a venturi tube. The tubular
      system can include a vortex tube. The tubular system can be
      configured to receive all of the components of the working fluid
      from the electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In other general aspects, heat is transferred using a
      working fluid that is circulated through and contained within a
      closed loop. A pressure of at least one electrochemically-active
      component of the working fluid is increased by circulating the
      electrochemically-active component through an electrochemical
      compressor and outputting the pressurized electrochemically-active
      component. The working fluid including the pressurized
      electrochemically-active component and, if present, other
      components of the working fluid that bypass the electrochemical
      compressor are outputted. A gain in kinetic energy is imparted to
      at least a portion of the outputted working fluid by directing the
      outputted working fluid through a body of revolution.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Implementations can include one or more of the following
      features. For example, the pressure of the
      electrochemically-active working fluid component can be increased
      by electrochemically ionizing the electrochemically-active
      component by stripping charged particles from the
      electrochemically-active component, enabling the ionized
      electrochemically-active component to pass through an electrolytic
      membrane, pumping the charged particles to create an electric
      potential gradient across the electrolytic membrane, pumping the
      ionized electrochemically-active component across the electrolytic
      membrane using the electric potential gradient, electrochemically
      de-ionizing the electrochemically-active component by combining
      the pumped charged particles with the ionized
      electrochemically-active component, and pressuring the de-ionized
      electrochemically-active component.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The electrochemically-active component can be dissociated
      from a condensable refrigerant component within the working fluid
      to enable the condensable refrigerant component to bypass the
      electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Heat from a first heat reservoir at a relatively low
      temperature can be conveyed to a second heat reservoir at
      relatively high temperature by circulating the working fluid
      through a closed loop that is thermally coupled to the first heat
      reservoir at a first portion and is thermally coupled to the
      second heat reservoir at a second portion. The heat can be
      conveyed by transferring heat from the working fluid at the second
      loop portion to the second heat reservoir including liquefying at
      least some of the working fluid; reducing a pressure of the at
      least partially liquefied working fluid by expanding the working
      fluid at a substantially constant enthalpy; and transferring heat
      from the first heat reservoir to the working fluid at the first
      loop portion including vaporizing at least some of the working
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] If other working component components that bypass the
      electrochemical compressor are present, then the pressurized
      electrochemically-active component can be re-associated with the
      condensable refrigerant component by imparting the gain in kinetic
      energy to the outputted working fluid portion to form a
      pressurized working fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The gain in kinetic energy can be imparted to the outputted
      working fluid portion by reducing an amount of working fluid from
      flowing back into the electrochemical compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] If other components of the working fluid that bypass the
      electrochemical compressor are present, then the pressurized
      electrochemically-active component can be mixed with the other
      components.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] If other components of the working fluid that bypass the
      electrochemical compressor are present, then kinetic energy can be
      imparted to the outputted working fluid portion by transferring
      kinetic energy from the pressurized electrochemically-active
      component to the other components.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The gain in kinetic energy can be imparted to the outputted
      working fluid portion by directing the outputted working fluid
      through a Venturi tube. The gain in kinetic energy can be imparted
      to the outputted working fluid portion by directing the outputted
      working fluid through a vortex tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The electrochemically-active component can include hydrogen
      (H2) and the condensable refrigerant component can include carbon
      dioxide (CO2). The condensable refrigerant can lack water. The
      working fluid can include water.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] An electrochemical compressor and heat pump system includes
      an electrochemical cell and a mixed gas refrigerant-based cooling
      system. The electrochemical cell is capable of producing high
      pressure hydrogen gas from a mixed fluid system including an
      electrochemically-active component such as hydrogen and at least
      one refrigerant fluid. The cooling system can include a condenser,
      compressor, and evaporator in thermal communication with an object
      to be cooled. Hydrogen gas is pressurized across the membrane
      electrode assembly. The hydrogen gas enters a gas space, where it
      is compressed into a vapor refrigerant. As the vapor refrigerant
      is compressed, it is forced through the condenser where the
      refrigerant is liquefied. The liquid refrigerant then passes
      through the evaporator where the liquid refrigerant is evaporated
      by absorbing heat from the object to be cooled. The mixed fluids
      then enter the electrochemical cell where hydrogen is pressurized
      again.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The electrochemical compressor raises the pressure of
      hydrogen in the working fluid and hydrogen back to the working
      fluid (refrigerant), which is then delivered to a condenser where
      the condensable component is precipitated by heat exchange with a
      sink fluid. The working fluid is then reduced in pressure in a
      thermal expansion valve. Subsequently, the low pressure working
      fluid is delivered to an evaporator where the condensed phase of
      the working fluid is boiled by heat exchange with a source fluid.
      The evaporator effluent working fluid may be partially in the gas
      phase and partially in the liquid phase when it is returned from
      the evaporator to the electrochemical compressor. In the process,
      heat energy is transported from the evaporator to the condenser
      and consequently, from the heat source at low temperature to the
      heat sink at high temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] One concern involving the use of electrochemical
      compressors is that the electrochemically-active component is
      reduced (such as for example to hydrogen gas from the cathode) at
      pressure, and then mixed with the working fluid at the anode, to
      raise the pressure of the working fluid. Remixing the gases
      creates the potential for blow back into the cells, and also
      requires good transfer of energy from the gas emerging from the
      cathode to the gas emerging from the anode. Thus the tubular
      system is used to reduce the potential for blow back and aid in
      good transfer of energy from one gas to the other. The tubular
      system is useful for mixing the pressurized hydrogen gas from the
      cathode of the electrochemical compressor cell with the working
      fluid (refrigerant) exiting the anode, and reduce the potential
      for blow back. Such a tubular system may also provide
      refrigeration or heating effects depending on specific
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Optionally, the working fluid may be pure hydrogen, and
      thus be completely transported to the cathode side, in which case
      a vortex tube maybe used with compressed hydrogen intake only.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The choice of tubular system is specific to the application
      of the heat transfer system, but nevertheless would be able to
      improve the gas stream(s) exiting the electrochemical compressor
      in preparation for the refrigeration cycles, and mitigate any
      negative impact (like blow back) into the cells of the compressor.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> DESCRIPTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0040] Referring to FIG. 1, a heat transfer system 100 defines a
      closed loop that contains a working fluid that is circulated
      through the loop. The heat transfer system 100 includes an
      electrochemical compressor 105 that lacks moving parts and a
      tubular system 110 that receives at least a portion of the working
      fluid from an output 114 of the compressor 105. The tubular system
      110 has a geometry of a body of revolution having a form described
      by rotating a plane curve about an axis in its plane. Due to this
      symmetrical geometry, a component of the working fluid portion is
      imparted with a gain in kinetic energy as that component moves
      through the tubular system 110. The tubular system 110 can
      additionally prevent or reduce the amount of the working fluid
      portion from flowing back into the compressor 105. For example,
      the tubular system 110 can be a venturi tube or a vortex tube, as
      discussed below. In some implementations, the heat transfer system
      100 also includes a heat sink 140 in thermal contact with the
      tubular system 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The heat transfer system 100 can optionally include one or
      more output components 115 at the output 114 of the compressor
      105. The output components 115 are one-way valves that ensure
      proper delivery of the working fluid components that exit the
      compressor 105 by reducing or avoiding back-pressure into the
      compressor 105 and therefore ensure unidirectional flow of fluids
      (including any gases). Moreover, the heat transfer system 100
      includes heat transfer components 120 between an output 116 of the
      tubular system 110 and an input 112 of the compressor 105. These
      heat transfer components 120 are any components that are used to
      transfer heat from one location to another, and will be discussed
      in greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Referring also to FIG. 2, the electrochemical compressor
      105 is a device that raises the pressure of a component of the
      working fluid 200 by an electrochemical process. Accordingly, at
      least one component of the working fluid 200 must be
      electrochemically active. In particular, the
      electrochemically-active component must be ionizable. For example,
      the electrochemically-active component is oxidizable at a gas
      pervious anode 205 of the compressor 105 and is reducible at a gas
      pervious cathode 210 of the compressor 105. The electrochemical
      compressor 105 includes one or more electrochemical cells
      electrically connected to each other through a power supply, each
      electrochemical cell having a gas pervious anode, a gas pervious
      cathode, and an electrolytic membrane disposed between and in
      intimate electrical contact with the cathode and the anode. The
      design in which the compressor 105 includes only one exemplary
      cell 202 is shown in FIG. 2. However, the electrochemical
      compressor 105 can include a plurality of electrochemical cells,
      as shown in FIGS. 3A-C of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/626,416,
      filed Nov. 25, 2009 and entitled "Electrochemical Compressor and
      Refrigeration System," which is incorporated herein by reference
      in its entirety. In some implementations, the electrochemical
      compressor 105 is an annular stack of electrochemical cells
      electrically connected in series such as, for example, the cells
      generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,913,511 (Grubb); in U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,432,355 (Neidrach); and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,489,670
      (Maget).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Each cell 202 includes the anode 205, where the
      electrochemically-active component of the working fluid is
      oxidized; the cathode 210, where the electrochemically-active
      component (EC) of the working fluid is reduced; and an electrolyte
      215 that serves to conduct the ionic species (EC&lt;+&gt;) from
      the anode 205 to the cathode 210. The electrolyte 215 can be an
      impermeable solid ion exchange membrane having a porous
      microstructure and an ion exchange material impregnated through
      the membrane such that the electrolyte 215 can withstand an
      appreciable pressure gradient between its anode and cathode sides.
      The examples provided here employ impermeable ion exchange
      membranes, and the electrochemically-active component of the
      working fluid is remixed with the working fluid after compression
      and thus the pressure of the working fluid 200 is elevated prior
      to the condensation phase of the refrigeration process. However, a
      permeable ion exchange membrane is also feasible with the working
      fluid traversing in a unidirectional and sequential path through
      electrode assemblies with increasing pressure. The active
      components of the working fluid dissolve into the ion exchange
      media of the ion exchange membrane and the gas in the working
      fluid traverses through the ion exchange membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As another example, the electrolyte 215 can be made of a
      solid electrolyte, for example, a gel, that is, any solid,
      jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and
      weak to hard and tough and being defined as a substantially dilute
      crosslinked system that exhibits no flow when in the steady-state.
      The solid electrolyte can be made very thin, for example, it can
      have a thickness of less than 0.2 mm, to provide additional
      strength to the gel. Alternatively, the solid electrolyte can have
      a thickness of less than 0.2 mm if it is reinforced with one or
      more reinforcing layers like a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      membrane (having a thickness of about 0.04 mm or less) depending
      on the application and the ion exchange media of the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Each of the anode 205 and the cathode 210 can be an
      electrocatalyst such as platinum or palladium or any other
      suitable candidate catalyst. The electrolyte 215 can be a solid
      polymer electrolyte such as Nafion (trademark for an ion exchange
      membrane manufactured by the I. E. DuPont DeNemours Company) or
      GoreSelect (trademark for a composite ion exchange membrane
      manufactured by W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc.). The catalysts
      (that is, the anode 205 and the cathode 210) are intimately bonded
      to each side of the electrolyte 215. The anode 205 includes an
      anode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 207 and the cathode 210
      includes a cathode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 212. The
      electrodes (the anode 205 and the cathode 210) of the cell 202 can
      be considered as the electrocatalytic structure that is bonded to
      the solid electrolyte 215. The combination of the electrolyte 215
      (which can be an ion exchange membrane) and the electrodes (the
      anode 205 and the cathode 210) is referred to as a membrane
      electrode assembly or MEA.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Adjacent the anode gas space 207 is an anode current
      collector 209 and adjacent the cathode gas space 212 is a cathode
      current collector 214. The anode collector 209 and the cathode
      collector 214 are electrically driven by the power supply 250. The
      anode collector 209 and the cathode collector 214 are porous,
      electronically conductive structures that can be woven metal
      screens (also available from Tech Etch) or woven carbon cloth or
      pressed carbon fiber or variations thereof. The pores in the
      current collectors 209, 214 serve to facilitate the flow of gases
      within the gas spaces 207, 212 adjacent to the respective
      electrodes 205, 210.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Outer surfaces of the collectors 209, 214 are connected to
      respective bipolar plates 221, 226 that provide fluid barriers
      that retain the gases within the cell 202. Additionally, if the
      cell 202 is provided in a stack of cells, then the bipolar plates
      221, 226 separate the anode and cathode gases within each of the
      adjacent cells in the cell stack from each other and facilitate
      the conduction of electricity from one cell to the next cell in
      the cell stack of the compressor. The bipolar plate 221, 226 can
      be obtained from a number of suppliers including Tech Etch
      (Massachusetts).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Additionally, subassemblies of components of the
      electrochemical cell can be commercially obtained from
      manufacturers such as W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc. under the
      PRIMEA trademark or Ion Power Inc. Commercially available
      assemblies are designed for oxygen reduction on one electrode and
      therefore the electrodes (the anode 205 and cathode 210) may need
      to be modified for hydrogen reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Hydrogen reduction at the cathode 210 actually requires
      lower loadings of precious metal catalysts and also is feasible
      with alternative lower cost catalysts such as palladium. Thus, the
      eventual production costs of assemblies employed in the system 100
      are substantially lower than typical fuel cell components.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The working fluid 200 includes one or more components,
      depending on the application of the heat transfer system 100.
      Thus, in some implementations, the working fluid 200 includes a
      first component that is electrochemically active, and therefore
      takes part in the electrochemical process within the compressor
      105 such that the first component 240 is output along a conduit
      250, and a second component 242 that is a condensable refrigerant
      that bypasses along a separate conduit 252 the electrochemical
      process within the compressor 105. Such a working fluid is
      described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In other implementations, the working fluid 200 includes a
      single component (such as pure hydrogen (H2)) that acts as a heat
      transfer fluid and is electrochemically active and entirely takes
      part in the electrochemical process. In these other
      implementations, there would be no second component that bypasses
      the compressor 105 along the conduit 252 and the single component
      240 moves entirely within the conduit 250. Such a working fluid is
      described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Referring again to FIG. 1, the heat transfer system 100
      optionally includes one or more output components 115 at the
      output 114 of the compressor 105. The output components 115 can
      include a first one-way valve 260 in the conduit 250 that ensures
      proper delivery of the first working fluid component 240 that
      exits the compressor 105 and a second one-way valve 262 in the
      conduit 252 that ensures proper delivery of the second working
      fluid component 242.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The heat transfer system 100 also includes a control system
      135 that is coupled to the compressor 105 and one or more devices
      within the heat transfer components 120. The control system 135
      can be a general system including sub-components that perform
      distinct steps. For example, the control system 135 includes the
      power supply 250 (such as, for example, a battery, a rectifier, or
      other electric source) that supplies a direct current electric
      power to the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Moreover, the control system 135 includes one or more of
      digital electronic circuitry, computer hardware, firmware, and
      software. The control system 135 can also include appropriate
      input and output devices, a computer processor, and a computer
      program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage
      device for execution by a programmable processor. The procedure
      embodying these techniques (discussed below) may be performed by a
      programmable processor executing a program of instructions to
      perform desired functions by operating on input data and
      generating appropriate output. Generally, a processor receives
      instructions and data from a read-only memory and/or a random
      access memory. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying
      computer program instructions and data include all forms of
      non-volatile memory, including, by way of example, semiconductor
      memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices;
      magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks;
      magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM disks. Any of the foregoing may
      be supplemented by, or incorporated in, specially-designed ASICs
      (application-specific integrated circuits).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The control system 135 receives information from components
      (such as, for example, temperature sensors and the compressor 105)
      of the system 100 and controls operation of a procedure (as
      discussed below) that can either maintain a heat source or a heat
      sink at a relatively constant temperature condition. Additionally,
      controlling the operation of an electrochemical compressor 105
      consists of turning its current on or off through the power
      supply. Alternatively, the voltage applied to the electrochemical
      compressor 105 can be set to be in proportion to the heat source
      fluid temperature or the heat sink fluid temperature. In some
      applications, such as electric cars without internal combustion
      engines, there may be an advantage in operating the vehicle air
      conditioning system electrically and driving each wheel
      independently without a central motor (required to drive the air
      conditioning system).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Referring to FIG. 3, an exemplary heat transfer system 300
      that includes a compressor 105 and a tubular system 110 is shown.
      In this case, the heat transfer system 300 is a refrigeration
      system in which the heat transfer components 120 include a first
      heat transfer device 310 that transfers heat from a first heat
      reservoir (a heat source or object to be cooled) to the working
      fluid, a second heat transfer device 315 that transfers heat from
      the working fluid to a second heat reservoir (a heat sink), and a
      thermostatic expansion valve 320 between the first and second heat
      transfer devices. The system 300 also includes one or more sensors
      (for example, temperature sensors) 325, 330 placed along flow
      paths between components of the system 300 to provide feedback to
      the control system 135, which is also coupled to the compressor
      105, the first heat transfer device 310, and the second heat
      transfer device 315.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The working fluid contained within the closed loop of the
      system 300 includes at least the first component 240 that is
      electrochemically active and therefore takes part in the
      electrochemical process within the compressor 105. The first
      component 240 is output along the conduit 350. The working fluid
      includes at least the second component 242 that is a condensable
      refrigerant that can be used for the heat transfer application
      under consideration. The condensable refrigerant is any suitable
      condensable composition that does not include water. The
      condensable refrigerant bypasses the electrochemical process
      within the compressor 105. The second component 242 is output
      along the conduit 352. As discussed above, each of the conduits
      350, 352 can include a respective one-way valve 360, 362 that
      ensures proper delivery of the respective working fluid components
      240, 242.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Additionally, the working fluid can include a third
      component (such as water) to hydrate an ion exchange membrane
      within the compressor 105 and therefore pass through the
      compressor 105 with the first component 240. Water can be
      considered a contaminant of some standard refrigerants, and it can
      negatively impact heat exchange performance of the refrigerant.
      Thus water as the third component of the working fluid can be
      reduced for example, to a minimal amount that is needed to provide
      enough hydration to one or more components of the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In some implementations, the first component (which is
      electrochemically active) includes hydrogen (H2) and the second
      component (which is a condensable refrigerant) includes carbon
      dioxide (CO2). In this implementation, the components are present
      in the proportion of approximately one part hydrogen and four
      parts of carbon dioxide by volume. The relative proportions of
      hydrogen and carbon dioxide are governed by the desired relative
      efficiency of the electrochemical compressor 105 and the system
      300. The quantity of water maintained in the working fluid is
      governed by the thickness of membranes employed in the compressor
      105, the equivalent weight (acidity) of the ion exchange media
      employed in the compressor 105, and the amount of hydrogen in the
      system 300. Thinner membranes of higher equivalent weight (that
      is, lower acidity) employed in systems with lower proton
      capability require less water. In general, the working fluid
      includes less than 50% of water, but can include less than 20%,
      less than 10%, or less than 1% water, depending on the
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] While hydrogen is used primarily as the
      electrochemically-active component of the working fluid, hydrogen
      also possesses useful heat transfer properties. Hydrogen's low
      density, high specific heat, and thermal conductivity make it a
      superior coolant. Hydrogen gas can be used as the heat transfer
      medium industrially in, for example, turbine generators. The
      presence of hydrogen gas within the working fluid thus enhances
      the performance of the condensable refrigerant; and provides
      thermal exchange opportunities at points away from thermally
      conductive surfaces of the fluid conduits and the heat transfer
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The first heat transfer device 310 includes an evaporator
      that places the working fluid in a heat exchange relationship with
      the first heat reservoir or source of heat (for example, a source
      fluid). The first heat transfer device 310 includes inlet and
      outlet ports coupled to respective conduits 311, 312 that contain
      the working fluid of the system 300. The second heat transfer
      device 315 includes a condenser that places the working fluid in a
      heat exchange relationship with the second heat reservoir or heat
      sink (for example, a sink fluid). The second heat transfer device
      315 includes inlet and outlet ports coupled to respective conduits
      316, 317 that contain the working fluid of the system 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The expansion valve 320 is an orifice that controls the
      amount of working fluid flow. The valve 320 can include a
      temperature sensing bulb filled with a similar gas as in the
      working fluid that causes the valve to open against the spring
      pressure in the valve body as the temperature on the bulb
      increases. As the temperature in the evaporator 310 decreases, so
      does the pressure in the bulb and therefore the pressure on the
      spring, causing the valve to close.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The control system 135 is coupled to the compressor 105,
      the first heat transfer device 310, and the second heat transfer
      device 315. The control system 135 is also coupled to one or more
      temperature sensors 325, 330, 340, 345 placed within the system
      300 to monitor or measure the temperature of various features of
      the system 300. For example, the temperature sensor 325 can be
      configured to measure the temperature of the working fluid within
      the conduit 311 and the temperature sensor 330 can be configured
      to measure the temperature of the working fluid within the conduit
      317. As another example, temperature sensors 340, 345 can be
      placed near respective heat transfer devices 310, 315 to measure
      the temperature at which the heat transfer device operates, to
      measure the temperature of the working fluid within the respective
      heat transfer device, or to measure the heat source fluid
      temperature or heat sink fluid temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The refrigeration system 300 can also include, though does
      not necessarily require, one-way valves 360, 362 at the output of
      the compressor 105. Each of the one-way valves 360, 362 can be a
      mechanical device, such as a check valve, that normally allows
      fluid (that is, liquid or gas) to flow through it in only one
      direction (the direction away from the compressor 105 and toward
      the tubular system 110). The valves 360, 362 ensure proper
      delivery of the components of the working fluid that exit the
      compressor 105 into the rest of the refrigeration system 300 by
      reducing or avoiding back-pressure into the last cell in the
      compressor 105, and therefore ensure unidirectional flow of the
      fluids (which include gases). For example, the valve 360 is placed
      within a conduit 350 that transports the higher pressure
      electrochemically-active component plus the small amount of water
      that is involved in the electrochemical process and the valve 362
      is placed within a conduit 352 that transports the lower pressure
      condensable refrigerant that bypasses the electrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The refrigeration system 300 can also include a dryer 370
      that is configured to remove water from the working fluid prior to
      reaching the expansion valve 320 to reduce the chance of water
      freezing within the valve 320 and potentially clogging the valve
      320, and to increase the efficiency of the expansion process
      within the valve 320.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The system 300 includes an electrochemical cell of the
      compressor 105 that compresses an electrochemically-active
      component of the working fluid, and remixes the compressed (at
      high pressure) electrochemically-active component (the first
      component) with the condensable refrigerant (the second component)
      to elevate the pressure of the mixed gas working fluid in a vapor
      compression refrigeration cycle. In this way, the electrochemical
      compressor 105 is capable of producing high pressure hydrogen gas
      from a mixed component working fluid having an
      electrochemically-active component such as, hydrogen and at least
      one condensable refrigerant. In this arrangement, hydrogen is
      compressed to a much higher pressure than the final working fluid
      pressure (that is, the pressure of the remixed working fluid), and
      because of this, the hydrogen when mixed with the lower pressure
      condensable refrigerant is at the required higher pressure. The
      exact pressure requirements for the hydrogen stream depends on the
      volume of condensable refrigerant being pressurized in relation to
      the volume of hydrogen, the desired final pressure requirements of
      the remixed working fluid, and the targeted energy efficiency. The
      tubular system 110 is employed to make sure the gas flows are
      maintained in the intended directions and that no back flow is
      allowed towards the cells of the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Referring also to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the refrigeration system
      300 includes as the tubular system 110 a Venturi tube 410 that
      receives low-pressure fluid (the unpressurized condensable
      refrigerant) 442 from the conduit 352 and high-pressure fluid (the
      pressurized electrochemically-active component plus any other
      components that travel through the condenser 105) 440 from the
      conduit 350.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The Venturi tube 410 includes at least one convergent
      nozzle 480 following a cylinder 482. The Venturi tube 410 can also
      include a divergent nozzle 484 following the convergent nozzle
      480. The Venturi tube 410 is configured to mix the low-pressure
      fluid 442 with the high-pressure fluid 440 to enable a transfer of
      kinetic energy from the high-pressure fluid 440 to the
      low-pressure fluid 442. Additionally, the Venturi tube 410 is also
      inherently configured to increase the kinetic energy of the
      low-pressure fluid 442 as it enters the convergent nozzle 480;
      because of the Bernoulli effect, the fluid 442 is supplied with
      energy by a pressure gradient force from behind as it enters the
      convergent nozzle 480, thus providing an increase in kinetic
      energy (and therefore velocity) of the fluid 442 as it passes
      through the convergent nozzle 480. Moreover, the fluids 440, 442
      leaving the convergent nozzle 480 are mixed together and slowed a
      bit as they enter the divergent nozzle 484. By the time the fluids
      440, 442 exit the divergent nozzle 484 and the Venturi tube 410,
      they are more fully mixed together, with the low-pressure fluid
      442 that exits noticing an increase in kinetic energy relative to
      the low-pressure fluid 442 that enters. In this way, the Venturi
      tube 410 enables a successful mixing between the low-pressure
      fluid 442 and the high-pressure fluid 440 that prevents or reduces
      the chance that the fluids 440, 442 are directed back into the
      compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 4A shows the conduit 350 coupled to the tube 410
      axially while FIG. 4B shows the conduit 350 coupled to the tube
      410 tangentially. In each of these designs, the fluids 440, 442
      may mix at different locations along the path through the cylinder
      482 and the convergent nozzle since the fluid 440 would be
      entering the cylinder 482 along different paths.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Referring also to FIG. 5, in another implementation, the
      refrigeration system 300 includes as the tubular system 110 a
      vortex tube 510 that receives low-pressure fluid (the condensable
      refrigerant) 542 from the conduit 352 and high-pressure fluid (the
      electrochemically-active component plus any other components that
      travel through the condenser 105) 540 from the conduit 350. The
      low-pressure fluid is injected tangentially into a swirl chamber
      580 and the high-pressure fluid is injected around a conical
      nozzle 570. In this case, the high-pressure fluid 540 rotates
      along the swirl chamber 580 and decreases in angular momentum,
      transferring its kinetic energy to the outer rotating low-pressure
      fluid 542. The fluids intermingle in the swirl chamber 580.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The vortex tube 510 does not have any moving parts and it
      operates by imparting a rotational (vortex) motion to an incoming
      compressed air stream; this is done by directing compressed air
      into an elongated and cylindrical channel in a tangential
      direction. A vortex tube 510 includes on its interior an
      aerodynamic surface in that it is designed to reduce or minimize
      the drag caused by a fluid moving through it. The conical nozzle
      570 within its interior causes a separation of fluids depending on
      its position. Therefore, although the vortex tube 510 lacks moving
      parts, a position of the conical nozzle 570 can be adjusted
      axially since such an adjustment changes a ratio of mixing of the
      fluids, and also changes outlet temperatures of the fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some implementations, the heat transfer system 100 is a
      heat exchange system 600, as shown in FIG. 6. In this case, the
      heat transfer components 120 include a heat exchanger 605 and a
      mixing device 615. The mixing device 615 can be a three-way valve
      that allows two fluids to enter through two separate ports, then
      mix the two fluids and output the mixed fluid through a third
      port. The heat exchange system 600 includes as the tubular system
      110 a vortex tube 610. The vortex tube 610 receives a compressed
      working fluid (for example, hydrogen) 620 from the electrochemical
      compressor 105 through a conduit 625 and outputs a cold gas
      exhaust 630 through an output conduit 635 to the heat exchanger
      605. The heat exchanger 605 receives the cold gas exhaust 630 and
      uses the cold gas exhaust 630 to cool a heat source by placing the
      cold gas exhaust 630 and a heat source fluid in thermal contact
      (either direct or indirect) with each other. The warmed gas
      exhaust 640 from the heat exchanger 605 and a hot gas exhaust 645
      from the vortex tube 610 are combined or mixed in the mixing
      device 615 and the output from the mixing device 615 is directed
      into the compressor 105, where the process begins over again. In
      the heat exchange system 600, the vortex tube 610 is used solely
      with one working component fluid (for example, hydrogen) and is
      used with a purpose of generating a gas stream exhaust at one side
      for cooling purposes and/or a hot gas stream on the other side
      optionally for heating purposes. The control system 135 is
      connected to one or more of the heat exchanger 605, the vortex
      tube 610, the compressor 105, and the mixing device 615 to receive
      information about the system 600 and control operation of the
      components within the system 600. For example, the control system
      135 can regulate the inlet and outlet ports of the mixing device
      615 to control the amount of fluids mixed and output to the
      compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In some implementations, heat-sinking the whole vortex tube
      510 or 610 can be helpful. Moreover, vortex tubes 510, 610 can
      also be cascaded, that is, arranged in series with each other
      along the fluid flow direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Thus, in summary, the tubular system 110 mixes pressurized
      hydrogen gas from the cathode of the electrochemical cell
      compressor 105 either on its own (as shown in FIG. 6) or
      optionally with a working fluid component (unpressurized
      condensable refrigerant) (as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4) exiting the
      anode for refrigeration cycle applications. The tubular system 110
      therefore enables the mixing of gases exiting the anode and the
      cathode of the electrochemical compressor to impart good energy
      transfer between the two gases without blow back. Additionally,
      the tubular system 110 enables the transfer of pressure or energy
      from a pressurized gas stream exiting an electrochemical cell and
      an unpressurized gas stream exiting the same electrochemical
      cell's opposite electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The heat transfer system 100 can work with a wide range of
      work fluids. However the choice of the working fluid depends on
      the application under consideration and other external regulatory
      factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In some implementations, the vortex tube 510, 610 is a
      vortex tube model number 106-2-H (57 SLPM) from Vortec Division of
      ITW Air Management, Cincinnati, Ohio that is combined with a
      4Hm-series hydrogen generator producing pressurized hydrogen from
      electrolysis (which can simulate the performance of an
      electrochemical compressor) to produce 100 BTUH cooling effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In some implementations such as that shown in FIG. 6, the
      electrochemical compressor 105 is a 10 cm*10 cm cell that produces
      pressurized hydrogen, and is combined with the vortex tube 610
      directly to produce cooling and heating gas streams, which are
      then recombined and fed back into the electrochemical cell of the
      compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Referring to FIG. 7, a procedure 700 is performed for
      transferring heat using a working fluid that is circulated through
      and contained within a closed loop of the heat transfer system 100
      of FIGS. 1 and 2. Initially, a pressure of at least one
      electrochemically-active component of the working fluid is
      increased (step 705). The pressure of the electrochemically-active
      component is increased by circulating the electrochemically-active
      component through the electrochemical compressor 105 and
      outputting the pressurized electrochemically-active component. The
      working fluid including the pressurized electrochemically-active
      component and, if present, other components of the working fluid
      that bypass the electrochemical compressor 105 are outputted (step
      710), for example, to the tubular system 110. The tubular system
      110, which is a body of revolution, imparts a gain in kinetic
      energy to at least a portion of the outputted working fluid due to
      its geometry (step 715).<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The general procedure 700 is performed as a part of a heat
      transfer procedure that uses all of the components (such as the
      heat transfer components 120) of the heat transfer system 100. For
      example, with reference to FIG. 8, the refrigeration system 300
      performs a procedure 800 for transferring heat from a heat source
      (for example, at the first heat transfer device 310 of the system
      300) to the heat sink (for example, at the second heat transfer
      device 315 of the system 300).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Low pressure (that is, unpressurized) working fluid (which
      is typically a gas mixture of hydrogen, condensable refrigerant,
      and water) enters the compressor 105 (step 805). A mixture of
      hydrogen and water is dissociated from the condensable refrigerant
      (step 810). In particular, the hydrogen (in the form of a proton)
      and water dissolve into the ion exchange media while the
      condensable refrigerant does not. The condensable refrigerant is
      diverted along a path separate from the electrochemical path
      through the membrane electrode assembly (step 815). The
      dissociated mixture is then pumped across the membrane electrode
      assembly of each cell in the compressor 105 (step 820). In
      particular, electrons are stripped from the hydrogen in the
      hydrogen/water mixture at the anode collector of the cell, and the
      hydrogen ions are transported across the anode, electrolyte, and
      toward the cathode due to the electrical potential applied across
      the collectors from the power supply. Additionally, the hydrogen
      ion gas is pressurized across the membrane electrode assembly.
      Next, the hydrogen ions are recombined with the electrons at the
      cathode collector to reform hydrogen gas at a higher pressure, and
      this higher pressure hydrogen gas is recombined with the diverted
      condensable refrigerant to thereby raise the pressure of the
      working fluid (step 830) for example, by directing the diverted
      condensable refrigerant and the pressurized mixture exiting the
      compressor 105 through the tubular system 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Thus, the electrochemical compressor 105 raises the
      pressure of the working fluid and delivers the higher pressure
      working fluid to the second heat transfer device (the condenser)
      315 where the condensable refrigerant is precipitated by heat
      exchange with the sink fluid (step 835). The working fluid is then
      reduced in pressure in the expansion valve 320 (step 840).
      Subsequently, the low pressure working fluid is delivered to the
      first heat transfer device (the evaporator) 310 where the
      condensed phase of the working fluid is boiled by heat exchange
      with the source fluid (step 845). The evaporator effluent working
      fluid may be partially in the gas phase and partially in the
      liquid phase when it is returned from the evaporator to the
      electrochemical compressor 105. In the process, heat energy is
      transported from the evaporator to the condenser and consequently,
      from the heat source at a relatively lower temperature to the heat
      sink at relatively higher temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Referring also to FIG. 9, concurrently with the procedure
      800, the control system 135 performs a procedure 950 for
      controlling the amount of electrical potential applied to the
      current collectors of the compressor 105, and therefore also
      controlling the amount of heat energy transported from the
      evaporator to the condenser. The control system 135 receives
      information from the one or more sensors (for example, temperature
      or pressure sensors) in the system 300 indicating physical
      characteristics (such as temperature or pressure) at key locations
      of the system 300 (step 955). The control system 135 analyzes the
      information (step 960) and determines whether physical properties
      of the system 300 need to be adjusted based on the analyzed
      information (step 965). For example, the control system 135 can
      determine that a current applied to the compressor 105 (and
      therefore the current applied to the electrode collectors) needs
      to be adjusted. As another example, the control system 135 can
      determine that a flow rate of one or more of the heat sink fluid
      and the heat source fluid that transport heat from and to the
      devices 315, 310 needs to be adjusted. If the control system 135
      determines that a physical property of the system 300 should be
      adjusted, then the control system 135 sends a signal to the
      component that is affected to adjust the particular property (step
      970). For example, the control system 135 can send a signal to the
      power supply to adjust the amount of current applied to the
      current collectors in the compressor 105. Otherwise, the control
      system 135 continues to receive information from the one or more
      sensors (step 955).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The energy efficiency of the system 100 depends on the
      available surface area of the anode 205 and the cathode 210, and
      the current density and operating voltage applied to the cells
      from the power supply. Higher current densities result in greater
      the resistive losses for the system 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The size reduction of the compressor 105 is feasible
      because of its cellular design, and because it is operating using
      an electrochemical process. If an application requires significant
      size reductions, the electrode (the anode and the cathode)
      surfaces can be reduced, the applied current densities and
      voltages can be increased, and as a result a smaller mass of cells
      can be employed in the compressor 105. This would result in an
      almost order of magnitude reduction in size and weight for the
      system 100 compared to conventional mechanical systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Since cooling capacity is linked to applied current and
      voltage, one advantage of this system is that it can more easily
      modulate from low capacity (that is, low current density at a
      specific voltage) to a high capacity. A system 100 designed to
      operate at high capacities actually becomes more efficient at
      lower utilizations, while, the opposite is true for mechanical
      systems.<br>

      The disclosed subject matter relates to a refrigeration system
      that includes a vapor- compression refrigeration cycle that
      includes an electrochemical compressor configured to transfer a
      refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The function of both refrigeration cycles and heat pumps is to
      remove heat from a heat source or reservoir at low temperature and
      to reject the heat to a heat sink or reservoir at high
      temperature. While many thermodynamic effects have been exploited
      in the development of heat pumps and refrigeration cycles, the
      most popular today is the vapor compression approach. This
      approach is sometimes called mechanical refrigeration because a
      mechanical compressor is used in the cycle. Mechanical compressors
      account for approximately 30% of a household's energy requirements
      and thus consume a substantial portion of most utilities' base
      load power. Any improvement in efficiency related to compressor
      performance can have significant benefits in terms of energy
      savings and thus have significant positive environmental impact.
      In addition, there are increasing thermal management problems in
      electronic circuits, which require smaller heat pumping devices
      with greater thermal management capabilities.<br>
      Vapor compression refrigeration cycles generally contain five
      important components. The first is a mechanical compressor that is
      used to pressurize a gaseous working fluid. After proceeding
      through the compressor, the hot pressurized working fluid is
      condensed in a condenser. The latent heat of vaporization of the
      working fluid is given up to a high temperature reservoir often
      called the sink. The liquefied working fluid is then expanded at
      substantially constant enthalpy in a thermal expansion valve or
      orifice. The cooled liquid working fluid is then passed through an
      evaporator. In the evaporator, the working fluid absorbs its
      latent heat of vaporization from a low temperature reservoir often
      called a source. The last element in the vapor compression
      refrigeration cycle is the working fluid itself.<br>
      <br>
      In conventional vapor compression cycles, the working fluid
      selection is based on the properties of the fluid and the
      temperatures of the heat source and sink. The factors in the
      selection include the specific heat of the working fluid, its
      latent heat of vaporization, its specific volume and its safety.
      The selection of the working fluid affects the coefficient of
      performance of the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      For a refrigeration cycle operating between a lower limit, or
      source temperature, and an upper limit, or sink temperature, the
      maximum efficiency of the cycle is limited to the Carnot
      efficiency. The efficiency of a refrigeration cycle is generally
      defined by its coefficient of performance, which is the quotient
      of the heat absorbed from the sink divided by the net work input
      required by the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In one general aspect, a refrigeration system conveys heat from a
      first heat reservoir at a relatively low temperature to a second
      heat reservoir at relatively high temperature. The refrigeration
      system defines a closed loop that contains a working fluid, at
      least part of the working fluid being circulated through the
      closed loop. The refrigeration system includes a first heat
      transfer device that transfers heat from the first heat reservoir
      to the working fluid, a second heat transfer device that transfers
      heat from the working fluid to the second heat reservoir, an
      expansion valve between the first and second heat transfer devices
      that reduces pressure of the working fluid, and an electrochemical
      compressor between the first and second heat transfer devices. The
      electrochemical compressor includes one or more electrochemical
      cells electrically connected to each other through a power supply,
      each electrochemical cell including a gas pervious anode, a gas
      pervious cathode, and an electrolytic membrane disposed between
      and in intimate electrical contact with the cathode and the anode;<br>
      <br>
      Implementations can include one or more of the following features.
      For example, the working fluid can include a condensable
      refrigerant that bypasses the electrochemical process; and an
      electrochemically active fluid that participates in the
      electrochemical process within the electrochemical compressor. In
      other implementations, the working fluid can include a condensable
      refrigerant; water; and an electrochemically active fluid. In
      other implementations, the working fluid includes a condensable
      refrigerant that is not water; and an electrochemically active
      fluid. In some implementations, the condensable refrigerant does
      not participate in the electrochemical process. The working fluid
      can include carbon dioxide. The working fluid can include a
      fluorocarbon gas. The electrolytic membrane can include a solid
      electrolyte, for example, a gel.<br>
      The refrigeration system can include a temperature sensor
      thermally coupled to one or more of the working fluid, the first
      heat transfer device, and the second heat transfer device. The
      first heat transfer device can include a condenser. The second
      heat transfer device can include an evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      The electrochemical compressor can include a cathode gas space on
      a nonelectrolyte side of the cathode; and an anode gas space on a
      nonelectrolyte side of the anode. The electrochemical compressor
      can include a first electrochemically active route that traverses
      the anode and cathode; a second non-electrochemical route that
      bypasses the anode and cathode; and a combiner that combines the
      components that have traversed the first and second routes.<br>
      <br>
      The refrigeration system can also include a mechanical compressor.
      The mechanical compressor can be in series with the
      electrochemical compressor. The mechanical compressor can be
      between the electrochemical compressor and the first heat transfer
      device. The mechanical compressor can be between the
      electrochemical compressor and second heat transfer device.<br>
      <br>
      In another general aspect, an electrochemical compressor includes
      an inlet fluidly coupled to an evaporator to receive a working
      fluid that comprises a condensable refrigerant and an
      electrochemically active fluid; an outlet fluidly coupled to a
      condenser; and one or more electrochemical cells electrically
      connected to each other through a power supply. Each
      electrochemical cell includes a gas pervious anode, a gas pervious
      cathode, and an electrolytic membrane disposed between and in
      intimate electrical contact with the cathode and the anode. The
      anode, the cathode, and the electrolytic membrane are configured
      to pass the electrochemically active fluid. The electrochemical
      cell is configured to disassociate the condensable refrigerant
      from the electrochemically active fluid to prevent the condensable
      refrigerant from passing through the anode, the cathode, and the
      electrolytic membrane. The electrolytic membrane includes a
      membrane having a porous microstructure and an ion exchange
      material impregnated throughout the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      Implementations can include one or more of the following features.
      For example, the impregnated membrane can have a Gurley number of
      greater than 10,000 seconds. The ion exchange membrane can be able
      to withstand a pressure gradient between a side adjacent the anode
      and a side adjacent the cathode. The ion exchange membrane can be
      able to withstand a pressure gradient of at least 30 psi between a
      side adjacent the anode and a side adjacent the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      The ion exchange membrane can include a synthetic fluoropolymer of
      tetrafluoroethylene. The synthetic fluoropolymer can be an
      expanded polytetrafiuoroethylene having a porous microstructure of
      polymeric fibrils. The ion exchange material can substantially
      impregnate the membrane so as to render an interior volume of the
      membrane substantially occlusive. The ion exchange material can be
      impermeable to gas. The ion exchange material can be permeable to
      gas. The ion exchange material can be selected from a group
      consisting of perfluorinated sulfonic acid resin, perfluorinated
      carboxylic acid resin, polyvinyl alcohol, divinyl benzene,
      styrene-based polymers, and metal salts with or without a polymer.<br>
      <br>
      The anode, the cathode, and the electrolytic membrane can be
      configured to pass the electrochemically active fluid if the
      working fluid includes less than 50% of water.<br>
      <br>
      The one or more electrochemical cells can be connected in parallel
      with each other. A first electrochemically active route can be
      defined by the anode, the electrolytic membrane, and the cathode;
      and a second non-electrochemical route bypasses the anode, the
      electrolytic membrane, and the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor can include a combiner that combines the components
      of the working fluid that have traversed the first, route, the
      second route, or both the first and second routes. The ion
      exchange material can include a liquid electrolyte embedded in a
      matrix. The ion exchange material can include an anionic exchange
      membrane and the anode gas space operates at a higher pressure
      than the cathode gas space.<br>
      <br>
      The porous membrane can have a total thickness of less than 0.025
      mm.<br>
      <br>
      In another general aspect, a method of refrigeration includes
      conveying heat from a first heat reservoir at a relatively low
      temperature to a second heat reservoir at relatively high
      temperature by circulating a working fluid through a closed loop
      that is thermally coupled to the first heat reservoir at a first
      portion and is thermally coupled to the second heat reservoir at a
      second portion. The conveying includes transferring heat from the
      working fluid at the second loop portion to the second heat
      reservoir including liquefying at least some of the working fluid;
      reducing a pressure of the at least partially liquefied working
      fluid by expanding the working fluid at a substantially constant
      enthalpy; and transferring heat from the first heat reservoir to
      the working fluid at the first loop portion including vaporizing
      at least some of the working fluid. The conveying also includes
      increasing a pressure of the working fluid by dissociating an
      electrochemically active fluid from a condensable refrigerant
      within the working fluid to enable the condensable refrigerant to
      separate from the electrochemically active fluid,
      electrochemically ionizing the electrochemically active fluid by
      stripping charged particles from the electrochemically active
      fluid, enabling the ionized electrochemically active fluid to pass
      through an electrolytic membrane, pumping the charged particles to
      create an electric potential gradient across the electrolytic
      membrane, pumping the ionized electrochemically active fluid
      across the electrolytic membrane using the electric potential
      gradient, electrochemically de-ionizing the electrochemically
      active fluid by combining the pumped charged particles with the
      ionized electrochemically active fluid, and pressuring the de
      -ionized electrochemically active fluid. The conveying further
      includes re-associating the pressurized de-ionized
      electrochemically active fluid with the condensable refrigerant to
      form a pressurized working fluid that flows to the second loop
      portion. Implementations can include one or more of the following
      features. For example, dissociating the electrochemically active
      fluid from the condensable refrigerant can include passing the
      working fluid through an anode gas space to thereby dissociate the
      electrochemically active fluid from the condensable refrigerant
      within the working fluid. Electrochemically ionizing the
      electrochemically active fluid by stripping charged particles from
      the electrochemically active fluid can include electrochemically
      ionizing the electrochemically active fluid within a gas pervious
      anode adjacent the anode gas space. Enabling the ionized
      electrochemically active fluid to pass through the electrolytic
      membrane can include enabling the ionized electrochemically active
      fluid to enter the electrolytic membrane that is disposed between
      the gas pervious anode and a gas pervious cathode. Pumping the
      charged particles to create the electric potential gradient across
      the electrolytic membrane can include pumping electrons from the
      gas pervious anode to the gas pervious cathode to create the
      electric potential gradient between the gas pervious anode and the
      gas pervious cathode, and pumping the ionized electrochemically
      active fluid across the electrolytic membrane using the electric
      potential gradient can include pumping the ionized
      electrochemically active fluid to the gas pervious cathode.
      Electrochemically de-ionizing the electrochemically active fluid
      can include combining the pumped charged particles in the gas
      pervious cathode with the ionized electrochemically active fluid,
      and pressuring the de-ionized electrochemically active fluid can
      include pressuring the de-ionized electrochemically active fluid
      within a cathode gas space that is adjacent the gas pervious
      cathode and is maintained at a higher pressure than the anode gas
      space. The method can also include controlling the amount of heat
      conveyed by varying one or more of a current and a voltage applied
      to pump the charged particles to create the electric potential
      gradient across the electrolytic membrane.<br>
      <br>
      There are several benefits to using carbon dioxide as a
      refrigerant in a refrigeration system. If carbon dioxide manages
      to leak out of the system, and make its way up to the ozone layer,
      the ultraviolet radiation does not break up the molecule to
      release highly active chlorine radicals that help to deplete the
      ozone layer. Therefore, carbon dioxide does not deplete the ozone
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, while many have noted a few problems associated with the
      use of carbon dioxide in refrigeration systems, for example,
      requiring operating at higher pressure and higher compressor
      temperature, these operating requirements are found to be more
      advantageous in automotive applications. The very high cycle
      pressure results in a high fluid density throughout the cycle,
      allowing miniaturization of the systems for the same heat pumping
      power requirements. Furthermore, the high outlet temperature of
      the compressor can permit faster defrosting of automobile
      windshields and can even be used for combined space heating and
      hot water heating in home usage. In fuel cell applications
      involving the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbon sources such
      as natural gas, hydrogen gas is fed to the electrode assembly as a
      mixed gas stream with carbon dioxide present (typically referred
      to as reformate). Thus, electrodes have been developed and are
      commercially available (such as W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc.
      series 56 PRIMEA assembly) with suitable electrochemical
      performance with mixed hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas streams.
      The vapor compression refrigeration system uses an electrochemical
      compressor and therefore is modular (that is, it can be of
      different sizes without limitation). The vapor compression
      refrigeration system is electrically driven and thus fully
      electronically controlled. The vapor compression refrigeration
      system can be considered essentially noiseless, and thus is less
      noisy than conventional mechanical refrigeration systems. The
      vapor compression refrigeration system is more efficient than
      conventional mechanical refrigeration systems.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 1, an exemplary refrigeration system 100 defines
      a closed loop that contains a working fluid. The system 100
      includes an electrochemical compressor 105 that lacks moving
      parts, a first heat transfer device 110 that transfers heat from a
      first heat reservoir (a heat source or object to be cooled) to the
      working fluid, a second heat transfer device 115 that transfers
      heat from the working fluid to a second heat reservoir (a heat
      sink), and a thermostatic expansion valve 120 between the first
      and second heat transfer devices. The system 100 also includes one
      or more sensors (for example, temperature sensors) 125, 130 placed
      along flow paths between components of the system 100 to provide
      feedback to a control system 135 that is also coupled to the
      compressor 105, the first heat transfer device 110, and the second
      heat transfer device 115. The working fluid contained within the
      closed loop of the system 100 includes at least a first component
      that is electrochemically active and therefore takes part in the
      electrochemical process within the compressor 105. The working
      fluid includes at least a second component that is a condensable
      refrigerant that can be used for the heat pump application under
      consideration. The condensable refrigerant is any suitable
      condensable composition that does not include water. As discussed
      below, the condensable refrigerant bypasses the electrochemical
      process within the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the working fluid includes a third component that is
      water to hydrate an ion exchange membrane within the compressor
      105 (as discussed below). Water can be considered a contaminant of
      some standard refrigerants, and it can negatively impact heat
      exchange performance of the refrigerant. Thus water as the third
      component of the working fluid can be reduced for example, to a
      minimal amount that is needed to provide enough hydration to one
      or more components of the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      In some implementations, the first component (which is
      electrochemically active) includes hydrogen (H2) and the second
      component (which is a condensable refrigerant) includes carbon
      dioxide (CO2). In this implementation, the components are present
      in the proportion of approximately one part hydrogen and four
      parts of carbon dioxide by volume. The relative proportions of
      hydrogen and carbon dioxide are governed by the desired relative
      efficiency of the electrochemical compressor 105 and the system
      100. The quantity of water maintained in the working fluid is
      governed by the thickness of membranes employed in the compressor
      105, the equivalent weight (acidity) of the ion exchange media
      employed in the compressor 105, and the amount of hydrogen in the
      system 100. Thinner membranes of higher equiv`alent weight (that
      is, lower acidity) employed in systems with lower proton
      capability require less water. In general, the working fluid
      includes less than 50% of water, but can include less than 20%,
      less than 10%, or less than 1% water, depending on the
      application. It should be noted that while hydrogen is being used
      primarily as the electrochemically active component of the working
      fluid, hydrogen also possesses useful heat transfer properties.
      Hydrogen's low density, high specific heat, and thermal
      conductivity make it a superior coolant. Hydrogen gas can be used
      as the heat transfer medium industrially in, for example, turbine
      generators. The presence of hydrogen gas within the working fluid
      thus enhances the performance of the condensable refrigerant; and
      provides thermal exchange opportunities at points away from
      thermally conductive surfaces of the fluid conduits and the heat
      transfer devices.<br>
      <br>
      The first heat transfer device 110 includes an evaporator that
      acts as a heat exchanger that places the working fluid in a heat
      exchange relationship with the first heat reservoir or source of
      heat (for example, a source fluid). The first heat transfer device
      110 includes inlet and outlet ports coupled to respective conduits
      111, 112 that contain the working fluid of the system 100. The
      second heat transfer device 115 includes a condenser that acts as
      a heat exchanger that places the working fluid in a heat exchange
      relationship with the second heat reservoir or heat sink (for
      example, a sink fluid). The second heat transfer device 115
      includes inlet and outlet ports coupled to respective conduits
      116, 117 that contain the working fluid of the system 100. The
      expansion valve 120 is an orifice that is able controls the amount
      of working fluid flow. The valve 120 can include a temperature
      sensing bulb filled with a similar gas as in the working fluid
      that causes the valve to open against the spring pressure in the
      valve body as the temperature on the bulb increases. As
      temperatures in the evaporator 110 decrease, so does the pressure
      in the bulb and therefore on the spring causing the valve to
      close. Referring also to Fig. 2, the electrochemical compressor
      105 is a device that raises the pressure of a component of the
      working fluid 200 by an electrochemical process. Accordingly, at
      least one component of the working fluid must be electrochemically
      active. In particular, the electrochemically active component (the
      first component) must be ionizable. For example, the
      electrochemically active component is oxidizable at a gas pervious
      anode 205 of the compressor 105 and is reducible at a gas pervious
      cathode 210 of the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      The design in which the compressor 105 includes only one exemplary
      cell 202 is shown in Fig. 2. However, the electrochemical
      compressor 105 can include a plurality of electrochemical cells
      302, as shown in Figs. 3A-C. In some implementations, the
      electrochemical compressor 105 is an annular stack of
      electrochemical cells electrically connected in series such as,
      for example, the cells generally described in U.S. Patent. No.
      2,913,511 (Grubb); in U.S. Patent No. 3,432,355 (Neidrach); and in
      U.S. Patent No. 3,489,670 (Maget).<br>
      <br>
      Each cell 202 includes the anode 205, where the electrochemically
      active component (EC) of the working fluid is oxidized; the
      cathode 210, where the electrochemically active component EC of
      the working fluid is reduced; and an electrolyte 215 that serves
      to conduct the ionic species (EC&lt;+&gt;) from the anode 205 to
      the cathode 210. The electrolyte 215 can be an impermeable solid
      ion exchange membrane having a porous microstructure and an ion
      exchange material impregnated through the membrane such that the
      electrolyte 215 can withstand an appreciable pressure gradient
      between its anode and cathode sides. The examples provided here
      employ impermeable ion exchange membranes, and the
      electrochemically active component of the working fluid is remixed
      with the working fluid after compression and thus the pressure of
      the working fluid 200 is elevated prior to the condensation phase
      of the refrigeration process. However, a permeable ion exchange
      membrane is also feasible with the working fluid traversing in a
      unidirectional and sequential path through electrode assemblies
      with increasing pressure. The active components of the working
      fluid dissolve into the ion exchange media of the ion exchange
      membrane and the gas in the working fluid traverses through the
      ion exchange membrane.<br>
      <br>
      As another example, the electrolyte 215 can be made of a solid
      electrolyte, for example, a gel, that is, any solid, jelly-like
      material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to
      hard and tough and being defined as a substantially dilute
      crosslinked system that exhibits no flow when in the steady-state.
      The solid electrolyte can be made very thin, for example, it can
      have a thickness of less than 0.2 mm, to provide additional
      strength to the gel. Alternatively, the solid electrolyte can have
      a thickness of less than 0.2 mm if it is reinforced with one or
      more reinforcing layers like a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      membrane (having a thickness of about 0.04 mm or less) depending
      on the application and the ion exchange media of the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the anode 205 and the cathode 210 can be an
      electrocatalyst such as platinum or palladium or any other
      suitable candidate catalyst. The electrolyte 215 can be a solid
      polymer electrolyte such as Nafion (trademark for an ion exchange
      membrane manufactured by the I. E. DuPont DeNemours Company) or
      GoreSelect (trademark for a composite ion exchange membrane
      manufactured by W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc.). The catalysts
      (that is, the anode 205 and the cathode 210) are intimately bonded
      to each side of the electrolyte 215. The anode 205 includes an
      anode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 207 and the cathode 210
      includes a cathode gas space (a gas diffusion media) 212. The
      electrodes (the anode 205 and the cathode 210) of the cell 202 can
      be considered as the electrocatalytic structure that is bonded to
      the solid electrolyte 215. The combination of the electrolyte 215
      (which can be an ion exchange membrane) and the electrodes (the
      anode 205 and the cathode 210) is referred to as a membrane
      electrode assembly or MEA.<br>
      <br>
      Adjacent the anode gas space 207 is an anode current collector 209
      and adjacent the cathode gas space 212 is a cathode current
      collector 214. The anode collector 209 and the cathode collector
      214 are electrically driven by the power supply 250. The anode
      collector 209 and the cathode collector 214 are porous,
      electronically conductive structures that can be woven metal
      screens (also available from Tech Etch) or woven carbon cloth or
      pressed carbon fiber or variations thereof. The pores in the
      current collectors 209, 214 serve to facilitate the flow of gases
      within the gas spaces 207, 212 adjacent to the respective
      electrodes 205, 210.<br>
      <br>
      Outer surfaces of the collectors 209, 214 are connected to
      respective bipolar plates 221, 226 that provide fluid barriers
      that retain the gases within the cell 202. Additionally, if the
      cell 202 is provided in a stack of cells, then the bipolar plates
      221, 226 separate the anode and cathode gases within each of the
      adjacent cells in the cell stack from each other and facilitate
      the conduction of electricity from one cell to the next cell in
      the cell stack of the compressor. The bipolar plate 221, 226 can
      be obtained from a number of suppliers including Tech Etch
      (Massachusetts).<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, subassemblies of components of the electrochemical
      cell can be commercially obtained from manufacturers such as W.L.
      Gore &amp; Associates Inc. under the PRIMEA trademark or Ion Power
      Inc. Commercially available assemblies are designed for oxygen
      reduction on one electrode and therefore the electrodes (the anode
      205 and cathode 210) may need to be modified for hydrogen
      reduction.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen reduction at the cathode 210 actually requires lower
      loadings of precious metal catalysts and also is feasible with
      alternative lower cost catalysts such as palladium. Thus, the
      eventual production costs of assemblies employed in the system 100
      are substantially lower than typical fuel cell components. As
      mentioned above, the control system 135 is coupled to the
      compressor 105, the first heat transfer device 110, and the second
      heat transfer device 115. The control system 135 is also coupled
      to one or more temperature sensors 125, 130, 140, 145 placed
      within the system 100 to monitor or measure the temperature of
      various features of the system 100. For example, the temperature
      sensor 125 can be configured to measure the temperature of the
      working fluid within the conduit 111 and the temperature sensor
      130 can be configured to measure the temperature of the working
      fluid within the conduit 117. As another example, temperature
      sensors 140, 145 can be placed near respective heat transfer
      devices 110, 115 to measure the temperature at which the heat
      transfer device operates, to measure the temperature of the
      working fluid within the respective heat transfer device, or to
      measure the heat source fluid temperature or heat sink fluid
      temperature. The control system 135 can be a general system
      including sub-components that perform distinct steps. For example,
      the control system 135 includes the power supply 250 (such as, for
      example, a battery, a rectifier, or other electric source) that
      supplies a direct current electric power to the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the control system 135 can include one or more of
      digital electronic circuitry, computer hardware, firmware, and
      software. The control system 135 can also include appropriate
      input and output devices, a computer processor, and a computer
      program product tangibly embodied in a machine -readable storage
      device for execution by a programmable processor. The procedure
      embodying these techniques (discussed below) may be performed by a
      programmable processor executing a program of instructions to
      perform desired functions by operating on input data and
      generating appropriate output. Generally, a processor receives
      instructions and data from a read-only memory and/or a random
      access memory. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying
      computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-
      volatile memory, including, by way of example, semiconductor
      memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices;
      magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks;
      magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM disks. Any of the foregoing may
      be supplemented by, or incorporated in, specially-designed ASICs
      (application-specific integrated circuits).<br>
      <br>
      The controller 135 receives information from components (such as
      the temperature sensors and the compressor 105) of the system 100
      and controls operation of a procedure (as discussed below) that
      can either maintain the heat source or the heat sink at a
      relatively constant temperature condition. Additionally,
      controlling the operation of an electrochemical compressor 105
      consists of turning its current on or off through the power
      supply. Alternatively, the voltage applied to the electrochemical
      compressor 105 can be set to be in proportion to the heat source
      fluid temperature or the heat sink fluid temperature. In some
      applications, such as electric cars without internal combustion
      engines, there may be an advantage in operating the vehicle air
      conditioning system electrically and driving each wheel
      independently without a central motor (required to drive the air
      conditioning system).<br>
      <br>
      The refrigeration system 100 can also include one-way valves 150,
      155 at the output of the compressor 105. The one-way valve 150,
      155 can be any mechanical device, such as a check valve, that
      normally allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it in only
      one direction (the direction of the arrows). The valves 150, 155
      ensure proper delivery of the components of the working fluid that
      exit the compressor 105 into the rest of the refrigeration system
      100 by reducing or avoiding back-pressure into the last cell in
      the compressor 105, and therefore ensure unidirectional flow of
      the fluids (which include gases). For example, the valve 150 is
      placed within a conduit 152 that transports the high pressure
      electrochemically active component plus the small amount of water
      that is involved in the electrochemical process and the valve 155
      is placed within a conduit 157 that transports the condensable
      refrigerant that bypasses the electrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      The refrigeration system 100 can also include a dryer 160 that is
      configured to remove water from the working fluid prior to
      reaching the expansion valve 120 to reduce the chance of water
      freezing within the valve 120 and potentially clogging the valve
      120, and to increase the efficiency of the expansion process
      within the valve 120.<br>
      <br>
      Referring also to Fig. 3 A, in another implementation, the
      electrochemical compressor 105 includes a plurality of cells 300,
      301, 302, 303 arranged in series with each other, with the first
      cell 300 receiving the low pressure working fluid 200 from the
      conduit 112 and diverting the low pressure refrigerant along
      conduit 305. In this implementation, only the first cell 300
      diverts the low pressure refrigerant along the conduit 305. An
      output 310 from the first cell 300 is a higher pressure mixture of
      the electrochemically active component and water; the output 310
      is fed into an input 311 of the second cell 301. Likewise, an
      output 312 from the second cell 301 is fed into an input 313 of
      the third cell 302, and an output 314 of the third cell 302 is fed
      into an input 315 of the fourth cell 303. An output 316 from the
      fourth cell 303 carries the high pressure mixture of the
      electrochemically active component and water, and this output is
      mixed with the diverted refrigerant in conduit 305, as discussed
      above, and directed along conduit 116 toward the second heat
      transfer device 115.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 3A, the power supply is connected to the anode
      and cathode collector of each of the cells 300, 301, 302, 303. In
      other implementations, the anode collector of the cell 300 and the
      cathode collector of the cell 303 are the only collectors
      connected to the power supply. In this case, the end plates of
      each cell receive all the current and the current is then
      "conveyed" across the cells.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 3B, in another implementation, the
      electrochemical compressor 105 includes a plurality of cells 320,
      321, 322 arranged in series with each other, with the first cell
      320 receiving the low pressure working fluid 200 from the conduit
      112 and diverting the low pressure refrigerant along conduit 325.
      In this implementation, the low pressure refrigerant is mixed with
      the higher pressure mixture of the electrochemically active
      component and water directed through an output after each of the
      cells 320, 321, 322 and each of the cells 320, 321, 322 diverts
      the low pressure refrigerant. Thus, output 330 from the first cell
      320 is a higher pressure mixture of the electrochemically active
      component and water and this mixture is mixed with the diverted
      low pressure refrigerant traveling in the conduit 325 to form a
      mixture of the higher pressure electrochemically active component,
      the water, and the refrigerant that is directed to an input 331 of
      the second cell 321. An output 333 from the second cell 321 is a
      higher pressure mixture of the electrochemically active component
      and water and this mixture is mixed with the diverted low pressure
      refrigerant traveling in conduit 332 to form a mixture of the
      higher pressure electrochemically active component, the water, and
      the refrigerant that is directed to an input 334 of the third cell
      322. Lastly, an output 336 from the third cell 322 is a higher
      pressure mixture of the electrochemically active component and
      water and this mixture is mixed with the diverted low pressure
      refrigerant traveling in conduit 335 to form a mixture of the
      higher pressure electrochemically active component, the water, and
      the refrigerant that is directed along conduit 116 toward the
      second heat transfer device 115.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 3B, the power supply is connected to the anode
      collector of the first cell 320 and to the cathode collector of
      the third cell 322. In this case, the end plates of each cell
      receive all the current and the current is then "conveyed" across
      the cells. In other implementations, the anode collector and
      cathode collector of each of the cells 320, 321, 322 are connected
      to the power supply. Referring to Fig. 3C, in another
      implementation, the electrochemical compressor 105 includes a
      plurality of cells 350, 351, 352, 353 arranged in parallel with
      each other, with each of the cells 350, 351, 352, 353 receiving
      the low pressure working fluid 200 from the conduit 112 and each
      of the cells 350, 351, 352, 353 diverting the low pressure
      refrigerant along respective conduits 360, 361, 362, 363. In this
      implementation, the low pressure refrigerant from each of the
      cells 350, 351, 352, 353 is mixed together and passed through
      conduit 364, and the high pressure mixture of the
      electrochemically active component and water directed through
      respective outputs 370, 371, 372, 373 of each of the cells 350,
      351, 352, 353 is mixed together and passed through conduit 374.
      These two mixtures in the conduits 364 and 374 are combined with
      each other and directed along the conduit 116 toward the second
      heat transfer device 115. The power supply can be connected to the
      anode collector and to the cathode connector of each of the cells
      350, 351, 352, 353.<br>
      <br>
      While three or four cells are shown in these drawings, it is noted
      that any number of cells can be used in the compressor 105, and
      the number of cells can be selected depending on the cooling
      application of the system 100.<br>
      <br>
      Referring also to Fig. 4A, the system 100 performs a procedure 400
      for transferring heat from the heat source at the first heat
      transfer device 110 to the heat sink at the second heat transfer
      device 115.<br>
      Low pressure working fluid 200 (which is typically a gas mixture
      of hydrogen, condensable refrigerant, and water) enters compressor
      105 (step 405). A mixture of hydrogen and water is dissociated
      from the condensable refrigerant (step 410). In particular, the
      hydrogen (in the form of a proton) and water dissolve into the ion
      exchange media while the condensable refrigerant does not. The
      condensable refrigerant is diverted along a path separate from the
      electrochemical path through the membrane electrode assembly (step
      415). The dissociated mixture is then pumped across the membrane
      electrode assembly of each cell in the compressor 105 (step 420).
      In particular, electrons are stripped from the hydrogen in the
      hydrogen/water mixture at the anode collector of the cell, and the
      hydrogen ions are transported across the anode, electrolyte, and
      toward the cathode due to the electrical potential applied across
      the collectors from the power supply. Additionally, the hydrogen
      ion gas is pressurized across the membrane electrode assembly.
      Next, the hydrogen ions are recombined with the electrons at the
      cathode collector to reform hydrogen gas at a higher pressure, and
      this higher pressure hydrogen gas is recombined with the diverted
      condensable refrigerant to thereby raise the pressure of the
      working fluid (step 430).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the electrochemical compressor 105 raises the pressure of
      the working fluid 200 and delivers the higher pressure working
      fluid 200 to the second heat transfer device (the condenser) 115
      where the condensable refrigerant is precipitated by heat exchange
      with the sink fluid (step 435). The working fluid is then reduced
      in pressure in the expansion valve 120 (step 440). Subsequently,
      the low pressure working fluid is delivered to the first heat
      transfer device (the evaporator) 110 where the condensed phase of
      the working fluid is boiled by heat exchange with the source fluid
      (step 445). The evaporator effluent working fluid may be partially
      in the gas phase and partially in the liquid phase when it is
      returned from the evaporator to the electrochemical compressor
      105. In the process, heat energy is transported from the
      evaporator to the condenser and consequently, from the heat source
      at a relatively lower temperature to the heat sink at relatively
      higher temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Referring also to Fig. 4B, concurrently with the procedure 400,
      the control system 135 performs a procedure 450 for controlling
      the amount of electrical potential applies to the current
      collectors of the compressor 105, and therefore also controls the
      amount of heat energy transported from the evaporator to the
      condenser. The control system 135 receives information from the
      one or more sensors (for example, temperature or pressure sensors)
      in the system 100 indicating physical characteristics (such as
      temperature or pressure) at key locations of the system 100 (step
      455). The control system 135 analyzes the information (step 460)
      and determines whether physical properties of the system 100 need
      to be adjusted based on the analyzed information (step 465). For
      example, the control system 135 can determine that a current
      applied to the compressor 105 (and therefore the current applied
      to the electrode collectors) needs to be adjusted. As another
      example, the control system 135 can determine that a flow rate of
      one or more of the heat sink fluid and the heat source fluid that
      transport heat from and to the devices 115, 110 needs to be
      adjusted. If the control system 135 determines that a physical
      property of the system 100 should be adjusted, then the control
      system 135 sends a signal to the component that is affected to
      adjust the particular property (step 470). For example, the
      control system 135 can send a signal to the power supply to adjust
      the amount of current applied to the current collectors in the
      compressor 105. Otherwise, the control system 135 continues to
      receive information from the one or more sensors (step 455). In
      summary, the system 100 includes an electrochemical cell of the
      compressor 105 that compresses an electrochemically active
      component of the working fluid, and remixes the compressed (at
      high pressure) electrochemically active component (the first
      component) with the condensable refrigerant (the second component)
      to elevate the pressure of the mixed gas working fluid in a vapor
      compression refrigeration cycle. In this way, the electrochemical
      compressor 105 is capable of producing high pressure hydrogen gas
      from a mixed component working fluid having an electrochemically
      active component such as, hydrogen and at least one condensable
      refrigerant. In this arrangement, hydrogen is compressed to a much
      higher pressure than the final working fluid pressure (that is,
      the pressure of the remixed working fluid), and because of this,
      the hydrogen when mixed with the lower pressure condensable
      refrigerant is at the required higher pressure. The exact pressure
      requirements for the hydrogen stream depends on the volume of
      condensable refrigerant being pressurized in relation to the
      volume of hydrogen, the desired final pressure requirements of the
      remixed working fluid, and the targeted energy efficiency. The
      check valves 150, 155 are employed to make sure the gas flows are
      maintained in the intended directions and that no back flow is
      allowed towards the cells of the compressor 105.<br>
      <br>
      The energy efficiency of the system 100 depends on the available
      surface area of the anode 205 and the cathode 210, and the current
      density and operating voltage applied to the cells from the power
      supply. Higher current densities result in greater the resistive
      losses for the system 100.<br>
      <br>
      The size reduction of the compressor 105 is feasible because of
      its cellular design, and because it is operating using an
      electrochemical process. If an application requires significant
      size reductions, the electrode (the anode and the cathode)
      surfaces can be reduced, the applied current densities and
      voltages can be increased, and as a result a smaller mass of cells
      can be employed in the compressor 105. This would result in an
      almost order of magnitude reduction in size and weight for the
      system 100 compared to conventional mechanical systems.<br>
      <br>
      Since cooling capacity is linked to applied current and voltage,
      one advantage of this system is that it can more easily modulate
      from low capacity (that is, low current density at a specific
      voltage) to a high capacity. A system 100 designed to operate at
      high capacities actually becomes more efficient at lower
      utilizations, while, the opposite is true for mechanical systems.
      Referring also to Figs. 5 and 6, exemplary hybrid refrigeration
      systems 500, 600 define a closed loop that contains a working
      fluid and include the same components (for example, the
      electrochemical compressor, the heat transfer devices, and the
      thermostatic expansion valve) of the system 100. These systems
      500, 600 also include mechanical compressors 580, 680 operating in
      conjunction with the electrochemical compressors 505, 605 in a
      hybrid fashion. Such a design is useful for use in electric
      vehicles, for example. The design of the systems 500, 600 provides
      high efficiency service at low refrigeration requirements and
      allows the mechanical segment of the system 500, 600 to take over
      at constant and higher refrigeration demands. The mechanical
      segment of the system 500, 600 is the segment that bypasses the
      electrochemical compressor 505, 605.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 5, the mechanical compressor 580 is in parallel
      with the electrochemical compressor 505. For simplicity, the one
      way valves (such as the valves 150, 155) and the separate conduits
      for the high pressure electrochemically active component and the
      condensable refrigerant (such as the conduits 152, 157) that are
      found at the output of the compressor 505 are omitted from this
      drawing. As shown in Fig. 6, the mechanical compressor 680 is in
      series with the electrochemical compressor 605.<br>
      <br>
      The refrigeration system 100, 500, 600 can work with a wide range
      of condensable refrigerants. However the choice of refrigerant
      depends on the exact application under consideration and other
      external regulatory factors. Care should be taken in the selection
      of the refrigerant to ensure that the refrigerant does not degrade
      the electrochemical performance of the system 100, 500, 600 or
      poison the electrocatalyst employed.<br>
      An ideal refrigerant has good thermodynamic properties, is
      noncorrosive, stable, and safe. The desired thermodynamic
      properties are at a boiling point somewhat below the target
      temperature, a high heat of vaporization, a moderate density in
      liquid form, a relatively high density in gaseous form, and a high
      critical temperature. Since boiling point and gas density are
      affected by pressure, refrigerants may be made more suitable for a
      particular application by choice of operating pressure.<br>
      <br>
      While we have described an electrochemical compressor that uses a
      multiple component working fluid utilizing hydrogen and that is
      based on a cationic exchange membrane, it is also possible to use
      a working fluid including chlorine as a component; such a working
      fluid could be used advantageously in an anionic exchange membrane
      cell. In an electrochemical compressor using an anionic exchange
      membrane, the electrochemically active component of the working
      fluid is first reduced at a cathode. The anions formed at the
      cathode migrate to the anode where they are oxidized. The gas
      evolved at the anode is at a higher pressure than the fluid
      entering the cathode. The process is the reverse of the cationic
      electrochemical compressor previously described above with
      reference to Figs. 1-4B.<br>

      apparatus and processes. More particularly, the invention relates
      to microporous membranes that contain electrolytes in the pores.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Solid polymer electrolytes have recently attracted
      attention as electrolytes for lithium cells and the like because
      of the following advantages: (1) the energy density of a cell can
      be increased because the material can double as a separator, (2)
      leakage-free, high-reliability cells can be obtained by providing
      an all-solid construction, (3) it is easier to reduce the
      thickness or weight of a cell or to obtain an irregular shape, and
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There are two types of conventional solid polymer
      electrolytes: (1) polymers containing metal salts and (2)
      polymeric gels containing electrolyte solutions. With the first
      type, complexes of metal salts and polar polymers such as PEO
      (polyethylene oxide) form, and transport of lithium and other such
      ions accompanies the molecular motion of polymer chains. Such
      solid polymer electrolytes have high mechanical strength, but
      their ionic conductivity at room temperature has a limit on the
      order of 10-4 S/cm. It is therefore necessary to lower the
      molecular weight or to soften the polymers in order to intensify
      the molecular motion of the polymer chains, but this approach
      ultimately leads to a reduction in mechanical strength. With the
      second type, the contained electrolyte functions as an ionic
      conductor and preserves the polymers as solids. The ionic
      conductivity of such solid polymer electrolytes is on the order of
      10-3 S/cm, that is, falls within a practicable range, but a
      disadvantage is that the polymers are plasticized by the
      electrolyte, and their mechanical strength is lowered.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Demand has existed for some time for solid polymer
      electrolytes whose ionic conductivity is on the order of 10&lt;-3
      &gt;S/cm, whose thickness is on a par with that of conventional
      separators, and which have strength that does not present problems
      in terms of handling. Heat resistance is another consideration
      that has come into play in recent years as the performance of
      electrochemical reaction apparatuses has improved. In other words,
      a solid polymeric electrolyte composite for an electrochemical
      reaction apparatus should be able to preserve its diaphragm
      functions even when the apparatus heats up.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Composite solid polymeric electrolytes obtained by packing
      a solid polymer electrolyte into the pores of a polymeric porous
      film have been proposed as products satisfying both the ionic
      conductivity and mechanical strength requirements for solid
      polymer electrolytes (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications
      1-158051, 2-230662, and 2-291607), but a satisfactory electrolyte
      has yet to be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therefore, one object of the present invention is to
      provide a composite that utilizes a solid polymeric electrolyte
      for an electrochemical reaction apparatus that possesses
      satisfactory ion conduction properties and has excellent
      mechanical strength and heat resistance, and to provide an
      electrochemical reaction apparatus in which this electrolyte is
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Ion exchange membranes are well known. Ion exchange
      membranes which utilize a microporous media have previously been
      disclosed (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,547,551 and 5,599,614). Hitherto, the
      use of a microporous media was proposed primarily as a means of
      providing a "mechanical reinforcement function" only of the ion
      exchange media. This mechanical reinforcement provided improved
      dimensional stability as well as the capability to provide thinner
      overall membranes which in turn improved overall transport
      properties of the film (as measured through ionic conductance or
      moisture vapor transmission).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Also attempts to enhance ion exchange membrane properties
      have been attempted in the past by adding an additional component.
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,547,911 to Grot relates to a method to apply a
      layer of catalytically active particles to the surface of a
      membrane. U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,441 relates to the application of
      non-conductive inorganic particle to the surface of a membrane to
      improve it's gas release properties. Neither of these teach that
      the dispersion of an additive within the membrane results in
      higher performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,602 to Razaq relates to improving the
      performance of an ion exchange polymer membrane by treating it
      with an acid which diffuses into the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] WO 96/29752 to Grot et al relates to the incorporation of
      various inorganic fillers into a membrane to decrease fuel
      crossover. The ability to make thin very high conductance
      membranes is not addressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,181 (and Japanese patents 6-111827 and
      6-111834) to Stonehart et al relates to an ion exchange membrane
      in which silica is dispersed throughout the membrane. No
      indication is made to a microporous substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] U.S. Pat. No. 5,472,799 to Watanabe relates to an ion
      exchange membrane which incorporates a catalyst layer. While a
      thin membrane is mentioned as desirable, no mention is made of a
      microporous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,547,551 and 5,599,614 relate to the use of
      a microporous support where the function is to improve strength
      and mechanical properties, allowing the use of thin high
      conductance membranes. The addition of fillers within the
      microporous support is not addressed; however, the use of
      additives with the ion exchange medium to enhance specific
      functional properties is disclosed. But it is difficult to
      distribute additive particles adequately since the microporous
      reinforcement also acts as a filtration medium impeding the flow
      of finely divided particulates.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] There remains a need for thin high conductance membranes
      which have enhanced properties through the use of a functional
      support with the capability to provide multiple functions
      uniformly.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0033] Suitable microporous polymer films include those made from
      polyolefins, polyamides, polycarbonates, cellulosics,
      polyurethanes, polyesters, polyethers, polyacrylates, copolyether
      esters, copolyether amides, chitosan, and fluoropolymers. Suitable
      fluoropolymers include membranes of porous
      polytetrafluoroethylene, more preferably a membrane of expanded
      porous PTFE (sometimes referred to as ePTFE) produced by the

      [0034] Porous polytetrafluoroethylene sheet or film suitable for
      use in the invention can be made by processes known in the art,
      for example, by stretching or drawing processes, by papermaking
      processes, by processes in which filler materials are incorporated
      with the PTFE resin which are subsequently removed to leave a
      porous structure, or by powder sintering processes. Preferably the
      porous polytetrafluoroethylene film is porous expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene film having a structure of interconnected
      nodes and fibrils, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,566 and
      4,187,390 which describe the preferred material and processes for
      making them. The nodes and fibrils define an internal structure
      having a three-dimensional network of interconnected passages and
      pathways which extend vertically, from surface to surface, and
      laterally, from edge to edge, throughout the membrane. The porous
      polytetrafluoroethylene membrane should have a thickness in the
      range 3 to 1,000 micrometers, preferably in the range 5 to 100
      micrometers; a pore volume in the range 20 to 98 percent,
      preferably in the range 50 to 90 percent; and a nominal pore size
      in the range 0.05 to 15 micrometers, preferably in the range 0.1
      to 2 micrometers.<br>

      [0036] GB 2,026,381 discloses the preparation of membranes having
      a porous surface by blending polymer with a liquid component to
      form a binary two-phase system which, in the liquid aggregate
      state, has a region of miscibility and a region with miscibility
      gaps, forming a sheet of the blend, casting the film into a bath
      of the liquid component and removing the liquid component to
      provide porosity. The resultant non-oriented porous sheet has a
      relatively low tensile strength.<br>

      the preparations of porous articles, including microporous sheets,
      formed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a non-thermoplastic
      polymer, which is characterized by having a microstructure of
      nodes connected by fibrils. Such articles are produced by
      extruding a paste comprised of PTFE particles and a lubricant,
      removing the lubricant and stretching and annealing the resultant
      product. The resultant product is a sintered, oriented porous film
      of PTFE.<br>

      [0038] U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,100,238 and 4,197,148, incorporated by
      reference, describe the preparation of microporous films by
      extruding a two component blend, solvent leaching one dispersed
      component and stretching the resultant leached film to obtain a
      desired porosity. The blend consists of polymer and a leachable,
      non-miscible substance. Once the leachable dispersed polymer phase
      is removed and the film oriented, a porous film results.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] U.S. Pat. No. 3,679,540, incorporated by reference,
      discloses a method for making a microporous polymer film by cold
      stretching an elastic polymer film until porous surface regions
      are formed by film failure hot stretching the cold stretched film
      until fibrils and pores or open cells are formed and then heat
      setting the resultant film. Controlled porosity is generally not
      attained in such films because they do not always uniformly
      fibrillate to a specific pore size.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Certain U.S. patents disclose the preparation of porous
      polymer film by blending into the polymer non-miscible leachable
      particulate substance such as starch, salts, etc., forming a sheet
      and leaching the particulate substance from the polymer sheet.
      Such U.S. patents, incorporated by reference, include: U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 3,214,501 and 3,640,829, U.S. Pat. No. 3,870,593 discloses
      the preparation of a microporous polymer sheet by blending
      non-miscible, non-leachable filler into the polymer, forming a
      sheet of the blend and stretching the sheet to form pores which
      are initiated at the sites of the filler particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] U.S. Pat. No. 4,539,256 which patent is hereby incorporated
      by reference, teaches a method of making a microporous sheet which
      comprises the steps of melt blending a crystallizable
      thermoplastic polymer with a compound which is miscible with the
      thermoplastic polymer at the polymer melting temperature but
      immiscible on cooling below the polymer melting temperature,
      forming a sheet of the melt blend, cooling the sheet to a
      temperature at which the compound becomes immiscible with the
      polymer to cause phase separation between the thermoplastic
      polymer and the compound to provide a sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Such porous polymer films or sheets will preferably have a
      porosity of greater than 35%. More preferably, the porosity should
      be between 40-95% preferably 70%. The thickness of the film is
      preferably less than 2 mil (0.05 mm, 50 micrometers). Preferably
      the thickness is between 0.06 mils (1.5 m) and 1.6 mils, and most
      preferably the thickness is between 0.50 mils (0.013 mm) and 1.50
      mils (0.038 mm).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A preferred film is expanded porous PTFE commercially
      available in a variety of forms from W. L. Gore &amp; Associates,
      Inc., under the trademark GORE-TEX membrane. The porous
      microstructure of such expanded porous PTFE films either comprises
      nodes interconnected by fibrils, or comprises substantially
      fibrils with substantially no nodes present. Preferred porous
      expanded PTFE films can be characterized as having a bubble point
      between 10 and 60 psi; and an air flow between 20 Frazier and 10
      Gurley seconds. It may also have a pore size distribution value
      between 1.05 and 1.20; and a ball burst strength between 0.9 and
      17 pounds/force.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0044] The Functional Material</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0045] The material covering the structure defining the pores can
      be a metal oxide. The metal oxides endow the composite with
      improved mechanical strength sustainable over a long period of
      time ePTFE has good inherent mechanical strength, but this
      mechanical strength must be further enhanced by the metal oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The metal oxide also acts as a matrix to stably retain the
      solid polymer electrolyte in the pores at a high content. Because
      of its high porosity, the ePTFE is capable of accepting and
      holding large amounts of solid polymer electrolytes. In addition,
      the solid polymer electrolyte that fills the pores cannot be
      desorbed easily because it is retained by th fine fibrils and
      minute nodes of ePTFE. Furthermore, the oxides, improve the
      wettability of the microporous sheet, making it easier for the
      solid polymer electrolyte to pack the pores.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In addition, the metal oxide is stable at elevated
      temperatures. The performance of lithium cells and other
      electrochemical reaction apparatuses is gradually improving, and
      it is believed that heating is caused by the repeated charging and
      discharging occurring at a high current density, by short
      circuits, and by other undesirable phenomena. If the solid polymer
      electrolyte lacks heat resistance or is incapable of preserving
      its shape at high temperatures, the functions are lost and an
      extensive short circuit occurs, creating the danger of a
      malfunction. A composite acts to prevent a short circuit from
      forming between electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In the present invention, an expanded porous
      polytetrafluoroethylene which has continuous pores and in which
      the inner surfaces of the pores are covered with a metal oxide is
      used in order to retain the aforementioned solid polymer
      electrolyte. Examples of the metal oxides used in this case
      include oxides of the following elements: lithium, beryllium,
      boron, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, Ai [sic], phosphorus,
      potassium, calcium, cerium, titanium, vanadium, chromium,
      manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, gallium, germanium,
      selenium, rubidium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium, niobium,
      molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, cadmium, indium, tin,
      antimony, tellurium, cesium, barium, lanthanum, cerium,
      praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, cadmium, terbium,
      dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium,
      thorium, protactinium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, platinum,
      titanium, lead, bismuth, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Functional additives can be, for example, an inorganic
      filler, or a catalyst or a combination of such materials. Examples
      include, but are not limited to, silica, platinum, titanium
      dioxide, platinum supported on silica, platinum supported on
      titania, carbon, boron nitride, barium titanate, or a blend of
      materials, or a polymer such as a fluorocarbon, or a polyolefin,
      etc.-different to the original microporous substrate and the ion
      exchange material utilized such as for example perflouro sulfonic
      acid resin.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] One application is an improved self humidified membrane for
      a PEM fuel cell where the filler is silica or titanium dioxide
      which serves to aid in the back migration of product water from
      the cathode to the anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A second application is a self humidified low gas cross
      over PEM fuel cell membrane where the filler is platinum, or
      platinum supported on silica or titania, which serves to react and
      produce water in the membrane from any reactant which might
      otherwise diffuse through the membrane and degrade open circuit
      performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A third application is where the filler is boron nitride
      which serves to aid in heat conduction through the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A fourth application is a super capacitor where the filler
      is boron titanate which serves to increase the dielectric
      capability of the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A fifth application is where the filler is electrically
      conductive and serves to transport electrons through the membrane
      as well as protons for the production of H2O2 in a shorted fuel
      cell arrangement. This allows a much simpler cell design since it
      is no longer necessary to provide an external path for the
      electrons to flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A sixth application is where the filler is an ion exchange
      material which serves to improve the bond between the support and
      an ion exchange material in the polymer electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A seventh application is where the filler is a material
      which lowers the surface energy of the substrate thus improving or
      allowing wetting and easier processing of ion exchange material
      into the microporous structure.<br>

      <br>
      [0059] Examples of polymer compositions include polyethers,
      polyesters, polyimides, cross-linked polyethers, polymers
      containing polyether segments, polymers of vinyl silane having
      alkoxy groups, polymethyl <br>
      siloxanes having ethylene oxy (EO) groups, polyphosphazenes having
      EO groups, polymethacrylic acid esters having EO groups,
      polyacrylic acid, polyaziridine, polyethylene sulfide, and other
      polar polymer substances. Examples of electrolytes in the polymers
      include various metal salts such as LiCIO4, LiCF3SO3, LiF, Nal,
      Lil, NaSCN, LiBF4, LiPF6, LiBPh4 (Ph: phenyl group), and other
      alkali metal salts, as well as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,
      trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, tetrafluoroethylenesulfonic acid,
      and other proton acids.<br>

        Include Electrolytes.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0061] These polymers absorb and gel an electrolyte. Examples of
      such electrolyte solutions include solutions obtained by
      dissolving electrolytes and other necessary soluble polymers in
      organic solvents such as propylene carbonate,
      [delta]-butyrolactone, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran,
      acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, methyl tetrahydrofuran, and
      sulfolane. The polymers are not subject to any particular
      limitations as long as they are polymers that have cross-linked
      structures and are capable of absorbing and gelling the
      aforementioned electrolyte solutions, and any of the various
      conventionally known products can be used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0062] (3) Ion-Exchange Resins</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0063] The ion-exchange polymeric materials used can be any
      ion-exchange materials that will provide the desired result. The
      materials are preferably fluorinated because the material should
      be substantially inert to chemical activity and should be heat
      resistant.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The ion-exchange polymeric material will of course contain
      ionic functionality, preferably sulfonic moieties, carboxylic
      moieties or phosphonic moieties. The functional groups are present
      in an amount sufficient to impart ion-exchange properties to the
      polymer. An equivalent weight too high results in the electrical
      resistivity being too high. But if the equivalent weight is too
      low, mechanical strength becomes poor. The ionic functionality
      will usually be provided by carboxylic, sulfonic or phosphonic
      groups present either on the polymer backbone or present on
      pendant groups that extend from the polymer backbone in a
      recurring fashion. The polymer backbone will preferably be a
      fluorinated hydrocarbon backbone chain. The functional group
      preferably will have the structure -COOM, -SO3M or PO3M2, where M
      is hydrogen, a metallic cation or NH+4. If a metallic cation, it
      will preferably be an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal,
      such as Na+, K+ or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] For carboxylic functionality, the pendant side chains which
      carry the above functional groups may have at the terminal end of
      the side chain a group of the formula:<br>
      <br>
      EMI1.0<br>
      <br>
      [0066] where V is -COOM, Z is -F or -CF3 and [tau] is an integer
      of 1-12, preferably 1 or 2, as described in U.S. Pat. No.
      4,437,951 to DuPont, all of which is incorporated by reference for
      its disclosure of both carboxylic and sulfonic functionality.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The sulfonyl polymers with which the present invention is
      concerned are typically polymers having a fluorinated hydrocarbon
      backbone chain to which are attached the sulfonic containing
      functional groups as pendant side chains. For sulfonic polymers,
      terminal portion of the side chains can be:<br>
      <br>
      [0068] -CFRSO3M,<br>
      <br>
      [0069] -CF2CFRSO3M, or<br>
      <br>
      [0070] -OCF2CF2-SO3M, or the like<br>
      <br>
      [0071] where R is F, Cl, or perfluoroalkyl and M is as described
      earlier.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] For phosphoric polymers, the same sort of pendant groups
      are present.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Other ion-exchange resins useful herein, in addition to the
      fluorinated carboxylic resins and the fluorinated sulphonic and
      phosphoric resins described above, include, but are not limited
      to, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), divinyl benzene/styrene copolymers,
      provided they have the requisite functional groups pendant chains.
      The polymers can be mixed with a metal salt to obtain the desired
      functionality. A sulfonated polymer of trifluorostyrene, such as
      homopolymer or a copolymer with tetrafluoroethylene, can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] It is understood that the foregoing description of
      ion-exchange resins is not limited and is representative. It is
      understood that the invention can employ any polymer type of
      ion-exchange material. Thus, as seen above, not only do the resins
      include ones with the functional group as a part of the polymer,
      but also ones where the functional groups are provided by an
      additive to the polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The ion-exchange resins used in the invention can be
      prepared by general polymerization techniques developed for homo
      and copolymerizations of fluorinated ethylenes, particularly those
      employed for tetrafluoroethylene which are described in the
      literature. Nonaqueous techniques for preparing the copolymers
      include that of U.S. Pat. No. 3,041,317, that is, by the
      polymerization of a mixture of the major monomer therein, such as
      tetrafluoroethylene, and a fluorinated ethylene containing a
      sulfonyl fluoride group in the presence of a free radical
      initiator, preferably a perfluorocarbon peroxide or azo compound,
      at a temperature in the range 0-200[deg.] C. and at pressures in
      the range of 105 to 2*107 Pascals (1-200 Atm.) or higher. The
      nonaqueous polymerization may, if desired, be carried out in the
      presence of a fluorinated solvent. Suitable fluorinated solvents
      are inert, liquid, perfluorinated hydrocarbons, such as
      perfluoromethylcyclohexane, perfluorodimethylcyclobutane,
      perfluorooctane, perluorobenzene and the like, and inert, liquid
      chloro-fluorocarbons such as
      1,1,2-trichloro-1,2-2-trifluoroethane, and the like. Aqueous
      techniques for preparing such copolymers include contacting the
      monomers with an aqueous medium containing a free-radical
      initiator to obtain a slurry of polymer particles in non-water-wet
      or granular form, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,393,967, or
      contacting the monomers with an aqueous medium containing both a
      free-radical initiator and a telogenically inactive dispersing
      agent, to obtain an aqueous colloidal dispersion of polymer
      particles, and coagulating the dispersion, as disclosed, for
      example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,559,752 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,593,583.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In addition, ion-exchange polymer resins described and
      prepared as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,364 to DuPont; U.S. Pat. No.
      4,544,458 to DuPont; U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,218 to Asahi; U.S. Pat.

      by reference, can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Other examples of ion exchange materials include, such as
      polyvinyl alcohol, divinyl benzene, styrene based polymers, alpha
      beta triflurostyrene, or a ketone based ionomer such as sulfonated
      polyetherketone ether ketone (PEKEK) and metal salts with or
      without a polymer. The ion exchange material may also be comprised
      of at least in part a powder such as but not limited to carbon
      black, graphite, nickel, silica, titanium dioxide, platinum, boron
      nitrate, barium titanate or a non-ionic polymer such as
      poyvinylidene fluoride or a co-polymer of TFE, etc.<br>

      <br>
      [0079] An ePTFE in which the inner surfaces of the pores are
      covered with a metal oxide can be manufactured by a method
      comprising the following steps: a step in which the ePTFE is
      impregnated with a gelation product in the form of a solution
      obtained by allowing water to react with a hydrolyzable
      metal-containing organic compound, a step in which the gelation
      product in the form of a solution absorbed by the pores is allowed
      to react with water and converted to a gelation product in the
      form of a solid, and a step in which the gelation product in the
      form of a solid thus formed is heated and dried.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] A metal alkoxide or metal complex is formed as the
      aforementioned hydrolyzable metal-containing organic compound
      (also referred to as the "metal oxide precursor").<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Specific examples of metal alkoxides include
      tetramethoxytitanium, tetraethoxytitanium,
      tetraisopropoxytitanium, tetrabutoxytitanium, zirconium
      isopropylate, zirconium butyrate, tetramethoxysilane,
      tetraethoxysilane, tetraisopropoxysilane, and
      tetra-t-butoxysilane. Specific examples of metal complexes include
      titanium tetraacetyl acetonate, zirconium acetylacetonate, and
      other metal acetylacetonates. In the present invention, a
      silicone-based alkoxide such as tetraethoxysilane is particularly
      suitable for use.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The aforementioned metal oxide precursor is brought into
      contact with water, partially gelled, and made into a gelation
      product in the form of a solution before being complexed with the
      ePTFE. The gelation reaction can be a reaction well-known in the
      past, including a hydrolysis/polycondensation reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Water can be added to the metal oxide precursor, and
      agitation and mixing can be performed, in order to partially gel
      the metal oxide precursor. A water-miscible organic solvent such
      as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or another alcohol can be
      added to the water in this case, and an acid (hydrochloric acid,
      sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, hydrofluoric acid, or the
      like) or a base (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia,
      or the like) can also be added as needed. The partial gelation
      reaction of the metal oxide precursor can also be performed by
      adding water to the solution of the metal oxide precursor in an
      organic solvent, and agitating and mixing the system. In this
      case, any solvent can be used as the organic solvent as long as it
      is capable of dissolving the metal oxide. Aliphatic and aromatic
      hydrocarbons can be used in addition to alcohols. The gelation
      reaction is performed at a temperature that is generally 0 to
      100[deg.] C. and preferably 60 to 80[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The proportion in which water is used should be 0.1 to 100
      mol, and preferably 1 to 10 mol, per mole of the metal oxide
      precursor. Although it is preferable for the gelation reaction to
      be performed in a sealed system or in a flow of inert gas, it is
      also possible to promote the gelation reaction by the moisture
      contained in the outside air.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] A partially gelled product in the form of a solution of the
      metal oxide precursor is thus obtained. As used herein, the term
      "partially gelled product of a metal oxide precursor" refers to a
      product used under conditions corresponding to the use of a metal
      oxide hydrous gel in the form of a solid that is a completely
      gelled product and that lacks fluidity.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] To allow the partially gelled product of a metal oxide
      precursor to form a complex with the microporous sheet, it is
      possible to adopt a method in which the sheet is immersed in the
      partially gelled product in the form of a solution or a method in
      which the partially gelled product in the form of a solution is
      applied to the sheet with a spray or a roll, and any method can be
      used as long as it allows the partially gelled product to fill the
      pores of the surface portion and the interior of the sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The sheet that has been complexed with the partially gelled
      product of a metal oxide precursor in such a manner is brought
      into contact with an excess amount of contained water in order to
      further promote the gelation reaction of the metal oxide precursor
      and to form a metal oxide hydrous gel in the form of a solid
      (completely gelled product). It is preferable for a method in
      which the sheet complexed with the partially gelled product of a
      metal oxide precursor is immersed in water to be used for such
      complete gelation, but it is also possible to use methods in which
      sprayed water is blown, steam is blown, or the like. In this case,
      the water used may contain acids or alkalis because it is used to
      promote the gelation reaction. A metal oxide hydrous gel is
      produced in th form of a film on the inner surfaces of the pores
      of the molding after the gelation reaction has been completed, and
      a monolithically deposited metal oxide forming a thin, uniform
      layer on the inner surfaces of the pores can be obtained by drying
      the gel at 300[deg.] C. or lower, and preferably 200[deg.] C. or
      lower. The thickness of the metal oxide layer is 0.01 to 0.2
      [mu]m, and preferably 0.02 to 0.1 [mu]m. Because it is formed from
      a metal oxide hydrous gel obtained in such a manner, the metal
      oxide forms a monolithic, continuous film and has excellent
      adhesion that impairs its separation from the porous body. The
      metal oxide composite molding has a high void volume, which is at
      least 50%, and preferably at least 70%, of the void volume of the
      initial molding.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Alternatively, the functional material can be introduced
      into the micropores of the polymeric sheet by imbibing the
      material into the pores and then heating to remove the imbibing
      solvent. When the microporous polymeric sheet is
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the functional material can be
      added by mixing a particulate filler with a PTFE aqueous
      dispersion; cocoagulating the filler and the PTFE; lubricating the
      filled PTFE with lubricant; paste extruding and optionally
      calendering to form a film; and expanding the film by stretching
      it so as to form a porous PTFE membrane having the filler
      distributed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Alternatively, the microporous ePTFE can be plated with a
      metal described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,400 (Manniso).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Alternatively, a microporous article such as catalyst
      filled ePTFE described in part by U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,669 may be
      used as the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The solid polymer electrolyte can be placed into the pores
      by roll application, spraying, dipping, or another technique with
      a solution or dispersion containing the solid polymer electrolyte,
      and the solvent is then removed. The pores can be filled with a
      polymerization solution comprising an electrolyte and a monomer,
      and the ingredients polymerized inside the pores. The pores can be
      filled with a polymerization solution comprising an electrolyte, a
      monomer, and a solvent, the ingredients polymerized inside the
      pores, and the solvent is subsequently removed. The pores can be
      filled with an electrolyte-containing partially gelled solution of
      a polymer, and the ingredients are gelled inside the pores.
      Specific methods for introducing a solid polymer electrolyte into
      the pores of a molding are appropriately selected in accordance
      with the type of solid polymer electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The pores can be either partially or fully imbibed with ion
      exchange medium such as an ionomer in an alcohol solution such as
      is commercially available from Ashai Glass such as Flemion(R)
      solution in ethanol. The ion exchange medium may subsequently be
      dried or re-dissolved as the case may require.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] A product of the invention is depicted in FIG. 4. A
      composite membrane 10 is provided which is made up of a
      microporous polymeric sheet comprised of nodes 11 and fibrils 12.
      In some embodiments, the sheet can be comprised of only fibrils.
      The nodes and fibrils are covered, at least in part by functional
      material 13. The space between the nodes and fibrils is then
      filled, preferably, completely (i.e., no air flow through) with
      the polymer electrolyte. Preferably the interior volume of the
      sheet is substantially occluded by the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The composite membranes of the present invention may be
      employed in various applications, including but not limited to
      polarity based chemical separations, electrolysis, fuel cells,
      batteries, pervaporation, gas separation, dialysis, industrial
      electrochemistry, super acid catalyst, medium for enzyme
      immobilization and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Examples of use in some electrochemical applications
      include lithium primary cells, magnesium cells, and other primary
      cells, lithum secondary cells; polymer cells and other secondary
      cells; and fuel cells.<br>

      <br>
      [0096] 100 parts of tetraethoxysilane (manufactured by Sinetsu
      Silicone), 52 parts of water, and 133 parts of ethanol were
      allowed to react for 24 hours at 80[deg.] C. under reflux
      conditions in which the supply of moisture contained in the
      outside air was shut off with the aid of a calcium chloride tube,
      yielding a partially gelated solution of a metal oxide precursor.
      An expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene film (manufactured by
      Japan Gore-Tex Inc.; thickness: 25 [mu]m; pore diameter: 0.5
      [mu]m; thickness: 40 [mu]m; porosity: 92%) was impregnated with
      this solution and immersed in warm water (60[deg.] C.) for 5 hours
      to complete the gelation. The gelled product was dried for 30
      minutes at 150[deg.] C., yielding a silica gel complex extended
      porous polytetrafluoroethylen film in which the exposed surfaces,
      including the inner surfaces, of the porous body were covered with
      the silica gel. This composite film retained at least 80% of the
      voids of the original porous film and was highly porous.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] An acrylonitrile-methacrylate copolymer powder obtained
      from Japan Exlan Co. Ltd (molar ratio: 90/10) was subsequently
      added at a rate of 1.5 g/10 ml, and acetonitrile was added at the
      same time at a rate of 1.5 g/10 ml, to an organic electrolyte
      solution obtained by dissolving LiPF6, an electrolyte liquid mixed
      with propylenecarbonate and ethyl carbonate obtained from Tomiyama
      Pure Chemical Industry, in a mixed solvent (organic solvent) of
      propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate (volume ratio: 1/1) in
      such a way that the concentration was 1 M, yielding an
      acetonitrile-diluted polymeric gel molecule/electrolyte mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The acetonitrile-diluted polymer gel/electrolyte mixture
      was subsequently absorbed by the pores (cavities) of the
      aforementioned silica gel composite extended porous
      polytetrafluoroethylene film, then vacuum-dried for at least 5
      hours at 60[deg.] C. to remove the acetonitrile, and finally
      cooled to -20[deg.] C., yielding a solid polymer electrolyte
      composite with a thickness of about 25 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The ionic conductivity (20[deg.] C.; complex impedance
      technique) and the tensile strength as tested by JIS K 7113, of
      this polymer solid electrolyte composite were measured. The
      results are shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0100] An acetonitrile-diluted polymeric gel/electrolyte mixture
      prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was cast, yielding a
      solid polymer electrolyte (simple substance) with a thickness of
      25 [mu]m. In this case, the simple solid polymer electrolyte had
      insufficient mechanical strength, was difficult to handle, and was
      impractical as a film.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] For the sake of comparison, a solid polymer electrolyte
      film (simple substance) composed of a polymer/electrolyte with a
      thickness of 100 [mu]m was fabricated, and the ionic conductivity
      (20[deg.] C.; complex impedance technique) and tensile strength of
      the film were measured. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] It follows from Table 1 that the solid polymer electrolyte
      composite of the present invention is a solid polymer electrolyte
      in which the mechanical strength is significantly improved while
      the ionic conductivity is maintained at the level of a
      conventional solid polymer electrolyte. The composite of the
      present invention can be easily made into a thin film and stably
      fabricated into a solid polymer electrolyte film of about 25
      [mu]m, making it possible to reduce the resistance of the solid
      polymer electrolyte portion.<br>

      [0108] 15 g of an acrylonitrile-methacrylate copolymer powder
      (molar ratio: 90/10) and 12 g of acetonitrile were simultaneously
      added to 100 ml of an organic electrolyte solution obtained by
      dissolving LiPF6 in a mixed solvent (organic solvent) of propylene
      carbonate and ethylene carbonate (volume ratio: 1/1) in such a way
      that the concentration was 1M, yielding an acetonitrile-diluted
      polymer gel/electrolyte mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] 4 g of an LiCoO2 powder with a mean grain diameter of about
      20 [mu]m and 0.2 g of acetylene black were subsequently added to
      7.3 g of the aforementioned acetonitrile-diluted polymer
      gel/electrolyte mixture, and the ingredients were uniformly
      agitated, yielding a starting solution for the positive electrode.
      This starting solution was spread over the entire surface (with
      the exception of the terminal A) of the flat aluminum positive
      electrode collector 2 (thickness: 20 [mu]m) shown in FIG. 2, the

      <br>
      [0120] A lithium secondary cell was manufactured using, as an
      electrolyte film, the solid polymer electrolyte (simple substance;
      thickness: 25 [mu]m) of Comparative Example 1 instead of the solid
      polymer electrolyte composite film in Practical Example 2, but the
      components were difficult to handle and could not be made into a
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In view of this, a lithium secondary cell was fabricated in
      the same manner as in Practical Example 2 except that the solid
      polymer electrolyte film (simple substance; thickness: 100 [mu]m)
      of Comparative Example 1 was used instead of the solid polymer
      electrolyte composite film.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The resulting cell was subjected to charge/discharge cycle
      tests at a temperature of 20[deg.] C., an upper limit of 4.3 V,
      and a lower limit of 3.0 V, with the discharge being conducted at
      a constant current of 8 mA. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] It can be seen in Table 2 that the lithium secondary cell
      of the present invention remains stable over a large number of
      cycles and that the cell capacity deteriorates only slightly even
      when the number of cycles exceeds 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] By contrast, the lithium secondary cell of Comparative
      Example 2 is configured in such a way that the solid polymer
      electrolyte portion (simple substance) of the cell is four times
      thicker than the corresponding portion of the cell obtained in
      Practical Example 2, quadrupling the resistance of the solid
      polymer electrolyte portion (simple substance). As a result, the
      capacity deteriorates only slightly even when the number of cycles
      exceeds 200, but the discharge capacity is low. These results
      indicate that the present invention allows a compact,
      high-performance cell to be obtained.<br>

      [0125] A multi-functional membrane was made by<br>
      <br>
      [0126] a) mixing a particulate filler with PTFE aqueous
      dispersion,<br>

      <br>
      [0130] e) expanding said film by stretching it so as to form a
      porous PTFE having said filler distributed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] An aqueous dispersion of PTFE resin (20-36% solids) was
      obtained. Into the aqueous dispersion, particulate filler of Fumed
      Silica, Cabosil(R) M5, from Cabot Corp. was added to produce a 20%
      by weight silica final dried mixture. This mixture was
      cocoagulated by rapid shearing of the aqueous dispersion. A
      coagulum of fine powder PTFE resin and silica filler was
      subsequently formed and dried into cakes. When dry, the cakes were
      carefully crumbled and lubricated with an odorless mineral spirit.
      The amount of mineral spirits used was 0.52 grams per gram of
      PTFE/SiO2 dry powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] This mixture was aged below room temperature to allow for
      the mineral spirits to become uniformly distributed within the
      PTFE/SiO2 powder resin. This mixture was compressed into a billet
      and extruded at 1200 psi through a 0.045 inch by 6 inch gap die
      attached to a ram type extruder to form a coherent extrudate. A
      reduction ratio of 44:1 was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Two layers of extrudate were stacked together to form 100
      mil assembly and subsequently rolled down between two metal rolls
      which were heated to between 50[deg.] C. The final thickness after
      roll down was 0.014 inch. The material was transv rsely xpanded at
      a ratio of 3:1 and then the mineral spirits were removed from the
      xtrudate by heating the mass to 250[deg.] C. (i.e. a temperature
      wh re th mineral spirits were highly volatile). The dried
      extrudate was transversely expanded at 150[deg.] C. at a ratio of
      3.5:1 and a rate of 2300% per second. After expansion the sheet
      was amorphously locked at greater than 340[deg.] C. and cooled to
      room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] This membrane was subsequently imbibed with ion exchange
      resin solution as in example 5 to create a ion exchange composite
      membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Electrodes loaded at 0.3 mg/cm&lt;2 &gt;platinum were
      attached to both sides of the membrane and the membrane electrode
      assembly was placed in a single cell fuel cell test apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Air and H2, both at 40 psig and 25[deg.] C., were fed to
      the cell. A steady state current of 1.178 amps/cm&lt;2 &gt;was
      produced at 0.5 volts with no humidification of the incoming
      reactants. Cell temperature was 50[deg.] C. A microreinforced
      membrane with no filler yielded only 0.975 amps at the same test
      conditions.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0137] An aqueous dispersion of PTFE resin was obtained. Into the
      aqueous dispersion, a particulate carbon black (Ketjen Black)
      filler was added to produce a 20% by weight final dried mixture.
      This mixture was cocoagulated by rapid shearing of the aqueous
      dispersion. A coagulum of fine powder PTFE resin and carbon filler
      was subsequently formed and dried into cakes. When dry, the cakes
      were carefully crumbled and lubricated with an odorless mineral
      spirit. The amount of mineral spirits used was 0.20 grams per gram
      of PTFE/carbon black dry powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] This mixture was compressed into a billet and extruded at
      1500 psi through a 0.045 inch by 6 inch gap die attached to a ram
      type extruder to form a coherent extrudate. A reduction ratio of
      84:1 was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The extrudate was then rolled down between two metal rolls
      which were heated to between 50[deg.] C. The final thickness after
      roll down was 0.010 inch. The mineral spirits were removed from
      the extrudate by heating the mass to 250[deg.] C. (i.e. a t
      mperature where the mineral spirits were highly volatile). The
      dried extrudate was transversely expanded at 150[deg.] C. at a
      ratio of 3.5:1. After expansion, the sheet was heated to
      amorphously locked at greater than 340[deg.] C. and cooled to room
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] This membrane was subsequently imbibed with Flemion(R)
      (Asahi Glass) ion exchange resin solution (9% by weight resin in
      ethanol) and dried 3 times.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The final composite thickness was 27 microns.<br>

      <br>
      [0142] An aqueous dispersion of PTFE resin is obtained. Into the
      aqueous dispersion, a particulate titania filler was added to
      produce a 20% by weight final dried mixture. This mixture was
      cocoagulated by rapid shearing of the aqueous dispersion. A
      coagulum of fine powder PTFE resin and titania filler was
      subsequently formed and dried into cakes. When dry, the cakes were
      carefully crumbled and lubricated with an odorless mineral spirit.
      The amount of mineral spirits used was 0.20 grams per gram of
      PTFE/titania dry powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] This mixture was compressed into a billet and extruded at
      1500 psi through a 0.045 inch by 6 inch gap die attached to a ram
      type extruder to form a coherent extrudate. A reduction ratio of
      84:1 was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The extrudate was then rolled down between two metal rolls
      which were heated to between 50[deg.] C. The final thickness after
      roll down was 0.008 inch. The mineral spirits were removed from
      the extrudate by heating the mass to 250[deg.] C. (i.e. a
      temperature where the mineral spirits were highly volatile). The
      dried extrudate was transversely expanded at 150[deg.] C. at a
      ratio of 3.5:1 and at a rate of 440% per second. After expansion,
      the sheet was amorphously locked at greater than 340[deg.] C. and
      cooled to room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] It was subsequently imbibed with ion exchange media by
      brushing both sides with a solution of PFSA in ethanol (Flemion(R)
      9% by weight).<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0146] An aqueous dispersion of PTFE resin was obtained. Into the
      aqueous dispersion, a platinum coated titania catalyst was added
      to produce a 10% by weight final dried mixture. This mixture was
      cocoagulated by rapid shearing of the aqueous dispersion. A
      coagulum of fine powder PTFE resin and catalyst filler was
      subsequently formed and dried into cakes. When dry, the cakes were
      carefully crumbled and lubricated with an odorless mineral spirit.
      The amount of mineral spirits used was 0.26 grams per gram of
      PTFE/catalyst dry powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] This mixture was compressed into a billet and extruded at
      3000 psi through a 0.045 inch by 6 inch gap die attached to a ram
      type extruder to form a coherent extrudate. A reduction ratio of
      44:1 was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The extrudate was then rolled down between two metal rolls
      which were heated to 50[deg.] C. The final thickness after roll
      down was 0.016 inch. The mineral spirits were removed from the
      extrudate by heating the mass to 250[deg.] C. (i.e. a temperature
      where the mineral spirits were highly volatile).<br>
      <br>
      [0149] A portion of this roll was then placed within a batch film
      expansion machine and expanded at an expansion rate of 500% per
      second to a ratio of 12:1 in both the machine and transverse
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] This microporous membrane was subsequently imbibed with a
      fluorinated sulfonic acid resin composition as in example 5. The
      final thickness of the composite membrane was 15 microns.
      Electrodes with a total of 0.6 mg Pt/cm&lt;2 &gt;were attached and
      the membrane tested in a single cell fuel cell test apparatus. Air
      and H2, both at 40 PSIG and 25[deg.] C., were fed to the cell. A
      steady state current of 0.47 amps/cm&lt;2 &gt;was produced at 0.8
      volts with no humidification of the incoming gasses. Cell
      temperature was 50[deg.] C. A 15 micron microreinforced membrane
      with no filler yielded only 0.36 amps at 0.8 volts under the same
      conditions.<br>
