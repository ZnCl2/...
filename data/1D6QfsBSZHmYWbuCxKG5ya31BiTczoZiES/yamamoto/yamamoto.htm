      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- Vitamin D-binding protein (Gc protein) and
        its small domain (approximately [1/5] of the Gc peptide also

        cloned Gc protein and the cloned domain (Cd) peptide were
        treated with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase to
        yield macrophage activating factors, GcMAFc and CdMAF,
        respectively. These cloned macrophage activating factors and
        GcMAF are to be used for therapy of cancer, HIV-infection and
        osteopetrosis, and may also be used as adjuvants for
        immunization and vaccination. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to methods to detect immunosuppression
        in cancer and AIDS patients, particular to the absence or
        reduced precursor activity for macrophage activating factor due
        to the presence of a serum glycosidase derived from these
        diseases. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>A. Immunosuppression Resulting from Loss of MAF Precursor
          Activity</b> </p>
      <p>Inflammation results in activation of macrophages. Cellular
        membrane damage and the inflammatory process result in the
        release of lysophospholipids. Administration into mice of small
        doses (5-20 .mu.g/mouse) of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-Pc)
        and other lysophospholipids induced a greatly enhanced
        phagocytic and superoxide generating capacity of macrophages
        (Ngwenya and Yamamoto, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 193:118, 1990;
        Yamamoto et al., Inf. Imm. 61:5388, 1993; Yamamoto et al.,
        Inflammation. 18:311, 1994). This macrophage activation requires
        participation of B cells and T lymphocytes and a serum vitamin D
        binding protein (DBP; human DBP is known as group specific
        components or Gc). Activation of mouse peritoneal macrophages by
        lyso-Pc requires modification of the Gc protein by stepwise
        association with .beta.-galactosidase of lyso-Pc-treated B cells
        and sialidase of T cells, to generate the macrophage activating
        factor (MAF), a protein with N-acetylgalactosamine as the
        remaining sugar moiety (FIG. 1a) (Yamamoto et al., Proc. Natl.
        Acad. Sci. USA. 88:8539, 1991; Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol.
        151:2794, 1993). Thus, Gc protein is a precursor for MAF.
        Incubation of Gc protein with immobilized .beta.-galactosidase
        and sialidase generates a remarkably high titered MAF (GcMAF)
        (Yamamoto et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:8539, 1991;
        Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol. 151:2794, 1993; Naraparaju and
        Yamamoto, Immunol. Lett. 43:143, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,177,002).
        Administration of a minute amount (10 pg/mouse; 100 ng/human) of
        GcMAF resulted in a greatly enhanced phagocytic capacity of
        macrophages. When peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages of 175
        cancer patients bearing various types of cancer were treated in
        vitro with 100 pg GcMAF/ml, monocytes/macrophages (phagocytes)
        of all cancer patients were activated for phagocytic and
        superoxide generating capacity. This observation indicates that
        patient phagocytes are capable of being activated. However, the
        MAF precursor activity of plasma Gc protein was severely reduced
        in approximately one third of the cancer patient population.
        Loss of the MAF precursor activity prevents generation of MAF.
        Therefore, macrophage activation cannot develop in certain
        cancer patients. Since macrophage activation is the first step
        in immune development cascade, such cancer patients become
        immunosuppressed. This may explain at least in party why cancer
        patients die with overwhelming infections. About one third of
        the patients had moderately reduced MAF precursor activities
        while the remaining one third of the cancer patients had MAF
        precursor activities similar to those of healthy humans. Lost or
        reduced precursor activity of Gc protein was found to be due to
        deglycosylation of plasma Gc protein by
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase detected in a cancer patient's
        blood stream. Deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be converted to
        MAF (FIG. 1b). The source of the
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase appeared to be cancerous
        cells. Radiation therapy of cancerous lesions decreased plasma
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity with concomitant
        increase of precursor activity. This implies that radiation
        therapy decreases the number of cancerous cells capable of
        secreting .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Thus, plasma
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity has an inverse
        correlation with the MAF precursor activity of Gc protein. Both
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and MAF precursor
        activity of Gc protein in a patient's blood stream can serve as
        diagnostic and prognostic indices. </p>
      <p>Similarly, when peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages of 65
        HIV-infected/AIDS patients were treated in vitro with 100 pg
        GcMAF/ml, the monocytes/macrophages of all patients were
        activated for phagocytic and superoxide generating capacity.
        However, the MAF precursor activity of plasma Gc protein was
        severely reduced in about 1/10 of the HIV-infected patient
        population and approximately 25% of AIDS patients. These
        patients' plasma Gc protein is deglycosylated by
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase detected in HIV-infected
        patients. HIV-infected cells appeared to secrete
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Thus,
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and MAF precursor
        activity of Gc protein in the patient's blood stream can serve
        as diagnostic and prognostic indices. </p>
      <p>In my prior two U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,177,001 and 5,177,002, the
        entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference
        herein, as are my above cited journal articles, is disclosed
        various macrophage activating factors, processes for preparing
        them as well as methods of inducing macrophage activation in a
        person in need of such activation. </p>
      <p><b>B. The Origin of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase</b> </p>
      <p>Loss of the precursor activity was found to be due to
        deglycosylation of plasma Gc protein by
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase detected in the patient blood
        stream. The source of the enzyme appeared to be cancerous cells.
        Ehrlich ascites tumor cells contain a large amount of
        .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase and a very small amount of
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Yagi et al., Arch Biochem
        Biophys. 280:61, 1990). </p>
      <p>My data has indicated that both .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase
        and .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were detected in tumor
        tissue homogenates as represented by enzyme activities (about
        41.5 and 32.1 nmole/mg/min, respectively) of a lung tumor
        tissue. Similar results were also observed with eleven different
        tumor tissues including 4 lung, 3 breast, 3 colon and 1 cervix
        tumors, though the .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity
        varied from 5.9 to 50.8 nmoles/mg/min. Radiation therapy of
        cancerous lesions decreased plasma
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity with concomitant
        increase of precursor activity. This implies that radiation
        therapy decreases the number of cancerous cells capable of
        secreting .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. </p>
      <p>Similarly HIV-infected patients carry
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in their blood
        stream. HIV-envelope protein was found to contain
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. HIV-infected cells
        can secrete this enzyme in to blood stream, resulting in
        deglycosylation of Gc protein. This would cause
        immunosuppression in HIV-infected/AIDS patients. </p>
      <p>Thus, both .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and MAF
        precursor activity of Gc protein in patient blood stream can
        serve as excellent diagnostic and prognostic indices. </p>

      <p><b>1. Precursor activity of serum Gc protein of cancer and
          HIV-infected/AIDS patients.</b> </p>
      <p>To determine precursor activity of Gc protein, mouse peritoneal
        cells (mixture of lymphocytes and macrophages) will be incubated
        with 1 .mu.g lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-Pc)/ml in 0.1% egg
        albumin supplemented medium RPMI-1640 (EA medium) at 37.degree.
        C. for 30 min. The lyso-Pc-treated peritoneal cells will be
        washed with PBS and cultured for 3 h at 37.degree. C. in EA
        medium supplemented with gammaglobulin-depleted* patient
        plasma/serum (0.1%) and assayed for superoxide generation of the
        macrophages. Loss or decrease of precursor activity of serum Gc
        protein results in lack or reduction of superoxide generation.
        Thus, the precursor activity is expressed by amounts of
        superoxide generated (nmoles of superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6
        cells). </p>
      <p><b>2. Assay procedure for .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plasma/serum (1 ml) of a healthy human and patients will be
        precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. The ammonium
        sulfate precipitate will be dissolved in 50 mM citrate phosphate
        buffer (pH 6.0) and dialyzed against the same buffer at
        4.degree. C. The volume of the dialysate will be made up to 1 ml
        and assayed for the enzyme. Ammonium sulfate precipitation is to
        separate the enzyme from inhibitors. The enzyme activity will be
        determined at 37.degree. C. in a reaction mixture of 1.0 ml
        containing 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 5
        .mu.moles of p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-.alpha.-D-galactosaminide as
        a substrate. The reaction will be initiated by addition of 100
        .mu.l of the dialyzed samples and stopped after 60 min by adding
        200 .mu.l of 0.5M Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3 solution. The reaction
        mixture will be centrifuged and amount of released p-nitrophenol
        will be determined by the absorbance of the supernatant at 420
        nm and expressed as nmoles/min. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Cancerous cells and HIV-infected cells secrete
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase into the blood stream,
        resulting in deglycosylation of serum Gc protein. This
        inactivates the MAF precursor activity of Gc protein, leading to
        immunosuppression. Thus, both .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        activity and MAF precursor activity of Gc protein in patient
        blood stream can serve as diagnostic and prognostic indices. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the invention includes a

        activity in plasma or serum of a person suspected of having
        cancer or HIV, comprising the step of quantifying in the plasma
        or serum an amount of vitamin D.sub.3 -binding protein. The
        determination of the macrophage activating factor precursor
        activity provides an indication of the patient's capability to
        activate its own monocytes/macrophages. </p>

        or serum an amount of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p><b>II. Supporting Observations</b> </p>
      <p>Mechanisms of macrophage activation by lipid metabolites and a
        concept developed for therapy of immunodeficient diseases with
        vitamin D-binding protein derivatives are new and thus far have
        not been reported in the literature by others. Methods I have
        developed for diagnostic/prognostic indices are based on the
        following observations. </p>
      <p><b>A) Cancer Patients</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Characterization of peripheral blood
          monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes and Gc protein in cancer
          patients.</b> </p>
      <p>When peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages (phagocytes) of 175
        cancer patients bearing various forms of cancer were treated
        with a small amount (100 pg/ml) of GcMAF, the phagocytes of all
        cancer patients were efficiently activated for production of
        more than 5.0 nmoles of superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6 cells,
        as can be seen at the last column of Table 1. When a mixture of
        nonadherent (B and T) lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophage
        (phagocytes) of individual patient was treated with 1 .mu.g
        lyso-Pc/ml for 30 min and cultured in a medium supplemented with
        1 ng Gc protein/ml for 3 hr, the phagocytes of all cancer
        patients were efficiently activated, indicating that the B and T
        lymphocytes of all cancer patients are capable of generating
        macrophage activating factor (MAF) (more than 5.0 nmoles of
        superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6 cells, as can be seen in the
        3rd column of Table 1). However, when the lyso-Pc-treated
        nonadherent and adherent cell mixtures of individual patients
        were cultured in medium supplemented with patient own plasma
        (0.1%) for 3 hr, the phagocytes of about 1/3 of the patients
        were not activated (less than 1.0 nmole of superoxide
        produced/min/10.sup.6 cells, as can be seen at the 2nd column of
        Table 1). These observations suggest that the patient B and T
        cells are capable of generating MAF while the MAF precursor
        activity of Gc protein in the plasma of 1/3 of this patient
        population was greatly reduced. With this assay procedure,
        another 1/3 patient population had moderately reduced precursor
        activity to support macrophage activation for generating 1.5-3.5
        nmoles superoxide/min/10.sup.6 cells. The remaining cancer
        patients have precursor activity similar to those of healthy
        humans. Table 1 is exemplified by the data of the first 13
        patients studied. Immunoblotting analysis of cancer patient and
        healthy human plasma revealed no quantitative change in Gc
        protein in cancer patients. Thus, lost or reduced precursor
        activity of Gc protein in certain cancer patients led us to
        suggest deglycosylation of Gc protein (FIG. 1b). Thus,
        inflammation-primed macrophage activation can not be developed
        in certain cancer patients. Since macrophage activation is the
        first step in the inflammation-primed immune development
        cascade, these cancer patients are immunosuppressed. This may
        explain at least in part why cancer patients die after resulted
        from overwhelming infection. </p>

      <p><b>2. Detection of N-acetylhexosaminidases in cancer patient
          plasma.</b> </p>
      <p>Electrophoretic analysis of patient plasma showed no
        quantitative change in Gc protein in these patient plasma. Thus,
        lost or reduced precursor activity of Gc protein in cancer
        patients suggests deglycosylation of Gc protein. Thus,
        deglycosylation of Gc protein in plasma may be due to the
        presence of N-acetylhexosaminidases in the blood stream (FIG.
        1b). Patient and healthy human plasma were precipitated with 70%
        saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were dialyzed and
        assayed for .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and
        .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase using p-nitrophenyl
        N-acetyl-.alpha.-D-galactosaminide and p-nitrophenyl
        N-acetyl-.beta.-D-glucosaminide as substrates. Patients having
        lost or reduced precursor activity of plasma Gc protein carry a
        large amount of .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase and a significant
        amount of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase while about the same
        amount of .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase and extremely low level
        (1/10) of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were found in
        healthy human plasma (Table 2). Since both healthy human and
        patient plasma contain the same .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase
        activity level, .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase may have nothing
        to do with deglycosylation of Gc protein. In fact, Gc protein is
        known to be O-glycosylated (43). When Gc protein as a
        macromolecular substrate and an equal amount (activity level) of
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were used, the patient
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deglycosylated Gc protein
        while healthy human enzyme was unable to deglycosylate Gc
        protein as shown in Table 3. This observation led us to conclude
        that the healthy human enzyme seems to be .alpha.-galactosidase
        simply because .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and
        .alpha.-galactosidase share the same chromogenic substrate.
        Thus, .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was identified in cancer
        patient blood stream exclusively. </p>

      <p><b>3. Detection of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in
          cancerous tissues.</b> </p>
      <p>Secretion of endo-.alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from tumor
        tissues is likely to be responsible for deglycosylation of Gc
        protein in the patient blood stream. Fresh post-operation tumor
        tissues were obtained and homogenized in 15 mM Tris Buffer at pH
        7.0. The homogenates were treated with 70% ammonium sulfate for
        fractionation and the precipitate was dissolved in 50 mM citrate
        buffer at pH 4.5 and dialyzed in the same buffer at 4.degree. C.
        for overnight. Both .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase and
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in tumor tissue homogenate
        were assayed. As shown in Table 2, large amounts of both
        .beta.-N-acetylglucosaminidase and
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were detected in the tumor
        homogenates (data in Table 2 is exemplified by lung tumor). The
        latter enzyme was found to deglycosylate Gc protein (Table 3). </p>
      <p>It seems likely that secretory capacity of individual tumor
        tissue for N-acetylgalactosaminidase varies among cancer types.
        This would result in varying degrees of precursor activity of
        host plasma Gc protein. The extent of the decreased precursor
        activity may be reflection of invasiveness of tumor types. Thus,
        the precursor activity assay of individual patient should have
        diagnostic/prognostic utilities. </p>
      <p><b>4. Effect of radiation therapy on the precursor activity of
          Gc protein.</b> </p>
      <p>As radiation therapy of cancer patients progressed, the
        majority of patients who initially had lost or decreased
        precursor activity of plasma Gc protein had a return toward or
        to normal (healthy human) values during radiation treatment (see
        the 2nd column of Table 4). This finding suggests that radiation
        therapy results in an increase in glycosylated Gc protein in
        peripheral blood. This also implies that radiation therapy
        decreases cancer cells capable of secreting
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This observation proved the
        precursor activity of patient Gc protein to be useful
        diagnostic/prognostic indices. </p>

      <p><b>5. MAF precursor activity of Gc protein and
          .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in oral cancer patient sera.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Among 175 cancer patients, we chose oral cancer patients for
        prolonged observation because of immediate perceptibility of
        tumor appearance and metastasis. As shown in Table 5, about 1/3
        of total 18 patients exhibited greatly reduced precursor
        activity of serum Gc protein as expressed by less than 1.2
        nmoles of superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6 cells. Another 1/3 of
        this patient population showed moderately reduced precursor
        activity, ranging for 1.5 to 3.5 nmoles of superoxide
        produced/min/10.sup.6 cells. The remaining patients had
        precursor activity level equivalent to that of healthy humans. </p>
      <p>Since loss of the precursor activity of serum Gc protein is
        resulted from deglycosylation of Gc protein by
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, we assayed patient sera for
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. As shown in Table 5, patients
        who had very low precursor activities carried very high enzyme
        activities in their blood stream. Patients who had high
        precursor activities carried very low enzyme activity. Thus, the
        enzyme activity levels of all patients showed an excellent
        inverse correlation with their precursor activity levels as can
        seen in Table 5. However, these immunological indices show no
        correlation with the degree of differentiation of tumors. </p>
      <p>About 50% of patients who had low precursor activities (less
        than 2.25) either were recurrent cases or developed metastasized
        lymph nodes during 6 month study period. Therefore, precursor
        activity of Gc protein and .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        activity in patient blood stream were proved to be excellent
        diagnostic/prognostic indices. </p>

      <p><b>1. Characterization of peripheral blood monocytes,
          macrophages and Gc protein in HIV-infected/AIDS patients.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages (phagocytes) of 65
        HIV-infected patients were treated with a small amount (100
        pg/ml) of GcMAF, the phagocytes of all patients were activated
        for generating more than 4.0 nmoles of superoxide
        produced/min/10.sup.6 phagocytes as with healthy humans. When a
        mixture of lymphocytes and phagocytes of a healthy human was
        treated with 1 .mu.g lyso-Pc/ml for 30 min and cultured in a
        medium supplemented with 0.1% patient plasma for 3 h, the
        phagocytes were not activated with patient plasma of about 1/10
        of the total patient population and produced less than 0.7
        nmoles of superoxide/min/10.sup.6 phagocytes. These patients
        having severely decreased precursor activity were found to be
        approximately 1/4 of the AIDS patients. The plasma Gc protein of
        the majority (65%) of HIV-infected patients was capable of being
        converted to MAF as expressed by more than 4.0 nmoles of
        superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6 phagocytes while the MAF
        precursor activity of Gc protein in the plasma of approximately
        25% of this patient population was moderately reduced (ranging
        1.6-3.6 nmoles of superoxide produced/min/10.sup.6 phagocytes)
        as shown in Table 6. This observation suggests that the
        phagocytes of all HIV-infected patients are capable of being
        activated while the precursor activity of Gc protein for MAF in
        the plasma of certain AIDS patients was severely reduced. This
        may explain at least in part why AIDS patients die from
        overwhelming bacterial infection. </p>
      <p><b>2. Detection of N-acetylgalactosaminidase in HIV-infected
          patient plasma.</b> </p>
      <p>Electrophoretic analysis of patient plasma showed no
        quantitative change in Gc protein in these patient plasma. Thus,
        lost or reduced precursor activity of Gc protein in
        HIV-infected/AIDS patients suggests deglycosylation of Gc
        protein. Deglycosylation of Gc protein in plasma was found to be
        due to the presence of endo-.alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in
        the patient blood stream. Patients having lost or reduced
        precursor activity of plasma Gc protein carried significantly
        large amounts of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in
        their blood stream while an extremely low level of
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity was detected in
        healthy human plasma. As shown in Table 7, the enzyme activity
        in patient plasma showed excellent inverse correlation with the
        precursor activity of the patient plasma Gc protein, confirming
        our hypothesis that .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        deglycosylates plasma Gc protein. However, the enzyme activity
        and CD4.sup.+ value of the patients showed no obvious
        correlation. When Gc protein as a macromolecular substrate was
        treated with an equal activity (4 nmoles/min) of the enzyme from
        patient and healthy human plasma, the patient
        .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase efficiently deglycosylated Gc
        protein thus inactivated the precursor activity while the
        healthy human enzyme was unable to deglycosylate Gc protein. The
        inability of the healthy human enzyme to catabolize Gc protein
        may imply that this activity in healthy human is
        .alpha.-galactosidase, because .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        and .alpha.-galactosidase are evolutionary related, carry 46.9%
        amino acid sequence homology and share common chromogenic
        substrate for their catabolic capacities. Thus, a significant
        amount of .alpha.-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was detected
        exclusively in HIV-infected/AIDS patient blood stream. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>Serum vitamin D3-binding protein (Gc
        protein) is the precursor for the principal macrophage
        activating factor (MAF). The MAF precursor activity of serum Gc
        protein of breast cancer patients was lost or reduced because Gc
        protein was deglycosylated by serum -N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        (Nagalase) secreted from cancerous cells. Patient serum Nagalase
        activity is proportional to tumor burden. The deglycosylated Gc
        protein cannot be converted to MAF, resulting in no macrophage
        activation and immunosuppression. Stepwise incubation of
        purified Gc protein with immobilized -galactosidase and
        sialidase generated probably the most potent macrophage
        activating factor (termed GcMAF) ever discovered, which produces
        no adverse effect in humans. Macrophages treated in vitro with
        GcMAF (100 pg/ml) are highly tumoricidal to mammary
        adenocarcinomas. Efficacy of GcMAF for treatment of metastatic
        breast cancer was investigated with 16 nonanemic patients who
        received weekly administration of GcMAF (100 ng). As GcMAF
        therapy progresses, the MAF precursor activity of patient Gc
        protein increased with a concomitant decrease in serum Nagalase.
        Because of proportionality of serum Nagalase activity to tumor
        burden, the time course progress of GcMAF therapy was assessed
        by serum Nagalase activity as a prognostic index. These patients
        had the initial Nagalase activities ranging from 2.32 to 6.28
        nmole/min/mg protein. After about 16-22 administrations
        (approximately 3.5-5 months) of GcMAF, these patients had
        insignificantly low serum enzyme levels equivalent to healthy
        control enzyme levels, ranging from 0.38 to 0.63 nmole/min/mg
        protein, indicating eradication of the tumors. This therapeutic
        procedure resulted in no recurrence for more than 4 years. </p>

      <p>Abstract: Macrophages, when highly activated via inflammation
        (e.g. intratumor BCG administration), can eradicate cancerous
        cells. Inflammation-primed macrophage activation process is the
        principal macrophage activation cascade that requires serum Gc
        protein (vitamin D-binding protein) and participation of B and T
        lymphocytes. Stepwise hydrolysis of Gc protein with
        -galactosidase of inflammation-primed B cells and sialidase of
        T cells yields a potent macrophage activating factor (MAF), a Gc
        protein with N-acetylgalactosamine as the remaining sugar. Thus,
        Gc protein is the precursor for MAF. Stepwise treatment of
        purified Gc protein with immobilized -galactosidase and
        sialidase generates the most potent macrophage activating factor
        (GcMAF) ever discovered which produces no side effect in humans
        and animals. Macrophages activated by GcMAF (100 pg every 4 days
        to Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice) eradicate the tumor
        cells. After more than 25 weekly administrations of 100 ng GcMAF
        to cancer patients, the majority of prostate and breast cancer
        patients, excluding extremely advanced, exhibited healthy
        control levels of the tumor markers (e.g.,
        -N-acetylgalactosaminidase), indicating eradication of tumors
        confirmed by CAT-scan and MRI. We demonstrated rapid in vitro
        cancer cell-killing using mouse and human macrophages activated
        by GcMAF. Since activation of macrophages leads to enhanced
        phagocytosis and antigen presentation to lymphocytes for
        development of humoral and cellular immunity, GcMAF therapy of
        Ehrlich ascites tumor-bearing mice and prostate and breast
        cancer patients appeared to develop antibodies against their
        respective cancerous cells. When in vitro cancer cell-killing
        study with mouse and human macrophages activated by GcMAF was
        performed using Ehrlich ascites tumor, and breast and prostate
        cell lines in the presence of serum (or IgG) fraction of
        GcMAF-treated Ehrlich tumor bearing mice, prostate or breast
        cancer patients, greatly accelerated cell-killings were
        observed, indicating that sera of GcMAF treated tumor-bearing
        mice and cancer patients contain IgG antibodies against these
        cancer cells because inflammation (or GcMAF)-primed activation
        of macrophages is known to develop Fc-receptor mediated
        cell-killing and phagocytosis of targets preferentially </p>

      <p>Photodynamic action on mammalian tissues immediately results in
        severe inflammation, leading to macrophage activation.
        Intratumor PDT-induced inflammation generates maximally
        activated macrophages that can eradicate local as well as
        metastasized cancerous cells. Inflammation in mammalian tissues
        activates phospholipase A2 to releases lysophospholipids that
        efficiently activate macrophages. Because cancerous tissues
        contain alkylphospholipids, PDT-induced <br>
        inflammation of cancerous tissue produces
        alkyl-lysophospholipids and alkylglycerols that activate
        macrophages with approximately 400 times more efficiency than
        lysophospholipids. These results imply that highly activated
        macrophages can kill cancerous cells. Inflammation-primed
        macrophage <br>
        activation process is the principal macrophage activation
        cascade that requires serum vitamin D3-binding protein (known as
        Gc protein) and participation of B and T lymphocytes. Stepwise
        hydrolysis of Gc protein with the inducible membranous
        beta-galactosidase of inflammation-primed B cells and the
        membranous Neu-1 sialidase of T cells yields a potent macrophage
        activating factor (MAF), the protein with N-acetylgalactosamine
        as the remaining sugar. Thus, Gc protein is the precursor for
        the principal MAF. Stepwise treatment of highly purified Gc
        protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase
        generated the most potent macrophage activating factor (termed
        GcMAF) ever discovered which produces no side effect in humans.
        Administration of 100 ng GcMAF per human and 100 pg GcMAF per
        mouse results in the maximal activation of macrophages, which
        develop enormous variation of receptors. When human macrophages
        were treated in vitro with GcMAF (100 <br>
        pg/ml) for 3 hrs, the macrophages were highly activated. The
        activated macrophages can recognize and kill a variety of
        cancerous cells indiscriminately. When prostate and breast,
        cancer patients were treated with less than 25 weekly
        administrations of 100 ng GcMAF, the majority of cancer
        patients, excluding anemic patients, exhibited healthy control
        levels of the serum prognostic index,
        alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, indicating eradication of the
        tumors. GcMAF therapy also develops antibodies against the
        tumors. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract: </b>Vitamin D3-binding protein (Gc protein), a
        serum glycoprotein, is the precursor for the macrophage
        activating factor. Cancer patient sera contain
        -N-acetylgalactosaminidase that deglycosylates Gc protein.
        Deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be converted to macrophage
        activating factor, leading to immunosuppression. Of 46 oral
        cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma, approximately 22%
        had greatly reduced precursor activities. The precursor activity
        of approximately 61% of these patients was moderately reduced.
        The remaining patients (17%) had precursor activities equivalent
        to those of healthy humans. Patients with low precursor activity
        of serum Gc protein had high serum -N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        activity. In contrast, patients with high precursor activity had
        low serum -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. Thus, levels of
        serum -N-acetylgalactosaminidase of individual patients have an
        inverse correlation with precursor activities of their serum Gc
        protein. Surgical removal of tumors resulted in a subtle
        decrease in serum -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity with
        concomitant increase in the precursor activity of serum Gc
        protein. Serum enzyme analysis of nude mice transplanted with a
        human oral squamous carcinoma cell line revealed that serum
        -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity is directly proportional to
        tumor burden. Thus, -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in
        patient blood-stream can serve as a diagnostic/prognostic index.

      <p><b>Abstract</b>: Cancerous cells secrete
        ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NaGalase) into the blood stream,
        resulting in deglycosylation of serum vitamin D3-binding protein
        (known as Gc protein), which is a precursor for macrophage
        activating factor (MAF). Incubation of Gc protein with
        immobilized ?-galactosidase and sialidase generates the most
        potent macrophage activating factor (designated GcMAF).
        Administration of GcMAF to cancer-bearing hosts can bypass the
        inactivated MAF precursor and act directly on macrophages for
        efficient activation. Therapeutic effects of GcMAF on Ehrlich
        ascites tumor-bearing mice were assessed by survival time and
        serum NaGalase activity, because serum NaGalase activity was
        proportional to tumor burden. A single administration of GcMAF
        (100 pg/mouse) to eight mice on the same day after
        transplantation of the tumor (5  105 cells) showed a mean
        survival time of 21  3 days for seven mice, with one mouse
        surviving more than 60 days, whereas tumor-bearing controls had
        a mean survival time of 13  2 days. Six of the eight mice that
        received two GcMAF administrations, at Day 0 and Day 4 after
        transplantation, survived up to 31  4 days whereas, the
        remaining two mice survived for more than 60 days. Further, six
        of the eight mice that received three GcMAF administrations with
        4-day intervals showed an extended survival of at least 60 days,
        and serum NaGalase levels were as low as those of control mice
        throughout the survival period. The cure with subthreshold
        GcMAF-treatments (administered once or twice) of tumor-bearing
        mice appeared to be a consequence of sustained macrophage
        activation by inflammation resulting from the
        macrophage-mediated tumoricidal process. Therefore, a protracted
        macrophage activation induced by a few administrations of minute
        amounts of GcMAF eradicated the murine ascites tumor. </p>

      <p>Summary: Freund's adjuvant produced severe inflammation that
        augments development of antibodies. Thus, mixed administration
        of antigens with adjuvant was not required as long as
        inflammation was induced in the hosts. Since macrophage
        activation for phagocytosis and antigen processing is the first
        step of antibody development, inflammation-primed macrophage
        activation plays a major role in immune development. Therefore,
        macrophage activating factor should act as an adjuvant for
        immunization. The inflammation-primed macrophage activation
        process is the major macrophage activating cascade that requires
        participation of serum vitamin D3-binding protein (DBP; human
        DBP is known as Gc protein) and glycosidases of B and T
        lymphocytes. Stepwise incubation of Gc protein with immobilized
        [beta]-galactosidase and sialidase efficiently generated the
        most potent macrophage activating factor (designated GcMAF) we
        have ever encountered. Administration of GcMAF (20 or 100
        pg/mouse) resulted in stimulation of the progenitor cells for
        extensive mitogenesis and activation of macrophages.
        Administration of GcMAF (100 pg/mouse) along with immunization
        of mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) produced a large
        number of anti-SRBC antibody secreting splenic cells in 2-4
        days. Thus, GcMAF has a potent adjuvant activity for
        immunization. Although malignant tumours are poorly immunogenic,
        4 days after GcMAF-primed immunization of mice with heat-killed
        Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, the ascites tumour was no longer
        transplantable in these mice. </p>

          Yamamoto</b> </p>
      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>Serum Gc protein (known as vitamin
        D3-binding protein) is the precursor for the principal
        macrophage activating factor (MAF). The MAF precursor activity
        of serum Gc protein of prostate cancer patients was lost or
        reduced because Gc protein was deglycosylated by serum
        alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from
        cancerous cells. Therefore, macrophages of prostate cancer
        patients having deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be activated,
        leading to immunosuppression. Stepwise treatment of purified Gc
        protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase
        generated the most potent macrophage activating factor (termed
        GcMAF) ever discovered, which produces no side effect in humans.
        Macrophages activated by GcMAF develop a considerable variation
        of receptors that recognize the abnormality in malignant cell
        surface and are highly tumoricidal. Sixteen nonanemic prostate
        cancer patients received weekly administration of 100 nanogram
        (ng) GcMAF. As the MAF precursor activity increased their serum
        Nagalase activity decreased. Since serum Nagalase activity is
        proportional to tumor burden, the entire time course analysis
        for GcMAF therapy was monitored by measuring the serum Nagalase
        activity. After 14-25 weekly administrations of GcMAF (100
        ng/week), all sixteen patients had very low serum Nagalase
        levels equivalent to those of healthy control values, indicating
        that these patients are tumor free. No recurrence occurred for
        seven years.<br>

        Abstract --&nbsp; Cancerous cells and HIV-infected cells secrete
        alpha -N-acetylgalactosaminidase into the blood stream,
        resulting in deglycosylation of serum Gc protein. This
        inactivates the MAF precursor activity of Gc protein, leading to
        immunosuppression. Thus, both alpha -N-acetylgalactosaminidase
        activity and MAF precursor activity of Gc protein in patient
        blood stream can serve as diagnostic and prognostic indices. In
        one embodiment is disclosed a process for determining macrophage
        activating factor precursor activity in plasma or serum of a
        person suspected of having cancer or HIV, comprising the step of
        quantifying in the plasma or serum an amount of vitamin
        D3-binding protein. The determination of the macrophage
        activating factor precursor activity provides an indication of
        the patient's capability to activate its own
        monocytes/macrophages.; In another embodiment is disclosed a
        process for determining macrophage activating factor precursor
        activity in plasma or serum of a person suspected of having
        cancer or HIV comprising the step of quantifying in the plasma
        or serum an amount of alpha -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity.
        Determining the alpha -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in the
        plasma or serum provides an indication of a quantity of
        malignant cells (or HIV) in the plasma or serum.<br>
