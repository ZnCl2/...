        <p><b><font size="+1">Georgia Southern University Professor Dr.
              Tom Kollars Invents Device to Reduce Deaths from
              Mosquito-Borne Illnesses</font></b> </p>
        <p><img src="provector.jpg" height="318" width="549"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The ProVector is unique in its environmentally-friendly manner
        of killing mosquitoes </p>
      <p>More than 500 million people worldwide are infected with
        malaria each year, killing one to three million people, many of
        them children. Georgia Southern University professor Tom Kollars
        hopes his invention, the ProVector Bt, will drastically reduce
        those numbers. </p>
      <p>“If we can make a dent in that, I can go out of this world
        knowing I made it a better place,” said Kollars, the director of
        the Biodefense and Infectious Disease Laboratory in Georgia
        Southern’s Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health. </p>
      <p>The ProVector targets mosquitoes that carry deadly diseases
        such as malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus. In blind
        trials conducted by a Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
        overseas laboratory, the ProVector killed 50 to 100 percent of
        mosquitoes within days. </p>
      <p>The small device is essentially an artificial flower, made out
        of the same type of plastic used for football helmets.
        Mosquitoes are drawn to the ProVector by a four-color decal
        (different mosquito species are attracted to different colors).
      </p>
      <p>The insect feeds on an artificial nectar through a metal screen
        with openings big enough for only a mosquito’s mouth parts to
        fit through. Kollars' work in developing the ProVector Bt
        formula is unique in that it is the first time anyone has been
        able to get mature mosquitoes to ingest and die from Bacillus
        thurengiensis (Bt), a safe biopesticide. </p>
      <p>The ProVector comes in two models: the ProVector Bt, which
        kills the mosquito within a few days of eating the bait, and the
        ProVector M, which kills the malaria parasite inside the
        mosquito, leaving the mosquito to survive and serve its role in
        the environment without infecting humans. </p>
      <p>“We trick the mosquitoes into coming right to it and eating
        it,” Kollars said. “This is a very environmentally-friendly
        apparatus that uses a safe biopesticide, so it can be safely
        used in the home. No pesticides are sprayed into the
        environment.” </p>
      <p>The homes where Kollars envisions ProVectors are in tropical
        and subtropical regions. People in those areas live in forests
        and fields, in huts without basic things that many of us in the
        United States take for granted, like air conditioning and
        windows with screens. Bed nets have been a tremendous tool in
        reducing mosquito-borne illnesses, but have proven to be only
        seven percent effective in children under six months old. The
        bed nets also develop holes over time and mosquitoes have become
        resistant to the pesticides used on the nets, Kollars said. </p>
      <p>“Hundreds to thousands of mosquitoes can go into a home in one
        night,” he said. “Think of living in the Everglades with nothing
        covering your windows.” </p>
      <p>Kollars says he spent about 10 years perfecting the ProVector –
        working out of his garage and spending “over a hundred-thousand
        dollars” of his own money to develop it – and now that is all
        paying off. Kollars patented the idea and then licensed the
        patent to Medical Infusion Technologies, Inc., which plans to
        begin manufacturing and marketing the ProVector this year. </p>
      <p>What makes the ProVector such a viable tool, Kollars says, is
        its cost-effectiveness. The devices will sell for about $10
        apiece. About every three months, it will need a $1 bait refill.
      </p>
      <p>“The average Kenyan, for example, spends about $110 a year out
        of their $360 a year salary to treat their family for malaria
        alone. That’s one disease,” Kollars said. “A health department
        could buy this device for the family, and then the family could
        protect itself for $4 a year instead of $110 a year.” </p>
      <p>Kollars recently returned from Puerto Rico, where he tested the
        ProVector in a real jungle environment. He and Dr. Steven
        Hatfill, an infectious disease physician, set up a simulated
        village of 14 tents, each with a ProVector inside. They spent
        three weeks in the jungle, and will return in seven months to
        see how well the devices fare in extreme tropical conditions to
        reduce the mosquito population. </p>
      <p>ProVector Bt is currently being used to reduce mosquito
        populations around homes in Afghanistan. Next month, Kollars
        will visit and provide the ProVector Bt to a school in Thailand
        to help reduce the number of children contracting dengue, which
        kills up to 40 percent of children contracting the disease. In
        May, Kollars will travel to Kenya to conduct field research with
        the U.S. Army, and he will also travel to Uganda to begin
        epidemiology research with the Ministry of Health with the goal
        of reducing the number of malaria cases. </p>
      <p>Kollars and two assistants continue to conduct ProVector
        laboratory and field experiments at Georgia Southern University.
        They recently presented their research in Vienna, Austria, and
        Heidi Hulsey, Kollars’ doctoral student in the Jiann-Ping Hsu
        College of Public Health, will present at the American Mosquito
        Control Association in New Orleans. </p>
      <p>“We’re potentially going to save hundreds of thousands of
        lives,” Kollars said. “What more could a person want in the
        public health profession, than to make such an impact?” </p>
      <p>Georgia Southern University, a Carnegie Doctoral/Research
        University, offers 116 degree programs serving nearly 18,000
        students. Through eight colleges, the University offers
        bachelors, masters and doctoral degree programs built on more
        than a century of academic achievement. The University, one of
        Georgia’s largest, is a top choice of Georgia’s HOPE scholars
        and is recognized for its student-centered approach to
        education. </p>

      <p><i>Georgia Southern professor Dr. Tom Kollars was busy setting
          up mosquito traps in Bulloch County today. Georgia Southern
          professor Dr. Tom Kollars was busy setting up mosquito traps
          in Bulloch County today.</i> </p>
      <p>Mosquitoes might be small, but they pack a powerful punch.
        During the summer, mosquitoes in several areas in Chatham County
        were found to carry the West Nile virus. They can also carry
        several other potentially deadly diseases. </p>
      <p>Now one doctor says he has a way to prevent the spread of those
        diseases. </p>
      <p>Georgia Southern professor Dr. Tom Kollars was busy setting up
        mosquito traps in Bulloch County today, looking for a way to
        stop the spread of disease. Kollars has tested hundreds of
        mosquitoes and says that close to 60 percent of those that
        ingest the malaria parasite could get infected with the
        potentially deadly disease. </p>
      <p>But after working in southeast Asia, he saw firsthand what this
        deadly disease could do. </p>
      <p>"We saw patients and children with malaria and dengue fever,"
        said Dr. Kollars.&nbsp; "About 40 percent of children die and
        there's no treatment or vaccine, there's no drug for dengue,
        while there's drug resistance to malaria." </p>
      <p>So he came up with what he calls a solution. It's called
        Provector. It looks like a flower, only it uses a chemical to
        attract the mosquito. </p>
      <p>"Female mosquitoes have to get food sources, blood meals and
        nectar and fruit juices used for energy to fly. They'll feed on
        nectar and sugar sources ten times more than blood because they
        need it for energy," said Dr. Kollars. </p>
      <p>Once mosquitoes take in the antiviral formula in the traps, it
        works with their system to block the development of the disease,
        killing it but not the mosquito. </p>
      <p>Dr Kollars says not only will his invention help save lives,
        but it will be cost effective. </p>
      <p>"Well for example, the average family in Kenya spends $110
        treating their family with malaria. We're trying to make this
        device very cost effective at five to ten dollars, where someone
        can put this in their home," said Dr. Kollars. </p>
      <p>Through his research, Dr. Kollar's treatment has knocked down
        the number of infected mosquitoes to two percent. </p>
      <p>"We have a chance here to be involved with preventing hundreds
        of millions from dying and getting sick and it's a blessing,"
        said Dr. Kollars. </p>
      <p>Dr. Kollars says, right now they are developing the formula for
        malaria and dengue fever and then working on others for West
        Nile, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever. This is an
        environmentally safe product and should available in about a
        year. </p>
      <p>This project is a collaborative effort involving Mev Labs
        Incorporated, MIT Incorporated and Georgia Southern University.

        <b>Abstract </b>-- A disposable insect and/or arthropod
        trapping device that generates its own attractants of carbon
        dioxide (CO2), lactic acid and/or ammonia through the chemical
        reaction of adding a weakly acidic liquid such as vinegar
        (acetic acid) to solids such as baking soda (sodium
        bicarbonate), with the optional addition or substitution of urea
        and/or lactic acid. The liquids are mixed over a period of hours
        or days onto the solids to generate CO2 in the vicinity of an
        insect/arthropod trap having an insect-debilitating surface that
        traps the insects and arthropods when they alight on the
        surface. The container may have a cylindrical shape with an
        upper and lower chamber with fly paper attached to the
        container. The fly paper may be secured to the base and/or top
        portions of the container, or there may be fly paper like
        appendages to trap insects attracted by emitted gases. </p>

      <p>The Georgia Southern University Research and Service Foundation
        located in Statesboro, GA, advised MIT on November 27, 2008 it
        had successfully completed its independent Validation and
        Certification of ProVectorTM Models under contract by MIT,
        Holding Inc.; portions of the study available on-line at
        www.mitholdinginc.com. </p>
      <p>MIT can now offer for public use the first of the new line of
        ProVectorTM products developed by Dr. Tom Kollars from MEVLABS,
        Inc. and Pro Vector, LLC and licensed to MIT. ProVectorTM Bt
        (patent pending) is an economical and environmentally safe
        device for killing adult mosquitoes. The parts include a plastic
        flower with colors, chemical attractants and a refill containing
        Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bt) biopesticide. One refill
        lasts from three to six months depending on the size of the
        mosquito population. </p>
      <p>ProVectorTM Bt is unique because it is the first commercially
        available device to imitate a flower to which adult mosquitoes
        come to feed on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bt)
        pesticide. It was designed with the philosophy of keeping
        “Green” and made of virtually indestructible plastic which
        reduces waste and it only allows mosquitoes to feed on it,
        eliminating the spread of pesticides into the environment. The
        device includes a flower with color, chemical attractants, and a
        refill containing Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bt)
        biopesticide. One refill will last from three to six months
        depending on the size of the mosquito population. </p>
      <p>The active biopesticide Bt, is short for Bacillus
        thuringiensis, is a bacteria that has been studied by the US
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and found Bt safe enough
        to be exempt from food residue tolerances, groundwater
        restrictions, species labeling and special review requirements.
        Bt has historically been used to treat water sources in order to
        kill mosquito larvae as they filter in water. However, adult
        mosquitoes do not live in water and have different feeding
        habits than larvae. In addition to blood, most female mosquitoes
        feed on sugar sources for energy and all male mosquitoes use
        sugar sources. The ProVectorTM imitates the look and taste of
        flowers in order to trick the adult mosquitoes into eating Bt.
        Dr. Kollars and his staff have had astonishing results with
        their ProVectorTM Bt formulation, having a kill rate of over 80%
        in 24 hours and 100% within a week in the laboratory. </p>
      <p>ProVectorTM Bt seeks to achieve low cost and safety by using Bt
        in a contained manner without spreading it to the environment.
        MIT Holding is pleased to team with MEVLABS, Inc. and ProVector,
        LLC to provide the ProVectorTM Bt as another tool in the arsenal
        of public health officials and pest management professionals in
        their fight to battle mosquitoes and save lives. </p>
