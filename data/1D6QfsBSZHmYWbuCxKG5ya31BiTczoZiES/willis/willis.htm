      <div align="center"><big><b>The Story of Power</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Power from 1832 forward is based on the principal of magnets
      moving around a set of coils. This was the design that Michael
      Faraday setup and ran. This unit is the standard in the market
      place today and has had no improvement in design.<br>
      <br>
      In 2007 Richard Willis was attempting to build a DC pulse motor
      and stumbled upon a way to create a motor with more power output
      then input.<br>
      <br>
      The unit at first had moving parts. After a night of drinking,
      Richard came to the conclusion that the unit could be run in a
      stationary position.<br>
      <br>
      This unit later would become the design that would be used to
      create a solid-state driven motor. After 3 years and a few hundred
      thousand dollars in testing, we have a final output design that
      works well.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see in the pictures, we have coils wrapped by magnets.
      These units are pulsed at a fast rate between 3 to 10 k. The back
      rush of power is captured and rectified back to DC pulse power.<br>
      <br>
      Units need to dump the power into a battery or a capacitor bank to
      change from dc pulse to regular DC. Nothing that is made today
      will accept our power due to the fact that it is DC pulse.<br>
      <br>
      With no heat in the coils, there is no loss in the coils, thus no
      wasted power.<br>

      <br>
      Canadian inventor, Richard Willis of Magnacoaster Motor Company,
      Inc., claims to have an over-unity generator he calls "Vorktex"
      that produces electric power without using fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The crux of the design is a solid state system that involves some
      very high-powered permanent magnets and some specially-wound
      coils, along with some proprietary circuitry. The coils are
      immersed in a dielectric oil that is pumped through the system to
      prevent arcing between the coils from the high voltages and
      frequencies that otherwise create plasmas that destroy the coils.
      A lead acid battery bank serves both as the input and the output.
      The unit has to be shielded or it broadcasts EMF.<br>
      <br>
      As of July, 2009, the company's website lists a number products of
      varying power outputs (including 4.8 kW; 9 kW; 12 kW) for sale. As
      of June, 2012, units have begun to be shipped to back-order
      customers.<br>
      <br>
      Ongoing caution: While the company is taking money for product,
      they don't seen to be forthright about how long it will take for
      delivery or about the fact that they are deep in research and
      development / troubleshooting. <br>
      <br>
      These will be tied to Solar panels so that the install permitting
      can ride on the Solar coattails, which is legal, since his device
      does not require fuel to run. He says he's merely augmenting what
      the Solar is doing.<br>
      <br>
      Several demonstration videos have been posted.<br>
      <br>
      The company says they are in the middle of putting up a plant.<br>
      <br>
      The name Vorktex came about by a typo that stuck when looking for
      available domain names.<br>

      <br>
      Richard Willis, of the Canadian company Magnacoaster, has been
      promising to ship solid state, overunity generators for three
      years, but has failed so far to do so. All these years later,
      though no units have been shipped to customers. He still talks
      like this will happen very soon.<br>
      <br>
      Developing overunity devices into products is not an easy task.
      There are many issues an inventor can run into that can slow down
      or hinder the process of turning an exotic technology into a
      market ready product. A couple of these issues are discovering
      previously unknown variables that effect the function of the
      technology, and sourcing parts that are compatible with the
      technology. However, the longer it takes, the harder it is to
      believe that it will ever materialize. <br>
      <br>
      Magnacoaster is a Canadian company that began accepting money from
      customers nearly three years ago today, beginning September 29,
      2008, but has not yet shipped a product. To read more about what
      Magnacoaster claims to have (a solid state technology that can
      produce an output of kilowatts with only a few watts of input),
      check out a previous article that we posted to PESN earlier this
      year. In that article, we reported that Richard Willis, the CEO of
      Magnacoaster, expected to be able to start shipping product on
      July 18.<br>
      <br>
      We recently emailed Willis to ask for an update. The following are
      the questions we asked, and the answers we received, with some
      minor corrections in grammar.<br>
      <br>
      Q. How is the development of your units coming along?<br>
      <br>
      A. This hole going to production has been a challenge due to
      supplier issues and stream lining processes. To make the unit easy
      and easy to assemble, suppliers are a pain in the ass, and it
      makes it hard to work if everything has to be a face to face.<br>
      <br>
      Q. Have you been able to obtain the parts you need?<br>
      <br>
      A. We are still a wire harness away from the final unit but I
      still am looking at other options for the future. To make it easy
      to put the unit together as well the build fixture has not
      arrived, and that is one part we need, as the holder we are using
      blocks off access to some parts during the build up.<br>
      <br>
      Q. If you have been able to obtain the parts you need, how are the
      units performing?<br>
      <br>
      A. The unit tested out ok outside of the box problem is you have
      to have the box to stop the unit from broadcast.<br>
      <br>
      Q. Have you been able to ship any products to customers? If so,
      how&nbsp; many have you shipped?<br>
      <br>
      A. Not as of yet, we hope to fix this and get product rolling
      soon.<br>
      <br>
      The above email makes it obvious that Magnacoaster is continuing
      to make excuses for why they have not shipped products. Although
      it is possible that the issues Willis cites are valid, the fact of
      the matter is that customers have paid money, for products they
      have not received. <br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, Magnacoaster needs to do one of the following three
      things, immediately.<br>
      <br>
      - Show convincing evidence from third party testing that the
      technology works.<br>
      <br>
      - Show customers a working prototype.<br>
      <br>
      - Offer customers their money back.<br>
      <br>
      It is often acceptable to ask for money for research and
      development, when developing an exotic technology. What is not
      acceptable, is accepting money from customers for products that
      you know are likely not to be able to ship for some time. <br>
      <br>
      After the above portion of this story was composed, Sterling Allan
      sent an email to Willis asking him several questions.<br>
      <br>
      Hi Richard,<br>
      <br>
      In preparing a story for PESN about the latest with Magnacoaster,
      in comparing the list of customers from your site on June 10, 2011
      (40 orders) with the present list of orders (11 orders), it looks
      to me like the number of people with orders has dropped to nearly
      a fourth.<br>
      <br>
      Have you been able to give refunds to all those who canceled their
      orders?<br>
      <br>
      At the height, how many orders did you have in queue?<br>
      <br>
      What are your expectations at present regarding when you will be
      able to fulfill orders?<br>
      <br>
      Also, another key question is "How many witnesses have seen a
      prototype in operation" and "what did they see?"<br>
      <br>
      Thanks<br>
      <br>
      The following was the response.<br>
      <br>
      As a company we continue to grow and process more orders and train
      dealers. <br>
      <br>
      We are in the middle of training people to build boxes so we can
      add on more production. <br>
      <br>
      As for the amount of orders in the que at this time. Our facility
      is growing at a speed where we can handle growth <br>
      <br>
      We will not be updating the unit build list as I only have 2 hands
      and 12 hours a day. <br>
      <br>
      We see in the future dealers are going to be taking on the role of
      sales. This list will be moved to a dealer only area with units
      being shipped to dealers. <br>
      <br>
      Customers call dealers when there is a problem, not us. <br>
      <br>
      We are working with all the suppliers now and have a positive
      attitude. Any parts can be made in the next few weeks. Some places
      are more backlogged than others, and some parts take longer to
      make then others. <br>
      <br>
      We have had a few groups in the lab testing. They all have
      confirmed the same as the others.<br>
      <br>
      It seems to me that Willis is dodging the questions that were
      asked. My hope is that this will end well, and customers will
      eventually receive working OU devices, but I am less and less
      convinced that will happen. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>ELECTRICAL GENERATOR &nbsp;</b><br>
        <b>WO2009065219</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to an electrical power
      generator, and more particularly to an "over unity" electrical
      power generator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Electricity is conventionally generated in a number of
      ways, including fossil fuel powered electromechanical generators,
      coal powered electromechanical generators, waterflow powered
      electromechanical generators, nuclear reactor type generators, and
      so on. In each case, there are a number of disadvantages
      associated with the prior art, especially inefficiency and also
      scarcity of a power source.<br>
      <br>
      [ 0003] Recently, magnetic generators have been developed that
      produce electrical power from the magnetic field of the earth.
      Basically, an input magnetic field is quickly switched on and off,
      or alternatively more than one input magnetic field is selectively
      switched on and off, on an alternating basis, to influence a
      larger magnetic field in an electromagnetic apparatus that is
      selectively connected to an electrical power output circuit. A
      resulting political power is produced in the power output circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is even known to have magnetic generator circuits that
      produce more electrical power than is applied to the circuit.
      While this seems to contradict the laws of physics, it docs not,
      else such magnetic generator circuits would not work. These
      magnetic generator circuits work, on the basic principle that the
      space-time continuum is very energetic, including energy fields
      such as the Earth's magnetic field. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] It should be understood that electric fields and magnetic
      fields do not have an independent existence. A purely
      electromagnetic field in one coordinate system can appear as a
      mixture of electric and magnetic fields in another coordinate
      system. In other words, a magnetic field and at least partially
      turn it into an electric field, or vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      [00061 It is also well-known that a system that is far from
      equilibrium in its energy exchange with Hs environment can
      steadily and freely receive environmental energy and dissipate it
      in external loads. Such a system, can have a co-efficient of
      performance (COP) greater than 1.0. For a COP greater then 1.0, an
      electrical power system rnual lake some or all of its input energy
      from its active external environment. In other words, the system
      must be open to receiving and transducing energy from its external
      environment, as opposed to merely converting one form of energy to
      another form of energy.<br>
      <br>
      {00071 United States Patent No. 6,362,718 issued March 26, 2002 to
      Patrick et at. discloses an electromagnetic generator without
      moving pans. This electromagnetic generator includes a permanent
      magnet mounted within a rectangular ring-shaped magnetic core
      having a first magnetic path to one side of the permanent magnet
      and a second magnetic path to the other side of the permanent
      magnet. A first input coil and a first output coil extend around
      portions of the first magnetic path, with the first input coil
      being at least partially disposed between the permanent magnet and
      the first output coil. A second input coil and a second output
      coil extend around portions of the second magnetic path, with the
      second input coil being at least partially disposed between the
      permanent magnet and the second output coil. The input coils are
      alternatively pulsed by a switching and control circuit and
      provide induced current pulses in the output coils. Driving
      electrical current through each of the input coils reduces a levd
      of flux from the permanent magnet within the magnet path around
      which the input coil extends.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In an alternative embodiment of the Patrick et al
      electromagnetic generator, the magnetic core includes annular
      spaced-apart plates, with posts and permanent magnets extending in
      an alternating fashion between the plates. An output coil extends
      around each of these posts. Input coils extending around portions
      of the plates are pulsed to cause the induction of current within
      the output coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The apparent problems with the elect magnetic generator is
      disclosed m United States Patent No. 6,362,718 seem to be twofold.
      First, it is more expensive to produce than necessary as it has
      four coils. Secondly, while it apparently achieves a co-efficient
      of performance of more than 3.0, a much greater co-efficient of
      performance is readily achievable. This is believed to be due to
      the specific physical configuration of the magnetic paths.<br>
      <br>
      [00010] It is an object of the present invention to provide an
      electrical generator.<br>
      <br>
      [00011] It is another object of the present invention to provide
      an electrical generator having a co-efficient of performance
      greater than 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [00012] It is a further object of the present invention to provide
      an electrical generator having a co-efficient of performance
      significantly greater than 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00013] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention
      there is disclosed a novel electrical generator comprising an
      induction coil having a first end and a second end. There is a
      first magnet disposed adjacent the first end of the induction coil
      so as to be in the electro-magnetic of the induction coil when the
      induction coil is energized, and for creating a magnetic field
      around at least the first end of the induction coil. There is also

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00022] Referring to Figures 1 through 6 of the drawings, it will
      be noted that Figures 1 through 5 illustrate a Orst preferred
      embodiment of the electrical generator of the present invention,
      and Figure 6 illustrates a second preferred embodiment of the
      electrical generator of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [00023] Reference will now be made to Figures 1 through 5, which
      show a first preferred embodiment of the electrical generator of
      the present invention, as indicated by general reference numeral
      20. The electrical generator 20 comprises an induction coil 30
      having a first end 31 and a second end 32. The induction coil 30
      preferably includes a core 34 that is made from any suitable type
      of material, such as ferrit[beta], mumental, permalloy, cobalt,
      any non-permeable metal material, or any other suitable type of
      material. The coil 30 is wound from copper wire can be a single
      size wire or multiple sizes depending on the size of the ferrite
      core 34.<br>
      <br>
      [00024] There is a first magnet 40 disposed adjacent the induction
      coil 30, preferably at the first end 31 of the induction coil 30,
      so as to be in the electro-magnetic field of the induction coil 30
      when the induction coil 30 is energized. The first magnet 40
      comprises a permanent magnet that has its north pole facing ihe
      first end 31 of the induction coil 30. In the first preferred
      embodiment, the first magnet 40 is stationary with respect to the
      induction coil 30, and even more preferably contacts, or is even
      secured to the first end 31 of the induction coil 30. The size of
      the coil and the copper wire used to wind Ihe coil also depends on
      the size of the first magnet 40. The first magnet 40 is for
      creating a magnetic field around at least the first end 31 of the
      first magnet 30.<br>
      <br>
      [00025] There is also a second magnet 50 disposed adjacent the
      induction coil 30, preferably at the second end 32 of the
      induction coil 30 at a distance of about 1.0 cm so as to be in the
      electromagnetic field of the induction coil 30 when the induction
      coil 30 is energized. The gap between the second end 32 of the
      induction coil 30 and the second magnet 50 can be an air gap or
      can be a vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      [00026] The second magnet 50 comprises a permanent magnet that has
      ils north pole facing the second end 32 of the induction coil 30.
      In the first preferred embodiment, the second magnet 50 is
      stationary with respect to the induction coil 30. The size of the
      coil and the copper wire used to wind the coil also depends on the
      size of the second magnet 50. The second magnet 50 is for creating
      a magnetic field around at least the second end 32 of the second
      magnet 30.<br>
      <br>
      [00027] As can be seen in Figure 1. the first magnet 40 is
      oriented such that the first magnet 40 has its north pole facing
      the first cod 31 of the induction coil and its south pole facing
      away from the first end 31 of the induction coil 30. The first end
      31 of the induction coil 30 creates a south magnetic field when
      the induction coil 30 is energized. Tn this manner, the north pole
      of the first magnet 40 and the south pole of the first end 31 of
      the induction coil attract each other.<br>
      <br>
      [00028] Analogously, but oppositely, the second magnet 50 is
      oriented such (hat the .second magnet 50 has its north pole facing
      the second end 32 of the induction coil and its south pole facing
      away from the second end 32 of the induction coil 30. The second
      end 32 of the induction coil 30 creates a north magnetic field
      when the induction coil 30 is energized. In this manner, the north
      pole of the second magnet 50 and the north pole of the second end
      32 of the induction coil repel each other.<br>
      <br>
      [00029] A power input circuit portion, as indicated by the general
      reference numeral 60, is for providing power to the induction coil
      and comprises a source of electrical power 62. In the first
      preferred embodiment, as illustrated, the input source of
      electrical power 62 comprises a DC power source, specifically a
      battery 62, but additionally or alternatively may comprise a
      capacitor (not shown). The source of electrical power can range
      from less than 1.0 volt to more than 1,000,000 volts, and can
      range from less than one ampere to more than 1 million amperes.<br>
      <br>
      [00030] Alternatively, it is contemplated that the input source of
      electrical power could comprise an AC power source (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [00031] An input rectifier 64 that preferably, but not
      necessarily, is a Wheatstone bridge rectifier 64, has an input 66
      electrically connected to the source of electrical power 62 and
      also has an output 68. A first diode 70 is connected at its
      positive end 70a to one terminal 68a of the output 68 of the
      rectifier 62. A second diode 72 is connected at its negative end
      72a to the other terminal 68b of the output 68 of the rectifier
      62.<br>
      <br>
      [00032] There is also a timing means 80 in the input power circuit
      portion 60, and as shown electrically connected in series with the
      first diode 70, for creating electrical pulses and controlling the
      timing of the electrical pulses in the induction coil 30. The
      pulses are basically saw-tooth wave forma, as can be seen in
      Figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      [00033] Tn the first preferred embodiment, the timing means 80
      comprises a manual timer in the form of a set of "points" from the
      ignition system of a vehicle, as they can withstand high voitage
      and current levels.<br>
      <br>
      [00034] Alternatively, it is contemplated that the timing means
      could comprise an electronic timing circuit. Tt is also
      contemplated that a TGBT unit from a MIG welder could be used as
      the basis of the timing means 80, It has been found thai a timing
      means that provides a physical break in its "off" configuration
      works well as stray currents cannot back, track through the
      circuit at that time. The timing means can be of any suitable
      design as long as it can respond to -he placement of movable
      magnets 50 in the rotatable whcd 52.<br>
      <br>
      [00035] In use, the magnetic fields created by the first magnet 40
      and lhc second magnet 50 m conjunction with the coil 30, are each
      somewhat mushroom shaped, and oscillate back and forth, with
      respect to their size, in a manner corresponding io the timing of
      the dectrical pulses from the power input circuit portion 60, as
      caused by the tuning means 80.<br>
      <br>
      [00036] The power input circuit portion 60 further comprises an
      on/off switch 88 electrically connected m the power input circuit
      portion 60 in series with the second diode 72 and the induction
      coil 30, for selectively supplying power Io the induction coil 30.
      The on/off switch 88 may alternatively be located in any other
      suitable place in the power input circuit portion 60.<br>
      <br>
      [00037] A power output circuit portion, as indicated by the
      general reference numeral 90, is for receiving power from the
      induction coil and comprises an electrical load 92, that in the
      first preferred embodiment comprises a battery 92, but may
      additionally or alternatively comprise a capacitor (noi shown), or
      any other suitable electrical load device.<br>
      <br>
      [00038] The power output circuit portion 90 also comprises an
      output rectifier 94 having an input 96 an output 98 electrically
      connected to the electrical load 92 via a pair of forward biased
      diodes 100a, 100b that preclude the electrical load 92 from
      powering the induction coil 30. A first diode 102 is electrically
      connected at its positive end 102a to one terminal 94a of the
      input of the rectifier 94 and is electrically connected at its
      negative end 102b to one end of the induction coil 30. A second
      diode 104 is connected at its negative end 104a to lhc other
      terminal 94b of the input of the rectifier 94 and is electrically
      connected at its positive end 104b to the other end of the
      induction coil 30. The output of the coil, taken before the diodes
      102,104 is shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      [00039] The output at the electrical load 92 of the power output
      circuit portion 90 can range from less than 1.0 volt to more than
      1,000,000 volts, and can range from less than one ampere to more
      than 1 million amperes. As can be seen in Figure 5, the output at
      the electrical load 92 comprises generally spike-shaped pulses
      that have both negative and positive components.<br>
      <br>
      [00040] As can be readily seen in Figures 1 and 2, the input power
      circuit portion 60 is electrically connected in parallel with the
      induction coil 30 and the output power circuit portion 90 is
      electrically connected in parallel with the induction coil 30.<br>
      <br>
      [00041] The various diodes and rectifiers in the electrical
      generator 20 of the present invention can be of any suitable
      voltage from about 12 volts to over 1,000,000 volts, and can have
      a slow recovery time or a fast recovery time, as desired. Further,
      the various diodes and rectifiers may be configured in other
      suitable formats. There also may be additional capacitors added
      into the power output circuit portion adjacent the electrical load
      92 in order to increase the power in the power output circuit
      portion before discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [00042] It has been found that setting the timing of the timing
      means 80 to six hundred (600) pulses per minute provides a
      waveform in the power output circuit portion 90 that comprises
      generally spike-shaped pulses with a period of about 20
      nanoseconds. It is believed that the flux of the power pulses that
      are input into the induction coil 30 is quickly shifting the
      magnetic field back and forth in the induction coil 30, which is
      akin to the flux of the power pulses creating its own echo. The
      various electro-magnetic oscillations in the coil provide a much
      higher frequency in the power output circuit portion 90 than in
      the power input circuit portion 60.<br>
      <br>
      [00043] Reference will now be made to Figure 6, which shows a
      second preferred embodiment of the electrical generator of the
      present invention, as indicated by general reference numeral 220.
      The second preferred embodiment electrical generator 220 is
      similar to the first preferred embodiment electrical generator 20
      except that ihe second magnet comprises a plurality of movable
      magnets 2SO, specifically eight permanent magnets 250. The
      plurality of movable magnets 250 are each mounted on a rotatable
      wheel 252, and preferably are each mounted similarly one to
      another on the rotatable wheel 252. As desired, there can be any
      suitable number of movable magnets 250 m the rotatable wheel 252.
      Accordingly, the at least one movable magnet 250 is movable the
      electro-magnetic field of the induction coil 230 when the
      induction coil 230 is energized. The movable magnet[beta] 250 can
      be of any suitable strength and any suitable type of magnet, and
      maybe mounted on the rotatable wheel 252 by any suitable means,
      such as by a suitable adhesive, or may be mounted during the
      molding process if the rotatable wheel 252 is made from a plastic
      material. In use, the rotatable disk is rotated by the magnetic
      field of said induction coil when said induction coil is
      energized.<br>
      <br>
      [00044] It is also contemplated that the first magnet could be
      movable in the same manner as described for the second magnet 250.<br>
      <br>
      [00045] As can be understood from the above description and from
      the accompanying drawings, the present invention provides an
      electrical generator having a co-efficient of performance greater
      than 1.0., and more specifically an electrical generator having a
      co-efficient of performance significantly greater than 1.0. An
      electrical generator having a co-efficient of performance
      significantly greater than 1.0. is presently unknown in the prior
      art.<br>
      <br>
      [00046] Other variations of the above principles will be apparent
      to those who are knowledgeable in the field of the invention, and
      such variations are considered to be within the scope of the
      present invention. Further, other modifications and alterations
      may be used in the design and manufacture of the electrical
      generator of the present invention without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the accompanying claims.<br>
