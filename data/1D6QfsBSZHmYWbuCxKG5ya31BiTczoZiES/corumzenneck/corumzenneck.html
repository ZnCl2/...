      <b> </b>Aaron and Melissa Dykes of TruthstreamMedia were driving
      outside of Dallas near the small farming town of Milford, Texas,
      when a strange tower in the middle of a field caught their eye. It
      almost seemed like a joke because the shape was unmistakable. It
      looked just like Tesla/" "&gt;Nikola Tesla’s
      Wardenclyffe Tower, the legendary experimental wireless
      transmission station he built in 1901 in Shoreham, New York to
      transmit phone calls, fax images and electrical power but which
      was demolished 16 years later due to bankruptcy.<br>
      <br>
      A little bit of research revealed that the tower’s owners are
      Viziv Technologies and that the structure is, in fact a Tesla
      wireless transmission tower! Viziv is currently reviving the
      technologies of Tesla/" "&gt;Nikola Tesla, having
      “developed a system of patent-pending processes and equipment to
      efficiently launch the Zenneck surface wave…[which is ] an
      electromagnetic wave that uses the surface of the earth as a
      waveguide enabling it to carry communications signals or
      electrical power efficiently over long distances…”...<br>

      <b> </b>The Viziv surface wave system represents a paradigm shift
      in the science of electromagnetics.<br>
      <br>
      <b> WHAT IT IS</b><br>
      <b> </b>Our Viziv surface wave system allows the Earth itself to
      be used for clean, safe and efficient transfer of power between
      any two points on the globe, wirelessly. The system represents a
      paradigm shift in the science of electromagnetics.<br>
      <br>
      Today’s power distribution system of wired grids is fragile and
      aging.&nbsp; The transition to a global wireless system utilizing
      the Zenneck surface wave is a breakthrough that will effectively
      “cut the cord” between power generation facilities and the local
      distribution grids.&nbsp; This breakthrough will significantly
      enhance energy surety, reliability, and resiliency of the world’s
      electrical distribution systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b> HOW IT WORKS</b><br>
      <b> </b>Viziv Technologies has developed a system of
      patent-pending processes and equipment to efficiently launch the
      Zenneck surface wave. Currently, our research and
      commercialization efforts are focused on energy transfer and
      communications, but we recognize that this technology has the
      potential to impact numerous sectors of the economy.<br>
      <br>
      A Zenneck Surface Wave is an electromagnetic wave that uses the
      surface of the earth as a waveguide enabling it to carry
      communications signals or electrical power efficiently over long
      distances.<br>
      <br>
      This wireless power system will employ a “transmitter probe,”
      located near a power generation plant, to launch a Zenneck carrier
      wave.&nbsp; Receiver antennae will be positioned appropriately
      around the world to receive the signal and download the power into
      a local microgrid or conventional grid architecture.<br>
      <br>
      The wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or
      geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses (EMP), including
      those associated with a nuclear detonation.&nbsp; Unlike a wired
      grid, the Zenneck wave cannot be physically attacked and cyber
      attacks would be challenged to target or cause cascading failures
      to a wireless system.<br>
      <br>
      When launched, the Zenneck Surface Wave literally envelops the
      planet like a balloon, enabling transmitter probes to be placed
      anywhere power can be generated and receivers to be placed
      anywhere power is needed....<br>

            The Montauk Experiment &amp; Montauk Survivor Accounts</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <br>
      Dr. James F Corum looks at the Philadelphia experiment through the
      critical eyes of a scientist. <br>
      <br>
      In the late 1970's, he recruited a team of scientists to, for fun,
      see if there was any scientific basis for the description of
      events that occurred during the Philadelphia experiment as
      expressed in the book, "The Philadelphia Experiment", by Berlitz
      and Moore.<br>
      <br>
      Much to everybody's astonishment, there was.<br>
      <br>
      In 1994 at the Tesla Symposium at Colorado Springs, he, along with
      his brother K.L. Corum Ph.D. and J.F.X Daum, PhD., presented their
      findings in a paper titled "Tesla's Egg of Columbus, Radar
      Stealth, The Torsion Tensor, and the Philadelphia Experiment"<br>
      <br>
      They were, in a laboratory, able to replicate radar invisibility
      with their "egg of Columbus" apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Their initial conclusion was as follows:<br>
      <br>
      "The analysis would appear to lend credence to the hypothesis that
      something more than mythology is involved, and it renders
      plausible the conclusion that sufficient motivation exists to
      actually conduct a "Philadelphia Experiment" to examine radar
      stealth on ships with electric drives.&nbsp; Independent of
      whether our assumed values are practical or not, the analysis,
      which uses no phenomenology that wasn't known subsequent to 1938,
      would probably have brought WWII Naval investigators to the point
      of radar stealth experimentation.&nbsp; In fact, it would have
      been derelict behavior for the Defense Science Research Board not
      to have conducted such experiments if it were aware of the
      Phenomenology (as it must have been) in 1943.&nbsp; Such an
      approach to stealth, however, is impractical and certainly would
      be of little interest, as such, to the military today."<br>
      <br>
      His paper is, as he says, to serve as a "basis for discussion" for
      "critical, not skeptical" scientific thinking about the
      possibilities of scientific explanation for the events surrounding
      the Philadelphia Experiment. He asks other scientists to review
      his team's work and provide critical feedback.<br>

      Disclosed are various embodiments for superposition of guided
      surface wave launched along the surface of a lossy medium. In one
      example, Zenneck surface waves are launched along a surface of a
      lossy conducting medium using an array of guided surface waveguide
      probes and a predefined field pattern of the Zenneck surface waves
      is maintained. The individual ones of the guided surface waveguide
      probes include a feed network electrically coupled to a charge
      terminal. The feed network provides a phase delay that matches a
      wave tilt angle associated with a complex Brewster angle of
      incidence associated with the lossy conducting medium<b><br>
