      <br>
      Director of the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas, Dr.
      Carl Baugh has invented and patented a 'Hyperbaric Biosphere'
      chamber to test Biblical claims regarding pre-flood atmosphere and
      magnetic conditions based on Genesis.<br>
      <br>
      Genesis states that life on earth was created 'perfect' and
      designed to live forever. It also states that after the fall of
      man, all elements of which everything is made, were cursed.
      Genesis then records the gradual degeneration of the whole of
      creation until the flood of Noah followed by an increasing rate of
      degeneration as time progressed.<br>
      <br>
      If the dates and years reported use the same standards we do in
      modern times, then there is an overlapping of pre-flood humans
      with that of post-flood survivors where the pre-flood humans lived
      many more years.<br>
      <br>
      The average age of man prior to the flood was approximately 920
      years, after the flood, mans lifespan declined by 250 years until
      the time of Christ when lifespans averaged 70 years. Tests
      indicate simulation of a pre-flood environment would produce
      conditions of increased longevity, cellular growth and a change in
      molecular structures.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Dr. Baugh's experiments with his special hyperbaric biosphere have
      produced fascinating results that indicate potential methods to
      heal and/or rejuvenate people today. NASA has even requested Dr.
      Baugh's research and discoveries to determine their applicability
      to the space program. <br>
      <br>

      <b>Hyperbaric Biosphere</b><br>
      <br>
      Experiments carried out in this pre-flood atmospheric chamber have
      produced amazing evidence supporting the biblical record of the
      pre-flood world.<br>
      <br>
      Some examples include;<br>
      <br>
      extended life span of drosophila fruit flies up to three
      generations, molecular change of venom in copperhead snakes to a
      non-toxic state, accelerated growth of piranha fish - from 2" to
      16" over a 2.5 years period.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The Hyperbaric Biosphere patent allows for the ability to vary the
      mix of gases comprising the atmosphere in the chamber as well as
      to vary the electromagnetic field intensity, frequency and
      duration.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Baugh and an unidentified associate handle deadly copperhead
      snakes used in an experiment to test whether increased oxygen
      levels, as would be experienced in pre-flood conditions, might
      alter the physiology of the snakes.<br>
      <br>
      He contends an artificial pre-flood environment could be
      duplicated with increased oxygen, higher pressure and the use of
      higher EM fields<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="baugh2.jpg" width="280"

      <br>
      Another investigation at the creation evidence museum, the gnarled
      'spaghetti-like' formation of copperhead snake venom as seen under
      the scanning electron microscope before the copperhead snake was
      'housed' in a small hyperbaric chamber.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      After four weeks in the hyperbaric chamber, venom from the same
      copperhead snake shows a much less distorted structure (less
      gnarled) indicating a lowering of the toxicity level. Conditions
      in the hyperbaric chamber are seeking to provide the type of
      environment that existed in the time prior to the great flood.<br>
      <br>
      Additional information that might be of use;<br>
      <br>
      It has been estimated by researchers at the University of Illinois
      that the atmospheric pressures in the earliest beginnings of life
      on earth, could have been as much as 29.4 pounds per square inch,
      twice the current sea level pressure (14.7 psi at sea level).<br>
      <br>
      1) oxygen content would have been about 30% instead of the 21% we
      experience today<br>
      <br>
      2) an open wound could heal overnight under these conditions<br>
      <br>
      3) this atmospheric condition would support human life lasting
      several hundred years<br>
      <br>
      A related post sent to a discussion list recounts the following
      unconfirmed information about rejuvenation effects noted by
      aquanauts living underwater for periods of 30 days or greater.<br>

      Hi everyone,<br>
      <br>
      A friend of mine who worked for the NSA related an experiment that
      was conducted by NASA. Three scientists lived on the floor of the
      ocean for about 1-3 months in a biosphere.<br>
      <br>
      When they left they were all middle aged with graying hair and low
      libidos.<br>
      <br>
      When they returned their hair was clear of gray, their wrinkles
      had started to disappear, and their sex drive was so increased
      that their wives complaied to NASA about it.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that certain glands and organs were "reactivated."
      One in particular was the gland that lies over the top of the
      heart. Blood tests showed unusual hormones. Hormones that are
      normally associated with the growth of young children.<br>
      <br>
      f you check the Creation Research Center and look up the url for
      the Creation Research Institute you can then find the geologist
      who recreated the atmosphere of the flood in a container. I havent
      checked for his name yet. Been behind on my page and other
      projects, but I am having a pastor friend look into it for me.<br>
      <br>
      What if we take this knowledge and build a "room" that emulates
      the atmosphere of the Earth before the flood and sleep in it for 8
      hours a day? What effects might it have? My friend from the NSA
      said that for every day spent in there one year was added onto
      your life until you maxed out at 1000.<br>

          <b>Closed ecological system and method for supporting life</b><br>
          <b>US5935516</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An apparatus to contain a closed ecological system, wherein the
      apparatus includes a closed, air-tight chamber to contain an
      atmosphere. The chamber includes at least one access opening
      designed to allow plants, animals, raw materials, and other items
      to be placed within the chamber. The chamber includes a system for
      introducing oxygen and/or carbon dioxide into the chamber and for
      maintaining the oxygen and/or carbon dioxide at a predetermined
      concentration percentage of the atmosphere. Preferably, the closed
      ecological system of the present invention also includes a system
      for establishing a magnetic field within the chamber of a
      predetermined strength and orientation. The chamber may also
      include systems for elevating the atmospheric pressure within the
      chamber and for maintaining the atmosphere within the chamber at a
      predetermined temperature and humidity level. The chamber may also
      include a specialized lighting and sound system to establish light
      and sound of a predetermined intensity, frequency, and wavelength
      within the chamber. A satellite chamber may be provided in
      selective fluid communication with the closed ecological system
      for providing plants, animals, or chemical processes with
      short-term exposure to the conditions of the closed ecological
      system. The present invention is also directed to a method of
      establishing and maintaining a closed ecological system to support
      plant and animal life and to aid in the development, discovery,
      and/or production of new and improved chemical compounds that may
      be used as pharmaceuticals and other chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to closed ecological
      systems, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for
      establishing and maintaining a closed ecological system wherein
      the environment within the closed system is controlled such that
      plant and animal life can exist to its more optimal potential and
      thrive, the effects and causes of plant and animal disease can be
      reduced and/or eliminated, mental well being of animals can be
      fostered, and new and improved pharmaceuticals and other chemical
      compounds (organic and inorganic) can be discovered and/or
      synthesized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The environment in which we live with plants and other animals has
      changed since biological systems first appeared. The composition
      of the air we breathe has continued to change. For example, there
      is reason to believe that the concentration of oxygen found within
      the air has decreased over time. The climate, including
      temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, and the like has also
      been changing. It is further theorized that other important
      changes in the environment of the earth over time have been the
      marked decrease in atmospheric pressure, a decrease in the
      concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere, changes
      in the strength and orientation of the earth's magnetic field, and
      the change in the intensity and characteristics of the light
      radiation to which we are exposed. Furthermore, sounds of nature
      such as singing birds have become increasingly difficult to
      encounter due to a general decrease in the population of
      songbirds.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the above and other changes are a natural result of the
      maturing of the earth. Other changes to the earth's environment
      are caused by purely natural events--volcanic eruptions,
      earthquakes, tidal waves, glaciers, and the like alter the earth
      itself and the surrounding atmosphere. Other changes to the earth
      and its atmosphere are due entirely to man. Pollution,
      overpopulation, overdevelopment, overutilization of natural
      resources, fishing, hunting, and farming have all altered our
      world. As the human population continues to increase, the pace at
      which these changes occur will inevitably increase.<br>
      <br>
      These changes in the earth and the surrounding environment have
      had a detrimental impact on plants and animals including man.
      Certain plants and animals have vanished from the earth, unable to
      adapt to the changed earth. Many of the remaining varieties of
      plants and animals have found it difficult to thrive. The fruits
      and vegetables of trees and plants have lost taste and nutritional
      value. Animals, including humans, are increasingly disease
      stricken, weak, and otherwise unhealthy. Humans seem to have lost
      their general sense of well being, leading to an increase in
      depression, suicides, crime, violence, sickness, and other social
      and physical ailments and have become increasingly lethargic with
      shortened attention spans.<br>
      <br>
      The increasing physical and mental ailments of humans has led to a
      constant search for new and improved pharmaceuticals to combat
      these sicknesses. As one example, scientists are constantly
      searching the far reaches of the planet for naturally occurring
      antiviral and antibiotic substances. Once such naturally occurring
      substances are discovered, scientists may attempt to synthesize
      these drugs in a laboratory. While much progress has been made in
      the field of locating and synthesizing these compounds for use as
      pharmaceuticals, many ailments currently have no known effective
      treatment drugs or the causative agents have been able to adapt or
      modify their own structure to develop a resistance to such
      treatments. For example, many cancers and AIDS have been
      particularly resistant to pharmaceuticals located and/or
      synthesized using conventional methods in standard environmental
      conditions. It is believed that the changes in the earth's
      environment have prevented certain drugs from being created in
      nature, discovered, and/or synthesized, and has prevented the
      compounding of certain organic and inorganic elements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to solve the
      above and other problems caused by changes in the earth and its
      surrounding environment.<br>
      <br>
      It is also an object of the present invention to provide a closed
      ecological system including an atmosphere with an elevated oxygen
      content.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a closed
      ecological system including an atmosphere with an elevated
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a closed
      ecological system with an atmosphere having an elevated
      concentration of carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
      closed ecological system including a low level magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a closed
      ecological system including specialized lighting and sound.<br>
      <br>
      Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a
      closed ecological system with a controlled temperature, humidity,
      and other climate variables.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a closed
      ecological system having an overall environment that is favorable
      to the natural formation and/or the manufacture of improved
      compounds used to manufacture pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
      sickness and disease.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention accomplishes these and other objects by
      providing an apparatus to contain a closed ecological system,
      wherein the apparatus comprises a closed, air-tight chamber to
      contain an atmosphere, and wherein the chamber includes at least
      one access opening. The access opening is designed to allow
      plants, animals, raw materials, and other items to be placed
      within the chamber. The chamber includes means for introducing
      oxygen and/or carbon dioxide into the chamber and means for
      maintaining the oxygen and/or carbon dioxide at a predetermined
      concentration percentage of the atmosphere. Preferably, the closed
      ecological system of the present invention also includes means for
      establishing a magnetic field within the chamber of a
      predetermined strength and orientation. The chamber may also
      include means for elevating the atmospheric pressure within the
      chamber and means for maintaining the atmosphere within the
      chamber at a predetermined temperature and humidity level. The
      chamber may also include a specialized lighting and sound system
      to establish light and sound of a predetermined intensity,
      frequency, and wavelength within the chamber. A satellite chamber
      may be provided in selective fluid communication with the closed
      ecological system for providing plants, animals, or chemical
      processes with short-term exposure to the conditions of the closed
      ecological system.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is also directed to a method of establishing
      and maintaining a closed ecological system to support plant and
      animal life and to aid in the development, discovery, and/or
      production of new and improved chemical compounds that may be used
      as pharmaceuticals.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred
      embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in
      the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference
      numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same
      or like parts.<br>
      <br>
      An apparatus for establishing, containing, and maintaining a
      closed ecological system in accordance with the present invention
      is shown generally at 10 in FIGS. 1-7 and comprises an air-tight,
      substantially hollow chamber 20 made of plastic, metal,
      fiberglass, or any other suitable material. Chamber 20 includes a
      sealable access opening such as hinged door 22 provided with
      suitable air locks 24 and seals (not shown) to ensure that door 22
      does not reduce the air-tight integrity of the chamber 20. Chamber
      20 is designed to contain therein an atmosphere, plants, animals,
      objects and any other desired components of a closed ecological
      system such that plants and animals may live therein and such that
      chemical reactions such as the production of pharmaceuticals can
      be carried out therein. Chamber 20 may be of any size desired such
      that the ecological system established and maintained therein may
      be of any suitable size. Chamber 20 may only be large enough to
      contain a few small plants and animals, or chamber 20 may be large
      enough to contain a community of numerous human beings. As shown,
      chamber 20 is sufficiently large to contain at least one human
      being and several plants and animals. Chamber 20 may include
      air-tight windows 26 formed therein or in door 22 thereof using
      suitable glass or plastic to allow those outside of the chamber 20
      to observe the plants, animals, and any other animals, objects
      and/or conditions inside of chamber 20. Door 22 may be opened to
      remove, add, or reorient specimens as desired, after
      depressurization has returned internal pressure to ambient
      conditions. Windows 26 are designed to filter ultra-violet (UV)
      light to prevent unwanted UV light from affecting the ecological
      system contained within chamber 20. Specifically, UV light causes
      or encourages the formation of "free radicals" that are thought to
      be harmful to animals.<br>
      <br>
      Chamber 20 is supported upon a base 12 to prevent the unwanted
      movement of the chamber 20 and other components of the apparatus
      10. A sub-chamber or premixing chamber 28 (FIGS. 4 and 5) is
      preferably provided and is in selective fluid communication with
      chamber 20 through pipes or other conduits 27. Sub-chamber 28
      provides a means for premixing the gases and liquids to be added
      to chamber 20 to ensure that such gases and liquids are uniformly
      distributed within chamber 20. It should be recognized that
      chamber 28 may also function as a satellite chamber in selective
      fluid communication with chamber 20 for establishing and
      maintaining a closed ecological system similar to that found
      within chamber 20, such that plants, animals, chemical reactions
      and the like can be placed within the closed ecological system
      found within the satellite chamber for time periods that differ
      (usually shorter) from the amount of time chamber 20 needs to
      remain closed. To function as a satellite chamber, sub-chamber 28
      would need to include an access opening such as a door, and would
      need to include at least some of the features of chamber 20 as
      they are set forth below. Also, if sub-chamber 28 is to be used as
      a satellite chamber, chamber 20 and sub-chamber must be shielded
      from each other with a lead shield or the like to prevent the
      magnetic field (discussed fully below) of one chamber 20, 28 from
      interfering with the magnetic field of the other chamber 20, 28.
      For example, in addition to conducting experiments relating to the
      natural creation and/or synthesis of pharmaceuticals within
      chamber 20, sub-chamber 28, when properly adapted as a satellite
      chamber, may alternatively be utilized for the same types of
      experiments. Various chemicals could be mixed and placed within
      sub-chamber 28 for a period of time, and thereafter be removed
      from sub-chamber 28 and examined, without opening door 22 of
      chamber 20 and without altering the ecological system found within
      chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      Conduits 27 between sub-chamber 28 and chamber 20 are selectively
      blocked or closed using gate valves 29 (FIG. 5) or the like so
      that sub-chamber 28 may be selectively "disconnected" or prevented
      from being in fluid communication with chamber 20 to protect the
      integrity of the ecological system found within chamber 20 during
      premixing operations. After sub-chamber 28 is "disconnected" from
      chamber 20, various gases and other components of the closed
      ecological system as described herein may be introduced into
      chamber 28, without altering the ecological system within chamber
      20. When the gases and liquids introduced into sub-chamber 28 are
      properly mixed, which may occur naturally or with the aid of
      mixing devices such as blowers, gate valves 29 may be opened to
      allow the properly mixed gases and liquids to enter chamber 20 as
      is described below. Sub-chamber 28 includes a pressure relief
      valve 25 so that excess pressure may be vented from sub-chamber 28
      if necessary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the
      apparatus need not include a sub-chamber 28 and such is
      contemplated herein, although use of sub-chamber 28 is thought to
      be preferable. Also, those skilled in the art will recognize that
      any ecological system or conditions created and maintained in
      chamber 20 may also be created and maintained in sub-chamber 28,
      and for reasons of clarity, the following description will not
      necessarily refer to providing an ecological system within both
      chambers 20,28 but will instead refer primarily to chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      Apparatus 10 includes numerous components and features such that
      an ecological system can be created and maintained within chamber
      20 and so that the characteristics of the ecological system so
      created and maintained, such as temperature, atmospheric pressure,
      humidity, magnetic field, oxygen level, carbon dioxide level, and
      the like may be accurately varied and monitored. One or more
      feeder valves such as dual ball valves 30 are provided in fluid
      communication with the interior of chamber 20 and are also
      connected to vacuum/pressure pump 38 (FIG. 5) to allow fluids such
      as air, oxygen, water, nutrients and others (organic and
      inorganic) to be communicated from the appropriate source into the
      ecological system found within chamber 20 through one or more
      valves 30. As is noted above, it is thought preferable to premix
      fluids in sub-chamber 28 prior to introducing the fluids into
      chamber 20. Feeder lines or conduits may be surrounded by a
      coolant or other thermal fluid to vary the temperature of the
      fluid in the feeder line. Because of the potentially elevated
      atmospheric pressure (hyperbaric pressure) within chamber 20, dual
      ball valves 30 are thought to provide a more effective seal to
      prevent the escape of gases from the chamber 20 and to otherwise
      protect the integrity of the closed ecological system created and
      maintained by the apparatus 10, although other suitable valves are
      known and are contemplated for use in conjunction with the present
      invention 10. A pressure gauge 32 is also provided to allow those
      outside of chamber 20 to monitor the atmospheric pressure within
      chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure of the atmosphere within chamber 20 may be varied as
      desired to provide an elevated atmospheric pressure. It is thought
      preferable for example to create a hyperbaric closed ecological
      system--i.e., a closed ecological system having an increased
      atmospheric pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure normally
      encountered on earth. It is thought most preferable to provide an
      environment inside of chamber 20 having an atmospheric pressure of
      1 to 2 atmospheres of pressure. FIG. 5 shows a pressure sensor or
      transducer 36 coupled to a pressure control mechanism such as
      pressure control computer 37 to control and regulate the pressure
      inside of chamber 20 and/or 28. Transducer 36 converts air
      pressure into electrical signals to provide input data to pressure
      control computer 37 so that computer can continually monitor the
      air pressure within chamber 20 and adjust the same accordingly. A
      vacuum/pressure pump 38 is provided in fluid communication with
      chamber 20 so that the pressure in chamber 20 can be elevated
      using compressed air generated by pump 38 and transferred into
      chamber 20 through one or more of the valves 30. Pump 38 may also
      be used to create a vacuum suction to draw air from chamber 20
      resulting in a low pressure environment within chamber 20. As a
      safety and control measure, a high pressure safety switch 35 is
      provided to prevent overpressurization of the chamber 20.
      Likewise, a low pressure safety switch 31 is provided to prevent
      an excessive vacuum condition from being established within
      chamber 20. A pressure relay 39 is provided to selectively
      energize vacuum/pressure pump 38 as needed to increase or decrease
      the atmospheric pressure in chamber 20 and a blow off valve 33 is
      provided in fluid communication with chamber 20 to allow excessive
      air pressure that may be contained therein to be rapidly vented
      automatically when the atmospheric pressure within chamber 20
      exceeds some threshold value such as 2 atmospheres.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to an elevated atmospheric pressure, the closed
      ecological system of the present invention 10 preferably includes
      an atmosphere within chamber 20 having an elevated oxygen
      concentration relative to the concentration of oxygen normally
      found in the air surrounding the earth. Specifically, it is
      thought preferable to maintain a concentration of oxygen within
      chamber 20 such that the oxygen is equal to 22%-30% by volume of
      the atmosphere contained within chamber 20 when the atmospheric
      pressure is in the range of 1-2 atmospheres. For long term
      occupation within chamber 20 the oxygen level is most preferably
      maintained at 22%-24% by volume at 2 atmospheres of pressure,
      while for short term occupation, a month or less, the oxygen level
      within chamber 20 may be elevated to 26%-30% by volume at 2
      atmospheres of pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A source of oxygen such as a pressurized holding tank 40 or the
      like is provided to supply oxygen to the system 10. Alternatively,
      oxygen may be generated by an electrolysis process. Oxygen supply
      tank 40 is in fluid communication with vacuum/pressure pump 38 and
      chamber 20 using the appropriate conduits and connections. A valve
      assembly such as oxygen solenoid valve 42 is controlled by a
      control mechanism such as oxygen control computer 44 which is
      provided between supply tank 40 and pump 38 to regulate the flow
      of oxygen to pump 38 and into chamber 20 through one or more
      valves 30 (FIG. 1). An oxygen sensor 46 is provided in one or both
      chambers 20, 28 to sense the concentration of oxygen therein.
      Sensor 46 provides the concentration to oxygen control computer 44
      as input so that computer 44 may determine if oxygen solenoid
      valve 42 should remain closed or should be opened to allow more
      oxygen to enter chambers 20, 28. A filter 82 is preferably
      provided between oxygen supply tank 40 and pump 38 to filter any
      contaminants from the oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      By combining an increased level of oxygen concentration with a
      hyperbaric atmospheric pressure inside of chamber 20, the amount
      of oxygen absorbed by animals within the chamber 20 is maximized.
      This increased absorption of oxygen by the animals, including
      humans, leads to increased physical healing through the increased
      oxygen absorption of the cells of the animal, increased immunity,
      an increased level of mental awareness, and a general sense of
      well being for the animals that spend time within the closed
      ecological system created and maintained by apparatus 10. The
      increased absorption of oxygen by the animal cells raises the
      internal temperature of the cells, resulting in the damage to
      cancerous cells which have been found to have a lower resistance
      to heat than ordinary cells. As is discussed below in relation to
      FIGS. 9 and 10, the increased concentration of oxygen combined
      with an elevated atmospheric pressure, alone or in combination
      with other aspects of the closed ecological system found within
      chamber 20, has been found to result in the natural production of
      a superior snake venom having medicinal properties. Also, it is
      believed that the in increased oxygen level and atmospheric
      pressure contributes to improving the reactions among various
      chemicals which can lead to the production of superior chemical
      compounds such as very effective pharmaceuticals that may be used
      to treat illnesses for which there are currently few or no
      effective treatment drugs.<br>
      <br>
      In conjunction with increasing the concentration of oxygen in
      chamber 20, it may also be desirable in certain circumstances to
      increase the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in chamber 20.
      It has been theorized that an increased concentration of carbon
      dioxide lengthens the gestation period for mammals. This may be
      desirable to prevent premature births (births before the end of
      the normal gestation period for any particular mammal) or to
      lengthen the gestation period beyond normal to increase the
      development of the fetus. Carbon dioxide normally comprises
      approximately 0.026% by volume of the air normally encountered by
      mammals on earth. The apparatus 10 allows a closed ecological
      system to be created wherein the concentration of carbon dioxide
      therein may be elevated to approximately 0.1%-0.3% by volume. This
      increased level of carbon dioxide, in conjunction with an elevated
      atmospheric pressure of approximately 2 atmospheres leads to the
      lengthened gestation period for mammals. It has also been found
      that raising the level of carbon dioxide assimilation in plants
      enhances plant production of stalks, leaves, and fruit.<br>
      <br>
      As is shown in FIG. 5, a supply of carbon dioxide such as a
      pressurized carbon dioxide supply tank 50 or the like is provided
      in fluid communication with pump 38, through filter 82 designed to
      remove contaminants from the carbon dioxide. Pump 38 is in fluid
      communication with chamber 20 through one or more dual ball valves
      30. A carbon dioxide sensor 52 is capable of sensing the
      concentration of carbon dioxide in the chambers 20, 28. A control
      mechanism such as carbon dioxide control computer 54 receives the
      concentration of carbon dioxide from sensor 52 as input and
      determines whether to increase the concentration thereof. If more
      carbon dioxide is needed within chamber 20, carbon dioxide control
      computer 54 causes a valve assembly such as carbon dioxide
      solenoid valve 56 to open, thereby allowing carbon dioxide to flow
      from supply tank 50 to pump 38 and thereafter into chamber 20
      through one or more valves 30.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus 10 of the present invention also includes systems to
      control the temperature and humidity of the air within chamber 20
      and also includes an air filtration system to remove contaminants
      from the air. A temperature sensor 60 is provided within chamber
      20 to sense the temperature therein. Sensor 60 is coupled to a
      temperature control unit 62 which may be a computer or a simple
      thermostat, which is coupled to a heating and cooling pump 64.
      Heating and cooling pump 64 is capable of adding heat to or
      removing heat from chambers 20, 28 as desired to control the
      temperature therein. Heating and cooling pump 64 is coupled to
      chambers 20,28 through a check valve 68 to sub-chamber 28 and main
      chamber 20. Preferably, the temperature inside of chambers 20 and
      28 is maintained in the range of 70 DEG -80 DEG Fahrenheit (F.) at
      all times. The temperature may be decreased to approximately 70
      DEG F. at "night" and maintained at approximately 80 DEG F. during
      the "day." Of course, the terms "day" and "night" do not
      necessarily refer to the time of day outside of the chambers 20,
      28 although "day" and "night" within the chambers 20, 28 may be
      controlled to correspond to conditions outside of the chambers 20,
      28. Electric lights 25 (FIGS. 4 and 6) are provided to shine light
      into the chamber 20 through windows 26. Lights 25 receive power
      from a power supply 21 and are also connected to a control
      box/timer 23 that allows an operator of the apparatus 10 to vary
      the intensity, duration, and wavelength of each light 25. Lights
      25 are preferably filtered to provide a wavelength primarily in
      the range of 6365 Angstroms which results in a magenta light.
      Therefore, "day" may occur anytime lights 25 are on while "night"
      may occur anytime no light is shining through windows 26 because
      of darkness surrounding chamber 20 or because of shades or the
      like being placed over windows 26.<br>
      <br>
      The humidity within chambers 20, 28 is also closely monitored and
      is maintained in the range of 40%-60%. A humidity sensor 70 is
      provided within chamber 20 to sense the percentage of moisture
      found in the atmosphere within chamber 20 and is coupled to a
      humidity control unit 72 which may include a gravity
      collection/injection valve apparatus or any other suitable
      humidity control apparatus. Humidity control unit 72 is coupled to
      a computer system 74 that is capable of controlling the humidity
      control unit 72 to maintain the humidity within chambers 20, 28 at
      the desired 40%-60%. Humidity control unit 72 and computer system
      74 are coupled through a switch 76 to vacuum/pressure pump 38 such
      that pump 38 may be selectively energized through switch 76. Pump
      38 is coupled to a desiccator unit 78 which is in fluid
      communication with chambers 20, 28. Upon being energized through
      switch 76, pump draws air from within chambers 20, 28, through
      desiccator unit 78 wherein moisture is removed from the air. The
      dehumidified air is then returned into chamber 20 through one or
      more valves 30. Because of the closed nature of closed ecological
      system created and maintained in apparatus 10, it will not
      normally be necessary to add humidity to chambers 20, 28, although
      such is contemplated and may be accomplished by the addition of a
      humidifier to the apparatus 10.<br>
      <br>
      Apparatus 10 is also provided with an air filtration system
      comprising an air filter 80 provided in fluid communication with
      vacuum/pressure pump 38 and heating and cooling pump 64 such that
      any air introduced into chambers 20, 28 using vacuum/pressure pump
      38 and/or heating and cooling pump 64 is first filtered of any
      airborne contaminants such as dust and bacteria. Both filter 80,
      and filter 82 discussed previously, may be a conventional filter
      media such as a foam or mesh, may be an electrostatic ionization
      filtration system that electrically charges the contaminants so
      that they are attracted to either a positively charged or
      negatively charged surface, or the air filters 80,82 may be a
      combination thereof or any other suitable air filtering system.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus 10 further comprises means for establishing and
      maintaining a magnetic field within the chamber 20 of a
      predetermined strength and orientation. As with other aspects of
      the apparatus and the closed ecological system created and
      maintained thereby, a magnetic field may also be established
      within chamber 28 although for reasons of clarity, reference will
      only be made to chamber 20. Referring to FIG. 7 wherein the
      apparatus 10 is shown schematically, a magnetic field coil 90
      comprising shielded copper wire or the like surrounds and/or lines
      chamber 20 and is coupled by wires or the like to a D/D power
      generator 92 which generates controlled electromagnetic pulses
      (Hz) at optimal energy levels (Gauss). D/D power generator 92 is
      connected to a control mechanism such as control panel 94 which
      may be an analog device or a digital computer allowing a machine
      operator to vary the strength and orientation of the magnetic
      field created by the magnetic field coil 90 by varying the
      magnitude and direction of the electric current flowing through
      magnetic field coil 90.<br>
      <br>
      It is thought preferable to establish and maintain a magnetic
      field within chamber 20 of 0.5 Hz to 30 Hz at 1-5 Gauss and is
      thought most preferable to average a magnetic field of 8 Hz within
      chamber 20. A variable magnetic field of 8 Hz (average, with
      intensity nearing 5 Gauss) is thought to simulate the magnetic
      field found on earth thousands of years ago. The magnetic field
      may be cyclical--i.e., turned on and off, or raised and lowered
      depending upon other aspects of the closed ecological system. For
      example, the magnetic field may be elevated only in the "day" or
      "night" as such terms are defined above. Alternatively or in
      conjunction with the "day and "night" variables, the magnetic
      field may be dependent upon the song activity of live birds
      present within the chamber 20 or dependent upon the sounds of
      birds that are broadcast within the chamber 20 through a sound
      system as is discussed in greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 schematically illustrates a sound system 100 to be used in
      conjunction with the apparatus 10 of the present invention to
      establish predetermined sounds within the chamber 20. Sound system
      100 comprises a power supply 102 which may be the same as power
      supply 21 discussed previously, or power supply 102 may be
      separate therefrom. Power supply 102 is connected to and provides
      electrical power to a sound control panel 104 from where one may
      control the selection and characteristics of the sounds broadcast
      by the sound system 100 into chamber 20. Control panel 104 is
      connected to one or more speakers 106 for broadcasting sound and
      is also connected to one or more microphones 108 for receiving
      sound from within chamber 20 and transmitting the same onto a
      recording medium or for broadcasting such sounds outside of
      chamber 20. Control panel 104 may be located either inside or
      outside of chamber 20 such that sound system 100 may be controlled
      by a person outside of chamber 20 or inside chamber 20, depending
      upon the location of control panel 104. It has been found
      beneficial for animals and plants to be within chamber 20 while
      sound from sound system 100 is broadcast into chamber 20. For
      example, harmonic music corresponding to songs of birds within
      chamber 20 at controlled times and under controlled conditions has
      been found to be particularly beneficial to plants and animals
      within chamber 20. By broadcasting the songs of birds where the
      songs are tuned to a frequency of 256 Hz ranging from 2-60
      decibels in intensity, the sounds of the harmonic music will be
      tuned to the antenna of the DNA and cellular structure of the
      cells of animals which thereby causes a resonance of such cells
      and alters the vibratory cycle of the cells, leading to the
      improved health thereof, and leading to the deterioration of
      abnormal cells. As an alternative to broadcasting songs of birds
      into chamber 20, symphonic music, broadcast into chamber 20 in
      accordance with the above-noted broadcast parameters, may
      alternatively be utilized with the same or similar therapeutic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned previously, the apparatus 10 allows for the creation
      of a closed ecological system in accordance with the above,
      thereby creating an environment conducive to the manufacture of
      exceptional pharmaceuticals for treating diseases and ailments for
      which safe and effective pharmaceuticals have not yet been
      discovered. Such exceptional pharmaceuticals may be obtained
      through natural organic production of living systems themselves or
      may be obtained by mixing various chemicals. For example,
      referring now to FIGS. 9 and 10, there can be seen a scanning
      electron microscope view of snake venom obtained from a Copperhead
      snake living under ordinary conditions found on earth (FIG. 9) and
      a scanning electron microscope view of snake venom obtained from
      the same snake, after the snake lived in an apparatus 10 housing a
      closed ecological system as is set forth above. Those skilled in
      the art will recognize the markedly improved characteristics of
      the venom shown in FIG. 10 obtained from the Copperhead snake that
      inhabited the closed ecological system of the present apparatus 10
      for four weeks. Snake venom shown in FIG. 10 has been experimented
      with and found to have medicinal properties such as decreasing the
      size and occurrence of cancerous tumors, and providing relief from
      emotional illnesses. It is theorized that the toxicity of snake
      venom in the present invention would be lowered, if not
      eliminated, and the coherent structured chemical formation as
      shown would lead to immediate assimilation into patient receptors.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the apparatus 10 may
      further comprise conveniences and necessaries to sustain life such
      as water nutrients, waste facilities and the like. Also, while the
      foregoing description has set forth the preferred embodiment of
      the invention in particular detail, it must be understood that
      numerous modifications, substitutions, and changes may be
      undertaken without departing from the true spirit and scope of the
      present invention as defined by the ensuing claims.<br>

        </big></div>
      &nbsp; <br>
      A system and method for stimulating the immune systems of
      biological entities in an environment. Pulsed electrical currents
      are generated using an electric current generator. The pulsed
      electrical currents are fed through an arrangement of electrically
      conductive material such that magnetic energy is emitted from the
      arrangement into the environment. The arrangement of electrically
      conductive material is designed such that an intensity of the
      emitted magnetic energy varies across at least one spatial
      dimension of the environment. Certain embodiments of the
      arrangement, which have width-to-length ratios of approximately
      0.6, tend to provide variations in the intensity of the magnetic
      energy field which are very good for stimulating the immune
      systems of the biological entities.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to stimulating
      the immune system of biological entities. More particularly,
      certain embodiments of the present invention relate to a system
      and method to stimulate the immune system of biological entities
      moving in an environment through application of pulsed magnetic
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Use of magnetic energy to increase physiological performance of
      organisms has long been attempted. However, many of these
      techniques have been limited to belts, pads or mats which apply
      magnetic or electromagnetic energy to the person or other
      organism. Problems inherent in these techniques include the
      necessity for the organism to wear the belt or pad, and the
      necessity for a portable power source in order to generate
      magnetic energy. Furthermore, these techniques do not effect the
      environment surrounding the organism. Accordingly, there is a
      demand for an apparatus and method of applying pulsed magnetic
      energy to an organism (i.e., a biological entity) and its
      surrounding environment that is without the aforementioned
      disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional,
      traditional, and proposed approaches will become apparent to one
      of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems and
      methods with the present invention as set forth in the remainder
      of the present application with reference to the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An embodiment of the present invention comprises a system for
      stimulating immune systems of living biological entities in an
      environment. The system comprises at least one electric current
      generator providing a source of pulsed electrical current. The
      system further comprises at least one continuous coil of
      electrically conductive material having a first end and a second
      end, both of the ends being connected to the at least one
      generator to form a closed circuit such that the at least one coil
      emits a spatially non-uniform pulsed magnetic field into the
      environment in response to the pulsed electrical current to
      stimulate the immune systems as the biological entities move
      within the environment. Also, a configuration of the at least one
      coil comprises a plurality of turns of the conductive material in
      substantially a single spatial plane, and wherein the coil has an
      overall width-to-length ratio of between 0.4 and 0.8.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a system for
      stimulating immune systems of biological entities in an
      environment. The system comprises at least one electric current
      generator providing a source of pulsed electrical current. The
      system further comprises at least one arrangement of electrically
      conductive material having a first end and a second end, both of
      the ends being connected to the at least one generator to form a
      closed circuit such that the at least one arrangement emits a
      spatially non-uniform pulsed magnetic field into the environment
      in response to the pulsed electrical current to stimulate the
      immune systems as the biological entities move within the
      environment. Also, a configuration of the at least one arrangement
      comprises a plurality of substantially parallel segments of the
      conductive material forming a flat, substantially rectangular grid
      having an overall width-to-length ratio of between 0.4 and 0.8.<br>
      <br>
      A further embodiment of the present invention comprises a method

      method further comprises generating a pulsed electrical current
      with the generator such that the pulsed electrical current
      propagates through the arrangement from a first end of the
      arrangement to a second end of the arrangement. The arrangement
      emits pulsed magnetic energy into the environment in response to
      the pulsed electrical current such that an intensity of the pulsed
      magnetic energy is non-uniform across at least one spatial
      dimension of the arrangement to stimulate the immune systems as
      the biological entities move within the environment.<br>

      electrically conductive material having a first end and a second
      end where both ends are connected to the generator to form a

      pulsed magnetic field into the environment in response to the
      pulsed electrical current to stimulate the immune systems as the
      biological entities move within the environment. A configuration
      of the coil includes a plurality of parallel straight segments of
      the conductive material, being substantially of the same length,
      and a plurality of curved segments of the conductive material. The
      continuous coil spirals outward from a central position of the
      coil in substantially a single spatial plane.<br>
      <br>
      A further embodiment of the present invention includes a system
      for stimulating the immune systems of biological entities in an
      environment. The system comprises at least one electric current
      generator providing a source of pulsed electrical current. The
      system further comprises at least one continuous coil of
      electrically conductive material having a first end and a second
      end where both ends are connected to the generator to form a
      closed circuit such that the coil emits a spatially non-uniform
      pulsed magnetic field into the environment in response to the
      pulsed electrical current to stimulate the immune systems as the
      biological entities move within the environment. A configuration
      of the coil comprises a first plurality of parallel straight
      segments of the conductive material and a second plurality of
      parallel straight segments of the conductive material being
      substantially perpendicular to the first plurality of segments.
      The continuous coil winds outward from a central position of the
      coil in substantially a single spatial plane.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Reference will now be made in detail to the various
      embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are
      illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, the
      same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to
      refer to the same or like parts.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of a system for
      applying pulsed magnetic energy to an aquatic environment, in
      accordance with various aspects of the present invention. Shown
      generally at 10, the embodiment of FIG. 1 includes a water
      reservoir 12, such as an aquarium, a pool, a pond or some other
      body of water. Below water reservoir 12 is placed electric wiring
      16. In FIG. 1 electric wiring 16 is shown as a continuous coil of
      wiring, originating from the electric current generator 14 at a
      first end 17 and connecting back to the electric current generator
      14 at a second end 19 to form a closed circuit. The electrical
      wiring 16 is placed over a substantial area of the water reservoir
      12, at 1 to 30 inches below the bottom surface of the water
      reservoir 12, and is insulated from the surrounding elements and
      cross currents from other cables that may be present. If the water
      reservoir 12 has sides, such as in a pool, electric wiring 16 can
      also be placed behind the surface of the sides of reservoir 12.
      Electric wiring 16 is insulated by neutral materials, such as
      plastics, that will insulate the electric wiring 16, yet not
      produce a significant charge in the surrounding soil or substance.
      The electric wiring may be coated with an insulating material or
      may be placed in a non-conductive conduit, for example. Further,
      highly shielded electrical wire (e.g., using a conductive shield)
      is not desired as it decreases the capacity of diffusion of the
      pulsed magnetic energy into the aquatic environment. A pulsed DC
      voltage waveform is supplied to the electric wiring 16, and is
      controlled by the electric current generator 14. Pulsed current
      supplied by the generator 14 propagates from a first end 17 of the
      coil 16 to a second end 19 of the coil 16 in a closed loop in
      response to the pulsed DC voltage waveform. That is, both ends 17
      and 19 of the coil 16 are connected to output terminals of the
      generator 14. Alternatively, pulsed current supplied by the
      generator 14 may propagate from the second end 19 to the first end
      17.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, an air pump 18 and perforated air hose 20 may be
      included in the system embodied in FIG. 1. Air pump 18 and air
      hose 20 provide an oxygen source to the water within reservoir 12,
      thus, aerating the water and increasing the oxygen concentration
      of the water.<br>
      <br>
      In use, pulsed electrical current is applied to the electric
      wiring 16 by an electric current generator 14. Various electronic
      components may be utilized to generate electric current for use in
      this system and may include a computer controlled subsystem, for
      example, to control the intensity and pulsed frequency of the
      emitted magnetic energy. An electric current generator typically
      includes a power transformer, a rectifier and filter circuit, and
      an electronic switching circuit. For example, an electric current
      generator may be plugged into a 240 VAC single phase power source
      and output a pulsed DC voltage waveform having a maximum peak
      amplitude of, for example, 80 VDC.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the
      magnetic energy emitted from the wiring 16 has magnetic field
      components in the range of about 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the
      frequency range of the pulses is between 0.5 and 30 Hertz.
      Concurrently, air pump 18 pumps air through hose 20 to increase
      the oxygen concentration of the water. The water in free motion
      around the air bubbles is energized to a higher state because of
      the application of the pulsed magnetic energy, and thus may become
      even more saturated with oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Application of the magnetic energy to the reservoir 12 provides
      for application of magnetic energy to both plants and animals
      (i.e., biological entities) situated within the aquatic system.
      The affected plants and animals exhibit enhanced physiologic
      effects such as increased growth and overall health, for example,
      due to stimulation of the immune systems of the plants and
      animals. Furthermore, the highly oxygenated and energized water
      can then be utilized for watering plants which may not be directly
      exposed to the magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Electric current flows in a wire when a potential difference
      (i.e., a voltage) is applied across both ends of the wire. When
      electric current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is set up
      or emanates from the wire. If the wire is arranged in a coiled or
      grid-like configuration, for example, the magnetic fields from the
      various turns of the coil may combine constructively and
      destructively to form a spatially non-uniform magnetic field
      profile.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a flat coil 200 used
      to generate magnetic energy, in accordance with various aspects of
      the present invention. The coil is a continuous coil of
      electrically conductive material (e.g., copper wire) having a
      first end 201 and a second end 202. Both ends 201 and 202 are
      connected to at least one generator (e.g. generator 14 in FIG. 1)
      to form a closed circuit. The generator creates a pulsed voltage
      waveform (e.g., a DC pulsed waveform) that results in pulsed
      electrical currents that propagate through the coil 200 from the
      first end 201 to the second end 202 (or vice versa).<br>
      When the current pulses propagate through the coil 200, magnetic
      energy is emitted from the coil in the form of a pulsed magnetic
      field. When the coil is placed in an environment such as, for
      example, a swimming pool, a livestock yard, a garden, orchards, an
      athletic ground, a play ground, a pond, a lake, a whirl pool, a
      hot tub, or an aquarium, the magnetic energy is dispersed into the
      environment. The magnetic energy tends to stimulate the immune
      systems of biological entities (e.g., plants, animals, and humans)
      that are moving within the environment.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a
      configuration of the coil 200 comprises a plurality of spiraling
      turns of a conductive material such as, for example, copper wire.
      The spiraling turns do not necessarily follow a strictly
      mathematical spiral, but rather, the turns spiral at least in the
      sense that the turns wrap around on each other from the inside
      (i.e., from a central position 203 of the coil 200) to the outside
      of the coil 200. The configuration forms a flat, substantially
      oval surface having a width-to-length ratio of between 0.4 and
      0.8. Ideally, the width-to-length ratio is 0.618 which is the
      "golden mean" ratio found in many instances of nature. For
      example, the width-to-length ratio of the coil 200 shown in FIG. 2
      is 84.1232 inches divided by 156 inches which is a ratio of 0.539.
      The coil 200 of FIG. 2 has approximately 37 turns spaced at
      approximately 1 inch separation. In accordance with an embodiment
      of the present invention, the coil 200 comprises 8 Gage solid
      copper wire having a resistance of about 0.6 ohms per 1000 feet.<br>
      <br>
      The configuration of the coil 200 includes a plurality of parallel
      straight segments 210 of insulated copper wire being of
      substantially the same length, and a plurality of curved segment
      of insulated copper wire 220. The segments 210 and 220 are not
      discrete in the sense that they must be connected to form the coil
      200. Instead, the coil 200 is a continuous piece of copper wire.
      However, in an alternative embodiment the coil 200 could be made
      from discrete segments that are connected together by, for
      example, welding or soldering. The configuration of the coil 200
      is such that the plurality of turns of the coil are substantially
      in a single spatial plane, which gives the coil 200 its flat
      shape.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 2, the coil emits a
      magnetic field at least perpendicular to the surface of the coil
      (i.e., out of the page of FIG. 2). The intensity of the magnetic
      field varies (i.e., is non-uniform) across the coil 200, in a
      spatial dimension which is parallel to the surface of the coil
      200. The variation may be non-linear, in accordance with certain
      embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, as a biological
      entity moves within the environment in which the coil 200 is
      placed, the biological entity experiences the variations of the
      magnetic field. The variations stimulate the immune system of the
      biological entity. Typically, the coil 200 is insulated using a
      non-conducting material such as a plastic, to prevent direct
      conduction of the electrical currents into the surrounding
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3A-3C illustrate various views of an embodiment of the flat
      coil 200 of FIG. 2, clearly showing the spacing between the coil
      turns, in accordance with various aspects of the present
      invention. The coil 200 shown in FIG. 3A is mounted on a surface
      310 (e.g., a plywood board) using plastic clips to secure the
      wiring of the coil 200. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3B shows a curved section of the coil 200 with the spacing
      320 between the curved segments being about one inch. FIG. 3C
      shows a straight section of the coil 200 with the spacing 330
      between the straight and parallel segments being about one inch.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary simulated graph 400 of how a
      magnetic field intensity Bm 401 generated by the coil 200 of FIG.
      2 may be expected to vary non-linearly across a spatial dimension
      402 of the coil of FIG. 2 (distance across coil), in accordance
      with various aspects of the present invention. The peak magnetic
      intensity 403 occurs at the center of the coil 200. It is the
      configuration of the coil (e.g., shape, dimensions, spacing) that
      largely determines the shape of the spatially non-uniform magnetic
      field intensity. For example, the graph 400 of FIG. 4 may
      represent the variation in magnetic field intensity Bm across the
      width dimension 240 of the coil 200 and through a first center
      axis 250 of the coil 200 (see FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary graph 500 of measured data of how
      a magnetic field intensity 501 generated by the coil 200 of FIGS.
      3A-3C varies across three spatial dimensions of the coil 200 of
      FIGS. 3A-3C, in accordance with various aspects of the present
      invention. The data set 510 shows the variation in measured
      magnetic field intensity above (e.g., 18 inches) the coil 200 and
      across the length dimension 260 of the coil 200 along the axis 265
      which includes the physical center point 205 of the coil 200 (see
      FIG. 2). The coil center 540 is shown on the distance axis 550 in
      FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      The data set 520 shows the variation in measured magnetic field
      intensity above (e.g., 18 inches) above the coil 200 and across
      the width dimension 240 of the coil 200 along the axis 250 which
      includes the physical center point 205 of the coil 200. The data
      set 530 shows the variation in measured magnetic field intensity
      above (e.g., 18 inches) the coil 200 and across a diagonal
      dimension of the coil 200 along the axis 270 which includes the
      physical center 205 of the coil 200.<br>
      The direction of the magnetic field intensities 510, 520, and 530
      shown in the graph 500 is perpendicular to the flat surface of the
      coil 200. The absolute magnitude of the magnetic field intensities
      is a function of distance away from the surface or plane of the
      coil. In general, the magnetic field intensity decreases at points
      further away from the surface or plane of the coil. Notice that
      the magnetic field intensity 560 at the physical center of the
      coil is the same for all three data sets 510, 520, and 530 since
      the center corresponds to the same physical point in all three
      cases.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if the coil 200 is placed flat and just beneath the
      bottom surface of a swimming pool (e.g., 1 to 30 inches), the
      magnetic field intensity 501 of the data sets 510, 520, and 530
      will emanate above the coil into the water of the pool. As a
      swimmer swims through the pool across the coil (e.g., parallel to
      the surface of the coil), the swimmer will experience the magnetic
      variations of the magnetic field generated by the coil which
      stimulate the swimmer's immune system. In accordance with an
      embodiment of the present invention, the magnetic field is a
      pulsed magnetic field having a pulsed frequency of between 0.5 and
      30 Hertz, and the intensity of the magnetic fields 510, 520, and
      530 at a predetermined distance from the surface of the coil
      (e.g., 18 inches) vary through a range of about 0.5 to 30 Gauss
      across at least one spatial dimension of the coil 200. The
      electric current generator may comprise a programmable subsystem
      (e.g., a programmable logic controller or a computer-based
      subsystem such as a personal computer) which may control the
      frequency and intensity of the current pulses and, therefore, of
      the magnetic energy pulses.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an embodiment of a method 600 to
      stimulate immune systems of biological entities in an environment,
      in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. In
      step 610, at least one arrangement of electrically conductive
      material is positioned below a surface of an environment (for
      example, referring to FIG. 1, the coil 16 is positioned below the
      surface of the aquatic environment 12). In step 620, the at least
      one arrangement of electrically conductive material is connected
      to at least one electric current generator to form a closed
      circuit through the arrangement (for example, referring to FIG. 1,
      the ends 17 and 19 of the coil 16 are connected to electric
      terminals of the generator 14). In step 630, a pulsed electrical
      current is generated with the generator such that the pulsed
      electrical current propagates through the arrangement from a first
      end (e.g., end 19 in FIG. 1) of the arrangement to a second end
      (e.g., end 17 in FIG. 1) of the arrangement, and wherein the
      arrangement emits pulsed magnetic energy into the environment in
      response to the pulsed electrical current such that an intensity
      of the pulsed magnetic energy is non-uniform across at least one
      spatial dimension of the arrangement (e.g., see the non-uniform
      magnetic fields of FIGS. 4 and 5) to stimulate the immune systems
      as the biological entities move within the environment.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of a flat coil
      700 used to generate magnetic energy, in accordance with various
      aspects of the present invention. The coil 700 has a first end 701
      and a second end 702 and comprises a first plurality of vertically
      oriented, parallel straight segments 710 of conductive wire and a
      second plurality 720 of horizontally oriented, parallel straight
      segments 720 of conductive wire which are substantially
      perpendicular to the first plurality of segments. The coil 700 is
      a continuous wire, winding outward from a central position 730 of
      the coil 700 in substantially a single spatial plane forming a
      flat, rectangular coil (i.e., a coil forming a flat, rectangular
      surface). The coil 700 of FIG. 7 is similar to the coil 200 of
      FIG. 2 except the curved segments of FIG. 2 are replaced with the
      straight segments 720 of FIG. 7 and the straight segments 710 are
      not all of the same length.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, there is shown a second exemplary
      embodiment a system of the present invention, illustrating the
      application of pulsed magnetic energy to livestock animal pens. In
      this second embodiment, there is a stock pen 830 which can be used
      to retain any type of livestock animal or poultry. Further, it
      should be understood that such a stock pen can be enclosed in
      buildings or open fields. Electrical wiring 820 extends below the
      surface and laterally across first stock pen 830 to cover at least
      a substantial area of stock pen 830. The configuration of the
      electrical wiring 820 includes a plurality of substantially
      parallel segments of conductive material (e.g., segments of
      wiring) forming a flat, substantially rectangular grid. As in the
      first embodiment 10 of FIG. 1, electrical wiring 820 is comprised
      of electrical wiring having neutral insulating materials, and is
      placed under the surface of the selected area at a preferred depth
      of 1 to 30 inches. Electric current generator 810 generates and
      transmits pulsed electric currents through electric wiring 820. In
      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the
      width-to-length ratio of the substantially rectangular grid is
      between 0.4 and 0.8.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, this system may also include a water tank 840 for the
      watering of the animals. An air pump 850 may be used to pump air
      into the water tank 840 through hose 860. Aeration of water tank
      840 by pump 850 increases the oxygen concentration of the water
      held within water tank 840.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 8, the electrical wiring 820 forms a
      type of horizontal grid configuration across the stock pen 830.
      Pulsed current flows from the generator 810 through the various
      branches of the grid of wiring 820 and back to the generator 810,
      emitting pulsed magnetic energy (i.e., magnetic fields) into the
      environment of the stock pen 830. If the stockyard is enclosed,
      the electric wiring is buried at a depth between 1 and 30 inches
      within the dirt or other flooring material, such as concrete, for
      example. Again, a spatially non-uniform magnetic field is
      generated across the grid. However, the non-uniformity may be
      substantially different from that shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 due
      largely to the different configuration of the wiring 820 from that
      of the coil 200 of FIG. 2. However, a coil of the configuration of
      that of FIG. 1 or FIG. 2, or other configurations, could be used
      in the stockyard environment instead.<br>
      <br>
      Now referring to FIG. 9, there is shown a third exemplary
      embodiment of a system of the present invention illustrating the
      application of pulsed magnetic energy to a plant bio-system 900,
      such as a garden. The plant based bio-system may include, for
      example, a grain plot 910, fruit or other trees 920, plants 930
      and/or flowers 940. The plants may either be grown within the
      ground itself or within planting containers such as pots and the
      like. The environment 900 may optionally also include a water
      reservoir 950, which is aerated by hose 960 and air pump 970 to
      increase the oxygen concentration of the water held within
      reservoir 950. Pulsed magnetic energy is generated by an electric
      current generator 980 applying pulsed currents to electric wiring
      grid 990. Electric wiring grid 990 is positioned to cover at least
      a substantial portion of environment 900, and is placed below the
      surface of environment 900, at a depth of 1 to 30 inches. The
      plants affected by the application of the pulsed magnetic energy
      exhibit improved physiological effects such as improved and more
      rapid growth, and better overall health for example.<br>
      <br>
      Shown in FIG. 10 is yet another exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention, illustrating applying magnetic energy to an
      athletic playing surface 1000, such as, for example a basketball
      court, a football field, a soccer field, a swimming pool,
      playgrounds or other playing surfaces. Electrical wiring 1010 is
      placed below playing surface 1000 at a preferred depth of between
      1 and 30 inches. Electrical current generator 1020 generates and
      conducts electrical currents through electric wiring 1010 to
      create and diffuse the resultant magnetic energy throughout
      playing surface 1000. The magnetic energy is applied to those
      persons playing or competing on playing surface 1000. Upon
      application of the magnetic energy, humans may experience higher
      energy levels for longer periods of time, reduced fatigue, less
      muscle strain and soreness, in addition to increased concentration
      and precision in playing the particular sport.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 11, there is shown yet another exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention, illustrating application of
      magnetic energy to a golf course hole. This embodiment includes a
      tee box 1110, a green 1120 and/or optionally a water reservoir
      1130. Below tee box 1110 is placed electrical wiring 1140, which
      is placed at a depth of 1 to 30 inches. Electrical wiring 1150 is
      also placed below golf green 1120 at a preferred depth of 1 to 30
      inches. If water reservoir 1130 is used, electrical wiring 1160 is
      positioned below the bottom of reservoir 1130 at a depth of 1 to
      30 inches for emission of magnetic energy. Air pump 1195 and air
      hose 1196may optionally be used to pump air into the water
      reservoir 1130 to increase the oxygen content. Treated water from
      reservoir 1130 may be used to water the golf course fairways,
      greens, or other plants associated with the course as to achieve
      the benefits as described above in relation to the plant based
      bio-system embodiment. Electric current generators 1170, 1180 and
      1190 produce pulsed electric currents such that magnetic energy is
      emitted from electrical wiring 1140, 1160, and 1150 respectively.
      Optionally, a single generator can control the emission of
      magnetic energy from electrical wiring 1140, 1160, and 1150. As
      with the above described embodiments, electric current generators
      1170, 1180 and 1190 cause magnetic energy to be emitted having
      magnetic field components about in the range of 0.5 to 30 Gauss,
      and the frequency range of the pulses is between 0.5 and 30 Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      Effects seen through application of the pulsed magnetic energy to
      a grass surfaces such as soccer fields, play grounds, football
      fields, golf greens and tee boxes include more rapid and healthier
      growth of grass, faster regeneration or repair of divots and ball
      marks, fewer attacks to these grasses by pests as the grasses are
      healthier. The human players experience gentle invigoration,
      increased energy, greater concentration, and less muscle soreness
      or strain. Increased mental activity and faster healing of wounds
      has also been noted. Sporting equipment such as golf clubs are not
      affected by the application of magnetic energy because no
      sustained electrical current is conducted to the metal portions of
      the clubs.<br>
      <br>
      In use with any of the above embodiments, the characteristics of
      the magnetic energy remain the same, that is the magnetic energy
      having magnetic field components about in the range of 0.5 to 30
      Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses between 0.5 and 30
      Hertz. In application of pulsed magnetic energy to humans, the
      magnetic field strength may be adjusted to vary between 4 to 8
      Gauss. The placement of the electrical wiring below the surface of
      the selected area is adjusted to accommodate these parameters.
      Further, it is important to note that the spacing and arrangement
      of the electric wiring in the above described embodiments may be
      altered to achieve certain desired effects.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 illustrates exemplary resultant current pulses 1210 and
      1220 that may be produced in the coil 200 of FIG. 2 when applying
      an exemplary DC pulsed voltage waveform 1230 to the coil 200 of
      FIG. 2, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
      The pulsed voltage waveform 1230 shown in FIG. 12 is a square
      voltage waveform having a 50% duty cycle. Other duty cycles are
      possible as well, in accordance with various embodiments of the
      present invention. The pulsed voltage waveform 1230 is applied to
      the coil 200 by a generator (e.g., generator 14 of FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the pulsed voltage waveform 1230 may be, for
      example, anywhere between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz. Depending on the
      various parameters (e.g., the voltage level, the time constant,
      the pulsed frequency, etc.) of the system, the resultant pulsed
      current waveform in the coil may look like that of waveform 1210.
      Referring to the pulsed current waveform 1210, as the voltage
      level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1230 increases, the current
      level in the coil will begin to increase as seen in the segment
      1211 of the pulsed current waveform 1210. The curved nature of the
      rising current level of the segment 1211 is due, at least in part,
      to the time constant of the system (including the coil) which is
      determined by inductive, capacitive, and resistive factors of the
      system. In the pulsed current waveform 1210, the current level
      rises continuously until the voltage level of the driving pulsed
      voltage waveform drops off.<br>
      <br>
      When the voltage level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1230
      decreases, the current level in the coil will begin to decrease as
      seen in the segment 1212 of the pulsed current waveform 1210.
      Again, the curved nature of the falling current level of the
      segment 1212 is due, at least in part, to the time constant of the
      system. In the pulsed current waveform 1210, the current level
      decreases continuously until the voltage level of the driving
      pulsed voltage waveform again rises. For example, the peak voltage
      level of the DC pulsed voltage waveform 1230 may be 80 VDC and the
      resultant peak current level of the pulsed current waveform 1210
      may be 100 amps.<br>
      Referring to the pulsed current waveform 1220, as the voltage
      level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1230 increases, the current
      level in the coil will begin to increase as seen in the segment
      1221 of the pulsed current waveform 1220. Again, the curved nature
      of the rising current level of the segment 1221 is due, at least
      in part, to the time constant of the system. In the pulsed current
      waveform 1220, the current level rises and then flattens off to a
      peak current level 1222 well before the voltage level of the
      pulsed voltage waveform drops off. This flattening off tends to
      occur when the peak voltage level 1231 is relatively low. The
      lower peak voltage level 1231 means that the current will not
      build to as high a level as it would with a higher peak voltage
      level driving the coil. Therefore, the pulsed current waveform
      1220 reaches its peak level sooner and stays there.<br>
      <br>
      When the voltage level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1230
      decreases, the current level in the coil will begin to decrease as
      seen in the segment 1223 of the pulsed current waveform 1220.
      Again, the curved nature of the falling current level of the
      segment 1223 is due, at least in part, to the time constant of the
      system. In the pulsed current waveform 1220, the current level
      decreases to a zero current level 1224 well before the voltage
      level of the pulsed voltage waveform increases again. Again, this
      flattening off tends to occur when the peak voltage level 1231 is
      relatively low. That is, the current level does not have as far to
      fall since the peak current level was relatively low. Therefore,
      the current level reaches zero sooner and flattens off. For
      example, the peak voltage level of the DC pulsed voltage waveform
      1230 may be 20 VDC and the resultant peak current level of the
      pulsed current waveform 1210 may be 10 amps.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 13 illustrates exemplary resultant current pulses 1310
      produced in the coil 200 of FIGS. 3A-3C when applying an exemplary
      DC pulsed voltage waveform 1320 to the coil 200 of FIGS. 3A-3C, in
      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The pulsed
      voltage waveform 1320 shown in FIG. 13 is a pseudo-square voltage
      waveform having a 50% duty cycle. Other duty cycles are possible
      as well, in accordance with various embodiments of the present
      invention. The pulsed voltage waveform 1320 tends to droop over
      the segment 1330 due to the load the coil provides to the
      generator. Therefore, the pulsed voltage waveform 1320 is not
      perfectly square.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the pulsed voltage waveform 1320 may be, for
      example, anywhere between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz. Depending on the
      various parameters (e.g., the voltage level, the time constant,
      the pulsed frequency, etc.) of the system, the resultant pulsed
      current waveform in the coil may look like that of waveform 1310.
      Referring to the pulsed current waveform 1310, as the voltage
      level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1320 increases, the current
      level in the coil will begin to increase as seen in the segment
      1311 of the pulsed current waveform 1310. The curved nature of the
      rising current level of the segment 1311 is due, at least in part,
      to the time constant of the system (including the coil) which is
      determined by inductive, capacitive, and resistive factors of the
      system. In the pulsed current waveform 1310, the current level
      rises continuously until the voltage level of the driving pulsed
      voltage waveform begins to droop. There is a time delay, however,
      between when the voltage level begins to droop and when the
      current level begins to decrease slightly over the segment 1312.<br>
      <br>
      When the voltage level of the pulsed voltage waveform 1320 drops
      off, the current level in the coil will begin to decrease as seen
      in the segment 1313 of the pulsed current waveform 1310. Again,
      the curved nature of the falling current level of the segment 1313
      is due, at least in part, to the time constant of the system. In
      the pulsed current waveform 1310, the current level decreases
      continuously until the voltage level of the driving pulsed voltage
      waveform again rises.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention,
      the systems described herein may be used by incrementing and/or
      decrementing the pulsed frequency over time. For example, in
      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the pulsed
      frequency may start at 0.5 Hz and be incremented every one minute
      by 0.5 Hz until reaching 28 Hz. Then the pulsed frequency may be
      decremented from 28 Hz back down to 0.5 Hz at a frequency step of
      0.5 Hz every minute. Other methods of varying the pulsed frequency
      over time are possible as well and may be tailored to certain
      physiological conditions to be treated by stimulating the immune
      system.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, a method and systems are disclosed for stimulating the
      immune systems of biological entities in an environment. A
      magnetic energy field is generated such that the magnetic energy
      field varies non-uniformly in intensity across at least one
      spatial dimension of the environment. The magnetic energy field is
      generated using an electric current generator which is connected
      to a coil or other alternate arrangement of conductive material
      such as wire. The coil or arrangement is typically placed beneath
      a surface of the environment. The magnetic energy field is pulsed
      at a predetermined frequency.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been described with reference to certain
      embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art
      that various changes may be made and equivalents may be
      substituted without departing from the scope of the invention. In
      addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular
      situation or material to the teachings of the invention without
      departing from its scope. Therefore, it is intended that the
      invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed,
      but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within
      the scope of the appended claims.<br>

      A system (14,16,18,20) and method of enhancing growth and

      pulsed electromagnetic energy. An Electromagnetic generator (14)
      connected to electrical wiring (16) wich is placed below the
      surface of a selected area such as, a garden, stock pen or
      athletic playing field (24) for emission of electromagnetic energy
      to plants and animals, including humans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is generally a means to enhance growth and
      performance of biological systems. More specifically, the present
      invention is a system and method to enhance physiological
      performance of organisms through application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Use of electromagnetic energy to increase physiological
      performance of organisms has long been attempted. However, many of
      these techniques have been limited to belts, pads or mats which
      apply magnetic or electromagnetic energy to the person or other
      organism. Problems inherent in these techniques include the
      necessity for the organism to wear the belt or pad, and the
      necessity for a portable power source in order to generate
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, these techniques do not effect the environment
      surrounding the organism, nor do they bring the environment and
      organism into gentle resonance. Accordingly, there is a demand for
      an apparatus and method of applying pulsed electromagnetic energy
      to an organism and its surrounding environment that is without the
      aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is an apparatus and method of applying
      pulsed electromagnetic energy to organisms such as humans or other
      animals, and to the organism's surrounding environment such as
      grass and other organisms within this environment. Specifically,
      electrical wiring which emits pulsed electromagnetic energy, is
      placed under the surface of the area in which the humans or other
      organisms are situated. This includes putting wiring in proximity
      to or under the surface of a variety of environments, such as
      livestock pens, poultry pens, ponds, garden plots, athletic
      courts, and golf courses. The system and method of the present
      invention is used in association with various different organisms
      or living systems such as humans and other animals, as well as
      plants, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic energy is then pulsed through the electric wiring
      and diffused throughout the area surrounding the wiring, including
      the atmosphere above the surface of the selected area.<br>
      <br>
      As the electromagnetic energy diffuses, it is applied to both the
      plants and animals within the selected area. The application of
      the pulsed electromagnetic energy brings these organisms into
      gentle resonance and enhances biological function and genetic
      expression of these organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, better health, increased appetite and higher
      consumption of water, are among the positive effects that have
      been experienced by participating humans.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred
      embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are
      illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever possible, the same reference numbers will be used
      throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
      <br>
      Shown in Fig. 1 is a first preferred embodiment of the present
      invention. It illustrates the application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy to any aquatic setting. Shown generally at
      10, this embodiment includes a water reservoir 12, such as an
      aquarium, pool, pond or other body of water. Below water reservoir
      12 is placed electric wiring 16. Although in Fig. 1 electric
      wiring 16 is shown in a continuous open ended coil of wiring,
      electric wiring 16 can be positioned in a discontinuous fashion
      having a main line and a plurality of other lines extending from
      the main line. The electrical wiring 16 is placed over a
      substantial area of water reservoir 12, from 1 to 30 inches below
      the bottom surface of the water reservoir 12 and is insulated from
      the surrounding elements and cross currents from other cables. If
      water reservoir 12 has sides, such as in a pool, electric wiring
      16 can also be placed behind the surface of the sides of reservoir
      12. Electric wiring 16 is insulated by neutral materials, such as
      plastics, that will insulate electric wiring 16, yet not produce a
      charge in the surrounding soil or substance. Further, highly
      shielded electrical wire is not desired as it decreases the
      capacity of diffusion of the pulsed electromagnetic energy. The
      pulsed electromagnetic energy is supplied to electric wiring 16,
      and is controlled by an electromagnetic energy generator 14.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, an air pump 18 and perforated air hose 20 may be
      included in the system embodied in Figure 1. Air pump 18 and air
      hose 20 provide an oxygen source to the water with in reservoir
      12, thus, aerating the water and increasing the oxygen
      concentration of the water.<br>
      <br>
      In use, pulsed electromagnetic energy is applied to the electric
      wiring 16 by an electromagnetic energy generator 14. Various
      electronic components maybe utilized to generate electromagnetic
      energy for use in this system, such as a computer system or a
      electromagnetic wave generator for example. Preferably, the
      electromagnetic energy has a magnetic field component in the range
      of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses between
      0.5 and 30 Hertz. Concurrently, air pump 18 pumps air through hose
      20 to increase the oxygen concentration of the water. The water in
      free motion around the air bubbles is energized to a higher state
      because of the application of the pulsed electromagnetic energy,
      and thus becomes even more saturated with oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Application of the electromagnetic energy to reservoir 12 provides
      for application of electromagnetic energy to both plants and
      animals situated within the aquatic system. The affected plants
      and animals exhibit enhanced physiologic effects such as increased
      growth and overall health for example. Furthermore, the highly
      oxygenated and energized water can then be utilized for watering
      plants which are not directly exposed to electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally the system and method of the present invention
      contemplates the sustained or intermittent introduction of
      acoustic energy into the aquatic setting or the environment of
      other embodiments of the present invention. Many forms of soothing
      sounds may provide enhanced benefit but most preferred is the use
      of symphonic music or sounds, preferably with minimal or no
      dischord. The introduction of such can be accomplished through a
      sound system 100 as is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. Sound
      system 100 comprises a power supply 102, which may be independent
      or shared with other systems utilized in the environment, that is
      operably connected to a sound control panel 104 from which one may
      control the selection and characteristics of the sounds broadcast
      by sound system 100 into the surrounding environment of the
      present invention. Control panel 104 is connected to one or more
      speakers 106 for broadcasting the generated sound. In aquatic
      settings underwater speakers are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      Although not required, one or more microphones 108 for receiving
      sound from the aquatic setting or other environment is
      contemplated. Such sounds may be recorded as is known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally the sustained or intermittent introduction of orgone
      or radionic energy into the aquatic setting of the environment or
      other embodiments of the present invention, especially but not
      necessarily in pulsed form, is contemplated. Such radionic energy
      is supplied through one or more radionic generators or collectors
      as are lcnown and available in the art. Exposure time and
      intensity may be varied.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown a second embodiment of the
      present invention, illustrating the application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy to livestock animal pens. In this
      embodiment, there is a stock pen 24 which can be used to retain
      any type of livestock animal or poultry. Further, it should be
      understood that such a stock pen can be enclosed in buildings or
      open fields. Electrical wiring 26 extends below the surface and
      laterally across first stock pen 24 to cover at least a
      substantial area of stock pen 24. As in the first embodiment,
      electrical wiring 26 is comprised of electrical wiring having
      neutral insulating materials, and is placed under the surface of
      the selected area at a preferred depth of 1 to 30 inches.
      Electromagnetic energy generator 28 generates and transmits
      electromagnetic energy to electric wiring 26. Optionally, this
      system may also include a water tank 34 for watering of the
      animals. An air pump 30 may be utilized to pump air into the water
      tank 34 through hose 32. Aeration of water tank 34 by pump 30
      increases the oxygen concentration of the water held within water
      tank 34.<br>
      <br>
      If the stoclcyard is enclosed, the electric wiring is buried at a
      depth between 1 and 30 inches within the dirt or other flooring
      material, such as concrete, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Now referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a third embodiment of the
      present invention illustrating the application of electromagnetic
      energy to a plant bio-system 46, such as a garden.<br>
      <br>
      The plant based bio-system may include, for example, a grain plot
      48, fruit or other trees 56, plants 58 and/or flowers 60. The
      plants may either be grown within the ground itself or within
      planting containers such as pots and the like. The system 46 may
      optionally also include a water reservoir 50, which is aerated by
      hose 52 and air pump 54 to increase the oxygen concentration of
      the water held within reservoir 50. Electromagnetic energy is
      generated by an electromagnetic energy generator 64 and applied to
      system 46 via electric wiring 62. Electric wiring 62 is position
      to cover at least a substantial portion of system 46, and is
      placed below the surface of system 46, at a depth of 1 to 30
      inches. The plants affected by the application of the
      electromagnetic energy exhibit improved physiological effects such
      as improved and more rapid growth, and better overall health for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      Shown in Fig. 4 is yet another embodiment of the present
      invention, illustrating applying electromagnetic energy to an
      athletic playing surface 68, such as, for example a basketball
      court, a football field, a soccer field, a swimming pool,
      playgrounds or other playing surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical wiring 70 is placed below playing surface 68 at a
      preferred depth of between 1 and 30 inches. Electromagnetic energy
      generator 72 generates and conducts electromagnetic energy through
      electric wiring 70 to diffuse the electromagnetic energy
      throughout playing surface 68.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic energy is applied to those persons playing or
      competing on playing surface 68. Upon application of the
      electromagnetic energy, humans experience higher energy levels for
      longer periods of time, reduced fatigue, less muscle strain and
      soreness, in addition to increased concentration and precision in
      playing the particular sport.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Fig. 5, there is shown yet another embodiment of
      the present invention, illustrating application of electromagnetic
      energy to a golf course hole. This embodiment includes a tee box
      76, a green 92 and/or optionally a water reservoir 82. Below tee
      box 76 is placed electrical wiring 78, which is placed at a depth
      of 1 to 30 inches. Electrical wiring 94 is also placed below golf
      green 92 at a preferred depth of 1 to 30 inches. If water
      reservoir 82 is utilized, electrical wiring 88 is positioned below
      the bottom of reservoir 82 at a depth of 1 to 30 inches for
      emission of electromagnetic energy. Treated water from reservoir
      82 may be used to water the golf course fairways, greens, or other
      plants associated with the course as to achieve the benefits as
      described above in relation to the plant based bio-system
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic energy generators 80,90 and 96 produce and emit
      electromagnetic energy through electrical wiring 78,88 and 94
      respectively. Optionally, a single electromagnetic generator can
      control the emission of electromagnetic energy through electrical
      wiring 78,88 and<br>
      94. As with the above described embodiments, electromagnetic
      energy generators 80,90 and 96 emit electromagnetic energy having
      a magnetic field component in the range of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and
      the frequency range of the pulses between 0.5 and 30 Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      Effects seen through application of the electromagnetic energy to
      a grass surfaces such as soccer fields, play grounds, football
      fields, golf greens and tee boxes include more rapid and healthier
      growth of grass, faster regeneration or repair of divots and ball
      marks, fewer attacks to these grasses by pests as the grasses are
      healthier. The human players experience gentle invigoration,
      increased energy, greater concentration, and less muscle soreness
      or strain.<br>
      <br>
      Increased mental activity and faster healing of wounds has also
      been noted.<br>
      <br>
      Sporting equipment such as golf clubs are not affected by the
      application of electromagnetic energybecause no sustained
      electrical current is conducted to the metal portions of the
      clubs.<br>
      <br>
      In use with any of the above embodiments, the characteristics of
      the electromagnetic energy remain the same, that is
      electromagnetic energy having a magnetic field component in the
      range of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses
      between 0.5 and 30 Hertz. The cycling/hertz of the electromagnetic
      energy is varied slowly during a 24 hour period. In application of
      pulsed electromagnetic energy to humans, the magnetic field
      strength is adjusted to be within 4 to 8 Gauss. The placement of
      the electrical wiring below the surface of the selected area is
      adjusted to accommodate these parameters. Further, it is important
      to note that the spacing of the electric wiring in the above
      described embodiments may be altered to achieve desired effects.<br>
      <br>
      Although the principles, preferred embodiments and preferred
      operation of the present invention have been described in detail
      herein, this is not to be construed as being limited to the
      particular illustrative forms disclosed. They will thus become
      apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications of

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is generally a means to enhance growth and
      performance of biological systems. More specifically, the present
      invention is a system and method to enhance physiological
      performance of organisms through application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Use of electromagnetic energy to increase physiological
      performance of organisms has long been attempted. However, many of
      these techniques have been limited to belts, pads or mats which
      apply magnetic or electromagnetic energy to the person or other
      organism. Problems inherent in these techniques include the
      necessity for the organism to wear the belt or pad, and the
      necessity for a portable power source in order to generate
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, these techniques do not effect the environment
      surrounding the organism, nor do they bring the environment and
      organism into gentle resonance. Accordingly, there is a demand for
      an apparatus and method of applying pulsed electromagnetic energy
      to an organism and its surrounding environment that is without the
      aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is an apparatus and method of applying
      pulsed electromagnetic energy to organisms such as humans or other
      animals, and to the organism's surrounding environment such as
      grass and other organisms within this environment. Specifically,
      electrical wiring which emits pulsed electromagnetic energy, is
      placed under the surface of the area in which the humans or other
      organisms are situated. This includes putting wiring in proximity
      to or under the surface of a variety of environments, such as
      livestock pens, poultry pens, ponds, garden plots, athletic
      courts, and golf courses. The system and method of the present
      invention is<br>
      used in association with various different organisms or living
      systems such as humans and other animals, as well as plants, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic energy is then pulsed through the electric wiring
      and diffused throughout the area surrounding the wiring, including
      the atmosphere above the surface of the selected area.<br>
      <br>
      As the electromagnetic energy diffuses, it is applied to both the
      plants and animals within the selected area. The application of
      the pulsed electromagnetic energy brings these organisms into
      gentle resonance and enhances biological function and genetic
      expression of these organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, better health, increased appetite and higher
      consumption of water, are among the positive effects that have
      been experienced by participating humans.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred
      embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are
      illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever possible, the same reference numbers will be used
      throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
      <br>
      Shown in Fig. 1 is a first preferred embodiment of the present
      invention. It illustrates the application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy to any aquatic setting. Shown generally at
      10, this embodiment includes a water reservoir 12, such as an
      aquarium, pool, pond or other body of water. Below water reservoir
      12 is placed electric wiring 16. Although in Fig. 1 electric
      wiring 16 is shown in a continuous open ended coil of wiring,
      electric wiring 16 can be positioned in a discontinuous fashion
      having a main line and a plurality of other lines extending from
      the main line. The electrical wiring 16 is placed over a
      substantial area of water reservoir 12, from 1 to 30 inches below
      the bottom surface of the water reservoir 12 and is insulated from
      the surrounding elements and cross currents from other cables. If
      water reservoir 12 has sides, such as in a pool, electric wiring
      16 can also be placed behind the surface of the sides of reservoir
      12. Electric wiring 16 is insulated by neutral materials, such as
      plastics, that will insulate electric wiring 16, yet not produce a
      charge in the surrounding soil or substance. Further, highly
      shielded electrical wire is not desired as it decreases the
      capacity of diffusion of the pulsed electromagnetic energy. The
      pulsed electromagnetic energy is supplied to electric wiring 16,
      and is controlled by an electromagnetic energy generator 14.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, an air pump 18 and perforated air hose 20 may be
      included in the system embodied in Figure 1. Air pump 18 and air
      hose 20 provide an oxygen source to the water with in reservoir
      12, thus, aerating the water and increasing the oxygen
      concentration of the water.<br>
      <br>
      In use, pulsed electromagnetic energy is applied to the electric
      wiring 16 by an electromagnetic energy generator 14. Various
      electronic components maybe utilized to generate electromagnetic
      energy for use in this system, such as a computer system or a
      electromagnetic wave generator for example. Preferably, the
      electromagnetic energy has a magnetic field component in the range
      of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses between
      0.5 and 30 Hertz. Concurrently, air pump 18 pumps air through hose
      20 to increase the oxygen concentration of the water. The water in
      free motion around the air bubbles is energized to a higher state
      because of the application of the pulsed electromagnetic energy,
      and thus becomes even more saturated with oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Application of the electromagnetic energy to reservoir 12 provides
      for application of electromagnetic energy to both plants and
      animals situated within the aquatic system. The affected plants
      and animals exhibit enhanced physiologic effects such as increased
      growth and overall health for example. Furthermore, the highly
      oxygenated and energized water can then be utilized for watering
      plants which are not directly exposed to electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally the system and method of the present invention
      contemplates the sustained or intermittent introduction of
      acoustic energy into the aquatic setting or the environment of
      other embodiments of the present invention. Many forms of soothing
      sounds may provide enhanced benefit but most preferred is the use
      of symphonic music or sounds, preferably with minimal or no
      dischord. The introduction of such can be accomplished through a
      sound system 100 as is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. Sound
      system 100 comprises a power supply 102, which may be independent
      or shared with other systems utilized in the environment, that is
      operably connected to a sound control panel 104 from which one may
      control the selection and characteristics of the sounds broadcast
      by sound system 100 into the surrounding environment of the
      present invention. Control panel 104 is connected to one or more
      speakers 106 for broadcasting the generated sound. In aquatic
      settings underwater speakers are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      Although not required, one or more microphones 108 for receiving
      sound from the aquatic setting or other environment is
      contemplated. Such sounds may be recorded as is known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally the sustained or intermittent introduction of orgone
      or radionic energy into the aquatic setting of the environment or
      other embodiments of the present invention, especially but not
      necessarily in pulsed form, is contemplated. Such radionic energy
      is supplied through one or more radionic generators or collectors
      as are lcnown and available in the art. Exposure time and
      intensity may be varied.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown a second embodiment of the
      present invention, illustrating the application of pulsed
      electromagnetic energy to livestock animal pens. In this
      embodiment, there is a stock pen 24 which can be used to retain
      any type of livestock animal or poultry. Further, it should be
      understood that such a stock pen can be enclosed in buildings or
      open fields. Electrical wiring 26 extends below the surface and
      laterally across first stock pen 24 to cover at least a
      substantial area of stock pen 24. As in the first embodiment,
      electrical wiring 26 is comprised of electrical wiring having
      neutral insulating materials, and is placed under the surface of
      the selected area at a preferred depth of 1 to 30 inches.
      Electromagnetic energy generator 28 generates and transmits
      electromagnetic energy to electric wiring 26. Optionally, this
      system may also include a water tank 34 for watering of the
      animals. An air pump 30 may be utilized to pump air into the water
      tank 34 through hose 32. Aeration of water tank 34 by pump 30
      increases the oxygen concentration of the water held within water
      tank 34.<br>
      <br>
      If the stockyard is enclosed, the electric wiring is buried at a
      depth between 1 and 30 inches within the dirt or other flooring
      material, such as concrete, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Now referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a third embodiment of the
      present invention illustrating the application of electromagnetic
      energy to a plant bio-system 46, such as a garden.<br>
      <br>
      The plant based bio-system may include, for example, a grain plot
      48, fruit or other trees 56, plants 58 and/or flowers 60. The
      plants may either be grown within the ground itself or within
      planting containers such as pots and the like. The system 46 may
      optionally also include a water reservoir 50, which is aerated by
      hose 52 and air pump 54 to increase the oxygen concentration of
      the water held within reservoir 50. Electromagnetic energy is
      generated by an electromagnetic energy generator 64 and applied to
      system 46 via electric wiring 62. Electric wiring 62 is position
      to cover at least a substantial portion of system 46, and is
      placed below the surface of system 46, at a depth of 1 to 30
      inches. The plants affected by the application of the
      electromagnetic energy exhibit improved physiological effects such
      as improved and more rapid growth, and better overall health for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      Shown in Fig. 4 is yet another embodiment of the present
      invention, illustrating applying electromagnetic energy to an
      athletic playing surface 68, such as, for example a basketball
      court, a football field, a soccer field, a swimming pool,
      playgrounds or other playing surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical wiring 70 is placed below playing surface 68 at a
      preferred depth of between 1 and 30 inches. Electromagnetic energy
      generator 72 generates and conducts electromagnetic energy through
      electric wiring 70 to diffuse the electromagnetic energy
      throughout playing surface 68.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic energy is applied to those persons playing or
      competing on playing surface 68. Upon application of the
      electromagnetic energy, humans experience higher energy levels for
      longer periods of time, reduced fatigue, less muscle strain and
      soreness, in addition to increased concentration and precision in
      playing the particular sport.<br>

      Referring now to Fig. 5, there is shown yet another embodiment of
      the present invention, illustrating application of electromagnetic
      energy to a golf course hole. This embodiment includes a tee box
      76, a green 92 and/or optionally a water reservoir 82. Below tee
      box 76 is placed electrical wiring 78, which is placed at a depth
      of 1 to 30 inches. Electrical wiring 94 is also placed below golf
      green 92 at a preferred depth of 1 to 30 inches. If water
      reservoir 82 is utilized, electrical wiring 88 is positioned below
      the bottom of reservoir 82 at a depth of 1 to 30 inches for
      emission of electromagnetic energy. Treated water from reservoir
      82 may be used to water the golf course fairways, greens, or other
      plants associated with the course as to achieve the benefits as
      described above in relation to the plant based bio-system
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic energy generators 80,90 and 96 produce and emit
      electromagnetic energy through electrical wiring 78,88 and 94
      respectively. Optionally, a single electromagnetic generator can
      control the emission of electromagnetic energy through electrical
      wiring 78,88 and 94. As with the above described embodiments,
      electromagnetic energy generators 80,90 and 96 emit
      electromagnetic energy having a magnetic field component in the
      range of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses
      between 0.5 and 30 Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      Effects seen through application of the electromagnetic energy to
      a grass surfaces such as soccer fields, play grounds, football
      fields, golf greens and tee boxes include more rapid and healthier
      growth of grass, faster regeneration or repair of divots and ball
      marks, fewer attacks to these grasses by pests as the grasses are
      healthier. The human players experience gentle invigoration,
      increased energy, greater concentration, and less muscle soreness
      or strain.<br>
      <br>
      Increased mental activity and faster healing of wounds has also
      been noted.<br>
      <br>
      Sporting equipment such as golf clubs are not affected by the
      application of electromagnetic energy because no sustained
      electrical current is conducted to the metal portions of the
      clubs.<br>
      <br>
      In use with any of the above embodiments, the characteristics of
      the electromagnetic energy remain the same, that is
      electromagnetic energy having a magnetic field component in the
      range of 0.5 to 30 Gauss, and the frequency range of the pulses
      between 0.5 and 30 Hertz. The cycling/hertz of the electromagnetic
      energy is varied slowly during a 24 hour period. In application of
      pulsed electromagnetic energy to humans, the magnetic field
      strength is adjusted to be within 4 to 8 Gauss. The placement of
      the electrical wiring below the surface of the selected area is
      adjusted to accommodate these parameters. Further, it is important
      to note that the spacing of the electric wiring in the above
      described embodiments may be altered to achieve desired effects.<br>
      <br>
      Although the principles, preferred embodiments and preferred
      operation of the present invention have been described in detail
      herein, this is not to be construed as being limited to the
      particular illustrative forms disclosed. They will thus become
      apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications of
      the preferred embodiments herein can be made without departing
      from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the
      appended claims.<br>

      Born &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carl Edward Baugh<br>
      October 21, 1936 (age 77)<br>
      Kenedy, Texas, USA<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Carl Edward Baugh (born October 21, 1936) is an
        American young earth creationist. Along with others, Baugh
        claims to have discovered human footprints alongside dinosaur
        footprints near the Paluxy River in Texas, but never provided
        evidence for his alleged findings.[1][2][3] Baugh is a national
        television host, purporting to present science supporting
        creationism on the program Creation in the 21st Century on the
        Trinity Broadcasting Network. His claims have been debunked by
        the scientific community and other creationists as
        pseudoscience.[4] His educational credentials have also been
        called into question.[5] He was also the president and a
        graduate of Pacific International University, an unaccredited
        university located in Springfield, Missouri.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Biography</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Born in Kenedy, Texas, Baugh graduated in 1955 from Abilene High
      School in Abilene, Texas[citation needed]. He currently appears on
      Trinity Broadcasting Network program Creation in the 21st
      Century.[6] Baugh was also the president and a graduate of the
      Pacific International University, which was a non-accredited
      organisation.[7][8]<br>
      <br>
      In 1984, Baugh started the Creation Evidence Museum in a
      double-wide trailer in Glen Rose, Texas, near Dinosaur Valley
      State Park, to promote creationism.[4] All of the museum exhibits
      have been strongly criticized as incorrectly identified dinosaur
      prints, other fossils, or outright forgeries.[9][10] In 2008, a
      descendant of a family that found many original Paluxy River
      dinosaur tracks in the 1930s claimed that her grandfather had
      faked many of them.[11] Others, such as purported dinosaur claws,
      were identified by University of Texas at Austin paleontologist
      Wann Langston as crocodile teeth.[12]<br>
      <br>
      In 1996, Baugh presented his "man-tracks" in the controversial
      program The Mysterious Origins of Man.[13] Creationist Ken Ham, of
      Answers in Genesis, criticized the claims in a review titled
      "Hollywood's 'Moses' Undermines Genesis," regarding Baugh:
      "According to leading creationist researchers, this evidence is
      open to much debate and needs much more intensive research. One
      wonders how much of the information in the program can really be
      trusted!"[14] He also has been given television exposure by the
      tele-evangelist Kenneth Copeland. He has authored several
      self-published books[4] on such topics as the age of the universe,
      dinosaurs coexisting with humans and critiques of evolution.[15]<br>
      <br>
      In 2001 Baugh and Creation Evidence Museum were featured on The
      Daily Show where Baugh likened human history to The Flintstones
      and the show poked fun at his claims about the hyperbaric
      biosphere, pterodactyl expeditions, and dinosaurs.[16]<br>
      <br>
      He is a promoter of intelligent design. In 2002 he appeared with
      William A. Dembski at a conference in Texas and has built his more
      recent web material around ID and Dembski.[17]<br>
      <br>
      The Accelerated Christian Education schools teach his theories as
      fact in some of their High School science workbooks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Claims and criticism</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Both scientists and creationists have criticized Baugh's claims.
      In 1982–1984, several scientists, including J.R. Cole, L.R.
      Godfrey, R.J. Hastings, and S.D. Schafersman, examined Baugh's
      purported "mantracks" as well as others provided by creationists
      in the Glen Rose Formation.[12] In the course of the examination
      "Baugh contradicted his own earlier reports of the locations of
      key discoveries" and many of the supposed prints "lacked human
      characteristics."[12] After a three-year investigation of the
      tracks and Baugh's specimens, the scientists concluded there was
      no evidence of any of Baugh's claims or any "dinosaur-man
      tracks".[12]<br>
      <br>
      On September 27, 1984, Al West, a Baugh co-worker for two years,
      who followed the mantrack claims since 1974, and friend of Glen
      Kuban, publicly announced that Baugh "never had evidence for
      manprints as claimed.[12] Gayle Golden, writer for The Dallas
      Morning News, reported that Baugh "paid $10,000 for his Moab
      skeleton and confirmed that Baugh knew at their purchase that the
      bones had already been dated at 200-300 years. However Baugh later
      claimed that the bones were found in Cretaceous deposits."[12]<br>
      <br>
      One of Baugh's more famous claims, aside from the dinosaur tracks,
      is an alleged out of place artifact of an "18th century miner's
      hammer" found in million-year-old Ordovician rock (he has also
      claimed it is in Cretaceous rock) found in 1934 from London,
      Texas.[18][19] Baugh asserted this as evidence against
      scientifically known ways that rocks form.[18] However, laboratory
      tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the
      rock.[18][19] J.R. Cole wrote, "The stone concretion is real, and
      it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological
      processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician
      rock? The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician.
      Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped
      in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in
      this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble."[20]<br>
      <br>
      In July 2008, Baugh was in contact with Alvis Delk and James
      Bishop, who claimed to have found a dinosaur-human print
      fossil.[21] Baugh bought the "fossil" from Delk who used the money
      to pay his medical bills.[22] On the authenticity of the claims,
      reporter Bud Kennedy noted, "since no scientists were involved,
      about all we really know so far is that the museum has a new
      rock."[23] This was deemed "not a convincing human footprint in
      ancient rock" by biologist Glen J. Kuban and called a "blatant
      fake" by biologist PZ Myers.[24]<br>
      <br>
      Creationist organizations such as Answers in Genesis have
      criticized Baugh's claims saying he "muddied the water for many
      Christians. . . . People are being misled."[4] Don Batten, of
      Creation Ministries International wrote: "Some Christians will try
      to use Baugh's 'evidences' in witnessing and get 'shot down' by
      someone who is scientifically literate. The ones witnessed to will
      thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more
      inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening
      to."[25] Answers in Genesis (AiG) lists the "Paluxy tracks" as
      arguments "we think creationists should NOT use" [emphasis in
      original].[26] Also Answers In Creation reviewed Baugh's museum
      and concluded "the main artifacts they claim show a young earth
      reveal that they are deceptions, and in many cases, not even
      clever ones."[27]<br>
      <br>
      In his 1992 book Panorama of Creation, Baugh claims that a layer
      of metallic hydrogen surrounded the early earth. Furthermore, he
      professes that hexagonal water, or, "Creation water" as he calls
      it, is capable of healing. Such claims have been addressed by
      scientists as pseudoscience,[8] and his hypotheses and credentials
      are not accepted in academia.<br>
      <br>
      Baugh has claimed several college degrees, at one point professing
      to earning three doctorates, when no evidence exists that he even
      graduated from high school.[28] All three "doctorates" are from
      unaccredited "schools." One is an honorary "Doctor of Philosophy
      in Theology" from the non-accredited California Graduate School of
      Theology. His claimed 1989 "doctorate" and masters degrees in
      Archaeology come from the non-accredited Pacific International
      University, of which Baugh was also the president.[28] His
      dissertation titled "Academic Justification for Voluntary
      Inclusion of Scientific Creation in Public Classroom Curricula,
      Supported by Evidence that Man and Dinosaurs Were Contemporary"
      was reviewed by Brett Vickers who criticized its "descriptions of
      his field-work on the Paluxy river 'man-tracks', speculation about
      Charles Darwin's religious beliefs and phobias, and biblical
      evidence of Adam's mental excellence."[29] In 2005, Baugh claimed
      to have completed yet another doctorate in theology from the
      unaccredited diploma mill known as Louisiana Baptist
      University.[30]<br>
