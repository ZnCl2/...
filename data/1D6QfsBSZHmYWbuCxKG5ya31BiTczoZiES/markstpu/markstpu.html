      </b>"In one of the RCA engineering manuals I read that it has been
      measured in a wire that there exists a slight increase in current
      when first electrons are caused to flow in it.<br>
      <br>
      "This was explained because the earth’s magnetic field exerted
      some influence on the wire and the electron flow inside it. Or
      rather the electrons on the surface of the wire.<br>
      <br>
      "The inrush of current through the filament interacts with the
      earth’s magnetic field to produce a small kick. (Morgan Jones
      book, valve amplifiers. 3 rd edition, page 262)<br>
      <br>
      "It PROVES that there is an interaction between the magnetic field
      of the earth and simple electrons running through wires<br>
      <br>
      "They say that you cannot get more out of something then you put
      into it. Then I think about that wire with the small kick when
      first turned on… There in lies the secret my friend..."<br>

      observed this phenomenon in the 1940s. ]<br>

        STEVEN MARK : Summary of Important Points:<br>
        <br>
      </b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compass will spin up when turned on.<br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never tune too closely to the exact frequencies<br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a Kill Switch with Over Voltage &amp; Heat
      Sensors.<br>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The control units are so very important to control
      the frequencies.<br>
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The frequencies are directly related to the
      circumference of the collector coil.<br>
      6.&nbsp;&nbsp; First frequency, then second harmonic component
      into the second, then the third.<br>
      7.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could describe the useable current output of my
      coil as DC but with some hash in it.<br>
      8.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 3 Control Coils (all the way around) each
      of the 3 Collector Units.&nbsp; Start them 1 at a time.<br>
      9.&nbsp;&nbsp; The “TPU” units apparently heat up to a potentially
      dangerous level after a considerable period of time<br>
      10. The Collector is three separate coils of multi strand copper
      wire laid one on top of the other. Other control wires are wound
      around all of the horizontal collector coils together.<br>
      <br>
      It took several years of experimentation to discover what
      frequencies and most importantly how to make small integrated
      circuits work to perform the control functions necessary to make
      the demonstrations you see on the video tapes available today.<br>
      <br>
      So in many ways we have early RCA color TV engineers to thank for
      my discovery of the power generator.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure they
      are all dead now but they did contribute.&nbsp; Perhaps a story
      which had impact on me at that time was told to me by my boss way
      back in 1970 I believe it was.<br>
      <br>
      He told me that around 1965 or 66 there was an explosion in an
      apartment in Chicago.&nbsp; The authorities had concluded that for
      some unknown reason, a General Electric color television receiver
      had been the source of an explosion that killed a young black
      child in the apartment.&nbsp; My boss went on to relate that he
      was involved in the investigation because he was in Chicago at the
      time and he was invaluably experienced with television circuits
      and etc.&nbsp; He told us that what they found was, the TV had
      exploded with some quick fury.&nbsp; The explosion did in fact
      kill the poor child who was sitting directly in front but spared
      his mother who was some distance away in the kitchen.&nbsp; The
      explosion was strange because of the absence of expected chemicals
      necessary to create the explosion.&nbsp; It appeared that the TV
      was the exact center of the explosion, however no one could find a
      reason for the explosion occurring.<br>
      <br>
      Also consider that there is not really much inside a TV to explode
      with enough force to kill people and destroy the living room a
      large apartment.&nbsp; Yes a CRT can explode and kill someone,
      however this was not the kind of explosion we are talking
      about.&nbsp; The most interesting part of the story is that
      according to our boss, metallic objects especially those
      containing large amounts of iron were dramatically
      displaced.&nbsp; He mentioned that some nails were actually
      removed from the walls and pulled toward the TV set.&nbsp; When
      they found them they were bent and shaped like cork screws!&nbsp;
      Everything in the room appeared to have moved or was moving toward
      the TV as it exploded, or imploded as the case may be.<br>
      <br>
      The child was apparently killed by way of these metallic objects
      traveling through his body on their way toward the center of the
      TV set.&nbsp; As far as my boss knew, there was never a good
      explanation for the occurrence.&nbsp; We found out that this was
      not the only unexplained explosion of TV sets worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      However, the fact that all the sets exploded while in operation
      may bear some light.&nbsp; Also most of the TV sets were made by
      the GE company or were TV sets made using GE circuits and of
      similar design.&nbsp; However, this man who had been my mentor for
      so many years had his own theory which he never told anyone as far
      as i know, except me.&nbsp; His theory was that the TV while in
      operation, somehow managed to become a receiver of more then just
      television waves and so for a millisecond in time became a
      receiver and discharged of a huge amount of electrical and
      magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      This discharge of magnetic energy is vary similar to the discharge
      of magnetic energy during an atomic explosion. . . Now that is
      something I have thought about a great deal.&nbsp; My employer's
      words had great impact on me. Not that they meant anything really,
      but I kept thinking about the possibility of many frequencies
      combining at one moment in time to produce an entirely different
      effect then intended by the designers.<br>
      <br>
      Listen to what I say here......&nbsp; I am going to state just
      characteristics.&nbsp; I don't want people to get over excited and
      start arguing again too much.&nbsp; My units behave exactly like
      common radios in one way.&nbsp; With a radio you have many
      different stations broadcasting at different frequencies.&nbsp;
      Yes I know about the difference between Frequency Modulation and
      Amplitude Modulation, etc.&nbsp; That is not relevant for our
      conversation here.<br>
      <br>
      You tune your radio to the station you desire and the closer you
      tune to the ideal frequency the stronger the amplification of the
      signal will be and the better the radio will collect and amplify
      the signals for their entertainment value.&nbsp; If the radio
      signal is too strong the radio receiver might be overloaded and
      distortion or other bad effects will take place. By tuning
      slightly off frequency we can weaken the signal the radio is
      receiving and amplify and produce the sound for entertainment
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      However, the music will not be of high quality.&nbsp; The music
      will be lacking in response and timbre, etc.&nbsp; OK let us
      compare this story of the common radio.&nbsp; Think of the power
      unit as a device similar to a radio receiver.&nbsp; No I do not
      want to hear feed back informing me that I am trying to convince
      the world my unit works on radio waves!!!.<br>
      <br>
      But it behaves very much like a simple radio receiver except for
      the fact that radio waves need to be amplified before they can be
      of any use to us.&nbsp; My units behave as though they are
      variable tuning devices, and we are tuning them to a frequency
      just like a radio.&nbsp; The closer you get to the center
      frequency the more power you permit the collector to dissipate
      into a load.&nbsp; The important difference here is that in the
      case of the radio, you tune into the frequency and amplify it for
      use.<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp; In the case of my power unit, you create several
      frequencies within a space of the collector coil's circumference.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp; The frequencies are directly related to the circumference
      of the collector coil.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp; You can begin to collect the current and dissipate it
      with no need for amplification because the signal source also
      becomes the feed for the power source and has the natural tendency
      to run with gain.<br>
      <br>
      4.&nbsp; It is important that you note that you can never tune too
      closely to the exact frequencies of power conversion because the
      power received by the collector will instantly destroy it.<br>
      <br>
      5.&nbsp; We instead must deliberately tune off the frequencies of
      conversion in order to make the thing properly work.&nbsp;
      Remember that it is like a furnace which feeds itself.&nbsp; The
      hotter it gets the more fuel it gives itself to burn.<br>
      <br>
      6.&nbsp; That is why the control units are so very
      important.&nbsp; Without the control unit constantly monitoring
      the frequencies of operation and making the necessary changes to
      keep the whole thing off exact conversion frequency, then the unit
      would very quickly destroy it's self.<br>
      <br>
      7.&nbsp; By the way, have you seen the video of the compass
      turning violently in the center of the unit while in
      operation?&nbsp; Notice that when I first turn the unit on that
      the compass starts to spin very slowly.&nbsp; It speeds up faster
      and faster until it just stops.&nbsp; When it stops the unit is
      always operating at about it's design maximum.<br>
      We never found out why any of this occurred.&nbsp; It tended to
      reinforce what I observed as the turbine effect.<br>
      <br>
      8.&nbsp; When the unit is shut off the compass starts to revolve
      again and slowly comes to a rest.&nbsp; By the way, the fire
      discharge everyone sees in the video is after the output of the
      device is switched through a large high value resister!<br>
      <br>
      9.&nbsp; I hope that will wake up a few of you to the danger
      potentials.<br>
      <br>
      10.&nbsp; Stefan is quite correct about the amount of power
      necessary to pull the nails out of the walls during the GE color
      television explosion in Chicago.&nbsp; Actually Dr. Schinzinger
      told me that it would have required much more power then
      that.&nbsp; We theorized that the TV set must have become for a
      split second, a power unit very similar in operation to one of my
      own making.&nbsp; Except for the fact that it wouldn't have been
      designed to collect and convert the available power in a useful
      way.&nbsp; Instead, the TV just stumbled for one millisecond on
      the correct combination of frequencies necessary to cause the
      phenomenon of magnetic collection.&nbsp; But unfortunately the TV
      set had no way to control the function and began to absorb and
      discharge both the electric and magnetic factors caused by the
      influence of the strong field.<br>
      <br>
      11.&nbsp; It was during this discussion with Dr. Schinzinger that
      he pointed out that during an atomic explosion aside from the
      gigantic blast wave and heat produced there is also an extremely
      large magnetic force which is so strong that it travels way out
      into space during the explosion.&nbsp; The magnetic wave is so
      strong that it will completely destroy any unprotected electronic
      circuits of solid state design.&nbsp; That is why solid state
      radios will be useless after an nuclear attack on your country.<br>
      <br>
      12.&nbsp; Let us ponder where the huge magnetic field comes from
      when you explode an atomic bomb.&nbsp; It is just created? Is it
      converted? Is it part of the earth somehow?&nbsp; Is it just a by
      product of the fabric of time and space being ripped into pieces
      in a fragment of a second?&nbsp; I am curious as to where this
      unbelievably huge magnetic force comes from during an atomic
      explosion... It is something else to think about.&nbsp; Perhaps in
      connection with my power technology. Dr. Schinzinger said that it
      is explained as being the result of the splitting of the
      atom.&nbsp; However, that is a very short explanation and not
      really a satisfactory explanation of what generates the
      force.&nbsp; He agreed with me and said it would also mean that in
      reality we know very little about magnetic fields and magnetic
      property.<br>
      <br>
      13.&nbsp; The multiple frequencies traveling around the coils are
      of too high a frequency to provide for any motive effort.&nbsp;
      They are only a means to achieve an end.&nbsp; The multiple
      frequencies begin to feed themselves and the multiple kicks become
      a combined big kick.&nbsp; I call it resonating.&nbsp; That is why
      if you notice in the video tapes that it takes just a few seconds
      for the coil to begin to function at maximum effort.<br>
      <br>
      14.&nbsp; When I began to study the effects of multiple
      frequencies combined together I found out that when you
      deliberately strive to create the worst case scenario of
      frequencies you start to get some very measurable kicks.&nbsp; In
      themselves they are not much. But if you make enough of them fast
      sendoff, you get a collectible power spike that is more then the
      power available to begin with.&nbsp; The destructive heating
      caused by the eddy currents become the problem we face when we
      make a really large powerful coil.&nbsp; Now you understand more
      about the heating problem and why using a fan does not work.<br>
      <br>
      15.&nbsp; You could describe the useable current output of my coil
      as DC but with some hash in it.&nbsp; It really doesn't have any
      convertible AC component which could provide a mechanical motive
      force as you suggested.&nbsp; "In one of the RCA engineering
      manuals I read that it has been measured in a wire that there
      exists a slight increase in current when first electrons are
      caused to flow in it.&nbsp; This was explained because the earth's
      magnetic field exerted some influence on the wire and the electron
      flow inside it.&nbsp; Or rather the electrons on the surface of
      the wire.&nbsp; Even today you can find examples of discussion of
      this fact even in non scientific journals.&nbsp; If you look in
      Morgan Jones book, Valve Amplifiers, 3rd edition, on page 262 he
      says, The inrush of current through the filament interacts with
      the earth's magnetic field to produce a small kick.&nbsp; SMALL
      KICK.&nbsp; Those words mean a great deal.&nbsp; It PROVES that
      there is an interaction between the magnetic field of the earth
      and simple electrons running through wires.&nbsp; It may be a
      small influence but it is actual OVER UNITY.&nbsp; I have spent
      several years of my life thinking about that."<br>
      <br>
      16.&nbsp; They didn't know that according to science only one
      playing of the shellac disk would destroy it.&nbsp; They didn't
      know so they just kept on making and selling diamond needles for
      not only shellac disks but the new soft vinyl ones as well.&nbsp;
      Trial and error is the best way to make new discoveries.&nbsp; If
      we rely completely on what we are told by scientists and engineers
      we will never make any relevant discoveries because we are told
      not to try, that they are impossible.&nbsp; On to another
      point.&nbsp; Please keep in mind that these things are
      dangerous.&nbsp; Very dangerous.&nbsp; We are talking about
      several hundred volts at a potential of an amp or more.&nbsp; The
      average experimenter can not deal with anything like that.<br>
      <br>
      17.&nbsp; I do not want the average person actually coming across
      one of the correct frequency components and using both hands to
      measure the field frequency not realizing there is five hundred
      volts and zap, their heart is stopped.&nbsp; I tell you this from
      my experience.&nbsp; Personal experience involving others.<br>
      <br>
      If something as elementary as an ETR circuit is not understood by
      the experimenter and if the experimenter has never had any
      experience with high voltages, especially voltages that can easily
      kill you, then he should get out and not attempt to recreate
      anything like my technology.&nbsp; During my experiments and even
      during my demonstrations, several people were badly hurt.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps you read the report by a gentleman who was told NOT to
      touch the two leads coming out of the small coil because the same
      voltage was there as would be at the 120 volt mains wall
      socket.&nbsp; At some point he decided the only way for him to
      know for sure that my demonstration was real was to touch the two
      leads leading directly out of the small coil.&nbsp; He was badly
      burned and needed medical attention.&nbsp; However he became an
      instant believer.<br>
      <br>
      18.&nbsp; The very FIRST example I gave you was that;&nbsp; It is
      common scientific knowledge that if you have a piece of wire and
      first run electricity through it you will have a small kick when
      first energized.&nbsp; The kick is universally attributed to the
      earth's magnetic field.&nbsp; OK the point is; YOU CAN GET SOME
      ENERGY OUT OF THE EARTH!&nbsp; Next point; YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
      VERY SIMPLE WITH A WIRE TO SHOW THIS.<br>
      <br>
      Next point; YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN GET MORE OUT OF A PIECE OF
      WIRE THEN YOU PUT IN TO IT.<br>
      <br>
      19.&nbsp; We are not talking about a coil or a transformer or
      anything developing a primary to secondary flux.&nbsp; We are just
      talking about a straight piece of wire, some electrons and a
      method of measuring what comes out of it.&nbsp; Some people just
      sit back and say, well that isn't very much power, we want to make
      much more.&nbsp; In order to run you must walk first.&nbsp; I told
      you that the simplest form of over unity is a piece of wire and a
      voltage source.<br>
      Anyone can actually connect it and measure.&nbsp; See for yourself
      the kick. NO coil no xmrs, just a kick.<br>
      <br>
      That should tell you learned gentleman that there exists a form of
      energy convertible and useable which is directly related to a
      simple piece of wire and instantaneous electron flow.&nbsp; You
      know it is common knowledge in the electron tube world that aside
      from the fact that a cold filament conducts more electricity then
      when hot, one of the things that destroys the filament in electron
      tubes for that matter is this kick when you first turn on the
      juice.&nbsp; The kick is there whether the filament is hot or
      cold.&nbsp; The kick helps destroy the filament and cathodes
      integrity.<br>
      <br>
      So everyone knows about the kick and accepts that it somehow comes
      from the earth's magnetic field.&nbsp; So do something with this
      information!&nbsp; Not even Edison explained what this
      means!&nbsp; In his memoirs he said that it was a fact that we all
      had to contend with, but that he did not understand why it
      happened.&nbsp; If you call yourself experimenters then start to
      experiment.&nbsp; I had only this to go on when I started and
      little by little I figured out how to make many several thousands
      of kicks per second. . . AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT ISN"T DIFICULT AT
      ALL.<br>
      <br>
      20.&nbsp; Lets talk about the 'kick.'&nbsp; When the old Edison DC
      generators were turned on, back in the day, they released this
      'kick' and killed many workers in the process.&nbsp; A man by the
      name of Tesla had seen this.&nbsp; He wondered how and why this
      'kick' would occur.&nbsp; So he experimented with wire and
      disruptive discharges from capacitors.&nbsp; It was found by him
      that this kick could be made so powerful that it could explode
      wires instantly. This kick came out of the wires
      perpendicularly.&nbsp; He discharged capacitors into stout wire
      and through a spark gap.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the kick's strength and appearance was in how fast
      Tesla discharged the capacitors into the spark gap AND how fast
      Tesla STOPPED the flow of current AT the spark gap.&nbsp; Tesla
      used all types of devices to stop this flow of current, magnets, a
      flame, counter-rotating engines.&nbsp; His goals were to get the
      time in which the discharge is STOPPED to be much quicker.&nbsp;
      As Tesla did this he found that the perpendicular radiations, the
      ones from the wires, caused electrical effects to appear in wires
      and other copper/metal materials near the STOPPED
      current/discharge.&nbsp; These electrical effects could be made to
      create electrons on other wires and copper around his STOPPED
      current/discharge wire.<br>
      <br>
      21.&nbsp; With the right combination of frequencies, you can
      actually create a revolving field with inertia!&nbsp; That is what
      I have referred to as , The inertia effect.&nbsp; There is a
      genuine gyroscopic effect when the units are on.&nbsp; Everybody
      has noticed that when held and in operation, the units have a
      definite vibration and have a gyroscopic effect.&nbsp; They seam
      to resist being moved through the air.&nbsp; When placed on a
      smooth surface it is very pronounced.&nbsp; Some of you should
      think about that.<br>
      <br>
      22.&nbsp; Rotation of field.&nbsp; How many people think about
      that.&nbsp; If you could have a field that you could think of as a
      big ball.&nbsp; And you could rotate it in two directions what
      would the ramifications be?&nbsp; Listen, you need to make three
      coils or so one on top of the other.&nbsp; But the important thing
      is to wrap the control coils perpendicularly around the collector
      coils.&nbsp; There needs to be three of them all the way
      around.&nbsp; Start them up one at a time each.<br>
      <br>
      23.&nbsp; First frequency, then second harmonic component into the
      second, then the third.&nbsp; When you eventually strike the cord
      look out.&nbsp; You will know what has happened at that
      point.&nbsp; In the mean time you can measure a slight output even
      if you do not strike the exact cord.&nbsp; Larger collectors have
      a much greater ability to collect and dissipate more energy then
      the smaller ones. However, if they turn into a bomb it will not
      make much difference.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a small
      lightning strike.<br>
      <br>
      24.&nbsp; Perhaps a smaller one is safer because the only thing
      that will stop a red collector is the disintegration of the matter
      acting as a receiver.&nbsp; IE, the wires all burn up.&nbsp; We
      built many, many units with various combinations of collectors
      during our experimental days.&nbsp; My colleagues and I have a
      recollection of about thee hundred being crushed up because they
      were not the best designs.&nbsp; Most of the more successful units
      we made had control wiring run or wrapped vertically over the
      horizontal collector wires.&nbsp; You can see them in the units in
      some of the videos under black plastic covering.&nbsp; They were
      run perpendicular to the travel of the collector wires. They were
      run in multiple segments.&nbsp; Each segment could be fed a
      different frequency individually and or from a collector section
      to help perpetuate the oscillation and control.<br>
      <br>
      25.&nbsp; The control frequencies are important in order to make
      power from the collector.&nbsp; I assumed that anyone working on
      technology this sophisticated would have a superior knowledge of
      electronics and an understanding of PURE frequency output being a
      Necessity to control the reactions going on inside the
      collector.&nbsp; By starting the oscillation you cause the current
      to flow in the collector which causes the magnification of the
      process within the collector which will ultimately produce the
      greater voltage and power in usable amounts during
      operation.&nbsp; It is electron flow of a high order creating a
      large magnetic field.&nbsp; Or vice versa.&nbsp; Electron tube
      circuits work much more precisely then solid state units.&nbsp;
      Especially when first experimenting.&nbsp; You will be able to get
      some excitation with solid state units but we had to design with
      tubes first and then try to duplicate the functioning system with
      solid state circuits later.&nbsp; It was difficult.&nbsp; Solid
      state circuits are very dirty and imprecise.<br>
      <br>
      26.&nbsp; Vacuum tubes have EXTREMELY FAST TRANSIT TIMES.&nbsp;
      Solid state devices are like molasses!&nbsp; They also use about a
      million percent of feed-back to get a clean signal output.&nbsp;
      Vacuum tube devices are fast, accurate and only require a few db
      of feedback to achieve better result.&nbsp; Lets just look at
      simple power amplifier as an example: A 100 watt solid state
      amplifier will consist on average with a compliment of 30 or so
      transistors, lots of amplifying and control devices all based on
      high current low voltage.&nbsp; Low voltage means SLOW.&nbsp;
      Also, all those transistors in the amplifying stages slow down the
      signal process.&nbsp; Now look at a basic electron tube
      device.&nbsp; You have one stage of amplification, one stage of
      signal phase splitting and driving and one stage of power output,
      all at high voltage low current. This means FAST!&nbsp; It also
      means that the feedback for frequency output correction is FAST
      also.&nbsp; Now you see why I&nbsp; have always said that tubes
      are much better for experimentation.&nbsp; Solid state devices are
      too slow to find the three major intersecting you know whats...<br>
      <br>
      27.&nbsp; I want you to start and think of the generator
      principles the exact same way that passing the sound barrier was
      accomplished.&nbsp; Read how the engineers finally developed the
      proper wing design to accomplish super sonic speed in
      aircraft.&nbsp; I hope it will give you a picture of what is going
      on inside the generator and especially the collector.&nbsp; The
      people who say that tubes are exactly the same as transistors are
      very, very naive.<br>
      <br>
      28.&nbsp; And now I will tell you something very important.&nbsp;
      You remember I mentioned fast electron transit time vs
      molasses?&nbsp; Let us examine a simple audio amplifier.&nbsp;
      When you design an amplifier you try to isolate noise, or hash
      from the mains power supply from getting into the B+ and
      contaminating the output signal, etc.&nbsp; You can measure all
      kinds of noise from the mains in your B+ not to mention all the
      noisy spikes from the solid state rectifiers giving the direct
      current to the power capacitors.&nbsp; All of this is easily
      measured, or seen on a scope of most solid state audio
      amplifiers.&nbsp; NOW design and make a good tube amplifier and
      you will immediately find a dramatic difference in the B+ supply
      measurements and what you can see on the scope.&nbsp; No more
      spikes from the solid state rectifiers, almost no hash from the
      mains power coming in!&nbsp; REMEMBER, all of that noise and hash
      in your solid state amplifier is in the output signal !&nbsp; Now
      tell me? What do you think is happening inside the extremely
      sensitive torrid generator when you use solid state devices to
      attempt to create the required precise control frequencies to make
      catalyst and produce power???<br>
      <br>
      29.&nbsp; You know transistors just don't do well at those high
      frequencies.&nbsp; They try hard but they just make all sorts of
      harmonics all over the place.&nbsp; Dirty things
      transistors.&nbsp; MOSFETS are better you know if you wanted to
      make an amplifier that behaved as though it was a tube amp but in
      a smaller size.&nbsp; Please be very careful with your experiments
      and WATCH out!&nbsp; The Kill switch....remember the kill
      switch.&nbsp; I do not want this to scare the crap out of any body
      and have them telling mamma, blaming satan, god, or any body else.<br>
      <br>
      30.&nbsp; This inventor claims that the output of the unit is high
      voltage DC with a frequency component of around 5k Hz.&nbsp; First
      of all, obviously you can have several different output components
      in the power output signal. You can have DC and AC together
      without any problem.<br>
      <br>
      There are several parts of the power unit which have patents.
      Remember that the power unit technology is owned by the UEC
      corporation and I have to be very careful about not stepping on
      their toes. I am not afraid of them or anything like that. It is
      just that they are the legitimate owners of the patents and most
      of the research ect. I would not like to break my trust with
      them.&nbsp; However, I can, and will give to all of you as much
      information as I can. I believe that I will be able to give you
      enough information to begin research on your own. I just have to
      pass it in front of my attorney first so I do not get myself into
      trouble, that's all.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; I will in time give out a
      basic Hardware diagram which you may find helpful.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;
      No, I will not publish a schematic diagram of the control circuit.
      It is proprietary information owned and controlled by the UEC
      Corporation, so I won't go there.<br>
      <br>
      31.&nbsp; About the Flame like Discharge. Yes it does cause RF
      burns. I was going to tell you about that, but I decided to wait
      and see how long it would take one of you to realize this on your
      own. Bravo!&nbsp; YES, toroidal transformers have some very weird
      factors.&nbsp; Study the strange factors.&nbsp; Your interest in
      the harmonic resonance is also stepping toward the right direction
      of things. But then again it depends on your viewpoint about
      exactly what harmonic resonance is and how it relates to magnetic
      fields and converting energy as does my power unit.&nbsp; We have
      done a great deal of experimentation with permanent magnets with
      some very astounding results. I could stop now and start over
      again with that subject alone. Has anyone ever read any of the
      reports about our experiments with what was called, the Magnetic
      shadow casting material? No it wasn't some kind of paint. But you
      would be fascinated with the amount of renewable energy you can
      extract from a permanent magnet! We went through about ten
      thousand dollars worth of Neodymium and Super Cobalt 404 magnetic
      material in our experiments. I could write volumes of information
      about that stuff. Those experiments tie in to our development of
      the power unit.<br>
      <br>
      32.&nbsp; At the request of Mr. Richard Mincherton I was present
      on October 28th at a test demonstration of a device that its
      inventor claims will produce electric power without measurable
      energy input except as derived from the earth'’ magnetic and
      gravitational fields. The test was conducted at the inventor's
      home. I was allowed to bring and use measuring instruments, but
      because the inventor had to leave after 1 ½ hours, I was not able
      to conduct independent tests on my own.&nbsp; Based on my
      observations, I can attest to the fact that the three models of
      the device displayed and tested on that day did indeed light up
      one, two and six light bulbs (each rated at 100 watt and 120 volt)
      respectively. This was less then the figures quoted to me before
      the test, but still adequate to demonstrate that the devices
      function in some fashion. The smallest unit produced 140 to 150
      volts unloaded and 60 to 90 volts when lighting one 100-watt bulb.
      The mid-sized unit produced 250 volts unloaded, and was observed
      producing 142 Volts at .5 Ampere after 30 minutes of lighting two
      bulbs.&nbsp; The largest unit produced 798 Volts unloaded. With a
      six-bulb load the voltage dropped to 420 Volts.<br>
      <br>
      After the test the inventor cut the toroidally shaped device into
      segments (though not the controller box located at the center of
      the device). These samples consisted of an array of
      circumferentially arranged coils and wires grouped around a core
      made of a cork like substance.&nbsp; October 29, 1995 Roland

      33.&nbsp; I do suggest that people who are not familiar with rf
      and the burns that can be had do not mess with this.&nbsp; The
      coils get hot. This problem has not been resolved. It apparently
      due to the windings moving.&nbsp; Think of the ouput as dc
      (pulsed) 5khz with lots of Hash in it.&nbsp; When it is unloaded
      the voltage climbs substantially and I do not mean a spike. it
      lasts for several seconds and is a good third higher.&nbsp; Steven
      calls it the turbine effect.<br>
      <br>
      The large coils have control units (as seen) the small coils have
      the control unit mounted on the inside edge of the coil and they
      do have to be inside the coil.&nbsp; Here is something interesting
      from Steven.&nbsp; It has been a very long road from beginning to
      end.&nbsp; It took several years of experimentation to discover
      what frequencies and most importantly how to make small integrated
      circuits work to perform the control functions necessary to make
      the demonstrations you see on the video tapes available today.<br>
      <br>
      In one of the videos you demonstrate your device which it is
      connected to a measuring instrument.&nbsp; When you turn it top
      down the voltage decrease and you had no explanation for it. Now
      my question: did you try your device already on the earth south
      site?&nbsp; YES NORBERT, WE DID TRY THEM SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR,
      THEY WORK IN REVERSE. CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY?<br>
      <br>
      34.&nbsp; YES THERE IS A ROTATING FEILD WHICH CAUSES ELECTRONS TO
      FLOW IN COPPER WIRE AND BE USED TO PROVIDE USEFULL WORK FORSE.
      THERE ARE MANY WIRES PERPENDICULAR TO THE MAIN COLLECTOR. THIS IS
      A NECESSARY PART OF THE DEVICE.<br>

      To whom it may concern:<br>
      <br>
      I have been hired by Mr. Green to evaluate the performance of the
      Toroidal Power Unit or TPU as has been described to me as a
      proprietary invention of Steven Mark who was until 1995 President
      and Chief engineer of Spheric Laboratories, a public
      corporation.&nbsp; I have been instructed to compare the
      performance of the TPU with that of any known batteries and other
      storage systems. As understood the device is universally observed
      to have the following characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      Outside Diameter: 6"<br>
      Inside Diameter: 5"<br>
      Height: 1 - 3/4"<br>
      Weight: 12 ounces<br>
      Output Power: 250 Watts<br>
      Output Voltage: 160 Volts<br>
      Voltage Frequency: 5000 Hz.<br>
      Duration of Performance: 30 Minutes<br>
      <br>
      The “TPU” units apparently heat up to a potentially dangerous
      level after a considerable period of time, and must be shut off at
      that point. This makes some people suspicious of a battery that is
      being depleted and which must be recharged after a few minutes.
      However, after having cooled down, the inventor has always managed
      to start the unit up again and light the lamps again for the same
      amount of time as before, until the unit heats up again, without
      removing the device from the observers sight to be “recharged”.
      This can apparently be done any number of times, such as the
      cumulative “ON” time can be extended to at least 30 or 40 minutes.
      This is several<br>
      times longer then the theoretical limit of any kind of concealed
      battery pack that I, the battery experts or electrical engineers
      have yet been able to discover. I have personally seen this
      demonstration at least fifty times.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      In point of fact, there is in existence a video tape showing a
      “TPU” putting out over 1,000 Volts and lighting ten 100 Watt/ 120
      volt light bulbs in series for ten minutes. (I have seen this
      demonstration in person several times). <br>
      <br>
      35.&nbsp; About the collector:&nbsp; It is three separate coils of
      multi strand copper wire laid one on top of the other, not
      interleaved. Three is important. You can do many things with three
      coils. You can run them in parallel, you can run two in series and
      one in parallel, or etc.&nbsp; You can run a separate frequency
      into each coil for better control on large power units if need
      be.&nbsp; The control wiring is vertically wound in several
      segments around each of the horizontal collector coils. Other
      control wires are wound around all of the horizontal collector
      coils together.<br>
      <br>
      Through the different control wire and coil wire arrangements you
      can keep complete control of the unit most of the time. However,
      you must have an emergency KILL switch. A way of cutting off all
      the control frequencies simultaneity. This kill switch must be,
      manual and also connected through a heat sensor buried within the
      collector coil.<br>
      <br>
      It should automatically stop the function of the unit before it
      self destructs on it's own. This is important for obvious reasons.
      Also the kill switch should also be connected to cut off whenever
      it measures over voltage. If that should ever happen, you would
      never have enough time to hit the kill switch before the
      inevitable explosion occurred.&nbsp; You know, it is very similar
      to the idea of a long garden hose. Picture a hose with water in
      it. If you pick up one end and move along the length of the hose
      you will move the water constantly along in the direction you are
      moving. You could also squeeze the hose in the direction to move
      the water along as well. And you could do both to control the
      movement of the water more precisely. You can think of the
      movement of water as the movement of electrons through the
      collector coils.<br>
      <br>
      36.&nbsp; August 16, 2006 – Mystery Post.&nbsp; Here is what I
      perceive in his power toroidal device, and I will try to make this
      concise and sensical:<br>
      <br>
      1. When one builds a bifilar coil, using one winding for power,
      and one for trigger, and drive this with a transistor, there is a
      certain point, when you bring a magnet close to one end of the
      coil, you will get a loud squealing noise from the coil. This
      feedback is the result of the trigger and power coil constantly
      switching the power transistor used to drive that coil off and on
      again. It is also a point where that coil/transistor combination
      produce a high voltage output which one can gather from the
      collector of the transistor. If left unchecked, this resonant
      frequency of on/off switching will burn up the transistor, and
      thus a resistor must be put into the trigger winding circuit to
      lessen the voltage produced in the winding. It is one element of
      what I believe is happening in the Mark device.<br>
      <br>
      2. When one places several coils around a toroid, one can think of
      switching from one to the next, preferably sequentially, the
      minimum number of coils being three. In this case one could use
      the trigger winding from one coil to turn on the power of the
      second coil, the trigger from the second to the third power, the
      third trigger to the power winding of the first coil.<br>
      <br>
      3. Flux can switch directions within a ferrous material
      instantaneously and some say super-luminally. It takes very little
      switching power to flip flux "bundles" from one direction to
      another, given that there is a good path for the flux to move
      through. The toroid is perfect for this. If one were to turn on a
      magnetic field in one coil, that flux permeates most of the
      toroid, but more importantly is perceived by the next coil. This
      in turn triggers that coil to operate, and the first coil field is
      shut down. In this way, one could use coils to move the flux in
      PULSES around the toroid. This switching from coil to coil,
      accomplished with low power, high voltage pulses occurs at a
      natural frequency of the circuit and that frequency that can be
      handled by the power transistors.<br>
      <br>
      4. The high voltage, low power is a result of the "kick" whereof
      Steve Mark speaks. It was most clearly described by Nikola Tesla,
      when he observed a very high voltage spike at the VERY INSTANT a
      DC switch was closed. In fact he spoke of people being killed by
      this spike. Such a spike (though lower in magnitude) happens
      within a transistor at the very instant its gate is closed to
      allow power to course through it. I learned of this in vacuum
      tubes from my dad when he taught me how to build my first Heathkit
      shortwave radio in 1963. He said: "Whenever possible, leave the
      radio on - it doesn't consume much power, but the startup surges
      will quickly burn up your tubes."&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      5. When a coil is thus activated, initially it creates a very
      powerful magnetic spike.&nbsp; Imagine that this can even be more
      amplified if the transistor is turned on only to close the gate of
      a silicone controlled rectifier, in order to dump a small
      capacitor very suddenly through the coil.<br>
      <br>
      6. It becomes easy to see that when one talks about the switching
      ability of transistors, 5kHz is perfectly reasonable, switching
      from one coil to the next.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      7. Next we have the challenge of making the many pulses of
      magnetic power unidirectional. As we all know current running
      through a wire creates a circular magnetic field centered about
      that wire. This also answers the old question you posed on one of
      your posts as to why a set of jumper cables jumps when shorted
      across the battery terminal. Well, first, the direction of current
      is opposite in the two leads, thereby quadrupling the magnetic
      force in the narrow space between the two wires. This powerful
      magnetic "linear" flux concentration between the cables then tries
      to orient itself to the ambient earths magnetic flux lines, and
      hence, jumps. Note, however, that there is more at play here. The
      VERY INSTANT you connect the cable to the battery, you also have
      that very high voltage spike whereof Tesla spoke. This spike has a
      large Radiant Energy component to the electricity. It contributes
      a great deal to the powerful magnetic pulse.<br>
      <br>
      8. Back to unidirectional flux in the toroid. In order to create a
      mainly DC current in windings around part or all of the toroid, we
      must now ensure the flux moves in ONE direction. Well, the
      placement of a magnet at right angles to the flow around the
      toroid would tend to make the flux take a preferential direction.
      The flux of a controlling coil in a flux-gating device such as
      some of the Joe Flynn devices is quite weak, but exerts enormous
      directional control on even very powerful flux. This is the
      concept exploited in the design of the newest patent of the
      Magnetic Power Module. (Interestingly, it appears to be a
      derivation of Steven Mark's efforts....) Thus, instead of using
      additional small coils to make the toroidal flux take one
      preferred direction as compared to the other can be acco0mplished
      by the use of a ferrite magnet, as seen in the videos (I, too have
      watched them numerous times.)<br>
      <br>
      9. Now to the question of the little pieces of wire and the
      magnet. I don't remember anyone answering this to your or Mr.
      Mark's satisfaction. Let me have a go. When you move a magnet
      across a wire you generate a current in that wire. However, what
      was not iterated is that the amount of current generated is not
      only a matter of the strength of the magnet, but rather the SPEED
      and distance at which that magnet is moved across that wire. Thus
      when we speak of moving the magnet across a small piece of wire at
      the speed of a gunshot, you generate a very sudden, high voltage
      spike in that little piece of wire.&nbsp; Conversely, if you could
      move that wire crossways through even a weak magnetic field with
      few flux likes, you could generate a voltage spike. In essence
      Mark is doing this in his toroid. He states he is running at about
      5kHz. For four coils (like the one that is open on the cardboard
      box in his garage with two lamps), he may be banging two opposed
      coils simultaneously with spikes, with the magnet forcing one
      direction, or he is running them sequentially. For the sequential
      version, that would mean the "magnetic flux North" (for lack of a
      better way to describe it) passes one spot in the toroid 1250
      times per second.&nbsp; The RPM of the flux would therefore be AT
      LEAST 75,000RPM. Can you imagine the kind of power you might
      generate from Neo magnets in an armature near windings if you
      COULD rev that puppy up to 75,000RPM? Only this toroid has no back
      EMF when a load is put on the wires.<br>
      <br>
      10. Remember I was talking about SPEED of the magnet passing the
      wires playing a significant role in the voltage produced. If we
      take the above example of 75,000 RPM, it is easy to calculate for
      a 14" diameter toroid, that the actual speed of the magnet
      "flying" past the wires at a very close range would be 3,123.74
      statute miles per hour or 4,581.5 ft/second. Compare this to the
      bullet of a high powered rifle at 2,800 ft/sec. 11. One need only
      to add all the little pieces of wire, which are now individual
      loops of wire around the toroid's ring itself to see why the
      toroid generates such enormous voltages and currents. Needless to
      say, toroidal coils, like any coil have a preferred resonant
      frequency. If the toroidal coil is tuned to the "kick" frequency
      or pulsed frequency, one can see that this thing would put out
      scary amounts of power.<br>
      <br>
      12. I shall make a stab here and say that these toroids DO NOT
      heat up until a load is put on the output wires. It would
      intuitively make sense that this heating is not only due to
      current flow within the toroid off-take winding, but also due to
      the new magnetic field that would result within the toroid, due to
      the DC current now flowing around it. Strangely, using the left
      hand rule for magnetism, this toroid is an aberration. Because
      when one thinks of the current beginning the flow through a load,
      the magnetic flux this winding creates is ADDITIVE to the pulsing
      magnetic flux created by the coils.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      13. When we look at the earth's magnetic field, there are some
      weird things to look at.&nbsp; Does a high-speed rotational flux
      field draw or lessen or concentrate flux lines into a Mark device?
      Maybe that is exactly what it does. This simply ADDS more density
      to the field.&nbsp; However, something else strikes me more
      simply. Mark has set up his terrific sequential pulsed magnetic
      field with a small battery (who cares if there is a battery - that
      point is moot when you look at the power out) which rotates nearly
      twice as fast as the bullet from a high powered rifle. It creates
      enormous numbers of flux lines crossing wires per second. That is
      key and it takes little power. Once power is established, one
      could take a tiny amount from the output and run the circuit, so
      again the battery is moot. The main thing is the device's strange
      reaction to physical movement. I attribute this to the ENORMOUS
      impact of the SPEED at which the magnetic flux moves.<br>
      <br>
      14. We see how even small flux density, when accelerated to very
      high speed, can STILL generate current in conductors, be they
      wires or even flat surfaces. When we talk about these effects, we
      understand that ANY magnetic device, be it a simple magnet compass
      or object, will try to orient itself to the earth's magnetic
      field. Try and experiment. See how a magnetized needle in a match
      turns slowly to north in a cup of water. Now take a strong
      neodymium magnet and tape a piece of thread to it and let it hang.
      Note how QUICKLY and how STRONGLY it orients itself to the earth's
      field. What Mark appears to have proven is that one can create the
      effect of higher strength of a magnet through speed of movement of
      the field. And the field appears to be strengthened drastically by
      the ADDITIVE pulses of the coils pumping the toroid up to
      saturation.<br>
      <br>
      15. To me the reason that the toroid appears to "judder" as one
      attempts to move the toroid across the table is straightforward.
      As the field rotates, there is a point in the device where the
      rotating field (perhaps rotating is the wrong word) better, field
      in its racetrack, is oriented in direct opposition to the Earth's
      magnetic field. On the diametrically opposite side, the field is
      perfect attraction to the earth's field. This means that pushing
      the device North and South would have the most pronounced
      juddering or washboard effect. However, going crossways to N_S may
      also have weird effects, the flux lines moving at right angles to
      one another. I would tend to say this might be even more
      pronounced when a big load is put on the output coil, if my above
      assumption is correct with the inner ADDITIVE flux under load.<br>
      <br>
      16. It makes sense that if we are moving a relatively weak
      magnetic field at very high RPM or lap rate, then perhaps we are
      now also talking about a gravitic interaction. Since it appears
      that gravity and spinning superconducting magnets are related, and
      we are spinning this field at a VERY high rate, then the
      orientation on startup is most likely also directly interacting
      with "gravitons?" I won't go there, as I know too little about the
      field.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that gravity is directional, be it
      into the earth or into space from the earth's center. Either way
      it is directional. Inverting the toroid MAY then be affected in
      operation or stopped when it is inverted. Has Steven Mark solved
      this? It sounds SOOOOO interesting. And naturally, with smaller
      toroids, he is also talking about higher angular acceleration of
      the field, due to the smaller diameter. Maybe this also has a
      bearing on the trait?<br>
      <br>
      17. The imploding television story is very interesting. Could
      Mark's device be close to tapping into or creating such a powerful
      magnetic vortex? Has he seen any evidence of magnetic attraction
      of any objects in or near the toroids?<br>

      <br>
      Dear Steven,<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for dinner the other night. I truly enjoyed the
      experience and the ride home together.&nbsp; Thank you for sharing
      your thoughts.&nbsp; When you get to be my age Stephen you have
      learned how not to ruffle feathers. If I were in your shoes I
      would do exactly what we discussed.&nbsp; I have talked to my
      associate about the problems as you see it involving the heat
      created by your unit when generating power. He is willing to
      assist us in finding a solution and he does not feel it is an
      insurmountable problem.<br>
      <br>
      The current involved no matter how slight must be a contributing
      factor, regardless. We must first consider all the working
      principles and decide how to go about solving the problem.&nbsp; I
      look forward to seeing you and your unit at my laboratory around
      eight thirty on Saturday morning.&nbsp; I will have only one
      observer and we will be otherwise alone.&nbsp; I promise you that
      we will give an honest evaluation of everything we observe and
      will attest to what we find.<br>
      <br>
      If you need to talk to me first you may leave a message for me at
      my office at the University of California Irvine.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      Roland Schinzinger, PhD.<br>

      786-7691.&nbsp; Second report on Energy Device<br>
      <br>
      At the request of Steven Mark I agreed to thoroughly test his
      invention of an energy device toroid at my laboratory at the UCI
      campus.&nbsp; With me was John Sanchez who will act as an observer
      and Mr. Mark who will operate his device for the tests.<br>
      <br>
      The device is reported to develop measurable amounts of electric
      power beyond any known battery or storage device. In fact the
      inventor claims that his device will create electric power
      indefinitely as long as it is permitted to cool at intervals.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Mark arrived promptly at 8:30 AM and wasted no time in
      permitting my examination of two units.&nbsp; The first unit was
      roughly shaped like a large donut. It measured approximately 4.72”
      across with an inside diameter hole of 3” making a core width
      approximately 1” thick The unit was exactly 2” tall, resembling a
      toroid. I did not measure the weight however the unit was
      extremely light when held in the hand.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Mark connected the unit directly to a 100 watt 120 volt
      incandescent light bulb and caused the unit to operate. It did in
      fact illuminate the incandescent bulb quite brightly. I measured
      the voltage at 137 volts D.C. exactly, (ObS). See note*&nbsp; I
      then measured the current flowing through the wires to the bulb at
      a steady one-ampere, (ObS).&nbsp; We noted the time at 9:06
      AM.,(ObS).&nbsp; We next measured the light output from the bulb
      with a luminescence meter and noted that it read2.5, (ObS). Next
      we measured a similar incandescent bulb placed in a socket powered
      from the main 120 volt (as measured) AC power provided to the
      laboratory. It measured 2.4 on the luminescence meter. This can
      probably be accounted for because the voltage as measured from the
      Toroid device is 137 volts and therefore 12 volts greater,
      generating a slight increase in light output over the incandescent
      light powered by the laboratory main power supply system.&nbsp;
      The toroid device did indeed provide the standard voltage and
      current necessary to provide electric lighting for a 120-volt
      circuit.&nbsp; The inventor then asked us for another bulb, which
      we provided him and he set about connecting the second bulb along
      with the first.&nbsp; The second bulb was connected in parallel to
      the first and did indeed light just as brightly as the<br>
      first.<br>
      <br>
      I measured 137 volts now across the output just as before although
      the load had doubled and the impedance halved (ObS).&nbsp; I
      measured the current flowing to the two bulbs at just less then
      2-amperes, (ObS).<br>
      <br>
      The inventor stated that the unit would provide two amperes at 137
      volts for several hours, if not indefinitely. We were cautioned
      that the unit while in operation would generate heat leading to
      self-destruction if not shut down and permitted to cool. He
      claimed that after cooling the unit could be restarted and used
      again over and over.<br>
      <br>
      We permitted the first unit to remain in operation and provide
      power for the two incandescent bulbs while we turned our attention
      to the second larger unit the inventor brought with him for
      testing.&nbsp; The second unit was again toroid shaped with a
      large hole in the center. It was approximately 15” at the outside
      and 13” inside with a core thickness of approximately 1”. The unit
      was 4” tall. The unit was not measured in weight but could be
      easily lifted with one hand, (ObS).&nbsp; The inventor started the
      second larger unit in operation and cautioned myself and Mr.
      Sanchez not to touch the output leads from the device as they were
      at lethal potential. The time was 9:39 AM.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor measured the output leads and told us there was 600
      volts potential at several amperes.&nbsp; He connected the unit to
      five 120 volt 100 watt incandescent light bulbs as provided by
      myself.&nbsp; The larger second unit did indeed brightly light the
      five incandescent bulbs brightly. These bulbs were wired in
      series.<br>
      <br>
      I measured the current through the wire connected to the 5-bulbs
      at 1.1 ampere, (ObS). I measured the voltage at 614 volts D.C.,
      (ObS).&nbsp; The inventor then connected another five 120 volt
      light bulbs along with the first five making a total of ten 120
      volt, 100 watt incandescent light bulbs lighting at equal
      intensity.&nbsp; I measured the light output with a luminescence
      meter at 2.43 each light bulb, (ObS). I did not measure the
      current but calculated it to be 2 amperes at 614 volts.&nbsp; I
      asked the inventor if this was the limit of the unit and he
      replied, “no way.”<br>
      <br>
      He provided a quick blow fuse rated at 50 amperes.&nbsp; With two
      large electrical clamps and wiring, he shorted the fuse across the
      output terminals of the toroid and destroyed the fuse, (ObS).
      There was only a slight flickering of the ten incandescent bulbs
      as observed although there was a tremendous discharge of sparks
      from the output terminals of the toroid unit.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor then gave me the fuse for examination. It was warm to
      the touch and smelled acrid, (ObS). It was a large 240 volt AC air
      conditioner disconnect fuse and designed for severe service duty,
      (OsS).&nbsp; The inventor’s claim that the large toroid output
      terminals were at lethal potential was no longer in question.<br>
      <br>
      The time was 11:20 AM when the inventor removed the small toroid
      unit from operation because of heat build up.&nbsp; I examined the
      small toroid unit and it was indeed quite hot to the touch.&nbsp;
      The unit had been in steady operation for exactly two hours and
      fourteen minutes. Noted: 2- hours and 14 minutes, (ObS).&nbsp; The
      load of 2- amperes at 137-volts did not change through the test
      period.<b><br>

      A little background on who I am and why I remained silent for over
      a decade.<br>
      <br>
      I have been an avid inventor and product developer since I was a
      kid. I was drawing detailed engines and mechanisms by age 9 and
      just had a knack for looking at a product and finding faults in
      the design. In school I spent all my time drawing machines and
      basic circuits. I worked on my first patent in High school and it
      issued in 1977. Since then I have developed over 200 products that
      cover several industries. I currently hold 21 patents that have
      issued or are pending published applications. As a product
      developer I have prepared dozens of patents for clients and read
      thousands of patents during searches over a quarter century now. I
      have seen it all when it comes to technology and I have an open
      mind which is rare in my field. I have designed and worked on
      alternative health devices like the RIFE machines and even worked
      with Barry Lynes the author of "The Cancer cure that worked". I
      designed the world's first Brainwave analyzer to measure
      correlates of I.Q. with Dr. John Ertl a brilliant PhD in
      Cybernetics. I am putting this out there to say that I have always
      entered into any design or design evaluation task with eyes wide
      open and no preconceptions.<br>
      <br>
      The reason why I didn't come forward sooner was due to an NDA
      [Non-Disclosure Agreement] I signed back in '96. As one who makes
      a living working with invention, patents and is a caretaker of
      others intellectual property, I have to be very careful in
      discussing anything of a sensitive nature. Although all NDA's have
      to expire by a certain date, I waited an extra 8 years just in
      case Steven ever surfaced again.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen several so called free energy devices, and all without
      exception were failures. Not all were fraudulent. Some were just
      not well understood by their creators as not meeting the
      requirements of producing over unity power or work.<br>
      <br>
      When I was approached by M.M. to work with Steven Marks, I wasn't
      overly excited after years of seeing these all crash and burn, but
      I was again all ears. When I saw the devices work and was able to
      rotate the units 90 degrees without loss of output power, I felt a
      chill go over me like seeing a ghost. You see I know Tesla's works
      as he is one of my heroes like Edison and others. I fully
      understood the impact of being able to rotate the device without
      performance depredation. The gyroscopic sensation felt when moving
      the device made it clear to me instantly that the coils displaced
      about the perimeter of the device were switching in a quadrature
      fashion like stators in a motor yet there were no mechanical
      devices in the unit. It became clear that there was a lot of
      current flowing from winding to winding.<br>
      <br>
      The device worked and the video is real. It was shot at a mansion
      that Steven rented in Lemon Heights California. Steven's face does
      not appear in the first videos but I did notice that he does
      appear in the one on youtube that shows potential investors. He
      always wore an all black suit and shoes even when doing basic lab
      work. It was part of the facade.<br>
      <br>
      The sad thing is that Steven was a bit of a hustler. He received
      millions from several investors, and never delivered the end
      product. Steven spent wildly on a lavish lifestyle. The seemingly
      sophisticated test equipment one sees in the videos was in fact a
      collection of audio and video gear. It was all purchased for audio
      development on Steven's so called 3D audio theater system that was
      shown at CES in 1996 or 97.<br>
      <br>
      I have no doubt that Steven was not the true inventor of this
      device, as he was not technically savvy enough for such a feat.
      His only technical background was working on televisions and cars.
      He claimed to be an expert in Rolls Royce repair and he did own an
      older model but it wasn't anything outstanding.<br>
      <br>
      I met Steven in 1996 when my company was hired by Mercury Marilla,
      Steven's boyfriend at the time, to replicate the device's
      capabilities by any means possible. At first I thought he was
      trying to find out if there was another quick way to produce the
      same result with an alternative approach, but I later realized he
      was likely looking for a second design that he could pawn off on
      investors so he could retain the original design.<br>
      <br>
      There were many, many investors pouring in money like there was no
      tomorrow in the hopes of getting their hands on what appeared to
      be the holy grail of free energy.<br>
      <br>
      There was a reason beyond the endless supply of investment dollars
      that kept the technology from ever being delivered, and that was
      the fact that the device only ran for so long before it shut down
      due to overheating, which averaged 20 minutes or so after it was
      activated. He was very frustrated with the thermal issues, but
      every time I came up with a solution he would say he would check
      it out, but nothing ever came of the remedies. He would never
      allow me to take the unit apart or do any dissecting at all. The
      design was quite simple. There were two sets of windings arranged
      in a fashion that very closely resemble the Tesla patent 381,970
      circa 1888. There were two large chokes and polypropylene caps
      that appeared to be an output smoothing function. My Instincts
      told me that the choke and cap pair was a tuned tank, but knowing
      how little electronics knowledge Steven had, I could not see him
      being capable of doing any tank tuning, and there was no grid dip
      gear around. I'll be releasing more information as I get time.<br>
      <br>
      Oh one little side note among many in this interesting moment in
      time was Steven’s use of a magnet to activate the device. This was
      just a ruse. The magnet, a cheap Radio Shack magnet at that was
      deployed only as a means of closing a simple Reed switch that
      closed the primary circuit. Steven thought this would throw off
      those who viewed live demos, as he was well aware that many
      potential investors were bringing their top engineers with them.<br>
      <br>
      I am thinking about writing a screenplay on this, as there is
      much, much more to the story, including sex, crimes and
      misdemeanors. I have been sitting on this story for over a decade
      now. <br>

      This was part of an email of 20 March 08, between myself and one
      of the respected elders in the movement to reproduce the SM
      Device. This email is redacted and only shows one question of many
      and my position on Steven Mark to clarify my motives in this
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; "I think that you offered some sound inspiration but i &gt;
      did not see how knocking him technically helps as &gt; there may
      come a time when he will be more forth &gt; coming"<br>
      <br>
      Let’s examine this situation.<br>
      <br>
      1. If there ever was a man deserving of some knocking it is Steven
      Mark. I understand that you guys are walking on egg shells with
      this guy with the hopes that he will someday reveal the final
      formula; but there is little reason to believe beyond hope and
      despair that he ever will reveal the final answer.<br>
      <br>
      2. Megalomaniacs like Steven need an audience to feed their
      narcissistic appetite. To give anyone the final keys to making the
      device work would be cutting the umbilical cord to his adoring
      fans. All he could gain from such an act is a thank you. Remember,
      Steven knows how to make these already. If he wanted to help you
      or anyone else he could have without hesitation long ago.<br>
      <br>
      3. There are several others doing this and are well beyond where
      Steven is. Once he realizes this watch how quickly he comes
      forward to help when his obsolescence becomes a self realization
      and his fan base loses interest.<br>
      <br>
      The reason I came forth yesterday was to tell the truth about what
      I experienced while working with Steven Mark. Contrary to some of
      the less than friendly posts regarding my inability to shed any
      light any light on the technology beyond what is already known, I
      never represented that I possessed or would reveal anything of a
      technical nature that would further any development underway. If I
      had I certainly would have finished the device myself.<br>
      <br>
      What was a payoff? None for myself. Most of the feedback I
      received publicly was negative. The only payoff I can hope for is
      that if a guy like Steven Mark, a hustler and tinkerer with less
      than extraordinary intellect was able to reproduce this free
      energy device there is hope for others to replicate this device
      also as many others have to date.<br>
      <br>
      I apologize for offending those who are still drinking the Steven
      Mark Koolaid but I don’t think most of you know of or appreciate
      the trail of shattered dreams and victims left in this mans’ wake.<br>
      <br>
      All the Best,<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      A solid-state electrical generator including at least one
      permanent magnet, magnetically coupled to a ferromagnetic core
      provided with at least one hole penetrating its volume; the
      hole(s) and magnet(s) being placed such that the hole(s)
      penetrating the ferromagnetic core's volume intercept flux from
      the permanent magnet(s) coupled into the ferromagnetic core. A
      first wire coil is wound around the ferromagnetic core for the
      purpose of moving the coupled permanent magnet flux within the
      ferromagnetic core. A second wire is routed through the hole(s)
      penetrating the volume of the ferromagnetic core, for the purpose
      of intercepting this moving magnetic flux, thereby inducing an
      output electromotive force.; A changing voltage applied to the
      first wire coil causes coupled permanent magnet flux to move
      within the core relative to the hole(s) penetrating the core
      volume, thus inducing electromotive force along wire(s) passing
      through the hole(s) in the ferromagnetic core. The mechanical
      action of an electrical generator is thereby synthesized without
      use of moving parts.<br>

      [0001] This application claims priority to Provisional Application
      60/645,674 filed Jan. 21, 2005, entitled PERMANENT MAGNET DRIVEN
      ELECTRIC GENERATOR.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] This invention relates to a method and device for
      generating electrical power using solid state means.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] It has long been known that moving a magnetic field across
      a wire will generate an electromotive force (EMF), or voltage,
      along the wire. When this wire is connected in an electrical
      closed circuit, in order to perform work, an electric current is
      driven through this closed circuit by the induced electromotive
      force.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It has also long been known that this resulting electric
      current causes the closed circuit to become encircled with a
      secondary, induced magnetic field, whose polarity opposes the
      primary magnetic field that first induced the EMF. This magnetic
      opposition creates mutual repulsion as a moving magnet moves
      toward such a closed circuit and attraction as that moving magnet
      then moves away from the closed circuit. Both these actions tend
      to slow, or "drag" the progress of the moving magnet generating
      the EMF, causing the electric generator to act as a magnetic
      brake, in direct proportion to the amount of electric current
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Gas engines, hydroelectric dams and steam-fed turbines have
      historically been used to overcome this magnetic braking action
      occurring within mechanical electric generators. A large amount of
      mechanical power is ultimately required to produce a large amount
      of electrical power, since the magnetic braking interaction
      resulting from induced electrical current is generally
      proportional to the amount of power being generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] There has been a long felt need for a generator which
      reduces or eliminates this well-known magnetic braking
      interaction, while nevertheless generating useful electric power.
      The need for convenient, economical, and powerful sources of
      renewable energy remains urgent. When the magnetic fields within a
      generator are caused to move and interact by means other than
      applied mechanical force, electric power can be supplied without
      the necessity of consuming limited natural resources, thus with
      far greater economy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] It has long been known that the source of the magnetism
      within a permanent magnet is a spinning electric current within
      ferromagnetic atoms of certain elements, persisting indefinitely
      in accord with well-defined quantum rules. This atomic current
      encircles each atom, thereby causing each atom to emit a magnetic
      field, as a miniature electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] This atomic current does not exist in magnets alone. It
      also exists in ordinary metallic iron, and in any element or
      metallic alloy that can be "magnetized", that is, exhibits
      ferromagnetism. All ferromagnetic atoms and "magnetic metals"
      contain such quantum atomic electromagnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In specific ferromagnetic materials, the orientation axis
      of each atomic electromagnet is flexible. The orientation of
      magnetic flux within, as well as external to the material, easily
      pivots. Such materials are referred to as magnetically "soft", due
      to this magnetic flexibility.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Permanent magnet materials are magnetically "hard". The
      orientation axis of each atomic electromagnet is fixed in place
      within a rigid crystal structure. The total magnetic field
      produced by these atoms cannot easily move. This constraint
      permanently aligns the field of ordinary magnets, hence the name
      "permanent".<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The axis of circular current flow in one ferromagnetic atom
      can direct the axis of magnetism within another ferromagnetic
      atom, through a process known as spin exchange. This gives a soft
      magnetic material, like raw iron, the useful ability to aim,
      focus, and redirect the magnetic field emitted from a magnetically
      hard permanent magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In the present invention, a permanent magnet's rigid field
      is sent into a magnetically flexible, "soft" magnetic material.
      The permanent magnet's apparent location, observed from points
      within the magnetically soft material, will effectively move,
      vibrate, and appear to shift position when the magnetization of
      the soft magnetic material is modulated by ancillary means (much
      like the sun, viewed while underwater, appears to move when the
      water is agitated). By this mechanism, the motion required for
      generation of electricity can be synthesized within a soft
      ferromagnetic material, without requiring physical movement or an
      applied mechanical force.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The present invention synthesizes virtual motion of magnets
      and their magnetic fields, producing an electrical generator
      described herein, which does not require mechanical action or
      moving parts. The present invention describes an electrical
      generator wherein magnetic braking phenomena, known as expressions
      of Lenz's Law, do not oppose the means by which the magnetic field
      energy is caused to move. The synthesized magnetic motion thereby
      manifests without mechanical or electrical resistance. This
      synthesized magnetic motion is aided by forces generated in
      accordance with Lenz's Law, in order to produce acceleration of
      the synthesized magnetic motion, instead of physical "magnetic
      braking" common to mechanically-actuated electrical generators.
      Because of this novel magnetic interaction, the solid-state static
      generator of the present invention is a robust generator,
      requiring only a small electric force to operate.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] FIG. 1 depicts a partially exploded view of an embodiment
      of an electric generator of this invention. The parts have been
      numbered, with the numbering convention applied to FIGS. 1, 2, and
      3.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Numeral 1 represents a permanent magnet with its North pole
      pointing inward toward the soft ferromagnetic core of the device.
      Similarly, numeral 2 indicates permanent magnets of preferably the
      same shape and composition, with their South poles aimed inward
      toward the opposite side, or opposite surface of the device. The
      letters "S" and "N" denote these respective magnetic poles in the
      drawing. Other magnetic polarities and configurations may be used
      with success; the pattern shown merely illustrative of one
      efficient mode of adding magnets to the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The magnets may be formed of any polarized magnetic
      material. In order of descending effectiveness, the most desirable
      permanent-magnet materials are Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NIB) magnets,
      Samarium Cobalt magnets, AlNiCo alloy magnets, or "ceramic"
      strontium-, barium- or lead-ferrite magnets. A primary factor
      determining permanent magnet material composition is the magnetic
      flux strength of the particular material type. In an embodiment of
      the invention, these magnets may also be substituted with one or
      more electromagnets producing the required magnetic flux. In
      another embodiment of the invention, a superimposed DC current
      bias can be applied to the output wire to generate the required
      magnetic flux, in substitution of, or in conjunction with said
      permanent magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Numeral 3 indicates the magnetic core. This core is a
      critical member of the generator, determining the characteristics
      of output power capacity, optimal magnet type, electrical
      impedance, and operating frequency range. This core may be any
      shape, composed of any ferromagnetic substance, formed by any
      process (sintering, casting, adhesive bonding, tape winding, etc).
      A wide spectrum of geometries, materials, and processes are known
      in the art of magnetic cores. Effective common materials include,
      but are not limited to, amorphous metal alloys (such as that sold
      under the trademark designation "Metglas" by Metglas Inc., Conway
      S.C.), nanocrystalline alloys, manganese and zinc ferrites as well
      as ferrites of any suitable element including any combination of
      magnetically "hard" and "soft" ferrites, powdered metals and
      ferromagnetic alloys, laminations of cobalt and/or iron, and
      silicon-iron "electrical steel". This invention successfully
      utilizes any ferromagnetic material, while functioning as claimed.
      In an embodiment of the invention, and for the purpose of
      illustration, a circular "toroid" core is illustrated. In an
      embodiment of the invention, the composition may be bonded iron
      powder, commonly available from many manufacturers.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Regardless of core type, the core is prepared with holes,
      through which wires may pass, which have been drilled or formed to
      penetrate the core's ferromagnetic volume. The toroidal core 3
      shown includes radial holes pointing toward a common center. If,
      for example stiff wire rods were to be inserted through each of
      these holes, these wires would meet at the center point of the
      core, producing an appearance similar to a spoke wheel. If a
      square or rectangular core (not illustrated) is used instead,
      these holes are preferably oriented parallel to the core's flat
      sides, causing stiff rods passed through the holes to form a
      square grid pattern, as the rods cross each other in the interior
      "window" area framed by the core. While in other embodiments of
      the invention, these holes may take any possible orientation or
      patterns of orientation within the scope of the present generator,
      a simple row of radial holes is illustrated herein as one example.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Numeral 4 depicts a wire or bundle of wires, i.e. output
      wire 4, that pick-up and carry the generator's output power.
      Typically this wire is composed of insulated copper, though other
      output mediums such as aluminum, iron, dielectric material,
      polymers, and semiconducting materials may be substituted. It may
      be seen in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 that wire 4, which serves as an
      output medium, passes alternately through neighboring holes formed
      in core 3. The path taken by wire 4 undulates, passing in an
      opposite direction through each adjacent hole. If an even number
      of holes is used, the wire will emerge on the same side of the
      core it first entered on, once all holes are filled. The resulting
      pair of trailing leads may be twisted together or similarly
      terminated, forming the output terminals of the generator shown at
      Numeral 5. Output wire 4 may also make multiple passes through
      each hole in the core. Though the winding pattern is not
      necessarily undulatory; this basic form is shown by way of
      example. Many effective connection styles exist; this illustration
      shows the simplest. All successful connection methods pass wire 4
      at some point through the holes in the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Numeral 6 in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 points to a partial
      illustration of the input winding, or inductive coil used to shift
      the permanent magnets' fields within the core. Typically, this
      wire coil encircles the core, wrapping around it. For the toroidal
      core presented, input coil 6 resembles the outer windings of a
      typical toroidal inductor, a common electrical component. For the
      sake of clarity, only a few turns of coil 6 are shown in each of
      drawing FIGS. 1, 2, and 3. In practice, this coil may cover the
      entire core, or specific sections of the core, including or not
      including the magnets, while remaining within scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIG. 2 shows the same representative generator of FIG. 1,
      looking transparently "down" through it from above, so the
      relative positions of the core holes (dotted lines), the path of
      the output wire, and magnet positions (as shaded areas) are made
      clear.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The generator shown uses a core with 8 radially drilled
      holes. The spacing between these illustrative holes is equal. As
      shown, each hole is displaced 45 degrees from the next. All holes'
      centers lay along a common plane; this imaginary plane is centered
      half-way along the core's vertical thickness. Cores of any shape
      and size may include as few as two, or as many as hundreds of
      holes, and a similar number of magnets. Other variations exist,
      such as generators with multiple rows of holes, zigzag and
      diagonal patterns, or output wire 4 molded directly into the core
      material. In any case, the basic magnetic interaction shown in
      FIG. 3 occurs for each hole in the core, as detailed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIG. 3 shows the same design, viewed broadside. The
      curvature of the core has been flattened to the page for the
      purpose of illustration. The magnets are represented
      schematically, protruding from core top and bottom, with arrows
      indicating the direction of magnetic flux-arrow heads pointing
      north, tails south.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In practice, the free, unattached polar ends of the
      generator's magnets may be left as-is, in open air, or provided
      with a common ferromagnetic path linking unused North and South
      poles together, as a magnetic "ground". This common return path is
      typically made of steel, iron or similar material, taking the form
      of a ferrous enclosure housing the device. It may serve the
      additional purpose of a protecting chassis. The magnetic return
      may also be another ferromagnetic core in repetition of the
      present invention, forming a stack or layered series of
      generators, sharing common magnets between generator cores. Any
      such additions are without direct bearing on the functional
      principle of the generator itself, and have therefore been omitted
      from these illustrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Two example flux diagrams are given in FIG. 3. Each example
      is shown in a space between schematically depicted partial input
      coils 6. A positive or negative polarity marker indicates the
      direction of input current, applied through the input coil. This
      applied current produces "modulating" magnetic flux, which is used
      to synthesize motion of the permanent magnets, and is shown as a
      double-tailed horizontal arrow (a) along the core 3. Each example
      shows this double-tailed arrow (a) pointing to the right or the
      left depending on the polarity of applied current.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In either case, vertical flux entering the core (b, 3) from
      the external permanent magnets (1, 2) is swept along, within the
      core, by the direction of the double-tailed arrow representing the
      input coil's magnetic flux (a). These curved arrows (b) in the
      space between the magnets and holes can be seen to shift or bend
      (a-&gt;b), as if they were streams or jets of air subject to a
      changing wind (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The resulting sweeping motion of the permanent magnets'
      fields causes their flux (b) to brush back and forth over the
      holes and wire 4 passing through these holes. Just as in a
      mechanical generator, when magnetic flux brushes or "cuts"
      sideways across a conductor in this way, EMF or voltage is
      induced. By connecting an electrical load across the ends of this
      wire conductor (Numeral 5, in FIGS. 1, 2) a current is allowed to
      flow through the load in a closed circuit, delivering electrical
      power able to perform work. Input of an alternating current across
      the input coil 6 generates an alternating magnetic field (a)
      causing the fields of permanent magnets 1, and 2 to shift (b)
      within the core 3, inducing electrical power through a load
      (attached to terminals 5), as if the fixed magnets (1,2)
      themselves were physically moving. However, no mechanical motion
      is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In a mechanical generator, induced current powering an
      electrical load returns back through output wire 4 creating a
      secondary induced magnetic field, exerting forces which
      substantially oppose the original magnetic field inducing the
      original EMF. Since load currents induce their own, secondary
      magnetic fields opposing the original act of induction in this
      way, the source of the original induction requires additional
      energy to restore itself and continue generating electricity. In
      mechanical generators, the energy-inducing motion of the
      generator's magnetic fields is being physically actuated,
      requiring a strong prime mover (such as a steam turbine) to
      restore the EMF-generating magnetic fields' motion, against the
      braking effect of the output-induced magnetic fields (the induced
      field (c), and the inducing field (b)), destructively in mutual
      opposition. It is this inductive opposition which ultimately must
      be overcome by physical force, which is commonly produced by
      consumption of other energy resources.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The electric generator of the present invention is not
      actuated by mechanical force. The generator of the present
      invention also makes use of the induced, secondary magnetic field
      in such a way as to not cause opposition, but instead addition,
      and resulting acceleration of magnetic field motion. Because the
      present invention is not mechanically actuated, and because the
      magnetic fields do not act to destroy one another in mutual
      opposition, the present invention does not require consumption of
      natural resources in order to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The present generator's induced magnetic field, resulting
      from electric current flowing through the load and returning
      through output wire 4, is that of a closed loop encircling each
      hole in the core admitting the output conductor or conductive
      medium (4, c). The present generator's induced magnetic fields
      create magnetic flux in the form of closed loops within the
      ferromagnetic core. The magnetic field "encircles" each hole in
      the core carrying output wire 4, similar to the threads of a screw
      "encircling" the shaft of the screw.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Within this generator, the magnetic field from output
      medium or wire 4 immediately encircles each hole formed in the
      core (c) carrying this medium or wire 4. Since wire 4 may take an
      opposing direction through each neighboring hole, the direction of
      the resulting magnetic field will likewise be opposite. The
      directions of arrows (b) and (c) are, at each hole, opposing,
      headed in opposite directions, since (b) is the inducing flux and
      (c) is the induced flux, each opposing one another while
      generating electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] However, this magnetic opposition is effectively directed
      against the permanent magnets that are injecting their flux into
      the core, but not the source of the alternating magnetic input
      field 6. In the present solid state generator, induced output flux
      (4, c) is directed to oppose the permanent magnets (1, 2) not the
      input flux source (6, a) that is synthesizing the virtual motion
      of those magnets (1, 2) by its magnetizing action on core 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The present generator employs magnets as the source of
      motive pressure driving the generator, since they are the entity
      being opposed or "pushed against" by the opposing reaction induced
      by output current which is powering a load. Experiments show that
      high-quality permanent magnets can be magnetically "pushed
      against" in this way for very long periods of time, before
      becoming demagnetized or "spent".<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 3 illustrates inducing representative flux arrows (b)
      directed oppositely against induced representative flux (c). In
      materials typically used to form core 3, fields flowing in
      mutually opposite directions tend to cancel each other, just as
      positive and negative numbers of equal magnitude sum to zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] On the remaining side of each hole, opposite the permanent
      magnet, no mutual opposition takes place. Induced flux (c) caused
      by the generator load currents remains present; however, inducing
      flux from the permanent magnets (b) is not present since no magnet
      is present, on this side, to source the necessary flux. This
      leaves the induced flux (c) encircling the hole, as well as input
      flux (a) from the input coils 6, continuing its path along the
      core, on either side of each hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] On the side of each core hole where a magnet is present,
      action (b) and reaction (c) magnetic flux substantially cancel and
      annihilate, being oppositely directed within the core. On the
      other side of each hole, where no magnet is present, input flux
      (a) and reaction flux (c) share a common direction. Magnetic flux
      thereby adds together in these zones, where induced magnetic flux
      (c) aids the input flux (a). This is the reverse of typical
      generator action, where induced flux (c) is typically opposing the
      "input" flux originating the induction.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Since the magnetic interaction herein is a combination of
      magnetic flux opposition and magnetic flux acceleration, there is
      no longer an overall magnetic braking, or total opposition effect.
      The braking and opposition is counterbalanced by a simultaneous
      magnetic acceleration within the core. Since mechanical motion is
      absent, the equivalent electrical effect ranges from idling, or
      absence of opposition, to a strengthening and overall acceleration
      of the electrical input signal (within coils 6). Proper selection
      of the permanent magnet (1, 2) material and flux density, core 3
      material magnetic characteristics, core hole pattern and spacing,
      and output medium connection technique create embodiments wherein
      the present generator will display an absence of electrical
      loading at the input and/or an overall amplification of the input
      signal. This ultimately causes less input energy to be required in
      order to work the generator. Therefore, as increasing amounts of
      energy are withdrawn from the generator as output power performing
      useful work, decreasing amounts of energy are generally required
      to operate it. This process endures, working against the permanent
      magnets (1, 2) until they are demagnetized.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In an embodiment of this invention, FIG. 4 illustrates a
      typical operating circuit employing the generator of this
      invention. A square-wave input signal, furnished by appropriate
      transistorized switching means, is applied at the input terminals
      (S), to the primary (a) of a step-down transformer 11. The
      secondary winding (b) of the input transformer may be a single
      turn, in series with a capacitor 12 and the generator 13 input
      coil (c), forming a series resonant circuit. The frequency of the
      applied square wave (S) must either match, or be an integral
      sub-harmonic of the resonant frequency of this 3-element
      transformer-capacitor-inductor input circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Generator 13 output winding (d) is connected to resistive
      load L through switch 14. When switch 14 is closed, generated
      power is dissipated at L, which is any resistive load, for
      example, an incandescent lamp or resistive heater.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Once input resonance is achieved, and the square wave input
      frequency applied at S is such that the combined reactive
      impedance of total inductance (b+c) is equal in magnitude to the
      opposing reactive impedance of capacitance 12, the electrical
      phases of current through, and voltage across, generator 13 input
      coil (c) will flow 90 degrees apart in resonant quadrature. Power
      drawn from the square wave input-energy source applying power to S
      will now be at a minimum.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In this condition, the resonant energy present at the
      generator input may be measured by connecting a voltage probe
      across the test points (v), situated across the generator input
      coil, together with a current probe around point (i), situated in
      series with the generator input coil (c). The instantaneous vector
      product of these two measurements indicates the energy circulating
      at the generator's input, ultimately shifting the permanent
      magnets' fields in order to create useful induction. This
      situation persists until the magnets are no longer magnetized.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a
      square (or other) wave may be applied directly to the generator
      input terminals (c) without use of other components. While this
      remains effective, advantageous re-generating effects may not be
      realized to their fullest extent with such direct excitation. Use
      of a resonant circuit, particularly with inclusion of a capacitor
      12 as suggested, facilitates recirculation of energy within the
      input circuit, generally producing efficient excitation and a
      reduction of required input power as loads are applied.<br>
