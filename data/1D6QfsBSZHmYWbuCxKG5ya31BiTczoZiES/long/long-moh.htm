      Hydrogen would command a key role in future renewable energy
      technologies, experts agree, if a relatively cheap, efficient and
      carbon-neutral means of producing it can be developed. An
      important step towards this elusive goal has been taken by a team
      of researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Lawrence
      Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the University of
      California, Berkeley. The team has discovered an inexpensive metal
      catalyst that can effectively generate hydrogen gas from water.<br>
      <br>
      "Our new proton reduction catalyst is based on a molybdenum-oxo
      metal complex that is about 70 times cheaper than platinum,
      today's most widely used metal catalyst for splitting the water
      molecule," said Hemamala Karunadasa, one of the co-discoverers of
      this complex. "In addition, our catalyst does not require organic
      additives, and can operate in neutral water, even if it is dirty,
      and can operate in sea water, the most abundant source of hydrogen
      on earth and a natural electrolyte. These qualities make our
      catalyst ideal for renewable energy and sustainable chemistry."<br>
      <br>
      Karunadasa holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Chemical
      Sciences Division and UC Berkeley's Chemistry Department. She is
      the lead author of a paper describing this work that appears in
      the April 29, 2010 issue of the journal Nature, titled "A
      molecular molybdenum-oxo catalyst for generating hydrogen from
      water." Co-authors of this paper were Christopher Chang and
      Jeffrey Long, who also hold joint appointments with Berkeley Lab
      and UC Berkeley. Chang, in addition, is also an investigator with
      the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen gas, whether combusted or used in fuel cells to generate
      electricity, emits only water vapor as an exhaust product, which
      is why this nation would already be rolling towards a hydrogen
      economy if only there were hydrogen wells to tap. However,
      hydrogen gas does not occur naturally and has to be produced. Most
      of the hydrogen gas in the United States today comes from natural
      gas, a fossil fuel. While inexpensive, this technique adds huge
      volumes of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Hydrogen can also
      be produced through the electrolysis of water -- using electricity
      to split molecules of water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen.
      This is an environmentally clean and sustainable method of
      production -- especially if the electricity is generated via a
      renewable technology such as solar or wind -- but requires a
      water-splitting catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Nature has developed extremely efficient water-splitting enzymes
      -- called hydrogenases -- for use by plants during photosynthesis,
      however, these enzymes are highly unstable and easily deactivated
      when removed from their native environment. Human activities
      demand a stable metal catalyst that can operate under
      non-biological settings.<br>
      <br>
      Metal catalysts are commercially available, but they are low
      valence precious metals whose high costs make their widespread use
      prohibitive. For example, platinum, the best of them, costs some
      $2,000 an ounce.<br>
      <br>
      "The basic scientific challenge has been to create earth-abundant
      molecular systems that produce hydrogen from water with high
      catalytic activity and stability," Chang says. "We believe our
      discovery of a molecular molybdenum-oxo catalyst for generating
      hydrogen from water without the use of additional acids or organic
      co-solvents establishes a new chemical paradigm for creating
      reduction catalysts that are highly active and robust in aqueous
      media."<br>
      <br>
      The molybdenum-oxo complex that Karunadasa, Chang and Long
      discovered is a high valence metal with the chemical name of
      (PY5Me2)Mo-oxo. In their studies, the research team found that
      this complex catalyzes the generation of hydrogen from neutral
      buffered water or even sea water with a turnover frequency of 2.4
      moles of hydrogen per mole of catalyst per second.<br>
      <br>
      Long says, "This metal-oxo complex represents a distinct molecular
      motif for reduction catalysis that has high activity and stability
      in water. We are now focused on modifying the PY5Me ligand portion
      of the complex and investigating other metal complexes based on
      similar ligand platforms to further facilitate electrical
      charge-driven as well as light-driven catalytic processes. Our
      particular emphasis is on chemistry relevant to sustainable energy
      cycles."<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A growing awareness of issues
      related to anthropogenic climate change and an increase in global
      energy demand have made the search for viable carbon-neutral
      sources of renewable energy one of the most important challenges
      in science today. The chemical community is therefore seeking
      efficient and inexpensive catalysts that can produce large
      quantities of hydrogen gas from water. Here we identify a
      molybdenum-oxo complex that can catalytically generate gaseous
      hydrogen either from water at neutral pH or from sea water. This
      work shows that high-valency metal-oxo species can be used to
      create reduction catalysts that are robust and functional in
      water, a concept that has broad implications for the design of
      ‘green’ and sustainable chemistry cycles. <br>

      New metal persulfido compositions of matter are described. :In one
      embodiment the metal is molybdenum and the metal persulfido
      complex mimics the structure and function of the triangular active
      edge site fragments of MoS2, a material that is the current
      industry standard for petroleum hydro desulfurization, as well as
      a promising low-cost alternative to platinum for electrocatalytic
      hydrogen production. This molecular [(PY5W2)MoS2]x+ containing
      catalyst is capable of generating hydrogen from acidic-buffered
      water or even seawater at very low overpotentials at a turnover
      frequency rate in excess of 500 moles H2 per mole catalyst per
      second, with a turnover number (over a 20 hour period) of at least
      19,000,000 moles H2 per mole of catalyst.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0003] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] This invention relates generally to a new composition of
      matter and, more specifically, to a new high oxidation state
      metal-oxo catalyst which can be used for generating hydrogen from
      water, in one embodiment the high oxidation state metal being
      molybdenum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] 2. Brief Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] Owing to issues of climate change and accelerating global
      energy demands, the search for viable carbon-neutral sources of
      renewable energy is amongst the foremost challenges in science
      today. One such alternative is hydrogen, which can potentially be
      used as a clean replacement for fossil fuels in many applications,
      including transportation in cars, buses, trucks, trains, and
      airplanes. It can further be used in fuel cells for powering
      mobile devices such as lap-top computers and cell phones, as well
      as for meeting power requirements in buildings and industry. Many
      industries also use hydrogen as a reactant. One example is the
      Haber-Bosch process that produces ammonia, which currently relies
      on steam reforming of natural gas or liquefied petroleum for the
      production of hydrogen. This is expensive, environmentally
      unsustainable (based on finite resources of fossil fuel and
      produces carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, two major
      atmospheric pollutants) and necessitates removal of sulfur which
      deactivates the catalyst used for ammonia production. Hydrogen is
      also used as a reducing agent for metal ores, for the production
      of hydrochloric acid and as a hydrogenating agent for unsaturated
      fats and oils.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In this context, where hydrogen has emerged as an
      attractive candidate for a clean, sustainable fuel as well as a
      precursor to many essential compounds, an intense interest in
      creating artificial systems that utilize earth-abundant catalysts
      for efficient hydrogen production from water has developed. A
      major quest of this renewable energy research is the search for
      efficient catalysts for the production of hydrogen from water,
      which rely on cheap, earth-abundant elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Hydrogenase enzymes possessing earth-abundant iron and/or
      nickel cofactors have been found to catalytically evolve H2 from
      neutral aqueous solution at its thermodynamic potential, with
      turnover frequencies of 100-10,000 mol H2/mol catalyst per second.
      However, the large size and relative instability of these enzymes
      under aerobic, ambient conditions has led to the search for
      well-defined molecular complexes outside the biological milieu
      that can produce H2 from water. Although many examples of air- and
      moisture-sensitive synthetic iron-sulfur clusters have provided
      insight into hydrogenase structure and reactivity, they catalyze
      proton reduction from acids in organic solvents at fairly negative
      potentials of -0.9 to -1.8 V vs. SHE (the Standard Hydrogen
      Electrode). Metal complexes that evolve H2 at more positive
      potentials still require organic acids, additives, and/or
      solvents. As such, the creation of earth-abundant molecular
      systems that produce H2 from water with high catalytic activity
      and stability remains a significant basic scientific challenge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to one aspect of this invention a new chemical
      has been synthesized which achieves the goal of H2 generation
      through the discovery of a well-defined organo metal-oxo complex
      that catalytically generates hydrogen from water at neutral pH. In
      one embodiment, the organo metal-oxo complex is an organo
      molybdenum-oxo complex, which has been successfully used to
      generate hydrogen for at least 3 days, with a turnover frequency
      of 1.47 million mol H2/mol catalyst per hour and a turnover number
      of 105 million mol H2/mol catalyst. Moreover, this same molecular
      system was used to evolve H2 from seawater, the earth's most
      abundant source of protons. Thus, demonstrated herein is that a
      high-valent metal-oxo unit can be exploited to create reduction
      catalysts that are robust and functional in water, an approach
      that has broad implications for the design of green and
      sustainable chemistry cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The rates of hydrogen production using the organo metal-oxo
      catalysts are at least one to two orders of magnitude higher than
      other known molecular electro-catalysts that operate in
      organic/acidic media. In addition the catalysts of this invention
      are significantly cheaper than other solid state catalysts
      currently in use. In the case of molybdenum, for example, its cost
      is about 74 times lower than the cost of platinum, the current
      preferred catalyst for hydrogen production. Unlike solid-state
      catalysts such as platinum metal, the molecular catalyst of the
      type described has the further advantage that it is also amenable
      to structural tuning through ligand modification and metal
      substitution, which may further improve production efficiencies.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] The preferred embodiments are illustrated in the context of
      the use of a molybdenum-oxo catalyst for the generation of
      hydrogen. The skilled artisan will readily appreciate, however,
      that the materials and methods disclosed herein will have
      application to a number of variants of this composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It has been discovered that a certain class of molecules
      can be particularly useful as catalysts for the generation of
      hydrogen gas from water. More particularly, these molecules are
      salts wherein the positive moiety comprises a PY5 metal-oxo ion,
      and even more particularly where the metal of the PY5 metal-oxo
      ion is molybdenum. (As used herein, PY stands for pyridine and PY5
      indicates the presence of five pyridyl rings). The positively
      charged cations of the compositions of matter of this invention
      are described by the general formula [(PY5W2)MO]&lt;2+&gt;,
      wherein PY5W2 is (NC5XYZ)(NC5H4)4C2W2, M is a high oxidation state
      metal, and W, X, Y, and Z are selected from the group comprising
      H, R, a halide, CF3, or SiR3, where R is an alkyl or aryl group.
      The two accompanying negative ions (i.e. the counter anion) of the
      metal-oxo salt composition may be selected from any number of
      anions, including a halide such as Cl&lt;-&gt;, I&lt;-&gt;, or
      PF6&lt;-&gt;, CF3SO3&lt;-&gt;, and so forth. The exact composition
      of the negative moiety is not significant as the anion does not
      play a significant role in the water to hydrogen reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A three dimensional model of the high oxidation state
      metal-oxo ion of the composition of this invention is shown in
      FIG. 1. Therein, central to the molecule is a metal atom, which in
      the illustrated embodiment is molybdenum (Mo). The metal can also
      be one of the following transition metals of the periodic table,
      including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Tungsten. Directly
      bound to the metal atom is a single oxygen atom, as well as the
      five pyridyl rings. For the base (or axial) pyridyl ring, the
      hydrogen atoms at the, X, Y, and Z positions may be substituted
      with a halogen such as F, Cl, Br, and I or a group such as R, CF3
      or SiR3 where R=alkyl or aryl group. Furthermore, the
      substitutions at the X, Y and Z position may be the same or
      different. Finally, the group attached to the quaternary carbon at
      the position may be either hydrogen, methyl, a higher alkyl, or
      aryl group or any one of the halogen, CF3 or SiR3 groups listed
      above. These pentapyridine ligand complexes are semi rigid, and in
      their salt form easily dissolve in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It has been found that when placed in water, the
      molybdenum-oxo salt goes into solution to form the moiety
      [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;2+&gt;. The hydrogen forming reaction in one
      embodiment is electrolysis driven. Herein, to initiate the
      hydrogen forming reaction, a negative potential is applied to one
      of two electrodes positioned within the water bath containing an
      electrolyte such as sodium phosphate or potassium chloride. In an
      embodiment, the negative voltage is in the order of 1.0 V to 1.4 V
      versus the standard hydrogen electrode which at pH 7 corresponds
      to an overpotential of between 0.6 V to 1.0 V. [As used herein,
      Overpotential=(applied potential-E(pH 7)), where at pH 7E=-0.4 V.]
      Upon application of the voltage, the positive metal-oxo moiety
      migrates to the negative electrode where it picks up electrons.
      While not intending to be bound by any particular theory regarding
      the reaction sequence, it is speculated that the catalytic cycle
      depicted in FIG. 2 is representative of the sequence of steps that
      results in the conversion of water to hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] More particularly, the catalytic cycle of FIG. 2 depicts a
      possible pathway for the generation of hydrogen from water
      mediated by [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2. One-electron reduction of
      [(PY5Me2MoO]&lt;2+&gt; gives [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;1+&gt;, with the
      addition of a second electron providing a putative [(PY5Me2)MoO]
      species. This reduction weakens the Mo-O bond and enhances its
      nucleophilicity, enabling it to deprotonate nearby water molecules
      to afford the reactive intermediate [(PY5Me2)Mo(H2O)]&lt;2+&gt;
      and release two OH&lt;-&gt; anions. The reduced aquo complex in
      the present scheme then eliminates H2 to regenerate
      [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;2+&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Observations are consistent with the foregoing
      Mo&lt;II&gt;/Mo&lt;IV &gt;cycle. Under reductive catalytic
      conditions, controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) of solutions
      of green catalyst [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 initially turn dark yellow
      and within about 10 minutes change to a purple-brown color that is
      maintained for the remainder of the electrolysis. Once the
      potential is switched off, the solution quickly changes back to
      the dark yellow color. Chemical reduction of
      [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;2+&gt; using one equivalent of sodium
      naphthalenide results in a similar dark yellow solution displaying
      absorption bands at 226, 264, 452, 473, and 737 nm. These data,
      together with the reversibility of the first reduction wave in the
      cyclic voltammogram of [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 in water, suggest that
      the dark yellow complex is [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;1+&gt;. Reaction of
      [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 with two equivalent of sodium naphthalenide
      further affords a solution with a purple-brown color matching that
      observed after extended electrolysis. Moreover, upon exposure to
      air, electrolyzed solutions regenerate green
      [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;2+&gt;, as verified by electronic (UV-visible
      range radiation) and vibrational (infrared radiation)
      spectroscopy. It is therefore believed that a PY5Me2 complex of
      Mo&lt;II &gt;is responsible for the reductive cleavage of water to
      release H2 and OH&lt;-&gt; ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] A series of experiments were carried out for one member of
      the catalysts of this invention, the species of the embodiment
      being [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2. The particular reaction was carried out
      in deionized water. The results are illustrated in FIG. 3. More
      specifically, the data reported in FIG. 3 are electrochemical data
      for a 7.7 [mu]M solution of [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 in a 0.6 M
      phosphate buffer at pH 7. The cyclic voltammograms are for a
      solution with (the dark line), and without (the light line) the
      catalyst at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Plot B graphically depicts the
      data for charge buildup versus time at various overpotentials.
      Plot C shows turnover frequency (TOF) versus overpotential. The
      background solvent activity was subtracted from plots 3B and 3C
      [Overpotential=applied potential-E(pH7)].<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments were
      carried out in a double-compartment cell to assess the efficacy of
      the [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 catalyst. As shown in FIG. 3B, the amount
      of charge utilized in 2 min increases with increasing
      overpotential until a saturation value of 0.43 C is reached at
      0.64 V. This saturation behavior is due to the potential drop
      between the working and auxiliary electrodes exceeding the
      compliance voltage of the potentiostat at high current densities,
      and is not an inherent property of the catalyst. Assuming that
      every electron is used for the reduction of protons, and that all
      the catalyst molecules in solution were producing hydrogen, the
      TOF for the catalyst was also calculated. The TOP increases with
      overpotential, reaching a maximum of 1600 mol H2/mol catalyst per
      hour (FIG. 3C). Control experiments performed using Na2MoO4 or
      PY5Me2 showed no catalytic activity, and no catalytic activity was
      observed when fresh electrolyte was added to a used mercury
      electrode. Moreover, no solid deposits were observed on the
      mercury electrode, which remained shiny even after extended and
      repeated electrolysis experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] To optimize catalytic TOP and assess the tong-term
      stability of [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 as a catalyst, extended CPE
      experiments were performed using a frit of greater diameter and a
      higher concentration of electrolyte (3 M phosphate, pH 7) to
      minimize internal resistance. Remarkably, the catalyst maintained
      activity under these conditions for at least 71 h, when the
      measurement was stopped because the concentration of hydroxide
      ions in the working electrode compartment overcame the capacity of
      the buffer. Thus, the [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 catalyst is effective
      for long durations at close to neutral pH, with its durability
      apparently limited only by the strength of the buffer. The data
      obtained in the experiments are reported at FIG. 4, which depicts
      extended electrolysis data for a 2 [mu]M solution of
      [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 in a 3 M pH 7 phosphate buffer, showing charge
      build-up and turnover number (TON) versus time (open circles), as
      well as data for the buffer solution alone (the solid line) with
      the cell operating at a potential of -1.40 V vs. SHE.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In this experiment, the current leveled out at 179 mA,
      whereas a control experiment run under identical conditions, hut
      without the catalyst, showed a current of just 1.1 mA. The charge
      accumulated over this period, after subtracting the contribution
      from the blank solution, resulted in a TON of 606,000 mol H2/mol
      catalyst with a TOF of 8510 mol H2/mol catalyst per hour (FIG. 4).
      It is believed these values are significantly higher than those
      for other reported molecular catalysts for electrochemical
      hydrogen production from neutral water, including di-nickel and
      mono cobalt complexes with TONs of just 100 and 5 mol H2/mol
      catalyst, respectively. Moreover, the activity of
      [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 is comparable to hydrogenase enzymes on a per
      volume basis, (packing together the number of catalyst molecules
      needed to fill the volume of a single hydrogenase protein yields
      hydrogen production rates of 1000-3400 H2 molecules/s) with far
      greater stability for the former.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] To test the stability of [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 in the absence
      of a buffer, CPE experiments were performed in a 1 M aq. KCl
      solution. Here, accumulation of hydroxide anions as H2 is
      generated, leads to an increase in pH. The accumulated charge
      within a given time period can be used to calculate the amount of
      H2 produced, and, therefore, the concentration of OH&lt;-&gt; ions
      in solution. FIG. 5A plots charge build-up over time at an applied
      potential of -1.40 V vs. SHE. The linear fit of the data (where
      the charge vs. time slope {y=0.42x}) evidences current is constant
      during the measurement (i.e. the catalytic activity is constant,
      with no decomposition occurring). FIG. 5B, plots the measured
      change in solution pH with time during electrolysis (squares) and
      the calculated change in pH assuming the catalyst performs at
      Faradaic efficiency (continuous line) is plotted. Notably, the
      agreement between calculated and observed pH changes during a
      60-min electrolysis, establishes that the catalyst indeed operates
      at Faradaic efficiency. Mass spectrometry studies indicate a
      reduced stability for [(PY5Me2)MoO]&lt;2+&gt; at high pH, with a
      significant dissociation of the molybdenum center from the PY5Me2
      ligand occurring above pH 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] With data showing that the catalyst can tolerate impurities
      and still show activity in water, performance was evaluated in
      seawater, the earth's most abundant proton source (FIG. 6). Upon
      adding [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 to a sample of California seawater with
      no added electrolyte, the onset of catalytic current was observed
      at ea, -0.81 V vs. SHE. In the absence of [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2, a
      catalytic current was not apparent until a potential of -1.60 V
      was attained. To obtain an accurate blank subtraction for
      controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), the charge generated from
      seawater atone was subtracted from the charge generated from the
      catalyst solution at the same overpotential, as determined from
      the solution pH at the end of the electrolysis. CPE experiments
      performed for short durations in seawater were remarkably similar
      to the results obtained in pH 7 buffered water. The current
      saturated at 0.32 C at an applied potential of -1.40 V vs. SHE,
      corresponding to a turnover frequency of 1225 mol H2/mol catalyst
      per hour at an overpotential of 0.78 V. The background solvent
      activity was subtracted from plots 6B and 6C
      [Overpotential=applied potential-E(pH at the end of the
      electrolysis)].<br>
      <br>
      [0030] An exemplary synthesis route for the obtaining of
      [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2 is set forth in the following paragraphs. All
      chemical synthese were conducted under strictly air and
      moisture-free conditions using standard glove-box and Schlenk-line
      techniques, unless otherwise noted. The compound MoI2(CO)3(MeCN)2
      was synthesized as described in Baker, P. K., Fraser, S. G. Keys,
      E. M., "The synthesis and spectral properties of some highly
      reactive new seven-coordinate molybdenum(II) and tungsten(II)
      bisacetonitrile dihalogenotricarbonyl complexes", J. Organomet,
      Chem. 309, 319-321 (1986). The compound PY5Me2, was synthesized as
      described in Canty, A. J., Minchin, N. J., Skelton, B. &amp;
      White, A. H., "Interaction of Palladium (II) Acetate with
      Substituted Pyridines, Including a Cyclometalation Reaction and
      the Structure of [Pd{meso-[(py)PhMeC]2-O5H3N}(O2CMe)][O2CMe]3H2O",
      J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 10, 2205-2210 (1986). All other
      reagents were purchased from commercial vendors and used without
      further purification. Electronic grade Hg (99.9998%), and platinum
      gauze were purchased from Alfa Aesar for the electrochemical
      studies. Toluene, acetonitrile and diethylether were dried and
      degassed using the VAC 103991 solvent system and stored over 3-A
      molecular sieves under a nitrogen atmosphere. Water was deionized
      with the Millipore Milli-Q UF Plus system.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The precursor [(PY5Me2)MoI]I2 was first synthesized. Solid
      PY5Me2 (200 mg, 0.45 mmol) was added to a 20-mL toluene solution
      of MoI2(CO)3(MeCN)2 (350 mg, 0.67 mmol) and the mixture was heated
      at reflux for 3 days. The solution was then cooled to room
      temperature and filtered to afford an orange solid, which was
      washed repeatedly with toluene until the filtrate was colorless.
      The solid was then extracted into 50 mL of acetonitrile, layered
      with 30 mL of diethylether, and allowed to stand for 2 days to
      yield orange rod-shaped crystals. The crystals were washed with 20
      mL of diethylether to give a combined yield of 360 mg (87% with
      respect to PY5Me2).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] [(PY5Me2)MoO]I2: Solid (PY5Me2)MoI]I2 (620 mg, 0.67 mmol)
      was added to 40 mL of deionized water and stirred in air for one
      day to give a green suspension. The water was then removed under
      reduced pressure and the green solid was washed with cold (0[deg.]
      C.) acetonitrile until the color of the filtrate changed from
      brown to green. The solid was then washed with 20 mL of
      diethylether to yield 470 mg (85%) of product.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] [(PY5Me2)MoO](PF6)2: A 20-mL acetonitrile solution of
      TI(PF6) (401 mg, 1.15 mmol) was added drop wise to a stirred 20-mL
      acetonitrile solution of [(PY5Me2)MoO]I2 (465 mg, 0.575 mmol), and
      the mixture was stirred in air for 12 h. The solution was cooled
      to 0[deg.] C. and filtered to remove the yellow thallium iodide,
      and the bright green filtrate was concentrated to a volume of 20
      mL under reduced pressure. Diffusion of diethylether vapor into
      this solution over the course of 3 days afforded 484 mg (95.0%) of
      product as green rod-shaped crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Electrochemical studies employed a mercury pool working
      electrode with a surface area of 19.6 cm&lt;2&gt;, which was
      stirred constantly during the CPE experiments. Electrical contact
      to the mercury pool was achieved through a platinum wire that
      remained immersed below the surface of the mercury, thereby
      avoiding contact with the solution, A 20.5 cm&lt;2 &gt;platinum
      gauze (52 mesh, woven from 0.1 mm diameter wire) was utilized as
      the auxiliary electrode and was separated from the solution in the
      working electrode compartment by a medium-porosity sintered-glass
      frit. The reference electrode was a commercially available aqueous
      Ag/AgCl electrode, which was positioned within 5 mm of the working
      electrode, and the potentials are reported with respect to SHE by
      adding 0.195 V to the experimentally obtained values. The working
      electrode compartment contained 5-100 mL of electrolyte solution
      which was thoroughly sparged and kept under a blanket of
      water-saturated nitrogen during the experiments. A 0.6 M pH 7
      phosphate buffer was used as electrolyte. Extended electrolyses of
      greater than 1 h were conducted in a larger cell containing 170 mL
      of 3 M pH 7 phosphate buffer in each compartment. The solutions in
      both compartments were vigorously stirred during the electrolysis.
      Sea water was obtained from Ocean Beach, San Francisco, and was
      passed through a course paper fitter prior to use in order to
      remove any particulate matter, iR compensation was employed for
      all experiments to account for the voltage drop between the
      reference and working electrodes using the BAS CV-50W software.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A mercury electrode was used in this study to reduce
      background activity of direct water reduction at the electrode at
      the high overpotentials needed to evaluate the catalyst. For
      catalysts which require lower overpotentials, other electrodes
      such as graphite and steel may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] It is to be noted that the turnover numbers and turnover
      frequencies reported in the text and figures of this application
      were generated prior to the filing of the referenced Provisional
      application, and these initial results were published thereafter
      (H. I. Karunadasa, C. J. Chang, J. R. Long, Nature 464, 1329
      (2010)). At the time, it was assumed that all the metal-oxo
      catalyst molecules in solution contributed toward hydrogen
      generation. It was subsequently determined that only the metal-oxo
      catalyst molecules adsorbed on the surface of the mercury
      electrode of the experiments were catalytically active. Using
      cyclic voltammetry, the surface coverage of the catalyst molecules
      on the electrode was calculated to be ca. 10&lt;-10
      &gt;mols/cm&lt;2 &gt;(according to methods detailed in A. J. Bard,
      L. R. Faulkner, Electrochemical Methods, Wiley, New York, 1980).
      By following this approach, we were able to derive a more accurate
      estimate of the rates of hydrogen production, which are about 2
      orders of magnitude greater than that earlier reported, and
      published. For example, in the extended electrolysis the turnover
      frequency was first reported as 8510 mols H2/mol catalyst per h,
      when in fact (applying the new calculus) it was actually about
      1,500,000 mol H2/mol catalyst per h. Similarly, the reported
      turnover number of 606,000 mol H2/mol catalyst is more accurately
      about 105,000,000 mol H2/mol catalyst. These higher rates are
      comparable to those of hydrogenase enzymes on a per molecule
      basis, while packing together the number of catalyst molecules
      needed to fill the volume of a single hydrogenase protein yields
      hydrogen production rates of 200,000-600,000 H2 molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The discovery of a molecular molybdenum-oxo catalyst for
      generating hydrogen from water without use of additional acids
      and/or organic co-solvents establishes a new chemical paradigm for
      creating reduction catalysts that are highly active and robust in
      aqueous media. Importantly, the system employs an inexpensive,
      earth-abundant metal to achieve catalytic H2 evolution from
      neutral buffered water or even seawater, maintaining long-term
      activity with TOF and TON values of 1.5 million mol H2/mol
      catalyst per hour and 105 million mol H2/mol catalyst,
      respectively. An overpotential of between 0.6 V to 1.0 V at the
      cathode leads to an efficiency of 67%-55% respectively for the
      cell, assuming that the rest of the cell operates at ideal
      efficiencies. The total voltage necessary for the cell depends on
      the reaction at the anode and well as the internal resistance of
      the cell which depends heavily on cell design, which does not
      constitute a part of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] This invention has been described herein in considerable
      detail to provide those skilled in the art with information
      relevant to apply the novel principles and to construct and use
      such specialized components as are required. However, it is to be
      understood that the invention can be carried out by different
      equipment, materials and devices, and that various modifications,
      both as to the equipment and operating procedures, can be
      accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention

      </b><br>
      A composition of matter suitable for the generation of hydrogen
      from water is described, the positively charged cation of the
      composition having the general formula [(PY5 W2)MO]2+, wherein
      PY5W2 is (NC5XYZ)(NC5H4)C2W2, M is a transition metal, and W, X,
      Y, and Z can be H, R, a halide, CF3, or SiR3, where R can be an
      alkyl or aryl group. The two accompanying counter anions, in one
      embodiment, can be selected from the following Cl', I', PF6", and
      CF3SO3". In embodiments of the invention, water, such as tap water
      containing electrolyte or straight sea water can be subject to an
      electric potential of between 1.0 V and 1.4 V relative to the
      standard hydrogen electrode, which at pH 7 corresponds to an
      overpotential of 0.6 to 1.0 V, with the result being, among other
      things, the generation of hydrogen with an optimal turnover
      frequency of ca. 1.5 million mol H2/mol catalyst per h.<br>
