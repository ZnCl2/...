      <p><b>1 )&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>This report summarizes a technical investigation of certain
        claims of Thomas Townsend Brown concerning a proposed method of
        propulsion for aerial vehicles. The investigation, which began
        May 3, 1952 and which is concluded hereby, is mainly analytical,
        no allotment having been made for an experimental program. </p>
      <p><b>2 )&nbsp;&nbsp; Brief Description of the Alleged Phenomena</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Brown claims to have discovered several new physical
        effects, and considers them to be interrelated. We will be
        concerned here with those relating to the force upon and between
        electrically charged bodies in air or under oil. </p>
      <p>2.1 )&nbsp;&nbsp; It is asserted that the force exerted upon a
        negatively charged body by a positively charged body is greater
        than the force exerted upon the latter by the former; that the
        force differential is proportional to the mass of the dielectric
        inserted between the bodies; and that the phenomenon is evidence
        of a new "electrogravitic" effect. Paragraph 4 contains a fuller
        description of these phenomena. </p>
      <p>2.2 )&nbsp; A corollary effect is the force tending to move a
        metallic disc which by means of a plastic disc supports a fine
        wire, AA tangentially disposed in its plane, as shown in <b><a
            href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></b>. When the wire is positively
        charged (e.g., 30 kilovolts) and the disc negatively charged, a
        propulsion force of a fraction of an ounce appears which moves
        the disc (and with it the wire) in the direction of the arrow C.
        These effects have been witnessed by the writer. Further
        discussion is presented below in paragraph 6. </p>
      <p><a name="fig1"></a><b>Figure 1: Demonstration Flying Saucer</b>
      </p>
      <center><img src="fig1a.jpg" height="414" width="379"></center>
      <p>2.3 )&nbsp; An apparatus has been examined superficially, which
        shows an unexpected torque on an oil-immersed disc when charged.
        This, according to Mr. Brown, is arranged to record
        automatically and frequently the magnitude of the angular
        deflection of the disc. These records have been tabulated and
        partially analyzed by Mr. Brown. Greater detail regarding this
        device is given in paragraph 5 below. </p>
      <p>2.4 )&nbsp; There has been briefly inspected a third electrical
        device, purporting to be a communication equipment operating on
        waves related to the electrogravitic effect. It appears that the
        transmitter is simply a relaxation oscillator consisting of a
        high tension DC power supply, a high resistor, and a condenser
        which periodically discharges through a short gap. The receiver,
        shown in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></b>, consists of two
        Pyranol capacitors 0-5 mf, two titanium oxide capacitors 500 mf,
        a Brush recorder, and a bypass capacitor 0.1 mf to prevent the
        recorder from oscillating. Two terminals in the circuit are
        charged as indicated before reception and left floating during
        reception. The bridge of four capacitors is housed in a cabinet,
        indicated by a dashed line, which forms an obviously imperfect
        shield against electromagnetic radiation. When the transmitter
        is operated in an adjoining room, the Brush recorder jumps with
        each spark. Mr. Brown states that the effect is present, but
        reduced, if the 25 kv potentials are not applied. If the
        Pyranols are short-circuited and removed, the effect is still
        reported present. No attempt has been made at conscious
        electromagnetic shielding of either the transmitter or the
        receiver. In the writer's opinion the response may be the result
        of a chance rectifying contact. </p>
      <p>The relation between the communication device and the
        mechanical effects which form the topic of this report appears
        to remote that no further mention will be made of the former. </p>

          Device</b> </p>

      <p><b>3 )&nbsp; The Investigative Method</b> </p>
      <p>This study is limited to the technical claims of Mr. Brown and
        is not concerned with matters of personality or personnel, or
        with the Townsend Brown Foundation. Although propulsion is the
        immediate center of interest, the claimed basic effect and its
        several manifestations are of the essence also. Therefore the
        analysis is not restricted to the propulsion apparatus. </p>
      <p>Rough quantitative data have been taken by the writer on the
        force between charged bodies, and on the force on the disc shown
        in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></b>. He has also carried out
        a brief examination of the recorded data on the oil-immersed
        disc. Whenever possible, word-of-mouth data have been ignored.
        It is regrettable that during the time of the investigation the
        greater part of the experimental data gathered over the years by
        Mr. Brown are unavailable, being in storage elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Full reliance is placed on the sincerity of Mr. Brown in his
        written reports of the data, but no reliance is placed on his
        interpretations. His orally reported data have been partially
        discounted as being less reliable than his written records.
        There is no evidence of conscious deceit. </p>
      <p>Most of the interviews have taken place at the Townsend Brown
        Foundation, 306 North Vermont Avenue, Hollywood, California. </p>
      <p><b>4 )&nbsp; The Basic Effect</b> </p>
      <p>At Zanesville, Ohio in 1927, Mr. Brown at this then Laboratory
        of Research Devices, performed experiments on force acting upon
        charged conductors. The apparatus took two forms, as described
        in a manuscript "Tapping Cosmic Energy", dated 28 October 1927,
        which was submitted at that time to the <i>Physical Review</i>
        for publication but which was rejected. Apparently no basic
        experiments have been performed since 1928. </p>
      <p>4.1 )&nbsp; In one form the conductors were two independent
        spheres suspended close but not touching by means of fine wires
        which also served as electrical leads. The spheres were of lead,
        and weighed 14,740 gr each. The wires supporting them hung from
        the ceiling 45 cm apart. When the spheres were oppositely
        charged to a potential difference of 125 kv they moved toward
        each other slightly in response to their electrostatic
        attraction. The negative sphere was displaced allegedly about
        twice as far as the positive sphere. The inequality of the
        displacement is the essence of the phenomenon. </p>
      <p>4.2 )&nbsp; In the other form of the basic experiments the
        condenser was formed by a block of insulating material 3-1/3 c
        2-1/2 x 15", to the ends of which electrodes were attached.
        Whether the condenser was suspended or whether it was mounted at
        the end of a centrally pivoted horizontal beam, it showed a
        force causing the arm to rotate, usually in such a direction
        that the positive electrode moved forward. The force is claimed
        to have been proportional to the mass of the block, although no
        data are given in the manuscript and none are available. The
        name "gravitor" is used for this apparatus. </p>
      <p>The condenser dielectric was either homogenous or laminated. In
        one laminated version, 10,000 sheets of 0.001" lead foil were
        separated by an equal number of 3 x 3" sheets of 0.0008"
        cellulose acetate in a formica box, to make 10,000 condensers in
        a series arrangement weighing 10 kg. The acceleration exhibited
        by this device when suitably charged is claimed to have been 2.5
        cm per sec2 when the electrodes were charged, evidencing a force
        of 25,000 dynes or about 25 gm; the homogenous type is stated by
        Mr. Brown to have had comparable thrust. The force was usually
        toward the positive electrode, although in some units it was
        toward the negative; this effect was attributed to a
        "polarization". The force is stated to have been stronger at
        some time that others, correlating with the position of the sun
        and moon. Data are displayed which relate to the angular speed
        of a pivoted gravitor, and which show half a dozen large
        fluctuation in a day; some of these can perhaps be construed a
        being dips simultaneous with the rise or setting of the sun or
        moon. </p>
      <p>On 17 June 1952 the undersigned accompanied (censored) of the
        Townsend Brown Foundation to the Glendale plant of the Bendix
        Aviation Corporation. An experiment of the type described in
        paragraph 4.1 had been set up by Bendix personnel. (Sentence
        censored). The observations in <b><a href="#table1">Table 1</a></b>
        were recorded by the undersigned. </p>

      <p>From a wooden scaffold a cylindrical brass weight 8" long and
        4" in diameter was hung with axis vertical by means of about 5'
        of #14 Cu wire (0.06408" diameter). A similar wire about 6" away
        suspended a similar weight level with the first. By means of the
        wires the weights were electrified to a measured voltage; the
        corona current was not measured. An optical projection system
        provided on the wall an image on a scale and insulated pointers
        attached to the weights. The weights were either hollow (5 lb)
        or solid (30 lb). In certain of the observations the weights
        were linked by an insulating bar. </p>
      <p>4.3 )&nbsp; An examination of the data makes it clear that the
        inequality in deflections reported by Brown is still present
        here, though only to the extent of 1-30% (tests 2-4) and less
        than that under conditions where the corona discharge is reduced
        (of tests 1 &amp; 5). </p>
      <p>When cigarette smoke was drifted into the vicinity of the wires
        it showed the existence of a wind. Just above the weights the
        wind blew from negative top positive, while higher on the wires
        the wind was opposite. </p>
      <p><b>5 )&nbsp; The Brown Electrometer</b> </p>
      <p>In a small thermostated room in the second basement of the
        Banks-Huntley Building (address censored), Los Angeles, there is
        a continuous experiment which shows an extension of the basic
        phenomenon. This apparatus is the Brown Electrometer. The device
        is housed in an oil-filled tank of half-inch steel, perhaps two
        feet in diameter and a foot deep, with a half-inch steel cover.
        In the tank there is suspended a horizontal disc 12" in diameter
        and one inch thick, made of six segments of pine wood
        alternating with six of marble around an 8" hub of Bakelite. The
        sections are separated by 1 x 2 x 1/16-inch copper strips.
        Alternate strips are grounded to a central metal stem supporting
        the disc which is attached to a music-wire suspension 0.018" in
        diameter and 6-3/8" long; the remaining copper strips connect to
        a central iron tit at the center of the hub, which dips into a
        cup of mercury. The disc is surrounded by a grounded metal
        shield which is attached to the tank and which stands at a
        clearance of 1/2-inch above and below the disc and 1-1/2 inch
        radially; this shield is centrally perforated at the top and
        bottom for the suspension and the tit. </p>
      <p>A sequencing device in a cabinet below the tank causes a
        half-wave smoothed DC power supply to impress upon the mercury
        cup a well-regulated negative potential of 11.1 kv resulting in
        a leakage current of 0.45 ma. The sequencer leaves the voltage
        on for 30 seconds, causing the disc to rotate several degrees.
        After 30 seconds, a short spark is made to jump from a point
        projecting about 9 inches horizontally in air from the stem of
        the disc, and perforates a rice-paper strip wound on a drum
        which rotates once each day. The voltage is then turned off and
        the disc returns to its relaxed position, which is recorded by a
        separate spark. The cycle repeats every three minutes. The
        apparatus appears to be well engineered and extremely reliable.
      </p>
      <p>5.1 )&nbsp; Mr. Brown has given attention for several years to
        the variations in the deflections of this electrometer. On the
        spark record the rest position is 50 units and the deflected
        reading is about 80. Until about a year and a half ago the
        deflected position was about 20, but suffered a gradual change
        to its present value at that time. Aside from the reversal of
        sign, the deflection undergoes fluctuations whose character is
        less dramatic but still large, e.g., 10-50%. The cause of these
        fluctuations has been sought by Mr. Brown by seeking for
        correlations between them and various outside influences, such
        as magnetic storms, temperature, pressure, the time of the year,
        civil time, lunar time, sidereal time, and the Dow-Jones
        average. Only the last five correlations are claimed. Tabulated
        data are available only for the year 1937. Hourly recordings
        throughout that year are tabulated, both for civil and lunar
        time. The writer has seen no convincing evidence that the stock
        market and the automatic recorder are correlated, although it
        has been claimed that a chi-square analysis has been performed,
        with positive results. </p>
      <p>5.2 )&nbsp; The undersigned has conducted a partial statistical
        analysis of the data from the automatic recorder for 1937 as
        follows: </p>
      <p>5.2.1 )&nbsp; Use was made of a table furnished by Mr. Brown
        entitled "Hourly Readings of Instrument, 1937" and particular
        attention was directed toward the readings of 0100, one hour
        after midnight, on each day of the first half of 1937. During
        the first half of January, for instance, the readings on days at
        this hour were 26.20, 25.90, 26.20, 26.10, 26.80, 25.60, 25.40,
        26.00, 26.00, 25.60, 26.60 and 25.90. The mean is 26.05, the
        standard deviation 0.55 and the probable error of the mean 0.15.
        <b><a href="#table2">Table 2</a></b> gives the half-monthly
        means and probable errors for time 0100 and for time 1300. This
        table shows that there was a strong and real variation during
        the spring of 1937; but the great similarity between the
        readings at 0100 and 1300 implies that there is no conspicuous
        diurnal effect. (See also paragraph 5.2.2) </p>
      <p>5.2.2 )&nbsp; A direct search was undertaken by the writer to
        see whether the data for the first half of 1937 reveal any solar
        diurnal period. Attention was confined to the first day in each
        half-month. On these twelve selected days the readings at time
        0200, for example, were 26.20, 26.00, 27.90, 29.00, 28.10,
        29.80, 30.40, 29.80, 28.90, 27.50, 27.40, and 28.10. The mean
        was 28.29 and the probable error of the mean 0.46. The probable
        errors, as far as calculated, were all in this neighborhood. <b><a
            href="#table3">Table 3</a></b> gives the means calculated as
        in the above example. It is seen that there is no strong diurnal
        periodicity, with the dubious exception of a peak at 1100 hours;
        this result confirms that of paragraph 5.2.1. </p>
      <p>5.2.3 )&nbsp; The undersigned has scrutinized a table of data
        captioned "1937 Readings of Instrument with Lunar Hour Angle" in
        a search for evidence of a variation of the readings with the
        position of the moon, as rising, setting, etc. The form taken by
        this search was as follows. For the calendar month January the
        average deflection for each lunar hour was noted; e.g., at lunar
        hour angle 1300, when the moon was one hour past the meridian,
        the readings for January averaged 26.74. At the same lunar angle
        in the succeeding calendar months the average readings were
        28,60, 30.18, 29.50, 28.02, and 28.52. The average of those six
        averages gives 28.59 as the mean of all observations taken at
        lunar hour angle 1300 during the first half of 1937. This
        process was repeated for each of the 24 hours. The means are
        listed in table 4. Their constance is most striking; they show
        no dependence upon lunar hour. </p>

        the Brown Electrometer, the following conclusion are implied: </p>
      <p>(a) Through the weeks and months the data drift significantly;
        <br>
        (b) There is no evidence of a solar diurnal period synchronizing
        with the sun, as claimed by Brown; <br>

        appear most emphatically to deny such a period. </p>
      <p>5.4 )&nbsp; Two related experiments have been described by Mr.
        Brown which throw light on the reason for the deflections if not
        the reason for their fluctuations. </p>
      <p>5.4.1 )&nbsp; In one, the sector disc was held stationary while
        a grounded metal disc was suspended horizontally over it in the
        oil, by a torsion fiber. When the sector disc was charged, a
        motion of the adjacent oil was noted by Mr. Brown. The suspended
        disc deflected, but not when a glass plate was interposed
        between the sector disc and the suspended disc. </p>
      <p>5.4.2. )&nbsp; The other related experiment concerns an
        oil-immersed annulus described by Mr. Brown as 2 feet in
        diameter and 6 inches thick, made of lead oxide (PbO) and
        paraffin in eight segments separated by 8 copper strips
        alternately charged positive and negative. By means of a probe
        the potential distribution on the PbO and paraffin surfaces was
        explored and it was noted that whereas the gradient was uniform
        across the edges of the lead oxide sectors, the gradient on the
        paraffin was steepest near the negative electrodes. This
        observation means that the steepest gradients are all in the
        same direction, e.g., clockwise. It was also noted that the
        application of high voltage to the electrodes of this disc
        caused a lively motion of the oil. </p>
      <p><b>6 )&nbsp; The Model Flying Saucers</b> </p>
      <p>At the quarters of the Townsend Brown Foundation a room is
        devoted to demonstrating a new method of propulsion (para. 2.2)
        which is claimed to depend upon the electrogravitic effect. </p>
      <p>6.1 )&nbsp; At the center of the room there stands a tall iron
        post carrying at its top a transverse Plexiglass beam about 6
        feet long, which is freely pivoted at its center to rotate in a
        horizontal plane. From each end of the beam hangs a model flying
        saucer, <b><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></b>, of which the metal
        part is composed of two spun aluminum discs 12" in diameter,
        between which is bolted an 18" Plexiglass disc. The periphery of
        this disc is indented with nearly semi-circular scallops. The
        fingers remaining between the scallops constitute standoff
        insulators supporting a bare 0.005-inch stainless steel wire AA
        at a distance of 3 inches from the aluminum spinnings and
        insulate it from the aluminum. This will be called the outboard
        wire in the following discussions. It embraces perhaps
        one-quarter of the circumference. A similar wire, BB, is
        supported at the opposite quadrant, but is connected to the
        aluminum spinnings; it appears to be without effect. Each of
        these two identical assemblies is suspended by an insulating
        string from one end of the Plexiglass beam. By rubber-covered
        leads, shown in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></b>, from the
        beam spinnings can be given one polarity while the outboard
        wires are given the opposite polarity. The leads are energized
        through rotating contacts at the pivot. If the beam rotates
        counter-clockwise as seen from above, the discs revolve about
        the post, in such a way that the outboard wire is at the leading
        edge. </p>
      <p>A full-wave rectified unsmoothed high-tension supply in an
        adjacent room provides voltage for the demonstration. The
        voltage is controlled by a Variac. An examination showed no
        hidden connections. </p>
      <p>6.2 )&nbsp; When the power was turned on, the discs became
        negative and the outboard wires positive. Corona discharge could
        be heard as a gentle hiss or crackling. It could be seen in the
        dark, particularly around the outboard wire. As soon as the
        potential was applied, the discs and the beam began to revolve,
        the leading edge being at the outboard wires. </p>
      <p>6.2.1 )&nbsp; The thrust was roughly measured by a method in
        which the rotation was prevented, as shown in <b><a
            href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></b>. The weight on the pan was
        adjusted until the indicated angle was 45 degrees, at which time
        the thrust was known to be equal to the force in the vertical
        thread. This method of thrust measurement is valid if the pivot
        is frictionless; actually, the friction seems to introduce an
        uncertainty of about 0.5 gm in the thrust data. The procedure
        described provides a value of the thrust of the two discs
        combined. </p>

        were gathered by the writer on 6 June with the collaboration of
        Mr. Brown and (censored), an assistant. Column 1 gives the
        setting of the Variac in the supply circuit for the high-tension
        transformers. The corresponding voltages, with respect to ground
        at the positive and negative outpost cables from the rectifier
        are given in columns 2 &amp; 3; at each polarity the voltage was
        measured with the aid of a 0-2 milliameter and a high series
        resistor. The current in each lead, recorded in Columns 4 &amp;
        5, was measured by the same milliameter when appropriately
        reconnected; it may be resumed that most of the current
        represented corona discharge between the discs and the outboard
        wires. Column 6 gives the measured thrust. In Column 7 is
        recorded the time taken for the discs to revolve once completely
        when free to do so, after they had had time to reach their full
        speed. The entires in Column 8 give the thrust to be expected on
        the basis that it is caused by the electric wind (see para. 7
        below). The last Column shows the efficiency of the propulsion,
        calculated (with due heed to the conversion of units) from the
        ratio of the electrical power input (Col. 2 x Col. 4 plus Col. 3
        x Col. 5) to the mechanical power output (Col. 6 x Velocity).
        The data in Columns 2 &amp; 3 were gathered first, then those in
        Columns 4, 5 &amp; 6, and finally in Columns 2 &amp; 3 again.
        The repeat measurements of the voltages nearly always agreed
        with the first measurements to within 0.75 kv or less. The
        average is recorded in Columns 2 &amp; 3. </p>

      <p>6.2.3 )&nbsp; Three additional observations were made. In one,
        slips of thin cardboard were cut, folded double and so hung on
        the outboard wire of each disc as to cover practically its
        entire length. Their purpose was to confine the positive ions to
        the region of the wire and so reduce the corona. It was observed
        that the thrust, originally about 7 gr as shown in <b><a
            href="#table5">Table 5</a></b>, was reduced to about 1 gr. </p>
      <p>6.2.4 )&nbsp; In the second additional observation the polarity
        of the discs was made positive while the wire was negative. The
        thrust was then 3 / 1 gr (in the same direction as before)
        instead of about 7, the Variac setting being 40, 45 and 50. </p>
      <p>6.2.5 ) The third additional observation was that when the disc
        was charged and immobilized as in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></b>,
        a brisk wind was developed. The origin of the wind was
        apparently near the outboard wire. Its direction was from the
        wire toward and past the aluminum spinning as shown by cigarette
        smoke. </p>
      <p><b>7 )&nbsp; Possible Theories of the Townsend Brown Phenomena</b>
      </p>
      <p>7.1 )&nbsp; Mr. Brown has no theory for the effects that he has
        demonstrated or claimed. He has advanced an empirical
        explanation for the magnitude of the force on a suspended
        condenser, but has not advanced supporting evidence. While
        granting the existence of the electric wind, Mr. Brown seems
        nevertheless to believe that some new force is operating which
        he describes as electrogravitic. This force is variable with
        time as shown by the Brown Electrometer. The origin of the force
        is of smaller interest to Mr. Brown than is the cause of its
        variations. No cause for the variations has been proposed, other
        than the alleged correlations with astronomical bodies. </p>
      <p>7.2 )&nbsp; It might be suggested that electrostriction is
        significant in Mr. Brown's effects. This suggestion is untenable
        because (1) the deflection of a suspended condenser (Table A
        [sic], Tests 6 &amp; 7) is far greater than any conceivable
        electrostrictive expansion or contraction; (2) electrostriction
        would cause no acceleration of the center of the center (sic) of
        gravity; and (3) the steady rotation of the flying saucer models
        cannot be caused by electrostriction, which is a dynamic effect
        only while the voltage is changing, and not in the steady state.
      </p>
      <p>7.3 )&nbsp; The force exerted upon a wire carrying a current in
        a magnetic field could conceivably contribute to the phenomenon.
        This hypothesis appears tenable at first sight, since the earth
        always provides the field, and with the corona discharge there
        is always associated a current. It is easily disproved, however,
        by (1) the sign of the deflections shown in<b> <a
            href="#table2">Table 1</a></b> was unchanged in test 3 when
        the polarity, and thereby the direction of any magnetic effect,
        was reversed; (2) the direction of the thrust by the model
        flying saucer was unchanged by changed polarity; (3) the equal
        and opposite corona currents in the leads to the saucers should
        result in equal and opposite magnetic force, and zero net
        thrust; and (4) there is no report that the Brown Electrometer
        shows normal deflections during magnetic storms. </p>
      <p>7.4 )&nbsp; The writer proposes that the origin of the observed
        phenomena is the electric wind. The effects described above all
        relate to the forces upon electrically charged bodies or upon
        adjacent insulating material. Such forces have long been the
        subject of observation and mathematical theory, and are
        discussed accordingly in such works as W.R. Smythe's "Static and
        Dynamic Electricity". It is commonly held by physicists that no
        practical discrepancies exist between theory and experiment in
        static electricity, if the experiments are conducted in the
        manner contemplated in the theory. It must be emphasized in this
        connection that the theory of electrostatics is written around
        the assumption that the insulators in the apparatus are perfect
        non-conductors, and that the fluid (e.g., air or oil) in which
        the apparatus is immersed is also a perfect non-conductor. For
        an experiment performed in a non-conducting medium the verdict
        of electrostatics is quite plain: the Townsend Brown effects
        should not exist. </p>
      <p>The experiments by Mr. Brown, including all those described in
        paras. 4, 5 and 6 were carried out in a partially conducting
        medium, i.e., air or oil. In such a medium the simple laws of
        electrostatics are not applicable. It is true that in the air or
        oil the conduction of electricity is usually so slight that the
        departures from the laws of electrostatics are quite negligible.
        When, however, large voltage gradients are involved, the density
        of ions is very greatly increased for well-known reasons, and
        the conductivity of the medium increases commensurately. If the
        voltage is high enough the passage of the ions through the air
        causes the crackling sound and bluish glow characteristic of the
        corona discharge. In the presence of such a discharge, the laws
        of electrostatics are not expected to hold. We will show that,
        so far from being forbidden, the Townsend Brown effects are
        actually predicted in the presence of a corona discharge. </p>
      <p>7.5 )&nbsp; We will adapt the treatment cited in (name
        censored) ("Conduction of Electricity Through Gases, 3rd ed.,
        Vol. II, 1933, page 544) in considering the force on a charged
        conductor brought about by the ionic conductivity in a gas.
        Consider a positively charged fine wire in air, parallel to a
        negative conductor. The well known concentration of the electric
        field near the fine wire will then produce a corona discharge;
        positive ions are generated at the wire. The wire being
        positively charged repels the ions. The force on the wire is
        roughly equal and opposite to that on the ions. If E is the
        field intensity and <i>u</i> the space charge density, the
        force on the ion is: </p>

        <p><img src="form1.jpg" height="42" width="212"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Where the integration covers the region occupied by the space
        charge. Here if we ignore the non-parallelism of the E vectors,

      <p>Where K is ionic mobility. </p>
      <p>For a positive ion in air at atmospheric pressure its value
        will be taken as 1.32 (cm/sec)/(volt/cm), while for the negative
        ion the value will be taken as 2.51 (cm/sec)/(volt/cm). </p>

      <p>Where d is the distance between the conductors. This force on
        the ions is communicated to the air by molecular collisions, and
        creates what is known as the electric wind; it is observed in
        the neighborhood of sharp points as well as fine wires. The
        thrust may be regarded as the force of reaction which results
        from the generation of the wind; the thrust is in the direction
        opposite to the wind, as in a jet airplane. </p>
      <p>7.5.1 )&nbsp; It is known that the mobility of a negative ion
        is greater than that of a positive, the ratio being about 1.9 at
        atmospheric pressure. The force on a positive conductor should
        therefore be, and according to (censored) and (censored) is
        observed to be, greater than that on a negative conductor. </p>
      <p>7.5.2 )&nbsp; Further confirmation of the above theory is found
        in the variation of F with pressure. Theory predicts that since
        k is well known to vary as the inverse square of the pressure
        the force should vary directly as the square root of the
        pressure; this prediction agrees with the early results of
        Arrhenius, <i>Wied. Ann.</i> 63: 305 (1897). </p>
      <p>7.5.3 )&nbsp; The efficiency of the electric wind as a
        propulsive agent is easily calculated. The power output is the
        product ViD/k of the thrust and the vehicle velocity V; while
        the power input is iv is the potential difference. The
        efficiency is then given by </p>
      <center><img src="form6.jpg" height="84" width="140"></center>
      <p>At a given vehicle velocity the efficiency can be improved by
        increasing the electrode spacing D or by decreasing the voltage
        necessary to sustain the corona. </p>
      <p>7.6 )&nbsp; Physically the theory of the electric wind is a
        shown in <b><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></b>, which shows a
        section view of two parallel charged wires in air. Positive ions
        are formed at the positive wire and surround it, but the
        attraction of the negative wire draws the positive cloud so that
        it lies primarily to the left of the positive wire in <b><a
            href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></b>. The slow mobility of the
        positive leads to a considerable positive charge in this region,
        which is repelled by the positive wire and which repels it.
        Negative ions are generated at the negative wire, and form an
        unsymmetrical cloud about it. Since their mobility is fairly
        fast, they are less crowded than the positives. The force on the
        positive wire is made of two parts; attraction to the left by
        the negative cloud (e.g., 20 gr) and repulsion to the left by
        the ion cloud (e.g., 10 gr). the force on the negative wire is:
        attraction to the right by the positive wire (e.g., 20 gr) and
        repulsion to the left by the ion cloud (e.g., 5 gr). The net
        force on the positive wire would in this hypothetical case be 10
        gr to the left, while that on the negative wire would be 15 gr
        to the right. The difference, 5 gr to the right would be
        directly observed if the weights hanging from the wires were
        connected by a rigid insulating link. </p>

      <p><b>8 )&nbsp; Test of the Electronic Wind Hypothesis</b> </p>
      <p>It is believed by the writer that the electric wind in air and
        in oil leads to all the well-documented results described
        herein. These results will be summarized and compared with the
        theoretical predictions. </p>
      <p>8.1 )&nbsp; (See para. 4.1) The positively charged sphere in
        the Zanesville experiments moved less that the negatively
        charged weight. This is as expected because the electrostatic
        force on the positive weight was partly balanced by the kinetic
        reaction from the electric wind which presumable existed (para.
        7.5 &amp; 7.6) because of the corona discharge at the wires. </p>
      <p>8.2 ) (See para. 4.3) The inequality in the motion of the
        weights in the Bendix experiment was less noticeable, thus
        discouraging corona and reducing the current. The observed
        electric wind was caused by corona at the wires, which was more
        or less strong according as the wires were rough or dusty in
        different areas. </p>
      <p>8.3 )&nbsp; (See para. 4.2) the deflection of a suspended
        condenser when charged was claimed. This is as expected if the
        leads or terminals sustain a corona. The "polarization" effect
        would seem to be evidence that one or the other lead or terminal
        had rough areas, sharp corners, or dust resulting in corona at
        one end to the other, and a thrust in one or the other
        direction. If the terminals have the same geometry, the force
        will, because of the lesser mobility of the positive ions, be
        directed toward the positive terminal; if the negative terminal
        is much rougher or sharper, it will be the seat of a corona of
        which the force might outweigh that at the positive terminal.
        The observed fluctuations in the effect are to be expected as
        the result of changing dust on the wires or terminals, which
        changes the corona current; the deflections in the Bendix
        experiment were somewhat irregular. </p>
      <p>8.4 )&nbsp; (See para. 5) The disc of the Brown Electrometer
        shown in <b>Figure 5</b> develops a torque in response to an
        applied voltage. The field in the oil is strongest in the
        regions A.B.V.D. where the oil is in contact with the electrodes
        separating the pine sectors from the marble sectors M. Positive
        ions formed at the electrodes as in a corona discharge will
        produce positive space charges at the regions A. &amp; D. while
        regions B. &amp; C. will have negative space charges. In the oil
        these will cause effects analogous to the electric wind in air.
        If the fields A.B.C.D. are equally strong the ion densities will
        be such as to give no net torque to the disc. We will assume, on
        the other hand, that the surface of the pine sectors allows a
        leakage current; this will have the effect of reducing the field
        in the regions A. &amp; B. and will leave the regions C. &amp;
        D. dominant in the production of force. The positive ions at D.
        will tend to rotate the disc clockwise while the negatives will
        tend to rotate is counterclockwise. Since their mobilities
        differ there will be a net torque in one or the other direction,
        as observed. If the chemistry of the oil or the insulating
        sectors changes with time the surface conductivity of the marble
        could become larger than that of the pine, causing a reversal of
        the torque. Aside from surface conductivity, other attributes
        may distinguish the marble from the pine. For example, a net
        torque might be caused by the influence of different dielectric
        constants from the field distribution, or if alternate sectors
        all project slightly from the electrodes. </p>

      </center>
      <p>A net torque might result from or be influenced by the surface
        conductivity of the pine and marble. If one is more conductive
        than the other, the field pattern will be made unsymmetrical
        (See para. 5.4.2) and the torque will be altered. It is possible
        that the slow fluctuations in the Brown Electrometer are caused
        by changes in the surfaces. The faster fluctuations may be
        caused by particles suspended in the oil, which may temporarily
        rest at such points as A. or B., changing the corona there
        temporarily. </p>
      <p>8.5 )&nbsp; The experiment reported in para. 5.4.1 would seem
        to corroborate the idea that a swirling of the oil is essential
        to the operation of the electrometer. This idea is in accord
        with the electric wind theory, whether or not the discussion in
        para. 8.4 is valid in detail. </p>
      <p>8.6 )&nbsp; It is claimed that the deflections of the
        electrometer show certain periodicities. If these are real they
        show the inadequacy of the electric wind hypothesis. Their
        reality is assessed in the crude and preliminary analysis
        contained in para. 5.2 and summarized in para. 5.3. There is no
        manifest solar diurnal period and no manifest lunar diurnal
        period. No test has been applied for the claimed sidereal
        diurnal period or for the correlation with the value of
        financial securities. Neither has it been possible to determine
        whether the slow changes in deflection (Table 2) are repeated
        annually as claimed; however, the fact that the deflections once
        annually permanently reversed direction would seem to discourage
        this claim. This reversal is attributable to changed surface
        conductivity of the sectors of the disc. It is concluded that
        the short study, para. 5 of the reading of the Brown
        Electrometer does not weaken the hypothesis that all the
        (censored: probably reads, "phenomena reported by Mr. Brown")
        are the result of electric wind. </p>
      <p>8.7 )&nbsp; The thrust observed in the experiment on the model
        flying saucers is given in <b><a href="#table5">Table 5</a></b>,
        para 6.2.2. The thrust to be expected on the electric wind
        hypothesis is tabulated as calculated from the equations, para.
        7.5. This agreement is satisfactory in order of magnitude.
        Actually the calculated thrust is about twice the observed. The
        discrepancy may be due to the approximations made in the
        mathematics of para. 7.5. </p>
      <p>8.8 )&nbsp; (See para 6.2.3) A partial shielding of the
        insulated wire on a model flying disc partially eliminated the
        thrust, presumable because the current was probably thereby
        reduced. The shielding also had the effect of making the
        approximations in para.7.5 still worse. Qualitatively, then, the
        electric wind hypothesis is again verified. </p>
      <p>8.8 )&nbsp; (See para. 6.2.4) With polarity reversed so that
        the insulating wire was negative, the thrust fell form about 7.5
        gr to about 3 gr, the ratio being 2.5. Unfortunately the current
        was not measured. Assuming it to have been unchanged in
        magnitude by the reversal, we would predict, from the result,
        that the mobility of the negative ions is 2.5 times greater than
        that of the positives. This is in fair agreement with the known
        factor of 1.9. </p>
      <p>8.10 )&nbsp; (See para. 6.2.5) A wind was observed to be
        generated near the outboard wire of the model flying saucers.
        This is as expected on the hypothesis under evaluation. The
        thrust experienced by the disc may be regarded as the jet
        reaction caused by the formation of this wind. </p>
      <p><b>9 )&nbsp; Conclusion</b> </p>
      <p>9.1 )&nbsp; All the well documented effects disclosed by Mr.
        Brown appear to be explained as caused by ionization of the air
        or oil in which the apparatus is immersed. </p>
      <p>9.2 )&nbsp; Mr. Brown claims that a gravitational anomaly
        exists in the neighborhood of a charged condenser. This effect
        has not been well documented by Mr. Brown, nor has the writer
        undertaken to refute it. </p>
      <p>9.3 )&nbsp; The thrust developed by the model flying saucers
        has its origin in the well-known phenomenon of the electric
        wind. </p>
      <p>9.4 )&nbsp; The efficiency of propulsion by the electric wind,
        as exemplified by the model flying saucers is of the order of
        1.4 percent. At speeds higher than 2.3 ft/sec attained by the
        model flying saucer the efficiency might be substantially
        improved. It is presumable less at high altitudes and zero in a
        vacuum.* If the efficiency of conversion of fuel energy into
        electrical energy is 21 percent the overall efficiency of
        propulsion of the model flying saucers by the electric wind is
        0.3 percent. This compares with about 25 percent for a
        propeller-driven airplane and about 15 percent for a jet
        airplane. </p>
