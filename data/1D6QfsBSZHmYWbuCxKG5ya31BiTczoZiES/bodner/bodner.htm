      <p>Artificial gills are devices that exist in science fiction, and
        being developed in reality, to extract oxygen dissolved in
        water, thus allowing humans to survive underwater. </p>
      <p>It is generally thought that they would be unwieldy and bulky,
        because of the massive amount of water that would have to be
        processed to extract enough oxygen to supply an active diver, as
        an alternative to a scuba set. However, Like-A-Fish is an
        ongoing attempt to develop such a system in the real world. </p>
      <p>As sea water contains 7 ppm oxygen. 1,000,000 kg (1,000 tonnes)
        of sea water holds 7 kg (1,000 short tons holds 14 lb) of O2,
        the equivalent of 5,350 litres (1,400 U.S. gallons) of oxygen
        gas at atmospheric pressure. &lt;p&gt;An average diver with a
        fully closed-circuit rebreather needs 1 litre (roughly 1 quart)
        of oxygen per minute. As a result, at least 192 litres (51
        gallons) of sea water per minute, or 3.2 liters (3.5 quarts)
        each second, would have to be passed through the system, and
        this system would not work in anoxic water. </p>
      <p>Natural gills work because nearly all animals with gills are
        cold-blooded and so need much less oxygen than a warm-blooded
        animal the same size[1]. </p>
      <p><b>Like-A-Fish</b> </p>
      <p>Like-A-Fish Technologies is an Israeli business, founded by
        Alan Bodner in 2001, that is developing a human artificial gill
        system; they have developed a prototype.[2] Like-A-Fish's
        technology uses a centrifuge causing lower pressure at the
        center, where dissolved air comes out of the water.[3] </p>
      <p>The key issue remaining is battery life. Currently a one kilo
        battery would only last for one hour,[2] whereas a regular scuba
        tank can last longer (depending on depth). The biggest
        possibilities lie in underwater habitats, which have access to
        electricity, but need constant refilling of air tanks.
        Additional possible uses include systems for scuba divers and
        submarines, among others. </p>
      <p>Like-A-Fish currently holds patents in Europe for its
        system.[4][5] </p>

      <p>An Israeli Inventor has developed a breathing apparatus that
        will allow breathing underwater without the assistance of
        compressed air tanks. This new invention will use the relatively
        small amounts of air that already exist in water to supply
        oxygen to both scuba divers and submarines. The invention has
        already captured the interest of most major diving manufacturers
        as well as the Israeli Navy. </p>
      <p>The idea of breathing underwater without cumbersome compressed
        air tanks has been the dream of science fiction writers for many
        years. In George Lucas movie "The Phantom Menace", Obi-Wan whips
        out a little Jedi underwater breathing apparatus and dives in.
        As things tend to happen in our world, yesterdays science
        fiction has turned into today's science fact due to one Israeli
        inventor with a dream. </p>
      <p>There are a number of limitations to the existing compressed
        air tank underwater breathing method. The first is the amount of
        time a diver can stay underwater, which is the result of the
        compressed air tank capacity. Another limitation is the
        dependence on compressed air refueling facilities near the
        diving site which are costly to operate and are used to compress
        the gas into the tanks which might be dangerous if not handled
        properly. The final problem has to do with the actual use of
        compressed air tanks underwater. When these tanks are in use
        they empty out and change the balance of the diver in the water.
      </p>
      <p>Engineers have tried to overcome these limitations for many
        years now. Nuclear submarines and the international space
        station use systems that generate Oxygen from water by
        performing 'Electrolysis', which is chemical separation of
        Oxygen from Hydrogen. These systems require very large amounts
        of energy to operate. For this reason, smaller, diesel fueled
        submarines cannot use these systems and are required to
        resurface to re-supply their air tanks every so often. Divers
        can't even consider carrying such large machines not to mention
        supplying them with energy. To overcome this limitation an
        Israeli inventor, Alon Bodner, turned to fish. Fish do not
        perform chemical separation of oxygen from water; instead they
        use the dissolved air that exists in the water in order to
        breathe. In the ocean the wind, waves and underwater currents
        help spread small amounts of air inside the water. Studies have
        shown that in a depth of 200m below the sea there is still about
        1.5% of dissolved air. This might not sound like much but it is
        enough to allow both small and large fish to breathe comfortably
        underwater. Bodner's idea was to create an artificial system
        that will mimic the way fish use the air in the water thus
        allowing both smaller submarines and divers to get rid of the
        large, cumbersome compressed air tanks </p>
      <p><i>The general structure of the system</i> </p>
      <p>The system developed by Bodner uses a well known physical law
        called the "Henry Law" which describes gas absorption in
        liquids. This law states that the amount of gas that can be
        dissolved in a liquid body is proportional to the pressure on
        the liquid body. The law works in both directionslowering the
        pressure will release more gas out of the liquid. This is done
        by a centrifuge which rotates rapidly thus creating under
        pressure inside a small sealed chamber containing sea water. The
        system will be powered by rechargeable batteries. Calculations
        showed that a one kilo Lithium battery can provide a diver with
        about one hour of diving time. </p>
      <p>Bodner has already built and tested a laboratory model and he
        is on the path to building a full-scale prototype. Patents for
        the invention have already been granted in Europe and a similar
        one is currently pending examination in the U.S. Meetings have
        already been held with most major diving manufacturers as well
        as with the Israeli Navy. Initial financial support for the
        project has been given by Israel Ministry of Industry and
        Commerce and Bodner is currently looking for private investors
        to help complete his project. </p>
      <p>If everything goes according to plan, in a few years the new
        tankless breathing system will be operational and will be
        attached to a diver in the form of a vest that will enable him
        to stay underwater for a period of many hours. </p>
      <p><i>Transcript of the Interview with Alon Bodner</i>: </p>
      <p>Question: We are speaking now with engineer Alon Bodner. First
        of all I have to tell you that since we put up your report on
        IsraCast, we have been inundated with literally millions of
        people going into our website to find out about your invention.
        Just where did you get the idea sir? </p>
      <p>Bodner: My seven years old son, Aviv, asked me some questions
        about the possibility of diving without tanks, maybe he was
        inspired by a Star Wars' movie, and then the wheels in my head
        started spinning. I knew that there is dissolved air in the
        water and that the fish breath this air so I thought, with all
        the technology in the world, why couldn't we also do it? </p>
      <p>Question: But just how practical is your idea, have you
        actually tried to run through this prototype in a pool or that
        kind of thing? </p>
      <p>Bodner: I call it a lab model it's not yet a prototype, it's in
        an aquarium which has a pump, a centrifuge, some hoses and a
        balloon, we cannot take it into the water yet, into the sea, but
        we tried it out with water and we saw that in principle it
        works. </p>
      <p>Question: In principle it works. We've been getting inquiries
        from people all around the world, some are asking what about the
        quantity, the large quantities of water that might have to be
        processed in order to get an adequate amount of oxygen for a
        diver? </p>
      <p>Bodner: I want to distinguish between open diving systems and
        closed diving systems. Usually when you go sports diving it's
        with open systems and this means that you inhale air from a tank
        and you exhale it into the water, and this requires a very large
        quantity of air. With closed systems, such as with breathers for
        individual divers or submarines or maybe in the future
        underwater habitats, the required water flow is much smaller, so
        this device is very suitable. </p>
      <p>Question: In other words, it could be a portable apparatus? </p>
      <p>Bodner: It is supposed to be a portable apparatus, yes. </p>
      <p>Question: And when you speak of underwater habitats, just what
        do you have in mind? </p>
      <p>Bodner: Well right now there exists several underwater habitats
        especially for research, off the coast of Florida there is one.
        It's like a Spacelab in the past, in which a few scientists live
        10-20 meters underwater, they breath from compressed tanks and
        perform experiments. In the future, you can have a whole city or
        many people under a glass dome and breathing air straight from
        this device. </p>
      <p>Question: What about the scientific community, have you
        yourself been approached by scientists and so forth? </p>
      <p>Bodner: Well I have, a few people do not understand the
        concept, they assume that I separate oxygen from the water and
        they say correctly that it is toxic below a depth of seven
        meters and then they ask some technical questions. In this case
        I want to say again, the device can extract air from the water.
        It is dissolved air which contains oxygen and nitrogen and so
        on. It does not extract oxygen from hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Question: And what are some of the technical problems that you
        have to overcome at this stage? </p>
      <p>Bodner: The main concerns are the power of the batteries I
        suppose and the water flow. The batteries are evolving in a very
        good rate and we don't expect any problems right now. As I said
        the water flow can be a problem, especially if using open
        systems, if you want I can elaborate better calculations. </p>
      <p>Question: If you could, please. </p>
      <p>Bodner: The calculation is quite different for open or closed
        systems; I'll start with the calculations for open systems. A
        diver can consume about 25 liters per minute of air at the
        surface. Assuming that there's about 2 percent of dissolved air
        in the water, the calculations show the water flow requirement
        of 1,250 liters per minute. As you go deeper your lungs require
        more air. At 10 meters depth the air and water flow requirement
        is double than that on the surface so that means that you will
        need 2,500 litters per minute of water, and this is a lot. For
        closed systems, the <br>
        calculation is different. In these systems the air is
        re-circulated and returned to the diver after the carbon dioxide
        is removed. For this case we calculate the oxygen consumption
        rate and not the air consumption rate as before. Say a diver
        consumes one liter per minute of oxygen, and unlike the above
        calculation your body requires the same amount of oxygen at all
        depths. So, assume there is about half a percent of dissolved
        oxygen in the water, this result in the water flow requirement
        of only 200 liters per minute at all depths, which is not too
        bad, and we can make a compact machine for this. </p>
      <p>Question: Engineer Bodner, you are a diver yourself? </p>
      <p>Bodner: Yes, lately I dive mainly in the Red Sea in Eilat and
        in the Mediterranean Sea, in the past I also dived in the
        Bahamas and off California. </p>
      <p>Question: So you can be a guinea pig for your own invention
        now? </p>
      <p>Bodner: I'd love to, but there are also many other volunteers,
        I get lots of e-mail from people all over the world who want to
        volunteer, to be among the first to use the systems. </p>
      <p>Question: OK, let's go to the big question now. How long do you
        estimate that it might take before your remarkable invention
        actually goes on the market, becomes marketable, in a finished
        product? </p>
      <p>Bodner: I expect the complete work the complete working
        prototype in about two years; this is provided if I get more
        funding, a commercial product will be ready shortly thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>Question: Well, what can we say, perhaps when the Wright
        brothers talked about people flying like birds in the air,
        you're following in their footsteps and talking about people
        that can swim like fish in the sea. </p>
      <p>Bodner: Well I hope so but it's too early still to compare me
        with the Wright brothers but I appreciate the comparison. </p>
      <p>Question: Have you had approaches from manufacturing companies
        and so forth? </p>
      <p>Bodner: I have but the discussions are still at early stages so
        of course I cannot divulge which names I'm speaking to. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present application is a continuation-in-part of
        copending <br>
        parent application No. PCT/IB01/02142, filed Nov. 14, 2001, and
        claims <br>
        the benefit of U.S. Provisional Appln. No. 60/248,249, filed
        Nov. 15, 2000. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] This invention relates to self-contained underwater
        breathing <br>
        apparatus and methods. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Among known underwater respiration devices are those
        that supply air via a conduit from the Earth's atmosphere to a
        submerged user or, in the case of SCUBA, comprise a portable
        tank with breathable compressed gases including oxygen. In
        open-circuit SCUBA systems, the breathed, exhaust gas is
        discarded in the form of bubbles with each breath.
        Closed-circuit systems recycle the exhaust gas by adding oxygen
        to and removing carbon dioxide from exhaled breaths. </p>
      <p>[0004] U.S. Pat. No. 3,333,583 discloses a closed-circuit
        underwater respiration device which purifies and recycles a
        diver's exhaled breath. This purification is achieved by driving
        the exhaust breath through gas permeable tubes, which are
        surrounded by a current of seawater. Oxygen dissolved in the
        seawater then passively diffuses across the tubes into the
        exhaled breath while carbon dioxide similarly diffuses out. The
        breath is then supplied to the diver for breathing and the
        process is repeated indefinitely. </p>
      <p>[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 3,656,276 discloses a closed-circuit
        method and apparatus for reoxygenating and removing carbon
        dioxide from stale, breathed air in an underwater habitat by
        mixing it with seawater in intimate and agitated contact, and
        subsequently separating the refreshed air from the seawater. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] The present invention suggests a self-contained
        breathing apparatus that operates in an open-circuit SCUBA-like
        manner where the user's exhaled breath is expelled into the body
        of water in the form of bubbles. However, the apparatus of the
        present invention differs from conventional SCUBA in that it
        does not require a portable tank of breathable compressed gases.
      </p>
      <p>[0007] The apparatus of the present invention comprises an
        inlet means for extracting a quantity of water from said body of
        water, a separator for separating said dissolved air from said
        quantity of water thereby obtaining said breathable air, a first
        outlet means for expelling the separated water back into said
        body of water, and a second outlet means for removing said
        breathable air from the separator and supplying it for
        breathing. </p>
      <p>[0008] The apparatus is for use within any body of water that
        naturally contains dissolved air and it obtains breathable air
        directly from the surrounding water in which it is submerged.
        The body of water may be an ocean, lake, pond, river or any such
        body having breathing marine life such as fish. </p>
      <p>[0009] The present invention further suggests a method for
        providing breathable air from a body of water naturally
        containing dissolved air comprising the steps of drawing an
        amount of water from said body of water, separating said
        dissolved air from the drawn water and thereby obtaining said
        breathable air, expelling the separated water and supplying the
        separated air for breathing, and expelling the air back into
        said body of water after it has been breathed. </p>
      <p>[0010] An apparatus operating according to the method of the
        present invention may be relatively light and uncomplicated. It
        also eliminates the need to carry a set amount of breathing air,
        one of the primary factors normally limiting the amount of time
        that can be spent underwater. Also, since in the apparatus of
        the present invention, the separated air already meets a user's
        pressure requirements for breathing, the apparatus eliminates
        the need for a pressure regulator, which is necessary in SCUBA
        to lower the pressure of the compressed gases in the tank. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0015] FIG. 1 schematically shows a self-contained breathing
        apparatus 2 according to the present invention. The apparatus 2
        is adapted to provide breathable air and is designed for use
        within any body of water naturally containing dissolved air,
        such as an ocean, lake, pond, river and the like. As can be seen
        in FIG. 1, the apparatus 2 comprises two inlet means 4a and 4b
        for extracting a quantity of water from the body of water, but
        may have one or many such inlet means. The inlet means 4a, 4b
        may be any kind of conduit through which liquid can be
        conducted. </p>
      <p>[0016] The apparatus 2 further comprises a separator 6 for
        separating the dissolved air from the extracted quantity of
        water conducted thereto via the inlet means 4a and 4b. The
        separator 6 has a housing and also includes first outlet means
        8a and 8b for expelling the separated water back into the body
        of water, and second outlet means 10a and 10b for conducting the
        separated air out from the separator 6. The separator 6 may
        include one or many first and second outlet means, which may be
        any kind of conduit through which fluids can be conducted. </p>
      <p>[0017] The second outlet means 10a and 10b may include valves
        that only permit air to be conducted further. These valves may
        be any kind of mechanism preventing the passage of water but
        allowing the passage of air. One possible option for such a
        mechanism includes providing a portion of the outlet means 10a
        and 10b that tapers to a smaller cross-sectional area and also
        includes a floating body, similar to a ping pong ball, for
        example, having a larger cross-sectional area and, consequently,
        being capable of blocking the movement of water without
        hindering the passage of air. Since the separated air in the
        separator 6 rises above the water, the separator 6 may be
        designed to ensure that the outlet means 10a and 10b and valves
        are located on the upper part of the separator 6. In addition, a
        plurality of outlets with valves can be positioned at various
        points on the separator 6, thereby ensuring that at least one of
        them is always pointing up and in contact with the rising
        separated air. In this way, the air rises towards the highest
        outlets 10a, 10b, which conduct the air further, either directly
        to a location for breathing or to an air bag 14, which serves as
        a storage reservoir for breathable air. </p>
      <p>[0018] The air bag 14 may be any kind of storage reservoir, and
        may also be part of another body such as a floatation jacket or
        depth-adjusting bladder, thereby simultaneously serving multiple
        purposes. </p>
      <p>[0019] The apparatus 2 further comprises a pump 16 to pump
        water into the separator 6 via the inlet means 4a and 4b. The
        pump 16 may be any mechanism creating a flow of water through
        the separator 6 such as by drawing water in via one or more of
        the inlet means 4a and 4b and/or ejecting water out via one or
        more of the outlet means 8a and 8b. The pump 16 is motorized and
        may be powered electrically, using batteries for example, or
        mechanically, such as by using the efforts of a user. </p>
      <p>[0020] The apparatus 2 and method by which it functions can be
        employed in a variety of settings to provide breathable air to
        living beings such as in submersible quarters, e.g. submarines
        or underwater habitats, as well as in diving gear for use by
        individuals. The apparatus 2 may further be used to provide such
        breathable air for uses other than breathing, e.g. for supplying
        air to combustion engines. </p>
      <p>[0021] FIG. 2 illustrates a specific use of the apparatus 2
        according to the present invention designed for an individual
        diver 20 as in the case of SCUBA. In this use, the apparatus 2
        includes batteries 17 to supply electrical power thereto, which
        are arranged on a belt 18 worn by the diver 20. The belt 18 may
        also carry lead diving weights to provide the diver 20 with the
        additional weight needed to counter his natural buoyancy, or
        alternatively, the batteries may also provide or contribute to
        this needed weight. The diver 20 also wears the air bag 14,
        which simultaneously serves as a thermal and flotation jacket. </p>
      <p>[0022] FIG. 3 is a functional diagram schematically
        illustrating how an apparatus 2 according to the present
        invention may operate for an individual diver in an ocean.
        Seawater from the ocean is drawn into the apparatus 2 via the
        inlet means (not shown) by the pump 16 and enters the separator
        6. </p>
      <p>[0023] The separator 6 separates the dissolved air from the
        water by any known method of physical separation or combination
        thereof. Most such methods are based on passing the water across
        a pressure drop and examples include, but are not limited to,
        cavitation, volumetric increase, and the use of centrifugal
        force. Cavitation involves passing the water across a hydrofoil
        such as a propeller, which, due to its design, creates a lower
        pressure region on its trailing edge, resulting in the release
        of dissolved air. Volumetric increase entails passing the water
        from a smaller to a larger space, thus increasing the volume of
        the water and decreasing the pressure applied thereto, thereby
        causing the release of the dissolved air. The use of centrifugal
        force involves rotating the water at such a speed that the
        heavier water moves farther away from the axis of rotation than
        the lighter dissolved air, consequently resulting in its
        separation. </p>
      <p>[0024] The air-depleted seawater is expelled from the apparatus
        2 back into the ocean via the first outlet means (not shown).
        The air released by separation is breathable and is, preferably,
        conducted to the air bag 14 via the second outlet means (not
        shown), wherefrom it is supplied to the diver. Having been
        breathed by the diver, the air is expelled into the ocean. If
        the diver requires less air than is conducted to the air bag 14
        by the separator 6, the air bag 14 stores the air. When the air
        bag fills completely, the air separator 6 shuts down until the
        diver has <br>
        used a predetermined fraction of the air in the bag 14, at which
        point the separator 4 resumes supplying air to the air bag 14.
        In this way, the apparatus expends less power. In the case of an
        individual diver, it is preferable for the air bag 14 to be
        flexible and inflatable but at the same time made from a durable
        material to minimize its likelihood of being damaged since the
        diver draws his breath from the air bag 14. In the case of a
        submarine or underwater habitat, a storage reservoir such as an
        air bag 14 may not be necessary and the breathable air can be
        directly supplied to such spaces. </p>
      <p>[0025] Reverting back to FIG. 1, the separator 6 shown utilizes
        two propellers 12a and 12b to separate air from water by
        cavitation. The propellers 12a and 12b also contribute to
        separation by imparting a centrifugal force on the water. In
        addition, the propellers 12a and 12b drive the water through the
        separator 6, thereby acting as axial pumps, which may be used in
        place of or in conjunction with the pump 16. The separator 6 may
        also comprise air tubes 13 to attract rising bubbles of air as
        they are separated from the water and convey them to the outlets
        10a and 10b. The air tubes 13 may be made of a material (e.g.
        stainless steel) adapted to attract air bubbles based on the
        coalescence effect. </p>
      <p>[0026] The amount of breathing air required by a diver depends
        on many factors such as diving depth and extent of physical
        exertion and also varies from one individual to the next.
        Nonetheless, most divers, even during their highest exertion,
        require no more than 25 liters of air per minute, and so the
        separator 6 is designed to provide at least this minimum amount
        of air at this rate. While the apparatus 2 may be of various
        sizes, one possible example for use by an individual diver
        includes the apparatus 2 having separator 6 cylindrical in shape
        and approximately 10 inches in diameter at its base and 20
        inches long. For a separator 6 having these dimensions and two
        cavitating propellers spanning its inner diameter, at most
        depths, the pump 16 will need to provide about 2000 liters of
        average seawater per minute to the separator 6 in order to
        produce the aforementioned minimum amount of air required by the
        diver. </p>
      <p>[0027] As can be seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, the apparatus 2
        according to the present invention may include a small reserve
        tank 22 of compressed breathable gases to be used in the case of
        a malfunction, which prevents or hinders the providing of air. </p>
      <p>[0028] Also, as shown in FIG. 3, the apparatus 2 may include an
        air purifying mechanism, such as a scrubber 24, as known in the
        art, adapted to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and/or other
        undesirable gases present within the air bag 14 and to thereby
        enable delivery of a more healthy supply of breathable air to
        the diver 20. </p>
      <p>[0029] Reverting to FIG. 1, the apparatus 2 may also provide a
        diver or other submersible with propulsion by directing the flow
        of water via the first outlet means 8a and 8b in a desired
        manner. Provided with a means for varying their direction
        separately or in unison, the first outlet means 8a and 8b can be
        oriented to create thrust at a user's command and propel the
        diver or submersible in a desired direction. In this way, energy
        that would otherwise be expended to propel a diver or
        submersible is saved. </p>
      <p>[0030] It should be understood that the above described
        embodiments are only examples of a self-contained open-circuit
        underwater breathing apparatus and method for using same
        according to the present invention, and that the scope of the
        present invention fully encompasses other embodiments which may
        become obvious to those skilled in the art. For example, the
        apparatus may be used in underwater drilling, where a supply of
        air may be necessary. </p>
