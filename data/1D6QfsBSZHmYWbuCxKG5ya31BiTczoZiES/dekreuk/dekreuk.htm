      <p><b><font size="+1">Delft Water-Purification Method Promises
            Radical Improvement</font></b></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Delft University of Technology
      research has discovered a method that could drastically change the
      way we purify water within a few years. Delft, in partnership with
      DHV engineering bureau, has developed a compact and
      environmentally-friendly purification method, in which aerobic
      bacteria form granules that sink quickly. An important part of the
      project's success was the work of Delft researcher Merle de Kreuk,
      who, on Tuesday, 27 June, will receive her PhD degree based on
      this research subject. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">With the new aerobic granular sludge
      technology (Nereda TM), aerobic (thus oxygen using) bacterial
      granules are formed in the water that is to be purified. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The great advantage of these granules
        is that they sink quickly and that all the required biological
        purifying processes occur within these granules.</span> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The technology therefore offers
      important advantages when compared to conventional water
      purification processes. For example, <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">all the processes can occur in one reactor</span>.
      Moreover, there is <span style="font-weight: bold;">no need to
        use large re-sinking tanks</span>, such as those used for
      conventional purification. Such large tanks are needed for this
      because the bacteria clusters that are formed take much longer to
      sink than the aerobic granule sludge. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">According to Delft PhD researcher
      Merle de Kreuk, a Nereda TM purification installation <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">needs only a quarter of the space
        required by conventional installations</span>. Moreover, Nereda
      TM <span style="font-weight: bold;">uses 30% less energy than the
        normal purification process.</span> This Nereda TM purification
      process is suitable for both domestic and industrial waste water.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Delft University of Technology has a
      long tradition in researching the possibilities of water
      purification with aerobic granular sludge. The maturation of the
      technology is largely due to the research conducted by De Kreuk.
      During her PhD research with Prof. Mark van Loosdrecht, De Kreuk –
      working together with DHV engineering bureau and supported by
      STOWA and STW grants – solved various technological bottlenecks
      and expanded the capacity of the test installation from 3 litres
      per hour to 1,500 litres per hour. DHV now has the final design,
      which is ready for practical implementation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The aerobic granular sludge technology
      is very promising, and has been nominated for the Dutch Process
      Innovation Award 2006. The technology is now in the
      commercialisation phase. In the coming years, De Kreuk will
      continue to contribute to the project's trajectory as a Delft
      researcher. DHV is currently negotiating with water purification
      companies to test this purification method on a larger scale. The
      first installations are already in use in the industrial sector.<br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The present invention relates to a method of acquiring granular
        growth of a microorganism in a reactor containing a liquid phase
        which comprises a substrate, wherein in a first step said
        substrate is converted by the microorganism resulting in the
        formation of and growth on a phase comprising the organism while
        the liquid phase is being mixed, in a second step mixing in the
        reactor is stopped to allow part of the solid phase to settle,
        and in a third step the reactor is partly emptied by discharging
        the top part of the reactor contents, which reactor is
        subsequently replenished with substrate-comprising liquid, to
        repeat steps 1 to 3.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
        <br>
        Such a method has been described by Sung S. et al. (Laboratory
        studies of the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, in Water
        Environment Research, 67 (3), p. 294, 1995). In this method an
        anaerobic conversion is carried out, the contents of the reactor
        are then clarified in characteristically 10-30 minutes after
        which the top part of the reactor contents is discharged.
        According to this publication work with anaerobically activated
        sludge has long been known, although it was not recognized in
        the beginning (1966) that what was occurring was "granulation"
        of the biomass. Granulation under methanogenic conditions (that
        is to say in the absence of oxygen) is often explained by the
        specific need of the respective organisms to exchange substrates
        the so-called "interspecies hydrogen transfer", or to reduce the
        toxicity of oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, applicant has found that granulation can also
        occur under aerobic and turbulent conditions.<br>
        <br>
        The method according to the invention is therefore characterized
        in that the microorganism is an aerobic microorganism, in that
        at least during the first step a third phase is present, which
        third phase comprises oxygen-containing gas being fed to the
        reactor during the first step while the contents of the reactor
        are kept in turbulence, and in that settling occurs in the
        second step and takes less time than the height of liquid in the
        reactor at the end of the first step divided by a settling
        velocity of at least 5 meters per hour.<br>
        <br>
        The formation of granules under turbulent aerobic conditions is
        unexpected, because organisms in a granule are under very great
        stress as due to the size of the granule, nutrients have to
        diffuse over large distances before reaching the interior of a
        granule. The fact that in addition aerobic organisms require
        oxygen, increases the stress still more so that one would expect
        such aerobic organisms only to flocculate. In addition, the
        expert would expect the granules to disintegrate due to the
        great shearing forces caused by the turbulence.<br>
        <br>
        In the present application an aerobic microorganism is
        understood to be both an obligate and a facultative aerobic
        microorganism.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the compound is fed to the reactor in pulses. This
        causes the organisms in a granule to be flooded with compound.
        As the organisms at the outside of the granule are unable to
        process such a supply of compound, the compound gets the
        opportunity to diffuse into the interior of the granule. This is
        especially important if the compound to be converted is a
        nutrient. An example of this is carbohydrate fermentation for
        the preparation of lactic acid.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with a favourable embodiment the contents of the
        reactor are substantially continuously mixed during the first
        step.<br>
        <br>
        To promote the formation of aggregates, Sung et al. prefer
        periodical mixing during which only slight shearing forces
        occur. According to the invention, however, continuous turbulent
        mixing subjects flocs to mixing forces, allowing them to be
        discharged more easily in the third step. In addition, applicant
        has established by experimentation that if microorganisms are
        subjected to great shearing forces, the result is a more robust
        granule. Thus according to the invention the organisms in the
        reactor form into granules more quickly.<br>
        <br>
        Turbulent mixing is conveniently carried out by feeding
        oxygen-containing gas into, for instance, an airlift-reactor or
        bubbling-bed reactor.<br>
        <br>
        An interesting application of the method according to the
        invention is characterized in that the conversion is a
        nitrification-denitrification-conversion in which the
        oxygen-containing gas is only supplied during the first part of
        the first step for the completion of the nitrification, and that
        the reactor operates during the remainder of the first step
        under substantially anaerobic conditions for the completion of
        the denitrification. If desired, the gas may during this first
        step be recirculated over the reactor. Due to recirculation all
        oxygen is used up and turbulence is maintained.<br>
        <br>
        When applying the method according to the invention, the
        organism-comprising granules must be present, or at least
        conditions promoting the formation of granules must be provided
        before starting up the reactor. It is useful, for instance, to
        feed the reactor with carrier particles to which organisms
        adhere, or are able to adhere. It has been shown that a
        mycelium-forming fungus can also be used as carrier.<br>
        <br>
        According to a very favourable embodiment settling occurs in the
        second step, taking less time than the height of liquid in the
        reactor at the end of the first step divided by a settling
        velocity of at least 10 meters per hour, preferably at least 15
        meters per hour. Thus the presence of granules in the reactor is
        strongly favoured in comparison with the presence of flocs. As
        mentioned above, Sung et al. describe a clarification step
        taking characteristically 10 to 30 minutes. The settling
        velocity is then only 1 meter per hour, and applied to aerobic
        organisms such a method will not result in granulation. While
        under anaerobic conditions the clarification step merely serves
        to separate organisms and treated water, is also the
        clarification step in the method according to the invention of
        essential importance for the induction of granulation.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br>
        <br>
        A bubbling-bed reactor (2.5 liters; height/diameter 20) was fed
        with 1.25 liters of a solution serving as model for waste water,
        comprising 8.7 mM ethanol, 5 mM ammonium chloride, 4.7 mM
        potassium phosphate, 2.4 mM magnesium sulphate, 0.48 calcium
        chloride and per liter solution 1.5 ml of a standard solution of
        trace elements. The solution was inoculated with aerobically
        active sludge from a water treatment plant. The model waste
        water in the bubbling bed reactor was subjected to a cyclic
        treatment at pH 6-8 and a temperature of 20.degree. C. The
        treatment consisted of i) aerating for 4 hours at a flow rate of
        1.5 liters air per minute (FIG. 1 shows the carbon dioxide
        percentage in the gas discharged from a bubbling-bed reactor
        during this phase. This percentage is a measure of the
        conversion of the ethanol), ii) the one-minute stoppage of
        aeration, and iii) draining model waste water from the
        bubbling-bed reactor at the half-way point of the column of
        liquid. Any biomass present during draining in the top half of
        the solution, was discharged together with the effluent.
        Finally, iv) the bubbling-bed reactor was replenished with a
        volume of model waste water equal to that of the discharged
        effluent. The cycle was then resumed with four hours aeration of
        the solution.<br>

        wastewater thus obtained being subjected, if required, in a
        second stage without the infeed of oxygen, to denitrification in
        the presence of a carbon source such as methanol, in such a way
        that the contact time between the ammonium-rich wastewater and
        the nitrifying bacteria is at most about two days, and the pH of
        the medium is controlled between 6.5 and 8.5 by the infeed of
        the said carbon source, and the excess, formed by growth, of
        nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and the effluent formed by
        the denitrification are extracted, the demand for the said
        carbon source during the treatment being controlled as a
        function of the amount of heat produced in the reactor. In
        addition the growth rate of the nitrifying and denitrifying
        bacteria is expediently controlled by means of the retention
        time, in the reactor, of the wastewater to be treated which is
        fed in.<br>

        <br>
        The invention relates to a method for the biological treatment
        of ammonium-rich wastewater in at least one reactor which has a
        temperature of at least 25.degree. C., by the wastewater being
        passed through the said reactor(s) with a population, obtained
        by natural selection in the absence of sludge retention, in the
        suspended state of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to form,
        in a first stage with the infeed of oxygen, a nitrite-rich
        wastewater and by the nitrite-rich wastewater thus obtained
        being subjected, if required, in a second stage without the
        infeed of oxygen, to denitrification in the presence of a carbon
        source such as methanol, in such a way that the retention time
        of the ammonium-rich wastewater is at most about three days, and
        the pH of the medium is controlled between 6.5 and 8.5 by the
        infeed of the said carbon source, and the excess, formed by
        growth, of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and the effluent
        formed by the denitrification are extracted.<br>
        <br>
        Such a method is known from a publication in Delft Outlook,
        95.2, pp. 14-17. However, the research reported in this
        publication was carried out on a laboratory scale and does not
        provide any suggestion whatsoever on the measures required for
        using such a process in practice to achieve adequate cleaning of
        the wastewater in question.<br>
        <br>
        As a result of discharge standards having become more stringent,
        in particular for nitrogen, there is a need for efficient,
        cost-effective purification systems for the treatment of
        wastewater. Examples of these concentrated industrial wastewater
        streams are, wastewater streams like those released with off-gas
        treatment etc. Another example of the concentrated nitrogen-rich
        wastewater stream is the so-called rejection water. This
        rejection water stream is formed after dewatering of fully
        digested sewage sludge and has not only a high ammonium
        concentration (about 1000 mg of NH.sub.4 -N per litre) but also
        a high temperature (usually about 30.degree. C.). The ammonium
        in the rejection water may account for as much as 15% of the
        total nitrogen loading of a wastewater treatment installation,
        while the volume flow of the rejection water is only less than
        1% of the wastewater volume flow to be processed. This rejection
        water therefore makes a considerable contribution to the
        nitrogen loading of the treatment installation.<br>
        <br>
        The biological treatment of such wastewater streams normally
        makes use of treatment processes in which the high sludge
        concentrations required are obtained by employing a form of
        sludge retention such as settling, membrane filtration,
        attachment to filter media, etc. In that context it is worth
        drawing attention to the STOWA report 95-08, which relates to
        the treatment of nitrogen-rich return streams in sewage plants,
        and to the Proc. 18th IAWQ Biennial, Water Quality International
        '96, 23-28 June 1996, Singapore, pp. 321-328.<br>
        <br>
        An, as it happens, frequently used treatment process is known as
        the activated-sludge system. Such a system is characterized on
        the one hand by employing sludge retention by sludge settling
        and, on the other hand, by the bacteria mainly being present in
        so-called activated-sludge flocculae. Such flocculae usually
        have a size of 0.1-2 mm.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        It should be noted that the present process of biological
        nitrogen removal preferably proceeds in two successive stages,
        an aerobic and an anoxic stage. Both stages can, in the present
        invention, take place in one reactor, separated in time, or in
        separate reactors which may or may not involve a return stream
        to the first stage. In the first stage the nitrogen present as
        ammonium is largely converted into nitrite, with the aid of
        oxygen and nitrifying bacteria. The second stage comprises the
        conversion of nitrite into molecular nitrogen, said conversion
        being anoxic and taking place with the aid of denitrifying
        bacteria. These denitrifying bacteria require a carbon source
        such as methanol, to carry out the said conversion.<br>
        <br>
        We have now found, surprisingly, that the method as set forth in
        the preamble can be carried out on an industrial scale, with an
        ammonium removal efficiency of more than 90% being achieved, by
        controlling the demand of the denitrifying bacteria for a carbon
        source, in this case methanol.<br>
        <br>
        More in particular we have found that the methanol demand during
        the treatment can be controlled as a function of the amount of
        heat produced in the reactor. These parameters proved to be
        directly proportional to one another. As will be explained
        hereinafter, the pH of the medium is controlled at the same time
        by means of the methanol being metered.<br>
        <br>
        It should be noted that during the nitrification two moles of
        protons are produced per oxidized mole of ammonium. The pH drops
        as a result. The pH is usually controlled by feeding alkali
        and/or acid into the reactor. During denitrification, on the
        other hand, protons are consumed. Denitrification furthermore
        takes place under anoxic conditions, nitrite being used as an
        electron acceptor. For denitrification to be possible, the
        presence of not only an electron acceptor, but also of an
        electron donor is required. Methanol, for example, is indeed
        added at the same time in the present process as an electron
        donor.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the following may be noted with respect to the
        present process. For the purpose of nitrogen removal, the
        ammonium present in the wastewater is not nitrified to nitrate
        but only to nitrite. Indeed, the term of nitritifying bacteria
        is sometimes used, to indicate more clearly that what takes
        place predominantly is the formation of nitrite. The
        denitrifying bacteria which are capable of anoxic conversion of
        both the nitrate and the nitrite into molecular nitrogen,
        consume a carbon source such as methanol, as explained above.
        The conversion of nitrite into molecular nitrogen requires on
        its own, however, about 40% less methanol than the conversion of
        nitrate into nitrogen. Moreover, the oxidation of nitrite to
        nitrate costs oxygen. Indeed, direct conversion of nitrite into
        nitrogen provides another (approximately) 25% savings on the
        oxygen account. The conversion via nitrite instead of nitrate is
        therefore very advantageous in economic terms.<br>
        <br>
        If, under certain circumstances, the conversion via nitrate is
        more attractive, however, than the conversion via nitrite, this
        can obviously be achieved by extending the retention time, of
        the wastewater to be treated, in the present process.<br>
        <br>
        In an expedient variation of the present process in addition the
        growth rate of the nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria is
        controlled by means of the retention time, in the reactor, of
        the wastewater to be treated which is fed in. This retention
        time is an important parameter, since the stability of the
        nitrifying process may be put at risk as a result of the maximum
        growth rate of the biomass decreasing as the temperature
        decreases. This therefore requires a higher temperature than
        with known, more conventional processes. In practical trials the
        influent of the reactor was found to have a temperature of
        30.degree. C. The biological conversion such as the
        nitrification will cause the temperature to rise by about
        15.degree. C. per gram of nitrogen per litre removed. Increasing
        the process control temperature beyond 40.degree. C., however,
        is not advantageous to the stability of the present process. By
        controlling the amount to be fed in of wastewater to be treated
        it is therefore possible to control the growth rate of the
        biomass; the temperature in the system and consequently the heat
        production therein then reflects the conversion in the system.<br>
        <br>
        It was found that a retention time of the amount of wastewater
        to be fed in of 0.5-2.5 days, preferably of 1.3-2.0 days,
        affords optimum results, i.e. an overall removal efficiency of
        more than 90%.<br>
        <br>
        Expediently, the retention time in the aerobic phase is from 0.5
        to 2 days and in the anoxic phase from 0.4 to 1 day. A reduction
        in the retention time in the aerobic phase may lead to an
        improvement in the ammonium conversion ratio. This is caused by
        a longer retention time for the denitrifying bacteria then being
        achieved with an identical cycle time of the aerobic and anoxic
        period. This produces a higher average pH, as a result of which
        the ammonium conversion rate is increased. If the retention time
        in the aerobic phase is extended at the expense of the retention
        time in the anoxic phase, the pH is not sufficiently stabilized
        by the denitrifying bacteria and the conversion ratio drops
        again. However, if the retention time in the aerobic phase is
        reduced too far, the nitrifying bacteria will be flushed out and
        as a result the conversion ratio again drops.<br>
        <br>
        Although control of the pH of the process according to the
        invention is effected by methanol being metered as a function of
        the amount of heat produced by the biological treatment,
        monitoring of the pH is obviously possible by the pH of the
        medium being measured directly. As explained above, protons (or
        acid ions) are produced during the nitrification process, as a
        result of which the pH of the medium drops in accordance with
        the equation<br>
        <br>
        The nitrification rate is therefore pH-dependent, so that
        conversely the pH can be regarded as a relevant process
        parameter. It was found, incidentally, that during the
        nitrification buffering may take place by bicarbonate
        (HCO.sub.3.sup.-) which is present in the rejection water fed
        into the reactor or is added, in accordance with the equation<br>
        <br>
        For an optimum effect it is important, in this context, that the
        carbon dioxide is transported (stripped) from the liquid phase
        to the gas phase. With respect to dimensioning the reactor to be
        used in the method according to the invention it was indeed
        found, in this context, that in the case of a ratio of volume to
        bottom area of the reactor in the range of 2-10 very beneficial
        results are achieved in terms of the
        nitrification-denitrification process according to the
        invention.<br>
        <br>
        The characteristic feature of the invention is that the process
        takes place without sludge retention being employed, i.e. the
        sludge retention time is equal to the liquid retention time. To
        achieve this, both the mixing and the discharge of the treated
        water need to be effective. Good mixing can be obtained by
        employing, for example, aeration in the aerobic phase, and in
        the anoxic phase, for example, by employing mechanical
        agitators, liquid injection, introduction of low-oxygen or
        oxygen-free gases etc. As a result of these measures a very
        active bacterial population is obtained, which is mainly present
        in the liquid phase as free cells and/or very small clusters of
        a limited number of cells, rather than activated-sludge
        flocculae.<br>
        <br>
        It should further be noted that the denitrification in the
        reactor is carried out under essentially oxygen-free conditions.
        Such conditions can be formed spontaneously as a result of
        denitrifying bacteria consuming the oxygen present, the
        environment consequently automatically becoming anoxic.
        Expediently, and to accelerate the process if required, the
        denitrification is carried out, however, with recycling of the
        nitrogen already formed previously by denitrification. An
        additional advantage of this is that the nitrogen stream through
        the reactor at the same time strips the carbon dioxide from the
        reactor.<br>
        <br>
        As indicated above, the excess, formed by growth, of nitrifying
        and denitrifying bacteria is extracted. In practice this
        involves these bacteria being entrained by the effluent from the
        reactor and being added to the main stream of the wastewater
        treatment process, after which the further removal of residual
        ammonium is carried out.<br>
        <br>
        It should be noted that the effluent from the reactor is
        preferably withdrawn therefrom at a point below the liquid level
        prevailing in the reactor, expediently with local intensive
        mixing. While at the moment this cannot be stated with
        certainty, this measure may be essential for a process without
        sludge retention.<br>
        <br>
        According to an attractive variation of the method according to
        the invention, the nitrite-rich, acidic effluent formed by
        nitrification is used, at least in part, for the neutralization
        of ammonia. This ammonia can be present both in the rejection
        water to be treated and, alternatively, in a process stream of
        whatever origin. The treatment can be carried out, for example,
        in a gas scrubbing installation known per se, whereas the
        effluent obtained after treatment can be recycled, for further
        treatment, to the nitrification reactor according to the
        invention.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SURVEY OF THE DRAWINGS</span><br>
        <br>
        The accompanying <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIGS. 1 and 2</span>
        schematically show the progress of the
        nitrification/denitrification process according to the
        invention. More in particular, FIG. 1 provides a sketch of the
        pH profile in the reactor, the pH being controlled between 8 and
        7 with the addition of methanol.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 2 also represents the change in time, produced by methanol
        being fed in, of the nitrite concentration and ammonium
        concentration for one cycle.<br>
        <br>
        It should be noted that if it is undesirable or less desirable
        for the bacteria present in the effluent to reach the main
        stream of the wastewater treatment process when the effluent is
        recycled to said main stream, said effluent, according to a very
        expedient embodiment of the method according to the invention,
        is first subjected to a treatment with protozoa. Such a
        variation is of interest, in particular, if the influent of the
        reactor is a COD-containing wastewater. The term COD refers, as
        usual, to chemical oxygen demand; the component relevant thereto
        in solution is primarily formed by carbon bound in organic
        compounds. This material acts as a nutrient for the bacteria
        present in the reactor. By subjecting the effluent of the
        biological treatment to a treatment with protozoa it proved
        possible to largely remove the bacteria suspended in the
        effluent and entrained from the reactor.<br>
        <br>
        It should also be noted that the principle, employed in the
        method according to the invention, of the absence of sludge
        retention can also expediently be employed in the treatment of
        COD-containing wastewater. More in particular this then means
        replacing the present nitrite route by the COD route, in which
        case an overall removal efficiency of more than 50% was
        obtained.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is explained in more detail with reference to an
        exemplary embodiment.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE</span><br>
        <br>
        In this example a continuous flow reactor without sludge
        retention was employed. Such a reactor makes it possible for the
        bacterial population having the lowest maximum growth rate to be
        flushed from the system selectively.<br>
        <br>
        The reason for this is that a retention time can be used which
        is lower than the maximum reciprocal growth rate of the one
        bacterial population (in this case the nitrite oxidizers which
        oxidize the nitrite present to nitrate), but is higher than the
        maximum reciprocal growth rate of the other bacterial population
        (in this case the ammonium oxidizers). Flushing out the nitrite
        oxidizers therefore leads to a build-up of nitrite in the
        reactor.<br>
        <br>
        The reactor used had a diameter of about 20 m and a height of 6
        m and therefore an effective volume of about 1150 m.sup.3.<br>
        <br>
        The influent for the reactor, the so-called rejection water, had
        a temperature of about 30.degree. C. and an ammonia
        concentration of about 1000 mg of N/l, while the total amount of
        rejection water fed in was about 760 m.sup.3 per day.<br>
        <br>
        For the purpose of converting ammonia into nitrite, followed by
        the conversion into nitrogen, the reactor contained about 120 kg
        of biomass.<br>
        <br>
        The treatment of the rejection water took place in the reactor
        with a cycle configuration as shown in FIG. 2, i.e. a cycle time
        of about 2 hours consisting of an aeration period of .+-.80 min,
        followed by a period involving recycling of the nitrogen gas
        formed in a first period of bout 40 min.<br>
        <br>
        In the steady state of the process the amount of rejection water
        fed to the reactor was such that the retention time was about
        1.5 days. The infeed of methanol was about 1 kg per kg of
        nitrogen bound as ammonium and was effected in such a way, while
        the temperature difference between the input and the output of
        the reactor was being measured, that the pH of the medium could
        be kept between about 7.2 and 7.7.<br>
        <br>
        The rejection water thus treated had a nitrogen concentration of
        as little as about 80 mg of total N.multidot.l.sup.-1, which
        could be recycled for treatment to the main stream of the
        treatment installation. The result of the treatment of this
        rejection water was therefore a purification efficiency of about
        90%. <br>

        <b>Abstract:</b> The invention relates to a method of treating
        ammonia-comprising waste water in which the bicarbonate ion is
        the counter ion of the ammonium ion present in the waste water.
        According to the invention half the ammonium is converted into
        nitrite, yielding an ammonia and nitrite-containing solution,
        and in the second step the nitrite is used as oxidant for the
        ammonia. In the method according to the invention the conversion
        of half the ammonia into nitrite occurs automatically, providing
        a method which requires fewer controls. Also, the method
        according to the invention requires no external additive.<br>
