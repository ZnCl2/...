        <div align="left"> Today the group of enthusiasts can slow down
          or speed up the course of time using special impact of the
          magnetic field. The biggest slowing down of time made up 1.5
          seconds within an hour of the equipment's operation in labs.<br>
          <br>
          In August 2001, a new model of the time machine meant for a
          human was set in a remote forest in Russia's Volgograd Region.
          When the machine even operated on car batteries and had low
          capacity, it still managed to change the time by three per
          cent; the change was registered with symmetrical crystal
          oscillators.<br>
          <br>
          At first, the researchers spent five, ten and twenty minutes
          in the operating machine; the longest stay lasted for half an
          hour. Vadim Chernobrov said that the people felt as if they
          moved to a different world; they felt life here and "there" at
          the same time as if some space was unfolding. "I cannot define
          the unusual feelings that we experienced at such moments." <br>
          <br>
          A tragedy occurred on August 30, 1989: an extremely strong
          explosion sounded at the Institute's branch office on the
          Anjou islands. The explosion destroyed not only the
          experimental module of 780 tons but also the archipelago
          itself that covered the area of 2 square kilometers. According
          to one of the versions of the tragedy, the module with three
          experimenters collided with a large object, probably an
          asteroid, in the parallel world or heading toward the parallel
          world. Having lost its propulsion system, the module probably
          remained in the parallel world.<br>
          <br>
          The last record made in the framework of the experiment and
          kept at the Institute archives says: "We are dying but keep on
          conducting the experiment. It is very dark here; we see all
          objects become double, our hands and legs are transparent, we
          can see veins and bones through the skin. The oxygen supply
          will be enough for 43 hours, the life support system is
          seriously damaged. Our best regards to the families and
          friends!" Then the transmission suddenly stopped.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> True story: I met one of the
          pioneers of the art in Moscow in 1994. His name is Vadim
          Chernobrov, and he's pretty far out there. An energetic
          Russian with an Abe Lincoln beard and a polyester three-piece
          suit, Chernobrov cut his teeth in UFO research as an employee
          of the "spacecraft department" of Moscow's Aviation Institute.
          ("We will conquer Mars in 1994," the scientists there used to
          joke, "and Snickers in '96.") At one stage Chernobrov even
          built his own spaceship but said, years later and with a
          twinge of sadness: "It didn't work."<br>
          <br>
          So he decided to branch into time travel. Not surprisingly, he
          had problems getting state funding. With his meager savings he
          built a time machine himself. (To avoid ridicule, Chernobrov
          and his team didn't actually call it a time machine. They
          preferred "Prospective Space Transportation System.") It was
          small: slightly larger than a basketball, in fact, and
          covered, apparently, in papier-mache ("electromagnetic skins,"
          Chernobrov explained). It had the look of a science project
          thrown together the night before it was due.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> The orb had a top panel that
          could lift up, revealing a tangle of wires and several small
          clocks. One wire poked out, connecting the device to an
          electrical transformer. Since the Prospective Space
          Transportation System was small, Chernobrov &amp; Co. couldn't
          send people back, or even forward, in time. So they tossed in
          mice instead. For an hour at a time the rodents would skitter
          about among the wires, and then Chernobrov would remove them
          and conduct tests. The mice, he somehow determined, had aged
          merely 3,560 seconds -- 40 seconds fewer than the 3,600 ticks
          Chernobrov and the rest of the world had experienced outside
          the ball. The electromagnetic fields, he said, altered the
          passage of time. "Don't be frightened," the Russian man said.
          "Some of us are a bit slower or accelerated under normal
          circumstances. Give or take 40 seconds, who's going to
          notice?"<br>
          <br>
          But Chernobrov sensed he was on the verge of something that
          could change our world. After all, Einstein, in his special
          theory of relativity, had shown that time slows down for
          objects moving close to the speed of light. In fact, said
          Chernobrov, a time traveler has already appeared on earth. He
          is Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor viewed by many Chinese as the
          founder of the country 6,000 years ago. According to
          Chernobrov, Huang Di came in a cone-shaped UFO. When I looked
          puzzled, Chernobrov said: "The Chinese could explain it to you
          better."<br>
          <br>
          Who knows, the future may regard Chernobrov as a visionary.
          The present hardly knows he exists. "This is dangerous work --
          unless you know how to control it," he said. "To a certain
          extent I'm taking risks with my reputation."<br>

          In experiments on deceleration and acceleration of a physical
          Time in small closed volume conducted since 1988, among other
          things the effect electromagnetic of fields on space-time
          continuum was checked. The experimental system for such effect
          represented set of electromagnets, are connected among
          themselves in serial and in parallel and installed on the
          globe-shaped surfaces. In various experiments from 3 up to 5
          such surfaces, Electromagnetic Working Surfaces (EWS) was
          used. All EWS layers of various diameters were installed
          consistently in each other (similarly to Russian toy
          "matrioshka"). The maximum EWS size was made about meter, the
          minimum EWS diameter (internal) was equal to 115 mm, that has
          appeared sufficient to place inside of EWS the gauges of the
          control and experimental animals (various kinds insect and
          laboratory Mouses ), to investigate the effects of converging
          spherical electromagnetic of waves were checked up.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> The measurements of rate of a
          course of a Time were conducted by all probable known modern
          ways of measurement of a time: all kinds electronic, quartz,
          mechanical, nuclear hours were used; as well as the specially
          made duplicated quartz generators (in which were compared the
          indications of frequencies of standard and heat-shielded
          generators); fiber-optic line diodes and other ways was fixed.
          Though on some kinds of measuring devices, for example, quartz
          hours, are collateral influenced by other physical factors,
          but the duplication of methods of measurement permitted
          essentially reduce a error of measurement. Thus change of
          speed of current of a time (was reached that the Professor
          Kozyrev named as density of time t / tE, where tE is normal
          time of Earth space and t is local time inside of the
          experimental system) is about a share of seconds earthly hour,
          though in one of experience because of some non-completely
          known reasons, the deceleration of time has made -4 minutes
          per 8 hour ( -30 sec per hour). Slowing down of rate of a time
          up to -1,5 sec per hour and acceleration up to + 0,5 sec per
          hour was found out and explained. If to accept a usual
          reference Time as tE= + 1, will become clear, that while we
          investigate a range of speed of a Time + 0,99 &lt; t / tE &lt;
          + 1,01. Hence subjects and animals, placed inwards at any mode
          of operations (slowing down or acceleration) in any case moved
          in Future faster or slower that ones in environmental area of
          space.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> In experience was established,
          that the processes of slowing down and acceleration of a Time
          sharply differ on character and consequences. So, the slowing
          down of a Time occurred considerably more smoothly and
          steadily; at acceleration sharp jumps in the were observed
          indications, this mode was characterized by general
          instability and dependence on any external factors. In
          particular, the instability of acceleration of speed of a Time
          depended on a time of days and arrangement of the Moon,
          probably and from other reasons, including operator presence.
          Even small external effect, for example mechanical vibration,
          resulted in change of size of speed, including to significant.

        <div style="text-align: left;"> His Time-machine report of 1996
          about Time Machine design and experimental results was first
          such sort report I saw. The Machine is complex systems of many
          electromagnets and its diameter is about 1 meter.<br>
          <br>
          It is his many-layers electromagnetic system. In the report he
          said only several words about the principles and their
          technical realization: there are electromagnets and they are
          powered in special impulse mode to create "wave that is moving
          to central point of the system".<br>
          <br>
          By my theory it is the way (one of many other ways) to create
          the "energy pumping" for some local space-time. In Ether
          theory the idea is "to change the density of the Ether".<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Chernobrov's understanding of Time structure is not
          theoretical ideas only but it is based on his experimental
          results: the rate of time flow was changed about 2 sec per 1
          hour of experiment, he reported in 1996.<br>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">It is known that the first
        experimental study of physical properties of Time were made by
        professor N.A.Kozyrev, who wrote some papers on causal or
        asymmetrical mechanics. It was conducted experiments on
        management of direction and rate of a sequence of a time. Since
        1967 in Moscow Air Institute under the direction of the
        Professor F. Yu. Zigel ( up to his death in 1988) the researches
        of UFOs those have some technical form were conducted. According
        to the work on opened State Budget theme " Preliminary
        researches on the abnormal phenomena in the atmosphere " much
        information was collected. The information collected consisted
        of whole file of odd and grouped information on this phenomena.
        The information was used to determine cause and effect
        connections and physical processes which where determined by
        authentic cases of traces and fragments, cinema and photos, and
        telemetering images of UFOs which started from the time of 1987
        onward. The data for some part of these objects their body
        (surface of device) influences the rate and direction of a
        course of a Time. To confirm this last statement, a series of
        experiments were made from 4 types of laboratory installations (
        and in the present time it is conducted one more system for new
        experiments). </div>

        of time has made -4 minutes per 8 hour ( -30 sec per hour ).
        Slowing down of rate of a time up to -1,5 sec per hour and
        acceleration up to + 0,5 sec per hour was found out and
        explained. If to accept a usual reference Time as tE= + 1, will
        become clear, that while we investigate a range of speed of a
        Time + 0,99 &lt; t / tE &lt; + 1,01. Hence subjects and animals,
        placed inwards at any mode of operations ( slowing down or
        acceleration ) in any case moved in Future faster or slower that
        ones in environmental area of space. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In experience was established, that
        the processes of slowing down and acceleration of a Time sharply
        differ on character and consequences. So, the slowing down of a
        Time occurred considerably more smoothly and steadily; at
        acceleration sharp jumps in the were observed indications, this
        mode was characterized by general instability and dependence on
        any external factors. In particular, the instability of
        acceleration of speed of a Time depended on a time of days and
        arrangement of the Moon, probably and from other reasons,
        including operator presence. Even small external effect, for
        example mechanical vibration, resulted in change of size of
        speed, including to significant. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Despite small size of change of a
        Time, even such small acceleration can be named as similarity
        "trips in Future " but the slowing down less than - 1 hour per
        hour cannot be considered " as trip in Past". So, the Physics of
        a Time of Future radical image differs from Physics of a Time of
        Past. Present - there is transition, conversion of a
        multialternative Future in one-alternative and unchangeable the
        Past. From here follows, that flight in Past ( at the "negative
        density t / tE") and in Future will really occur differently; in
        any degree they can be compared to moves of a ant along a tree:
        from any point of a tree (from Present ) for ant there is only
        one way downwards (in Past) and set of ways upwards ( in Future
        ). However, among all ways in Future there are doubtless and
        most probable variants of development for the Future, also there
        are impossible and almost possible. The movement in Future will
        be especially astable and power-intensive if less probable will
        appear given Variant of the Future. According to given "by the
        law of a top of a tree ", the return only if traveler in time
        does not interfere in occurring around and course of a past
        history does not change, otherwise this traveler will return in
        parallel Present of History of other branch of the tree. The
        penetration in Future from the Present is hindered by choice of
        a branch of moving, but the returning from any variant the
        Future in Present is possible at any script of behavior. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Experiments have confirmed also,
        that the Person and Time make very strong influence on each
        other. The effect of the operator on a course of experience is
        revealed, but it is not investigated up to the end. It is found
        out also, that the harmful effect on the biological system makes
        not a process of moving in a time itself but the difference of
        speed of change of a Time on various sites of a body. Inside of
        a laboratory installation it was also fixed, that the Time can
        be change with some inertiality. Sites of the space with a
        various Time have vague borders. At a sufficient difference in
        speed of change of a Time, the human eye can see other Time as
        white mist, at more greater difference - as lighting mist, that
        can serve as a signal of danger. It is possible to consider,
        that time-travels are possible, and (after experiments with
        mouses and other supervision) are some basis to think, that they
        will be safe for travelers if they observance some rules. It is
        specially necessary to emphasize, that the trips in time, due to
        opened properties of a Time, can not affect on Past and to
        change our past history. All so named paradoxes for travelers in
        time (when he "meet himself in Past" or "kill his grandfather in
        his children's age " ) have fine solutions in 3- dimensional
        time. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is possible to consider as a
        proven by some way, that the Time has more than one measurement,
        i.e. theoretical calculations by O. Bartini are confirmed, that
        the Time has 3 dimensions. Hence, our Earth world can be
        considered as 6-dimensional, and dimensions accordingly are: a
        length, width, height, age or date of a Time, variant of a
        History or erosion of a Time, density or speed of a Time. The
        concept for "Arrow of a T thus completely away in the fourth
        measurement ( date of a Time ), but enters by particular case in
        concept of the sixth dimension (speed of a Time ), with which
        physical concepts of a gravitation and energy are simultaneously
        also connected. Concepts of the " Einstein-Rosen bridges",
        entered in 1916, or "worm-holes", entered in science by John
        Willer at the end of 50th years, are by such sort approach the
        travels in 5th and 6th dimensions "classical" travel in time
        that was described by G. Wells will thus occur at various
        variants of trip in 4, 5, 6, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>,
        in all measurements of a Time.<br>
