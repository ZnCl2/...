      <p>1. A radar shows a huge ionic column reaching a few kilometers
        into the sky above The 44-meter Golden Section Pyramid </p>
      <p>With the help of a series of radars working in the centimeter
        range and placed at 60 km, 32 km and 30 km from the Pyramid,
        scientists conducted radiolocation of the area of vertical axis
        of the Pyramid. During this research, the existence of an ionic
        column with a height of 2000 meters and width of 500 meters
        along the vertical axis of the pyramid was established. This
        allegedly ionic column was constantly changing its height from
        800 meters to 2000 meters. The reflecting ability of this
        formation is comparable to reflecting ability of a plane. </p>
      <p>Moreover, a circle with a diameter of 300 km, with a higher
        degree of ionization and a center within the zone of the Pyramid
        was discovered with a significant degree of authenticity. </p>
      <p>It is possible to hypothesize about existence of a vortical
        radiation in the zone of the Pyramid with a diameter of hundreds
        of kilometers. Registered ionization is the effect of this
        radiation. Discovered ionic column above the Pyramid outlines
        the neck of the funnel of this vortex. </p>
      <p>2. Even at –40° C regular water does not freeze inside the
        Pyramid </p>
      <p>Several plastic bottles with regular water were placed inside
        the Pyramid and their state was observed within a period of
        three winter months. The water was not freezing and had all the
        properties of a liquid during this whole period. The lowest air
        temperature inside the Pyramid was –40°C. Measuring water
        temperature inside the bottles showed that it was the same as
        the temperature of the air (i.e. the water was not freezing even
        when its temperature was –40°C). </p>
      <p>However, it was noted during this research, that if a bottle of
        this water was shaken or hit, a crystallization process was
        beginning inside and the water was turning into ice within 3-20
        seconds (depending on the degree of water super cooling). </p>
      <p>3. Pyramid has powerful protective characteristics against
        lightning bolt hits </p>
      <p>Electro technical institute --- The institute conducted
        research on effects of the Pyramid field on electrical field in
        a long air space AXIS-PLANE under impulse voltage of positive
        polarity 250/2500 mcs. </p>
      <p>As a base system the researchers used air space AXIS-PLANE with
        distance between electrodes of S=5.0 m. </p>
      <p>As a test system they used the same thing, but the PLANE had 7
        pieces of granite 100 grams each, which were previously placed
        inside the pyramid. Granite pieces were placed on the PLANE in a
        circle with a diameter of 1 meter and with a center placed 0.5
        meters away from the center of the PLANE. </p>
      <p>Each system was subjected to 100 impulses. Researchers were
        registering trajectory of discharges and points of hits of the
        plane. Based on the results fields of hit points were generated.
        Discharge voltage during the research was approximately 1400 kV.
      </p>
      <p>Test results showed that the number of hit points in the base
        system was 5 times higher than that in the test system. </p>
      <p>Therefore, a contour of granite stones exposed to the pyramid
        energy has powerful protective characteristics against lightning
        bolt hits within the area of the contour. </p>
      <p>4. Golden Section Pyramid harmonizes space within its radius of
        influence </p>
      <p>New streams appeared in the area of the 22-meter pyramid on the
        Seliger Lake, a stork set up a nest, and nearby fields became
        covered with previously extinct kinds of flowers. </p>
      <p>5. Many substances and materials change their physical and
        chemical properties </p>
      <p>“Graphite” institute was determining the influence of the
        Pyramid field on the electrical resistance of carbon-based
        materials. Research object – pyrolitic carbon. Measurements were
        conducted by the 4-probe method with direct current. Sizes of
        carbon plates were ~ 25?10?1 mm, distance between potential
        contacts ~ 3 mm. Density of the measuring current was ~ 1500
        mA/cm2. Before the plates were placed inside the pyramids,
        electrical resistance was ~ 5-7 mcOhm/m2. After 1 day inside the
        pyramid, electrical resistance had doubled. Such measurements
        are anomalous for pyrolitic carbon. Even the neutron radiation
        does not yield a resistance change of more than 5%. </p>
      <p>6. Qualitative structure of oil changes </p>
      <p>A complex of pyramids was installed on an oil field. Within the
        next few days the viscosity of oil decreased by 30%, which
        correspondingly led to the increased oil production. Gradually,
        the structure of oil began to change, i.e. amounts of tars,
        paraffin, etc in oil decreased. Fractional structure of oil has
        shifted towards the light fractions (Moscow Academy of Oil and
        Gas). </p>
      <p>7. Burning of any substance inside the Pyramid Of The Golden
        Section produces pleasant aromas </p>
      <p>8. Increase in crop productivity </p>
      <p>Before planting the crops, their seeds were placed inside the
        Pyramid for 1-5 days. Tens of thousands of hectares were seeded
        with more than 20 crops. In each case crop productivity was from
        20% to 100%, the crops were not sick, were not bothered by
        droughts. Quantity of toxic substances in plants decreased.
        Similar results were obtained when closed contours of stones,
        previously exposed to the Pyramid energy, were placed around the
        crop fields. 500 small stones with total weight of 20 kg were
        placed around a 10 ha field. </p>
      <p>9. Medical research and experiments </p>
      <p>Research, experiments and tests in medical laboratories and
        science centers have confirmed that Golden Section
        Pyramids:&nbsp; neutralize geopathic zones...&nbsp; have
        powerful anti stress effects...&nbsp; slow aging processes by
        enhancing immune system...&nbsp; increase vitality of cellular
        tissue, slow development of negative processes in living
        organisms...&nbsp; reduce negative influence of the environment
        on humans and nature </p>

      <p>SUBSTANCE: method involves determining sign and power of
        biological energy field in the area of human pathogenic zones
        and treating the areas with pyramidal generators energy
        radiation. The patient is placed into harmonizing
        energy-and-information field of the main pyramidal generator.
        The detected pathogenic zone is exposed to concentrated
        unidirectional field produced in the space between two pyramidal
        generators arranged in unidirectional coaxial relation to one
        another. Sign and power of the concentrated unidirectional field
        are selected depending on the human biological energy field in
        the region of pathogenic focus in patient body. EFFECT: enhanced
        effectiveness of treatment course. 2 cl, 1 dwg<br>
        <br>
        [0001] The invention relates to the field of public health and
        is intended for the treatment of diseases associated with the
        violation of the patient's bioenergetics, and can also be used
        to correct the states of energy exhaustion. In this case,
        diseases associated with violations of bioenergetics are
        oncological (in the early stages), cardiovascular, neurogenic,
        etc. diseases.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] There are known methods of treating diseases associated
        with the violation of human bioenergetics, containing a
        procedure for identifying the area of &#8203;&#8203;pathology and the impact
        on it of various types of energy. The most common of these are
        methods of treatment according to the method of I. Nakatani and
        R. Fall, in which the pathology area is determined by sequential
        measurement of the electrical resistance of biologically active
        points of acupuncture or skin areas of the patient with
        subsequent electrostimulation. Such a method of treatment is
        laid, for example, in the Prognoz-Mini device produced serially
        by the Berdsk Electromechanical Plant (PROGNOZ-MINI medical
        diagnostic device, Berdsk, 1995) and demonstrated at the
        international exhibition Invex-86 in Prague. [1] However, this
        method is applicable for the treatment of a narrow range of
        diseases, and its disadvantage is the need for exposure to the
        human body of energy from foreign sources with technically
        generated frequencies and currents fed through the electrode
        system.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] More effective are the ways of treating the diseases
        associated with the patient's energy disturbance, according to
        the method of Dr. F. Morrell (Mora-Mora, MORA-Therapie, 1987, K.
        F. Haug-Verlag, Heidelberg), who proposed the so-called
        bioresonance therapy, or otherwise - "Mora-therapy." In
        accordance with this method, the treatment is performed by
        affecting the patient's biofield, which is detected, for
        example, by an ordinary biological locator. The essence of the
        method consists in determining the sign and power of the
        biofield in the field of pathology, harmonizing the entire
        organism as a whole (basic therapy), and simultaneously
        affecting the bioenergetic centers of the patient with its own
        enhanced energy radiation and inverted radiation emanating from
        the pathological region (local therapy) .<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The disadvantage of this method is a narrow range of
        diseases (allergy, diseases of the broncho-pulmonary system,
        gastrointestinal tract, spine, immune system failure, etc.) and
        the need for prolonged contact of the patient with the electrode
        system, as well as the high cost and complexity of the device
        that implements present method.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] More universal and simpler is the method of treating
        diseases associated with the violation of the patient's
        bioenergetics, containing procedures for determining the sign
        and power of the biofield in the pathology of the patient and
        affecting its bioenergy centers by the energy radiation of
        pyramidal generators that generate the same kind of energy that
        is used in the Mora- therapy. Such a method of transferring
        microwave electromagnetic energy to the human body is described
        by the German inventor M. Nemitz, Vorrichtung zum Sammel und und
        gezielten Ubertragen von besonders programmierten radiasthetisch
        messbaren Strahlungen auf den menschlichen Korper, OS 3823178,
        Int. Cl. A61NI / 16, AT 08.07 .88, FROM 11.01.90), who proposed
        a device containing a pyramid-shaped generator-accumulator of
        emissions, sequentially connected by electrical connections to
        the radiation transmitter, the radiation injector and the
        radiation adapter. The patient is placed between the injector
        and the adapter. The power of the pyramidal generator is
        regulated by the position of a permanent magnet, rotationally
        mounted on the base of the regular pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] The disadvantage of this method is the limitation of the
        impact on the patient's body only by local action, moreover, the
        insufficient power lost on electrical connections.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The task, solved by the proposed method, is to increase
        the effectiveness of treatment. The stated task is solved by the
        fact that in a known method of treating diseases associated with
        a violation of the patient's bioenergetics, containing
        procedures for determining the sign and power of the biofield in
        the pathology of the patient and affecting the energy centers of
        the pyramidal generators on his bioenergetic centers, the
        patient is placed in the harmonizing energy information field of
        the main pyramidal generator, and the revealed area of
        &#8203;&#8203;pathology is affected by a concentrated unidirectional field
        formed in the space between two additional pyramid-shaped
        generators oriented unidirectionally and coaxially to each
        other, the sign and the power of the concentrated unidirectional
        field being selected depending on the sign and power of the
        biofield of the pathology region of the patient.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] As is known (I.Efimova, "The Disclosed Secrets of the
        Pyramids." Science and Religion, N4, 1997), the field created
        inside the pyramid of the pyramid-shaped generator is divided
        into three zones according to the effect on man: a conditionally
        negative, converting and conditionally positive zone. Additional
        pyramidal generators installed above and below the patient
        located in the converting zone of the field of the main
        pyramidal generator expand the zone of its positive impact, and
        the additional generator, whose pyramid is directed by its apex
        to the base of the pyramid of the second coaxial additional
        generator, also creates a concentrated field in the region
        pathology of the patient.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] In this case, the area of &#8203;&#8203;pathology is revealed by
        scanning the patient's biofield with the help of a biological
        locator, the sign of the biofield is determined in the direction
        of rotation of the locator frame, and the power of the biofield
        in the pathology area is determined by acupuncture methods.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] The invention is illustrated in the drawing, which shows
        a patient placement scheme for implementing the proposed method
        of treating a patient. As can be seen from the drawings, the
        patient is placed on a couch 1 of a dielectric material in a
        harmonizing energy information field formed inside the main
        pyramidal generator. The generator has the shape of a frame
        pyramid 2 with a block of antenna-emitters 3. The construction
        of a pyramidal generator of energy-information radiation is
        described in detail in application No. 99113291 dated June 17,
        1999. Two additional pyramidal generators 4 and 6 with
        antenna-emitter blocks 5 and 7 are located under and above the
        couch 1 with the patient. By their design, the additional
        generators 4 and 6 are similar to the main generator 2, but have
        smaller dimensions and, correspondingly, lower power. The
        additional generators 4 and 6 are oriented unidirectionally and
        are fixed to the shelves 8 and 9 of the C-shaped arch 10, which
        is rotatable and vertically movable along the column 11. The
        shelves 8 and 9 are also provided with fastening means (not
        shown) that align the generators 4 and 6. The distance between
        the shelves 8 and 9 is selected with the condition that the bed
        of the couch 1 with the patient can pass between them.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] Treatment is carried out in the following sequence.
        Initially, the patient is diagnosed to identify pathological
        zones. The detection of pathological zones is performed by
        scanning the patient's biofield using a biological locator. In
        this case, the presence of the biofield corresponds to the
        rotation of the frame of the locator, and the direction of
        rotation of the frame of the locator corresponds to a definite
        sign of the field (direction of the field strength vector).
        Radiation power is determined by any known acupuncture methods
        to exclude subjective factors introduced by the biolocal
        operator. For this purpose, known measuring instruments based on
        the methods of Nakatani-Ryodoraku or R. Voll are used. After
        performing the diagnosis, the patient is placed on the couch 1,
        located in the harmonizing energy-information field of the
        pyramidal generator, whose pyramid 2 has parameters
        corresponding to the golden section (the ratio of the height of
        the pyramid to the side of the base is equal to the coefficient
        of the golden section of 1.618), and the pathology detected is
        affected by a concentrated unidirectional field, formed in the
        space between two additional pyramidal generators 4 and 6. In
        the presence of two areas of pathology in the patient NTA can be
        influenced by two pairs of extra pyramidal generators
        simultaneously.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] To influence the area of &#8203;&#8203;the pathology of the patient
        to the couch 1, a cart with additional generators 4 and 6 is
        driven so that the bed of the couch 1 is covered by a C-shaped
        bracket 10. The position of the generators 4 and 6 fixed on the
        shelves 8 and 9 is corrected by rotating the C-shaped bracket 10
        with respect to the column 11, or moving it up and down the
        column.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] The additional pyramidal generators 4 and 6 installed
        above and below the patient lying on the couch 1, due to their
        antennas-radiators 5 and 7, expand the area of &#8203;&#8203;positive
        influence of the main pyramidal generator 2, and the additional
        generator 4 in FIG. 1, whose pyramid is directed by its apex to
        the base of the pyramid of the second additional generator 6 in
        Fig. 1, creates a concentrated field in the pathology of the
        patient. The direction of the energy-information field is
        controlled by installing metal, mirror-polished screens on the
        bases of the pyramids 4 and 6. In this case, if it is necessary
        to correct the positive field above the antenna-emitter unit 7
        of the pyramid 6, a screen is installed, thereby blocking the
        information flow from above and concentrating the information
        flow from below (from the ground). If it is necessary to correct
        the negative field, the screen is placed below the lower
        additional pyramid 4, which blocks the information flow from the
        ground and concentrates only the information flow entering the
        pyramid from above (from space, air, environment, etc.), which
        is conditionally considered positive. The power of the pyramid
        generators is controlled by selecting the angle of rotation of
        the pyramids relative to the sides of the light and rotating the
        antenna-emitter unit 3, 5 and 7 relative to the corresponding
        pyramids 2, 4 and 6. Control of the orientation and power of the
        energy information field provides correction of the biofield of
        the patient emitted from its pathological zone and , as a
        consequence, the cure of the disease.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] Thus, the first group of patients: patient A., 43 years
        old, patient T., 48 years old, was admitted for treatment with a
        diagnosis: osteochondrosis of the thoracic spine with acute pain
        syndrome. The second group of patients: patient V., 38 years
        old, and patient Sh., 42 years old, was admitted for treatment
        with a diagnosis: chronic obstructive bronchitis of high
        severity, in the stage of exacerbation.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] Patients A., T., V., and S. were subjected to additional
        diagnostic methods of acupuncture and biological scanning, which
        confirmed the initial diagnosis. Treatment of patients with A.
        and B. was performed by acupuncture for a corresponding
        acupuncture prescription within 2 hours in one session.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] Patients T. and Sh. Were exposed to energy-information
        effects in the field of the harmonizing pyramid and the effect
        of the concentrated energy-information field of additional
        pyramids. The patient T.'s session consisted of a fifty-minute
        stay in the energy-information field of the main pyramid, within
        forty minutes of which he was subjected to concentrated
        unidirectional irradiation of the thoracic region of the spine.
        Patient S. stayed in the energy-information field of the main
        pyramid for 30 minutes, during 25 minutes of which he was
        subjected to concentrated unidirectional irradiation in the
        bronchial region.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] The positive effect - the absence of objective symptoms
        and complaints of patients - was achieved: for patients A and B.
        - for 10 sessions; for patient T. - for 3 sessions; for patient
        Sh. - for 7 sessions.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] As can be seen from the examples, the proposed method for
        treating diseases of various etiologies, which is based on a
        violation of the body's bioenergetics, makes it possible to
        achieve an increase in the effectiveness of the effect in
        comparison with traditional methods and thereby shorten the
        terms of procedures and treatment. <br>

      FIELD: biology and public health, in particular, equipment, such
      as form generators adapted for changing functional state of
      biological objects. SUBSTANCE: apparatus has three regular metal
      carcass-type four-angled pyramids of similar geometry, whose
      apexes are disposed in single straight line. Pyramids are inserted
      one inside the other and rigidly interconnected through similar
      metal bearing rods so that spaces of equal size are defined
      between them. Pin fixed to apex of outer pyramid is extending
      perpendicular to pyramid bases. Block of equally spaced antennae
      is secured to pin. Antennae are arranged along circumferential
      line and provided with emitters. Bearing rods are positioned at an
      angle of 42 deg to pyramid bases. Ends of rods are fixed to
      respective apexes of pyramid squares. Length of pyramid members
      and bearing rods is selected such that ratio of distance between
      bases of smaller and outer pyramids and base side of outer pyramid
      is 0.16, and ratio of height of each pyramid and length of its
      base side is 1.618. Block of antennae has hub allowing block to be
      mounted for rotation on pin, and array of similar antennae made in
      the form of bundle composed of three vibrators, which are arranged
      so as to define carcass-type tetrahedron with three ribs extending
      from single apex. Ratio of base side length and diameter of circle
      that is circumscribed by bundle apexes, and ratio of this diameter
      and length of vibrator are 1.618. Such construction allows
      energoinformational flux of controlled intensity to be directed to
      biological object. EFFECT: increased efficiency and enhanced
      reliability in operation. 3 cl, 2 dwg<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention relates to biology and health care, in
      particular to energy-informational effects on the functional state
      of a biological object by form generators.<br>
      [0002] The most common shape generators are regular pyramids,
      which have long been used for energy-informational effects on
      biological objects, for example, for mummification.<br>
      In particular, the well-known pyramid of Cheops and other numerous
      Egyptian pyramids have such properties (Krestyanka, N 9, 1989, p.
      37). The value of the active positive zone formed around it is
      usually taken as an indicator of the energy-informational impact
      of a pyramid. The size of the core depends on several factors, the
      main of which are the parameters of the pyramid, the design and
      the material from which it is made. Of the parameters, the most
      important are the values and ratios of the main parameters of the
      pyramid - the sides of the base and the height. From a structural
      point of view, pyramids can be solid, hollow, wireframe, open, or
      closed. In this case, the size of the core is maximum for a solid
      pyramid and minimum for a closed one. From the point of view of
      materials for manufacturing, with all other characteristics being
      the same, the gold pyramid provides the maximum size of the active
      zone, the copper pyramid is approximately three times smaller, and
      even less is the pyramid of other materials (Science and Religion,
      N 4, 1997, p.44).<br>
      [0003]The desire to increase the power of the flow of
      energy-informational impact by increasing the dimensions of the
      pyramid comes into conflict with the costs of its manufacture and
      with the occupied areas, incommensurate with the size of the
      objects of influence.<br>
      [0004]To resolve these contradictions, the German inventor P.
      Schweitzer proposed (DE OS 3320518, A 61 N 1/16.<br>
      AT 06/07/83.<br>
      OT 13.12.84) to use the phenomenon of resonance, which occurs in a
      device containing several hollow nested and rigidly connected
      pyramids, the heights of which lie on one straight line. The
      Bulgarian inventor I. Milev (KB "Magnitotron") further developed
      this direction and developed a device for energy-informational
      action on a biological object, containing three geometrically
      similar regular metal quadrangular pyramids nested into each other
      and rigidly connected to each other with a gap by the same metal
      supporting rods , the heights of which lie on one straight line,
      and at the top of the outer pyramid a rod is fixed perpendicular
      to the planes of the base of the pyramids, on which a block of
      antennas with radiators equidistant around the circumference is
      placed (Bulgaria, N 7, 1988, p. 9-10). In this case, the planes of
      the bases of all pyramids are aligned, and the block of antennas
      with emitters contains three antennas equally spaced around the
      circumference, rigidly attached to the rod and directed to it at
      an acute angle upward.<br>
      The ratio of the height of the pyramid to the length of the side
      of the square lying at its base was chosen equal to 0.636, i.e.
      the corresponding proportions of the famous Egyptian pyramid of
      Cheops. This design significantly increases the power of the
      energy-information flow with relatively small dimensions (with a
      pyramid height from 0.1 to 0.15 m - the coverage area is from 10
      to 30 m) and eliminates the effect of negative anomalies in the
      area around the pyramid.<br>
      [0005]However, the placement of the bases of all pyramids in the
      same plane and the use of the proportion of only the Cheops
      pyramid prevents the achievement of full resonance of the fields
      emitted by each pyramid.<br>
      In addition, such a device makes it possible to obtain an
      energy-information flow only of a constant (fixed) power for a
      given pyramid. Therefore, in order to obtain the
      energy-information flow of the given power, it is necessary to
      produce a pyramid with new parameters, respectively.<br>
      [0006]The objective of the present invention is to create a
      pyramid-based device for energy-informational impact on the
      functional state of a biological object of even higher power and
      with the ability to adjust the power of the information flow.<br>
      [0007]The problem is solved by the fact that in the known device
      for the energy-informational effect on a biological object
      (including three geometrically similar nested into each other and
      rigidly connected to each other with a gap by the same metal
      supporting rods regular frame metal quadrangular pyramids, the
      heights of which lie on one straight line, and at the top of the
      outer pyramid, an axis is reinforced perpendicular to the planes
      of the pyramid bases, on which a block of antennas with radiators
      equally spaced around the circumference is located) the bearing
      rods are located to the planes of the pyramid bases at an angle of
      42o, their ends are attached to the corresponding tops of the
      squares lying in the bases of the outer and inner pyramids, the
      middle - to the corresponding vertices of the square lying at the
      base of the middle pyramid, and the lengths of the elements of the
      pyramids and load-bearing rods are chosen so that the ratio of the
      distance between the planes of the bases of the smaller and outer
      pyramids to the side of the base of the outer pyramids d is 0.16,
      the ratio of the height of each pyramid to the side of its base is
      1.618, while the block of antennas with radiators contains a hub
      designed for rotational installation of it on the axis, and a
      number of identical antennas, each of which is made in the form of
      a beam of three vibrators, arranged as three edges of a skeleton
      tetrahedron emerging from one vertex, rigidly connected to the hub
      so that the beam axes are in the same plane of rotation parallel
      to the plane of the pyramid base.<br>
      [0008]In this case, the ratio of the side of the base of the outer
      pyramid to the diameter of the circle, which is described by the
      tops of the beams, and the ratio of this diameter to the length of
      the vibrator are equal to 1.618.<br>
      [0009]Optimally, the antenna unit with radiators contains eight
      beams of vibrators, which are oriented so that one of the straight
      lines passing through the ends of the vibrators of each beam is
      parallel to the plane of rotation of the unit of antennas with
      radiators, and the corresponding straight lines of any pair of
      adjacent beams are on opposite sides of the plane of rotation.<br>
      [0010]The claimed technical solution provides a significant
      increase in the power of the energy-information flow due to the
      use in the proportions of the pyramids and antennas of the
      coefficient 1.618 - the golden section coefficient, and allows you
      to change the power of the energy-information flow directly during
      operation with the same linear parameters of the pyramids.<br>
      [0011]The design of the control unit, which combines the emitter
      and the antenna, allows you to completely cover the space around
      the device and regulate the power of the energy-information flow
      by selecting the required angle of its rotation relative to the
      axis of the pyramid.<br>
      [0012]The drawings show a diagram of a device for
      energy-informational effects on biological objects, where Fig. 1
      shows the device in a diagonal view on regular quadrangular
      pyramids; in fig. 2 is a top view of the device along the arrow
      "A".<br>
      [0013]As shown in FIG. 1, the device is a structure consisting of
      three frame pyramids: outer pyramid 1, middle pyramid 2, and inner
      pyramid 3.<br>
      The pyramids are geometrically similar, i.e. the ratios of any two
      corresponding linear parameters of the pyramids are constant for
      them.<br>
      In particular, the ratio of the height of the outer pyramid to the
      length of the side of its base is 1.618, and the corresponding
      ratios of the heights to the lengths of the sides of the bases of
      other geometrically similar pyramids have the same meaning.<br>
      Pyramids 1, 2 and 3 are nested into each other and rigidly
      connected to each other with a gap by identical metal bearing rods
      4.<br>
      The frames of the pyramids 1, 2 and 3, as well as the supporting
      rods 4, are made of stainless steel with a diameter of 1.6 mm.<br>
      Pyramids 1, 2 and 3 are regular quadrangular pyramids, that is,
      they have squares at their bases.<br>
      The rods 4 with their ends are welded to the corresponding
      vertices of the squares lying at the bases of the lower 1 and
      inner 3 pyramids, and the corresponding vertices of the square
      lying at the base of the middle frame pyramid 2 are welded to the
      midpoints of the bearing rods 4.<br>
      The bearing rods 4 are the same in length and are inclined at the
      same angle to the planes of the pyramid bases, which determines
      the location of the heights of geometrically similar pyramids on
      one straight line.<br>
      The bases of the pyramids 1, 2 and 3, together with the supporting
      rods 4, form a truncated pyramid, in which the bearing rods 4 play
      the role of lateral ribs, the base of the outer pyramid 1 is the
      role of the larger base, the base of the middle pyramid 2 is the
      role of the middle section, and the base of the inner pyramid 3 -
      the role of the lesser foundation. Naturally, this truncated
      pyramid is also correct. The same angle of inclination of all rods
      4 to the base plane, equal to 42o, provides this pyramid with a
      ratio of linear parameters equal to the corresponding parameters
      of the Egyptian pyramid of Cheops. The linear dimensions of the
      bearing rods 4 are chosen so that the ratio of the distance
      between the planes of the bases of the inner and outer pyramids
      (i.e., the height of the truncated pyramid) to the length of the
      side of the base of the outer pyramid 1 (i.e., to the length of
      the side of the larger base of the truncated pyramid) is equal to
      0 ,sixteen.<br>
      [0014]At the top of the outer pyramid, an axis 5 is fixed,
      perpendicular to the planes of the base of the pyramids 1, 2 and
      3, on which, with the help of the hub 6, the control unit 7 is
      rotationally fixed with eight equally spaced radiating antennas 8
      (Fig.2)<br>
      Each antenna-emitter 8 is made in the form of a beam of three
      vibrators arranged as three edges of a frame tetrahedron emerging
      from one vertex (center of the beam). The top of the beam of
      vibrators is rigidly connected to the hub 6 put on the axis 5 so
      that the axes of the beams are in the same plane of rotation "B"
      (Fig. 1), parallel to the plane of the base of the pyramid.
      Depending on the selected diameter of the hub 6, the rigid
      connection of the center of the beam of vibrators can be either
      direct or indirect - through the bridges 9. In this case, the
      ratio of the side of the base of the outer pyramid to the diameter
      of the circle, which is described by the tops of the beams (shown
      in Fig. 2 by the dotted line), and the ratio of this diameter to
      the length of the vibrator are also equal to the golden section
      coefficient of 1.618.<br>
      [0015]Each of the eight vibrator beams is oriented so that one of
      the straight lines (for example, "B", Fig. 1 passing through the
      ends of two vibrators (for example, 10 and 11) of one beam is
      parallel to the plane of rotation of the antenna unit with
      emitters "B", and the corresponding straight lines of any pair of
      adjacent beams, for example, "C" and "D", are located on opposite
      sides of the plane of rotation "B".<br>
      The angle of rotation of the regulating unit 7 relative to the
      pyramids 1, 2 and 3 can be fixed with a locking screw (not shown
      in the drawing) of the hub 6.<br>
      [0016]The device works as follows.<br>
      After orienting its pyramids to the cardinal points (along the
      arrow N - S, as shown in Fig. 2), a power control unit of the
      energy-information flow 7 is installed on the axis 5. Turning the
      unit 7 in the horizontal plane "B" relative to the axis 5, adjust
      the power of the energy-information flow to the maximum value and
      fix the position of the adjustment unit 7 relative to the pyramids
      1, 2 and 3 using a hub lock screw 6, not shown in the drawings.<br>
      [0017]The increase in the power of the device is achieved due to
      the ratio of the corresponding geometric dimensions, which make it
      possible to expand the possibilities of using the golden section
      pyramid in the construction.<br>
      [0018]The verification of the achieved technical result was
      carried out by a comparative method on a frame model of the Cheops
      pyramid made of the same material with a side length of the
      pyramid base of 200 mm and on the claimed device with the same
      base side length.<br>
      A quantitative assessment of the power of the energy-information
      flow in these experiments was carried out using a dowsing
      indicator according to the number of frame revolutions in the
      hands of the same bioenergetic, while maintaining the same
      external conditions.<br>
      The experiments have shown that the Cheops pyramid model generates
      an energy-information flow that causes 52 revolutions of the
      indicator frame in one direction. The energy-information flow
      generated by the claimed device causes 120 revolutions of the
      indicator frame in the same direction, that is, the power of the
      energy-information flow more than doubles. Rotation of the
      regulating unit 7 in the horizontal plane "B" relative to the axis
      5 allows you to smoothly reduce the number of revolutions of the
      indicator frame to zero and thereby regulate the power of the
      information flow and, consequently, the degree and effectiveness
      of its impact on the biological object.<br>

        FIELD: medical engineering. SUBSTANCE: device has rectilinear
        carcass pyramid with a rod mounted on its apex and a set of
        circumferentially arranged antennas provided with emitting
        units. The antenna unit has a boss and four carcass
        tetrahedrons. Each tetrahedron has one of its apices attached to
        the boss. The tetrahedron heights corresponding to the apices
        belong to the same rotation plane running in parallel to the
        pyramid base plane. Pyramid base side is twice as small as the
        pyramid height. Radius of the circle drawn by the tetrahedrons
        apices is equal to the tetrahedron side length and four times as
        small as the pyramid height. The tetrahedrons are mounted in a
        way that one of the base sides of every tetrahedron is in
        parallel relation to the antenna unit rotation plane. EFFECT:
        enabled production of energy and information flow of given
        power.<br>
        <br>
        [0001] The invention relates to the field of biology and health,
        namely, to the energy-information effect on the functional state
        of a biological object by form generators.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] The most common form generators are regular pyramids,
        which have long been used for energy-information impact on
        bioobjects, for example for mummification. In particular, such
        properties are possessed by the famous Cheops pyramid and other
        numerous Egyptian pyramids (Magazine "Peasant Woman", No. 9,
        1989, p. 37). As an indicator of the energy-information effect
        of the pyramid, the value of the active positive zone formed
        around it is usually taken. The size of the core depends on
        several factors, the main ones being the parameters of the
        pyramid, the structure and the material from which it is made.
        Of the parameters, the most important are the magnitudes and
        ratios of the main parameters of the pyramid-the sides of the
        base and the height. In terms of design, the pyramids can be
        made integral, hollow, framed, open or closed. In this case, the
        size of the core is maximal for a whole pyramid and is minimal
        for a closed pyramid. From the point of view of the materials
        for manufacturing, with the same characteristics, the pyramid of
        gold provides the maximum value of the core, the copper pyramid
        is approximately three times smaller, and even smaller - the
        pyramid from other materials. (Nauka i religiya, No. 4, 1997 ,
        p. 44).<br>
        <br>
        [0003] The desire to increase the power of the
        energy-information flow due to the increase in the dimensions of
        the pyramid is in conflict with the costs of its production and
        with occupied areas incommensurable with the size of the objects
        of impact. To solve these contradictions, the Bulgarian inventor
        I. Milev developed a device for energy-information impact on a
        biological object, including a regular frame quadrangular
        pyramid and a block of antennas with emitters reinforced at its
        apex (Nauka i religiya, No. 10, 1997, p. 55). In this case, the
        unit contains three equally spaced antennas, which are rigidly
        attached to the top of the pyramid by means of a vertical rod,
        and the antennas themselves are placed at an acute angle to the
        rod. This design significantly increases the power of the
        energy-information flow at relatively small dimensions (height
        from 0.1 to 0.15 m, and the range of action from 10 to 30 m) and
        eliminates the effect of negative anomalies in the zone around
        the pyramid. However, it makes it possible to obtain an
        energy-information flow only by a constant (fixed) power for a
        given pyramid. Therefore, in order to obtain an
        energy-information flow of a given power, it is necessary to
        produce, respectively, a new pyramid. It is an object of the
        present invention to provide, on the basis of a pyramid, a
        device for energoinformational action on a biological object
        with the possibility of regulating the amount of energy
        information flow.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The problem is solved by the fact that in a known device
        for energy-information impact on a biological object (including
        a regular frame quadrangular pyramid with a rod fixed at its
        apex perpendicular to the plane of the pyramid base and a block
        of equally spaced antennae with radiators), the antenna array
        with emitters comprises a hub intended for rotational
        installation of it on a rod, as on an axis, and a number of
        antennas in the form of identical frame tetrahedra, one of the
        vertices fixed on the hub ak that the heights of the tetrahedra
        corresponding to these vertices are in the same plane of
        rotation parallel to the plane of the base of the regular frame
        pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] In this case, the side of the base of the pyramid is 2
        times smaller than its height, and the radius of the circle,
        which is described by the tetrahedron vertices attached to the
        hub, is equal to the side of the tetrahedron and four times
        smaller than the side of the base of the frame pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] In addition, the antenna array with emitters contains
        four frame tetrahedrons that are oriented so that one of the
        sides of the base of each tetrahedron is parallel to the plane
        of rotation of the antenna array with the radiators, and the
        corresponding sides of any pair of adjacent tetrahedra are on
        opposite sides of the plane of rotation.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The rotational installation of the antenna unit with the
        emitters to the top of the pyramid and the ability to fix the
        selected angle of rotation of the antenna unit with respect to
        it gives this unit a new function - the possibility of
        regulating the energy-information impact. Features of its design
        solutions allow to completely cover the space around the device.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] In Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a device for
        energy-information effect on biological objects; in Fig. 2 - a
        view on the arrow "B".<br>
        <br>
        [0009] The device for energy information impact on biological
        objects consists of a regular quadrangular pyramid 1 with a
        square base 2, a rod 3 rigidly fixed at the apex of the pyramid
        1 perpendicular to its base 2, and a block 4 of antennas with
        radiators equidistant in circumference.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] Pyramid 1 is a welded frame structure made of stainless
        steel bar 1.6 mm in diameter. At the same time, the heights of
        the pyramid H are twice as large as the side of the square lying
        in the base 2. The cylindrical rod 3 is welded to the top of the
        pyramid 1 and serves as a rotation axis for the antenna unit 4
        with emitters regulating the energy information flow. The
        regulating unit 4 on the axis 3 is mounted rotationally by the
        hub (central hub) 5. The regulating unit 4 comprises four frame
        tetrahedrons 6 and 7, also made of stainless steel bar. In this
        case, the frame tetrahedrons 6 and 7 and their edges serve as
        antennas with emitters. The vertices of the tetrahedra 6 and 7
        are fixed to the hub 5 by means of bridges 8 coaxial to the
        corresponding heights of the tetrahedra 6 and 7 and lying in the
        same "A" rotation plane of the regulating unit 4 parallel to the
        plane of the base 2 of the pyramid 1. The radius of the
        circumference that is described attached to the bridges 8
        vertices of tetrahedra 6 and 7, is equal to the side of
        tetrahedra and is four times smaller than the side of base 2 of
        frame pyramid 1. With such fastening of tetrahedra 6 and 7, the
        planes of their bases turn out to be perpendicular to the plane
        of rotation "A". The framework tetrahedra 6 and 7 are oriented
        relative to the webs 8 so that one of the sides 9 or 10 of the
        base of each tetrahedron 6 or 7 is parallel to the rotation
        plane "A" of the control unit 4, and the respective sides (for
        example, 9 and 10, figure 2) any adjacent tetrahedra (for
        example, 6 and 7, figure 2) are on opposite sides of the "A"
        plane.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] The angle of rotation of the block 4 relative to the
        pyramid 1 can be fixed due to the presence of a locking screw
        (not shown in the drawings) installed in the hub 5.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] The device works as follows. Pyramid 1 is installed on
        the base 2 on a horizontal platform and oriented to the sides of
        the world. Then, the power information adjusting unit 4 is
        installed on the axis 3. Turning the block 4 in the horizontal
        plane "A" around the axis 3 adjusts the power of the energy
        information flow to the maximum value and fixes the position of
        the flow control unit 4 relative to the pyramid 1 by means of a
        locking screw through the hub 5 on the axis 3.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] Verification of the achieved technical result is carried
        out by a comparative method on the well-known frame model of the
        Cheops pyramid from the same material with the length of the
        pyramid base 200 mm and on the declared device with the same
        side of the base of the device. Quantitative evaluation of the
        power of the energy-information flow in these experiments is
        carried out with the help of a biolocation indicator on the
        number of revolutions of the frame in the hands of the same
        bioenergetics while maintaining the same external conditions.
        The measurements showed that the Cheops pyramid without an
        adjustment block generates an energy-information flow, which
        causes 32 turns of the indicator frame in one direction. The
        energy-information flow generated by the claimed device causes
        64 turns of the indicator frame in the same direction, that is,
        the power of the energy-information flow is doubled. An increase
        in the power of the energy-information flow is also evidenced by
        the fact that the speed of the frame has increased by about one
        and a half times. The displacement of the regulating unit 4 due
        to its rotation in the horizontal plane relative to the axis 3
        allows smoothly reducing the number of revolutions of the
        indicator frame to zero and thereby regulating the power of the
        energy information flow and therefore the degree and efficiency
        of its effect on biological objects.<br>

        Abstract --- The invention relates to methods of stimulating the
        non-specific reactivity of an animal organism by the
        immunomodulating effect and can be used either as an independent
        or as an auxiliary treatment for acute or chronic diseases and
        as a preventive treatment to raise the resistance of the animal
        organism. The proposed method involves exposing the animal
        organism to energy by placing it in an energy field generated by
        one or more pyramids. The source of the energy is the background
        energy of the environment. When this method is used, the
        reactivity of the animal organism is raised and its resistance
        to infection significantly increased. </p>

      <p>Abstract --- FIELD: oil production industry. SUBSTANCE: this
        primarily relates to pump-forced oil recovery. According to
        method, intensified recovery of oil from wells is achieved by
        reducing viscosity of oil. This is reached by energy influence
        upon oil through positioning of one or several pyramids at
        distance not over 1000H from well head, where H is height of
        pyramids in meters. EFFECT: higher efficiency. <br>
