        <b>AN AMAZING UNTOLD STORY</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There is an extraordinary natural healing substance PRODUCED BY
      OUR OWN BODIES that modern medical science has proven to be one of
      the most powerful<br>
      natural medicines known to man.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike many other natural medical therapies, this method requires
      no monetary investment a doctors' intervention and can be easily
      accessed and used at any time. The extensive medical research
      findings on this natural medicine have never been compiled and
      released to the general public before now, but those who have been
      fortunate enough to hear about this medicine and use it have found
      that it can produce often astounding healing even when all other
      therapies have failed. This book tells of the doctors, medical
      researchers and the hundreds of other people who have used this
      extraordinary medicine throughout our century to cure a huge
      variety of common illnesses and to combat even the most incurable
      diseases. This is the extraordinary untold story of a natural
      healing substance so remarkable that it can only be called our own
      perfect medicine.<br>
      <br>
      My own experience with this little-known natural medicine began as
      a result of my search for an answer to many years of serious
      chronic illnesses that had begun very early in life. Like
      thousands of people today, I had developed chronic, degenerative
      disorders that couldn't be helped by conventional medicine and
      which threatened to permanently destroy my ability to work,
      function and simply enjoy life.<br>
      <br>
      When I was young, I suffered through the same measles, mumps,
      chicken pox and colds that everyone else did. And like other
      children, I played hard, worked hard, and dreamed of the day when
      I would become a vigorous, emancipated teenager, just like
      everyone else. But, for me, that particular dream wasn't going to
      come true.<br>
      <br>
      One beautiful July morning at the age of twelve, I awoke with a
      start. Suddenly, surprised and frightened, I realized I was lying
      in a dark red pool of blood that was so large it had soaked
      through even the thick layers of my mattress. Trembling and weak,
      I pushed myself up out of bed and felt a horrible, wrenching pain
      tear through my abdomen.<br>
      <br>
      My worried mother came running in answer to my screams, but after
      assessing the situation, said there really wasn't much she could
      do about the pain of my first menstrual period. But what neither
      she nor I knew at the time, was that what should have been a
      natural transition to adolescence and menstruating was, for me,
      going to become a waking nightmare that lasted almost 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      At the onset of each one of my monthly menstrual periods, I would
      invariably end up either in my doctor's office or at the emergency
      room of the hospital screaming with pain, bleeding copiously and
      passing huge clots of blood.<br>
      <br>
      For several months after my 'periods from hell' began, my mother
      chauffeured me around the city from doctor to doctor with no
      success until our family doctor finally instituted a monthly
      regimen of pain killers such as Demerol or Darvon injections and
      then sent me home with a big, round bottle of full-strength
      prescription Codeine with which I proceeded to dope myself
      senseless for the next eight to ten days. This same cycle was
      repeated every month for almost twenty years.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout adolescence, the simple everyday functions of getting
      up and going to school were an often monumental and utterly
      exhausting effort for me. Unlike the rest of my family and
      friends, I had marked periods of extreme exhaustion. I became
      extremely susceptible to colds and flu and felt bone-chillingly
      cold all the time – even in the warmest summer weather.<br>
      <br>
      By the age of fourteen, the effort of combatting severe chronic
      pain and fatigue while trying to keep up normal activities became
      impossible. I collapsed and had to be hospitalized and removed
      from school for several months. But even after a huge battery of
      medical tests and innumerable visits with doctors and specialists,
      no one was able to diagnose what was causing my problems.<br>
      <br>
      After many weeks, I returned to school and struggled through the
      high school years with the aid of generous amounts of codeine and
      other strong pain killers that my doctor willingly prescribed. But
      by the time I left home for college, the symptoms of bleeding,
      exhaustion, pain and digestive problems became so bad that I often
      was unable to even leave my room or to take part in daily
      activities.<br>
      <br>
      I kept up the Demerol injections and codeine for many years and
      added several other new painkillers and drugs which had been
      developed for menstrual problems to my regimen. But the problems
      continued unabated and in the ensuing years I developed a myriad
      of other serious health problems.<br>
      <br>
      During the years from age eighteen to thirty, I was diagnosed with
      pelvic inflammatory disease, ulcerative colitis, Chron's disease
      or ileitis (a chronic, painful inflammation of the colon), Chronic
      Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Hashimoto's disease (a disorder of the
      thyroid gland) and mononucleosis.<br>
      <br>
      I had severe chronic kidney infections, two miscarriages, chronic
      cystitis, severe candida and external yeast infections along with
      marked adrenal insufficiency and serious chronic ear and sinus
      infections for which I was prescribed antibiotics on an ongoing
      basis for several years. Food and chemical allergies also became a
      big problem. And even though I ate almost nothing because of my
      extreme food allergies, I actually kept gaining weight, which only
      added to the discomfort of all the other health disorders I was
      dealing with.<br>
      <br>
      The bottles of drugs I had taken during this time could have
      filled a small landfill, but none of my illnesses or disorders had
      been resolved, and in fact, were more debilitating than ever - it
      seemed as though I had become nothing more than a walking
      encyclopedia of disease and the worst part about the entire
      situation was that no matter how many failed drug therapies I
      tried, any visit to the doctor's office only resulted in another
      discouraging failure.<br>
      <br>
      Another big problem was the drug side effects -I felt like a
      ping-pong ball, bouncing from one drug to another as my doctors
      kept prescribing more and different drugs to counteract the side
      effects of the ones I was already taking. By the time I turned 30,
      the natural health movement was really picking up speed, and,
      desperate for any solution, I tried out the Adelle Davis nutrition
      regimen, mega-vitamin therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic care and
      every herbal preparation and drug-free natural health therapy that
      I could find.<br>
      <br>
      Within two years, my chronic cystitis cleared up and the menstrual
      pain and bleeding markedly decreased. The ulcerative colitis also
      responded and the sinus infections disappeared. I felt that I was
      slowly and surely regaining strength and health and even beginning
      to experience a portion of the energy and vigor that 'normal'
      healthy people enjoy - and all without drugs. When I conceived my
      son at 34 and made it through the first trimester without
      miscarrying I felt as though I'd conquered the final health
      frontier.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, in my burst of enthusiasm, I underestimated the
      impact of pregnancy on my understandably frail health, and the
      birth that I had so carefully prepared for was a near fatal
      disaster requiring emergency surgery. And as it turned out, even
      despite all the illness and pain I'd gone through in the years
      before the birth, all of it seemed like child's-play after I ran
      head on into the serious complications of a difficult childbirth.<br>
      <br>
      For months after the birth, I hounded my gynecologist, complaining
      of unremitting and severe abdominal cramps, cystitis and horribly
      painful menstrual periods. My natural health treatments would give
      temporary relief, but mystifyingly, didn't seem to have the same
      beneficial and lasting effects that they'd had before my
      pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      I underwent every conceivable medical test, all of which came back
      negative, but the problems just didn't go away My doctor flinched
      every time I walked in the door and then sent me back out again
      with increasingly severe assurances that the pain was
      "unwarranted" and probably all in my head.<br>
      <br>
      After alienating every doctor in town with my complaints, I
      finally gave up and decided to 'suffer in silence' until one hot
      summer day almost twenty-four months after the birth, I suddenly
      fell, screaming with pain, on my living room floor in front of my
      terrified two year old. I literally had to crawl to the phone to
      call my husband. When he carried me, screeching, into my OB's
      office, the doctor clicked his tongue disapprovingly. "Now it
      can't be that bad, dear, we just checked you out a few months
      ago", he cajoled.<br>
      <br>
      He gave me Codeine and sent me home - 48 hours later I was in the
      operating room having emergency surgery for multiple ruptured
      ovarian tumors.<br>
      <br>
      A couple of days after the procedure, my doctor sauntered into my
      hospital room with a conciliatory grin on his face. "Gee", he
      drawled apologetically, "We had no idea anything like this was
      going to happen. Your ovary looked horrible - engorged to the size
      of a grapefruit. No wonder you were hurting. Sorry you had to go
      so long without help but, you know, the tests just never turned up
      anything. And oh, by the way, the pathologist found a little
      endometriosis in your right ovary."<br>
      <br>
      Endometriosis is an incurable women's disease in which uterine
      tissue for some unknown reason detaches itself from the uterus,
      moves to other locations in the body, and attaches itself to other
      organs or body tissue. This misplaced uterine tissue spontaneously
      bleeds in response to hormonal changes, causing internal bleeding,
      scarring and often excruciating pain that can destroy the woman's
      ability to live and function normally. This disease is not
      uncommon among women, but it is incurable, at least by
      conventional medical standards.<br>
      <br>
      My "little" endometriosis turned into the monster that ate Tokyo -
      three months after my doctor had "successfully" operated, I was
      sitting in the ultrasound room at the hospital again, watching as
      several new endometrial tumors appeared on the monitor screen,
      accompanied by the usual excruciating pelvic pain, internal
      bleeding, constipation, hemorrhagic cystitis and acute exhaustion.<br>
      <br>
      After the ultrasound, I decided to contact a doctor who was
      recommended to me as an expert on endometriosis. He told me that
      he felt that my health problems had originally stemmed from
      undiagnosed severe endometriosis and an underactive thyroid which
      had probably been present since adolescence. He recommended an
      immediate hysterectomy, which I underwent. The day after the
      operation, the doctor visited me arid compassionately whispered
      that I would "never have a problem with endometriosis again". But
      he was wrong.<br>
      <br>
      Twenty months later, I had more tumors and another operation.
      Three months after that, the pain, tumors and internal bleeding
      reappeared again and I was scheduled for what would by now have
      been my sixth surgical procedure in five years, which I refused to
      undergo.<br>
      <br>
      Desperate and seriously debilitated, I flew to Mexico where I
      spent $15,000 on an intensive course of intravenous mega-vitamin
      and livecell therapy at one of the alternative cancer clinics
      which had offered some hope for my case. For weeks, doctors poured
      nutrients and natural medicines into my veins and mouth. I watched
      as many of the cancer patients around me seemed to get better and
      better with the treatments. And I did too - for about two months.<br>
      <br>
      I spent my fortieth birthday hopelessly sick and in bed which was
      where I stayed that entire year. The drugs, operations and Mexican
      treatments had completely failed, and my usual herbs and
      homeopathic remedies, although they gave temporary relief, seemed
      almost useless against the disease. And by now, even though I had
      health insurance, my husband and I had spent over $100,000 of our
      own money, and still, I couldn't even get out of bed.<br>
      <br>
      I had one last surgery which removed another large bleeding tumor.
      When I got home from the hospital, I weighed 89 pounds and
      developed a post-surgical infection which required several courses
      of antibiotics. After taking the antibiotics, I developed an
      extremely severe case of candida (yeast infection). My hands and
      arms became covered with a horribly itchy fungal infection that
      nothing could relieve or cure, and I remained generally exhausted,
      bedridden, and in intense pain. Because of the surgeries, I was
      also experiencing early and severe menopausal symptoms –
      hot-flashes, mood swings, water retention and depression. But
      because endometriosis is exacerbated by estrogen, my doctor
      recommended that I refrain from taking estrogen supplements which
      she said would have relieved the severe and very unpleasant
      symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Several months after the surgery, the all-too-familiar endometrial
      symptoms returned. My doctor assured me that all was well, but
      when I asked for and received my surgical records from the
      hospital, I found that she had written that "all attempts to
      remove endometriosis will be done, but complete surgical care can
      rarely be guaranteed; the patient may require further therapy for
      endometriosis, medically or surgically" For my exhausted and
      bewildered husband and myself, this prognosis seemed like an
      insurmountable and final defeat.<br>
      <br>
      I had one more heart to heart talk with a gynecologist who told
      me, "given the severity of your case, the reality is that you
      could be facing a lifetime of corrective surgery". Given the state
      of my health at the time, I couldn't envision that 'lifetime'
      meant anything more for me than a few additional years of
      mind-numbing pain and misery before my body finally gave out.<br>
      <br>
      After nearly a lifetime of illness, these last episodes in my late
      thirties and early forties seemed like the final blow, and in all
      honesty I felt that there was no way out and no hope in sight. No
      matter how many times I'd been assured by my doctors that drugs
      and surgery would cure the endometriosis and my other disorders
      and make it possible for me to live a normal life, the doctors had
      been proven wrong.<br>
      <br>
      A few weeks later, when I heard that one of my friends from the
      cáncer clinic had died in his sleep, I felt sad for his family,
      but happy for him, because he was finally free of his pain and
      suffering. In many ways, I felt that he was the lucky one and I
      almost wished that the same thing would happen to me; it seemed
      that death would have been a blessing, especially so that my
      family could be freed from the seemingly neverending burden of my
      illness and be able to get on with their lives. Sitting alone and
      discouraged one morning, I glanced up dismally from a book I was
      reading when my husband came in the room. "I've got something else
      we can try, honey," he chirped enthusiastically, and proceeded to
      describe his conversation with a woman who had cured herself of a
      serious and reportedly incurable kidney disorder by using an
      unusual therapy. "Whaaat", I responded, after he told me what the
      therapy was - "I don't think so", I said, and went back to reading
      my book. But after several more days and many more horrible
      episodes of pain and drugs, my husband handed me a small book and
      said, "You've got to try this". I picked up the book and began to
      read.<br>
      <br>
      The small, unpretentious-looking book was full of fascinating
      stories about people who had been cured of even the worst diseases
      with a seemingly strange and little-known natural therapy. The
      therapy seemed incredibly effective, yet I still felt reluctant to
      try it. But as I read further on in the book, the stories were so
      compelling and the therapy was so simple that suddenly, it didn't
      seem strange or preposterous to me anymore. And at this point in
      my now nearly futile existence, I knew I had absolutely nothing to
      lose by trying it - so I did.<br>
      <br>
      From the first day I began the therapy, to my immense surprise I
      got almost instantaneous relief from my incurable constipation and
      fluid retention. Within a week, my severe abdominal and pelvic
      pain was unbelievably gone.<br>
      <br>
      The chronic cystitis and yeast infections (internal and external)
      son disappeared and food allergies, exhaustion, and digestive
      problems all began to heal.<br>
      <br>
      After a few more months of the therapy, I noticed that amazingly,
      my colds, flu, sore throats and viral symptoms, all of which had
      resurfaced and become chronic after the surgeries, now rarely made
      an appearance. My hair which had fallen out in handfuls after my
      fifth surgery became thick and lustrous, my weight normalized, and
      my energy and strength increased so markedly that I was even able
      to work again.<br>
      <br>
      Last summer, I hiked four miles into the Grand Canyon. For the
      first time in many years I can swim and even comfortably ride
      horseback or on my mountain bike for hours at a time – all
      formerly unimaginable activities. Much to my own and my family's
      amazement, I am back at work and after 30 years of almost non-stop
      illness, I have a rich, full life again – and all because of an
      unbelievably simple and effective natural medicine that almost
      none of us even knows exists.<br>
      <br>
      This natural therapy became, for me, a priceless gift of health,
      as it has for many others. It gave the fastest, most dramatic
      results of any natural or man-made medical treatment I have ever
      tried and was truly the miraculous happy ending to my long story
      of illness and failed medical treatments. By using this simple,
      natural medicine, along with other natural healing approaches such
      as homeopathy, herbs, good nutrition and rest, I have been able to
      remain consistently disease-free and I feel better and stronger
      than I have ever felt in my life since that fateful day in July so
      many years ago.<br>
      <br>
      And even though this natural medicine seemed so peculiar to me at
      first, I later discovered, to my surprise, that medical
      researchers have been intensively studying and using this
      medicinal substance for decades.<br>
      <br>
      As a matter of fact, unknown to the vast majority of the public,
      this incredibly simple and wonderful natural treatment is a
      well-proven medical therapy that has been used extensively and
      successfully throughout the twentieth century by doctors and
      researchers from many different branches of medicine all over the
      world and has been shown to be amazingly effective in treating a
      huge variety of illnesses. It's time that all of us should know
      about this therapy and about the medical research findings on this
      truly remarkable natural medicine, which is why I have written
      this book.<br>
      <br>
      Up until this point, whenever anyone wrote or talked about using
      this substance for healing, they've been told that it's just an
      unproven folk remedy or 'old wives tale'. But as you'll discover
      in the following pages, this is completely untrue. The truth is
      that doctors and medical researchers for years have scientifically
      proven the tremendous effectiveness of this natural medicinethey
      just haven't told us about it, for reasons which we'll discuss
      later on in the book.<br>
      <br>
      This simple, natural method may seem less glamorous than comercial
      drugs and space-age surgical techniques because it's not glorified
      by the press or hyped by sophisticated, sugar-coated advertising
      themes. But when all the man-made medicines in the world can't
      help, people like myself have been eternally grateful to find that
      nature has provided this safe, painless solution to even seemingly
      incurable illnesses.<br>
      <br>
      In this age of hi-tech drugs, plastic body parts and mechanized
      medicine, I sincerely hope that all of us can become more open and
      accepting of this natural way of healing the body, and that the
      information provided in this book will help all of us to learn
      more about, (what I can unreservedly say), is the best natural
      remedy to disease and illness in existence.<br>

        </b><b>WHAT MODERN SCIENCE KNOWS ABOUT A MIRACLE MEDICINE (AND
          ISN'T TELLING)</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Although the knowledge and research findings on this extraordinary
      natural medicine have largely remained in the files of medical
      researchers in our century, there are people who have
      inadvertently discovered the incredible healing power of this
      substance and have used it to heal themselves:<br>
      <br>
      "I was officially diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the
      chest with possible infiltration of the left lung two years ago.
      Soon after I was diagnosed, I was hospitalized because my lung had
      filled with fluid and collapsed. I was in a desperate struggle to
      stop the production of the fluid, in addition to which I was
      terribly constipated and uncomfortable.<br>
      <br>
      Then I came across information on this particular natural therapy.
      As soon as I had ingested the [fluid] it was miraculous. My bowels
      immediately began to move again. The relief was incredible and the
      fluid production in my lung also subsequently soon died down to
      the doctors' amazement. They had no recourse but to remove my
      chest tube. They wanted me to consider chemotherapy, radiation or
      surgery but I refused and signed myself out of the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Needless to say I am still here after two years even though my
      parents were informed I had only four months to live after the
      diagnosis. I had used a number of holistic approaches (colonies,
      herbs, etc.) but to be perfectly honest I know it was the internal
      and external use of [this fluid] which has saved my life." — Mr.
      R., New York<br>
      <br>
      "I was diagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis at the age of
      twentyeight. The pain and swelling in the joints of my hands was
      unbelievable. I also suffered from migraine headaches since I was
      eight years old and it was very common for me to take a bottle of
      Excedrin with me everywhere I went. I never left my house without
      that bottle. I had also developed a severe weight problem over the
      years and had gotten up to almost 200 pounds.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I met someone who told me about this natural miracle
      therapy, but the best miracle of all is me. I started taking [this
      fluid] and four and a half months later I weighed 130 pounds. I
      lost 68 pounds! My arthritis is gone, my headaches are gone and I
      feel like I'm 20 years old.” — Mrs B., Florida<br>
      <br>
      "I laughed when I first heard about this therapy and didn't take
      it seriously. My main concern at the time was about my full-blown
      case of AIDS that had just been diagnosed and the Kaposi's sarcoma
      lesión (cancer) in my mouth that was supposed to spread throughout
      my body. But I decided to try the therapy topically on my vicious
      case of */ringworm and not only did the ringworm condition totally
      disappear after a few weeks, but the dry, cracked and painful skin
      all around my toes and foot had totally changed. New skin had
      grown in and was as soft as a baby's. It had a beautiful new color
      and just did not appear to be my own skin! I then tried the
      therapy internally each day and over the next 7 months the
      Kaposi's lesions became increasingly smaller until they
      disappeared totally! The mouth ulcers and genital herpes that used
      to plague me have not returned even once. I have NEVER felt better
      in my life." — Mr. Q., New York<br>
      <br>
      But it's not only people like these who have used this remarkable
      substance for healing. Medical scientists and doctors in the U.S.
      and all over the world have proven that this incredible body fluid
      and its components can actually destroy disease-causing viruses,
      bacteria and cancerous tumors, dissolve dangerous blood clots that
      cause heart attacks, heal ulcers, obesity, asthma, hay fever,
      allergies, colds, flu and digestive complaints as well as a host
      of other abnormalities and diseases.<br>
      <br>
      This simple natural fluid contains one. of the best and safest
      diuretic agents ever discovered. This agent has been proven to
      heal serious wounds and burns without scarring and is one of the
      most extraordinary natural skin moisturizers available. After
      nearly 100 years of modern study, medical researchers, in
      reference to this fluid and its components, report these findings:<br>
      <br>
      In clinical studies using an extract of this fluid on cancer
      patients, most patients in the study showed remarkable improvement
      after only one week of treatment and continued treatment produced
      a reduction in tumor size and normalization of biochemical tests
      with-out toxic or dangerous side effects. — Dr. S. Burzynski,
      Physiology, Chemistry &amp; Physics, 1977<br>
      <br>
      It surprisingly and easily kills viruses. In strong concentration,
      it not only weakens viruses such as polio and rabies, but actually
      destroys them. — Proceedings of the Society of Experimental
      Biology, 1936<br>
      <br>
      Natural antibodies to the HIV virus appear in this fluid in
      patients diagnosed with AIDS. — New York University Medical
      Center, 1988<br>
      <br>
      Sufficiently concentrated, it will kill gonorrhea bacteria.— Dr.
      Robert C. Noble, Division of Infectious Disease University of
      Kentucky College of Medicine, 1987<br>
      <br>
      It is capable of controlling a wide range of food, environmental
      and chemical allergies. — Dr. C.M.W. Wilson, Department of
      Geriatric Medicine, Law Hospital, Scotland, 1983<br>
      <br>
      It is capable of killing or stopping the growth of the bacteria
      that causes tuberculosis. — The American Review of Tuberculosis,
      1954<br>
      <br>
      This agent is one of the safest and most useful diuretics known.
      Its use is indicated in the treatment of excess pressure on the
      brain and eyes, inoperable brain tumors, skull fractures, and
      cerebral contusions. Further trials of this substance are
      warranted in the treatment of chronic glaucoma, hydrocephalus,
      delirium tremens, premenstrual edema, meningitis and epilepsy. —

      Urea - New Use Of An Old Agent, 1957 : This substance acts as an
      excellent and safe natural vaccine and has been shown to cure a
      wide variety of disorders including chronic and acute hepatitis,
      whooping-cough, asthma, hayfever, hives, migraine and intestinal
      disfunctions. The method is so simple it can be used without any
      difficulties. — Plesch Medical Press, London, 1947<br>
      <br>
      It was found that many physical illnesses were relieved, such as
      multiple sclerosis, colitis, hypertension, lupus, rheumatoid
      arthritis, hepatitis, hyperactivity, pancreatic insufficiency,
      psoriasis and eczema, diabetes, herpes zoster, and mononucleosis.

      So what is this mystery miracle medicine and why don't any of us
      know anything about it? If the body really does produce such an
      amazing substance, and doctors and scientists have used it to heal
      people, where are the news reports, the accolades, the
      commercials, the media hype?<br>
      <br>
      You want to know the answer? Then prepare yourself by first
      opening your mind. Let go of your initial disbelief and
      preconceptions and get ready for the best-kept secret in medical
      history.<br>
      <br>
      This extraordinary miracle medicine that numerous doctors,
      researchers and hundreds of people have used for healing is human
      urine.<br>
      <br>
      Surprised? Now before you scream "I don't believe it" and slam the
      book shut, consider this: Whether you know it or not, you've
      already re-used and reingested your urine - large amounts of it
      for a long period of time, and it's one of the reasons you're
      alive today.<br>
      <br>
      As medical researchers have discovered: "Urine is the main
      component of the amniotic fluid that bathes the human fetus.<br>
      <br>
      Normally, the baby 'breathes' this urine-filled amniotic fluid
      into its lungs. If the urinary tract is blocked, the fetus does
      not produce the fluid, and without it, the lungs do not develop."
      — New York Times Medical Section, August 16, 1988<br>
      <br>
      This is a fact that probably none of you without a medical
      background know -but the reality is, that urine is absolutely
      vital to your body's functioning and the internal and external
      applications of wine have proven medical ramifications far beyond
      anything that we, the general public can imagine.<br>
      <br>
      It doesn't matter how violent your reaction or how strong your
      disbe-lief may be, by the time you finish reading this book you
      will be utterly convinced and astounded by what the medical
      community hasn't told us about this incredible, but almost
      completely publicly unrecognized natural medicine.<br>
      <br>
      What amazes people most when they first hear about the medical use
      of urine is that they've never heard of it. To the vast majority
      of mankind, urine is nothing more than a somewhat repugnant
      "waste" that the body has to excrete in order to function.<br>
      <br>
      But as you'll discover, urine is not a waste product of the body,
      but rather, an extraordinarily valuable physiological substance
      that has been shown throughout the history of medical science
      right up until today to have profound medical uses that most of us
      know absolutely nothing about.<br>
      <br>
      One of the first things we need to clear up is the common
      perception of urine - urine is not what you think it is. As a
      matter of fact, you probably have no idea what urine is or how
      your body makes it.<br>
      <br>
      In reality, urine is not, as most of us believe, the excess water
      from food and liquids that goes through the intestines and is
      ejected from the body. I know that we generally think of urine in
      just this way - you eat and drink, the intestines "wring" out the
      good stuff in the food, and the urine is the left-over, dirty
      waste water that your body doesn't want, so it should never, ever
      be reintroduced back into the body in any form - right? Wrong.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how popular a conception this commonly shared scenario
      may be, it just isn't true. Urine is not made in your intestines.
      Urine is made in and by your kidneys. So what does this mean and
      why should it change the way you feel about urine?<br>
      <br>
      In layman's language, this is how and why urine is made in the
      body: When you eat, the food you ingest is eventually broken down
      in the stomach and intestines into extremely small molecules.
      These molecules are absorbed into tiny tubules in the intestinal
      wall and then pass through these tubes into the bloodstream. The
      blood circulates throughout your body carrying these food
      molecules and other nutrients, along with critical immune defense
      and regulating elements such as red and white blood cells,
      antibodies, plasma, microscopic proteins, hormones, enzymes, etc.,
      which are all manufactured at different locations in the body. The
      blood continually distributes its load of life-sustaining elements
      throughout the body, nourishing every cell and protecting the body
      from disease.<br>
      <br>
      As it flows through the body, this nutrient-filled blood passes
      through the liver where toxins are removed and later excreted from
      the body in the form of solid waste. Eventually, this purified,
      "cleaned" blood makes its way to the kidneys. When the blood
      enters the kidneys it is filtered through an immensely complex and
      intricate system of minute tubules called nephron through which
      the blood is literally "squeezed" at high pressure. This filtering
      process removes excess amounts of water, salts and other elements
      in the blood that your body does not need at the time.<br>
      <br>
      These excess elements are collected within the kidney in the form
      of a purified, sterile, watery solution called urine. Many of the
      constituents of this filtered watery solution, or urine, are then
      reabsorbed by the nephron and delivered back into the bloodstream.
      The remainder of the urine passes out of the kidneys into the
      bladder and is then excreted from the body.<br>
      <br>
      So, you say, the body's gotten rid of this stuff for a reason - so
      why would we want to use it again? And here's the catch: The
      function of the kidneys is to keep the various elements in your
      blood balanced. The kidneys do not filter out important elements
      in the blood because those elements in themselves are toxic or
      poisonous or bad for the body, but simply because the body did not
      need that particular concentration of that element at the time it
      was excreted. And medical researchers have discovered that many of
      the elements of the blood that are found in urine have enormous
      medicinal value, and when they are reintroduced into the body,
      they boost the body's immune defenses and stimulate healing in a
      way that nothing else does.<br>
      <br>
      As medical research has revealed:<br>
      <br>
      "One of the most important functions of the kidney is to excrete
      material and substances for which the body has no immediate
      need..." - Urinalysis in Clinical and Laboratory Practice<br>
      <br>
      For instance, the kidneys filter out water and sodium from the
      blood into the urine. Are water and sodium toxic? Of course not,
      they're both vital life-sustaining elements without which your
      body cannot function. But both elements could be lethal if there
      were too much water or sodium in your blood.<br>
      <br>
      Now what about potassium, calcium, and magnesium - these are
      familiar nutrients that we ingest in our food and vitamin pills
      everyday but they're also in your urine. These nutritional
      elements are extremely valuable substances to the body, certainly
      not toxic, and yet the kidney excretes these elements into the
      urine - why? Because it's taking out the excess amount of the
      potassium, calcium, etc. that is not needed by your body at the
      time that they are filtered out. Actually, it is this regulating
      process of the kidneys and the excretion of urine that allows us
      to eat and drink more than our bodies need at any one time.<br>
      <br>
      "The principal function of the kidney is not excretion, but
      regulation The kidney obviously conserves what we need, but even
      snore, permits us the freedom of excess. That is, it allows us to
      take in more than ... we need of many necessities – water and salt
      for example – and excretes exactly what is not required." — Dr. S.
      Cameron, Prof. of Renal Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London<br>
      <br>
      But this isn't the end of the story. Scientists have discovered
      that urine, because it is actually extracted from our blood,
      contains small amounts of almost all of the life-sustaining
      nutrients, proteins, hormones, antibodies and immunizing agents
      that our blood contains:<br>
      <br>
      "Urine can be regarded as one of the most complex of all body
      fluids. It contains practically all of the constituents found in
      the blood." — Urinalysis in Clinical and Laboratory Practice<br>
      <br>
      Many medical researchers, unlike most of us, know that far from
      being a dirty body waste, fresh, normal urine is actually sterile
      and is an extraordinary combination of some of the most vital and
      medically important substances known to man. Now this fact may be
      unknown to the vast majority of the public today, but, as you'll
      discover in this book, it is nothing new to modern medicine. To
      us, the public, urine seems like an undesirable waste product of
      the body, but to the medical research community and the drug
      industry, it's been considered to be liquid gold. Don't believe
      it? Read this: HIPPOCRATES MAGAZINE, May/June 1988<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>NOW URINE BUSINESS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Utica, Mich. – Realizing it is flushing potential profits down the
      drain, an enterprising young company has come up with a way to
      trap medically powerful proteins from urine. Enzymes of America
      has designed a special filter that collects important urine
      proteins and these filters have been installed in all of the men's
      urinals in the 10,000 portable outhouses owned by the Porta-John
      company, a subsidiary of Enzymes of America.<br>
      <br>
      Urine is known to contain minute amounts of proteins made by the
      body, including medically important ones such as growth hormone
      and insulin. There is a $500-million-a year market for these kinds
      of urine ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      This summer, Enzymes of America plans to market its first major
      urine product called urokinase, an enzyme that dissolves blood
      clots and is used to treat victims of heart attacks. The company
      has contracts to supply the urine enzyme to Sandoz, Merrell Dow
      and other major pharmaceutical companies. Ironically, this
      enterprise evolved from Porta-John's attempt to get rid of urine
      proteins -a major source of odor in portable toilets.<br>
      <br>
      When the president of Porta-John began consulting with scientists
      about a urine filtration system, one told him he was sitting on a
      gold mine.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of recycling urine is not new, however. "We thought about
      this," says Phillip Whitcome of Amgen, a Los Angeles biotechnology
      firm, "but realized we'd need thousands and thousands of liters of
      urine."<br>
      <br>
      Porta-john and Enzymes of America solved that problem. The 14
      million gallons flowing annually into Porta-John's privies contain
      about four and a half pounds of urokinase alone. That's enough to
      unclog 260,000 coronary arteries. — Hippocrates Magazine<br>
      <br>
      But urokinase isn't the only drug derived from urine that, unknown
      to us, has been a financial boon to the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
      <br>
      In August of 1993, Forbes magazine printed an article about Fabio
      Bertarelli who owns the world's largest fertility-drug producing
      company called the Ares-Serono Group based in Geneva, whose most
      important product is the drug Pergonal which increases the chances
      of conception.<br>
      <br>
      Guess what Pergonal is made from.<br>
      <br>
      "To make Pergonal, Ares-Serono collects urine samples from 110,000
      postmenopausal women volunteers in Italy, Spain, Brazil and
      Argentina. From 26 collection centers the urine is sent to Rome,
      where Ares-Serono technicians then isolate the ovulation-enhancing
      hormone." — Forbes<br>
      <br>
      Ares-Serono earned a reported $855 million in sales in 1992, and
      people pay up to $1,400 per month for this urine extract.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, most of us are operating under a gross misconception
      when we wrinkle our nose at the thought of using urine in
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Urea, the principal organic solid in urine, has long been
      considered to be a "waste product" of the body - it's even been
      considered to be dangerous or poisonous, but this too is
      completely untrue.<br>
      <br>
      Like any other substance in the body, too much urea can be
      harmful, but urea in and of itself is enormously valuable and
      indispensable to body functioning. Not only does urea provide
      invaluable nitrogen to the body, but research has shown that urea
      actually aids in the synthesis of protein, or in other words, it
      helps our bodies use protein more efficiently. Urea has also been
      proven to be an extraordinary antibacterial and anti-viral agent,
      and is one of the best natural diuretics ever discovered.<br>
      <br>
      These are a few more examples of commercial medical applications
      of urine and urea in use today:<br>
      <br>
      Ureaphil: diuretic made from urea<br>
      Urofollitropin: urine-extract fertility drug<br>
      PureaSkin: urea cream for skin problems<br>
      Amino-Cerv: urea cream used for cervical treatments<br>
      Premarin: urine-extract estrogen supplement<br>
      Panafil: urea/papain ointment for skin ulcers, burns and infected
      wounds<br>
      <br>
      Urea was discovered and isolated as long ago as 1773 and is
      currently marketed in a variety of different drug forms.<br>
      <br>
      Another urine-related product ingredient is carbamide. Carbamide
      is the chemical name for synthesized urea. Where do you find
      carbamide? - in places you'd never thought of such as in products
      like Murine Ear Drops and Murine Ear Wax Removal System, which
      contain carbamide peroxide, a combination of synthetic urea and
      hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      Medical researchers have also proven that urea is one of the best
      and only medically proven effective skin moisturizers in the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      In many years of laboratory studies researchers discovered that,
      unlike just about all other types of oil-based moisturizers that
      simply sit on the top layers of the skin and do nothing to improve
      water retention within skin cells (which gives skin its elasticity
      and wrinkle-free appearance), urea actually increases the
      water-binding capacity of the skin by opening skin layers for
      hydrogen bonding, which then attracts moisture to dry skin cells.<br>
      <br>
      This is a remarkable fact considering that women spend billions of
      dollars a year on outrageously expensive skin moisturizers whose
      ingredients, even in tightly controlled double-blind comparison
      tests (see Chapter 4), don't even come close to hydrating dry skin
      as well as simple, inexpensive urea. So as surprising as it seems,
      urine and urea do have an amazing and voluminous history in both
      traditional and modem medicine.<br>
      <br>
      An article in the New York State Journal of Medicine in 1980 by
      Dr. John R. Herman, Clinical Professor of Urology at Albert
      Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, points out the
      general misconceptions regarding urine and its medical use:<br>
      <br>
      "Autouropathy (urine therapy) did flourish in many parts of the
      world and it continues to flourish today...there is, unknown to
      most of us, a wide usage of uropathy and a great volume of
      knowledge available showing the multitudinous advantages of this
      modality ...<br>
      <br>
      Urine is only a derivative of the blood...If the blood should not
      be considered ‘unclean’, then the urine also should not be so
      considered. Normally excreted, urine is a fluid of tremendous
      variations of composition ...<br>
      <br>
      Actually, the listed constituents of human urine can be carefully
      checked and no items not found in human diet are found in it.
      Percentages differ, of course, but urinary constituents are
      valuable to human metabolism… "<br>
      <br>
      Look up urea in a medical dictionary. In Mosby's Medical and
      Nursing Dictionary urea is defined, not as a useless body waste,
      but as a systemic diuretic and topical skin treatment. It's also
      prescribed to reduce excess fluid pressure on the brain and eyes.<br>
      <br>
      Uric acid, another ingredient of urine, is normally thought of as
      an undesirable waste product of the body that causes gout. But
      even uric acid has recently been found to have tremendous
      health-promoting and medical implications. Medical researchers at
      the University of California at Berkeley reported in 1982 that
      they have discovered that:<br>
      <br>
      Uric acid could be a defense against cancer and aging.<br>
      <br>
      It also destroys body-damaging chemicals called free radicals that
      are present in food, water and air and are considered to be a
      cause of cáncer and breakdowns in immune function.<br>
      <br>
      Uric acid could be one of the things that enable human beings to
      live so much longer than other mammals. — Omni Magazine, Oct. 1982<br>
      <br>
      Urine is a critically important body fluid that has fascinated
      medical science throughout the centuries. Medical scientists study
      urine with tremendous intensity because, unlike the public, they
      know that it contains innumerable vital body nutrients and
      thousands of natural elements that control and regulate every
      function of the body<br>
      <br>
      The research book on urine published in 1975, Urinalysis in
      Clinical Laboratory Practice, stated that:<br>
      <br>
      "The magnitude of the attention which urine receives is attested
      to by a recent study which dealt with only the low-molecular
      weight constituents of human urine. This publication revealed that
      more than 1,000 technical and scientific papers, related only to
      low molecular weight substances in urine, appeared in the medical
      and scientific literatura in one (1) single year...<br>
      <br>
      It is now recognized that the urine contains thousands of
      compounds, and as new, more sensitive analytical tools evolve, it
      is quite certain that new constituents of urine will be
      recognized."<br>
      <br>
      So, whether we know it or not, urine does have an extremely
      important and undisputed place in medicine – and not just as a
      diagnostic tool or as an ingredient of various synthetic drugs.<br>
      <br>
      As the research studies presented in Chapter Four illustrate,
      natural urine and simple urea have been used consistently and
      extensively by medical researchers and scientists over the entire
      course of the twentieth century and have been proven to be
      profoundly effective and comprehensive therapeutic medicines that
      even in their natural or basic forms can produce outstanding and
      amazing healing results. Your first reaction once you've read the
      convincing research demonstrating urine's often startling medical
      uses may be a willingness to use it as long as it's altered enough
      to make it unrecognizable. Many people might consider a synthetic
      or chemically altered form of urine, such as urokinase, the blood
      clot dissolver, as preferable to using it as a natural medicine.<br>
      <br>
      But as we'll discuss throughout the book, there are many reasons
      for using urine in its natural form, rather than as a synthetic
      drug or extract, not the least of which is the fact that there is
      no synthetic equivalent for individual urine and never will be,
      owing to the tremendous complexity and uniqueness of each person's
      urine constituents.<br>
      <br>
      Just as nature produces no two people who are exactly the same,
      there are also no two urine samples in the world that contain
      exactly the same components. Your own urine contains elements that
      are specific to your body alone which are medicinally valuable
      ingredients tailormade to your own health disorders.<br>
      <br>
      How can that be? Because your urine contains hundreds of elements
      that are manufactured by your body to deal with your personal,
      specific health conditions. Your body is constantly producing a
      huge variety of antibodies, hormones, enzymes and other natural
      chemicals to regulate and control your body's functions and to
      combat diseases that you may or may not know you have.<br>
      <br>
      Modern research and clinical studies have proven that the
      thousands of critical body chemicals and nutrients that end up in
      your individual urine reflect your individual body functions, and
      when reutilized, act as natural vaccines, antibacterial,
      antiviral, anti-cancer agents, hormone balancers, allergy
      relievers, etc., (talk about the perfect preventive care
      treatment!).<br>
      <br>
      Many doctors have discovered and shown that it's extremely
      important to use our own natural urine in healing because extracts
      or synthetic drug forms of urine don't contain all of these
      individualized elements that address our personal, individual
      health needs .<br>
      <br>
      Another reason that many doctors have emphasized the use of the
      natural form of urine is that it does not produce side effects,
      whereas synthetic drugs and therapies all produce side effects,
      many of which are extremely dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, the urine-extract drug called urokinase, which is
      used to dissolve dangerous blood clots, can cause serious abnormal
      bleeding as a side effect; but natural urine itself (which
      contains measurable amounts of urokinase) has been used
      medicinally even in extremely large quantities without causing
      side effects.<br>
      <br>
      If you're not familiar with just how pervasive and extreme the
      risk of chemical drug-taking is, go to the library and look up a
      copy of The Physician's Desk Reference. This is the doctor's guide
      to every prescription and over-the-counter drug on the market, and
      every one of them is accompanied by a long list of ominous and
      frightening potential side effects.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, in almost 100 years of laboratory and clinical
      studies on the use of the use of natural urine and simple urea in
      medicine, extraordinary results have been obtained, but NO toxic
      or dangerous side effects to the user have ever been observed or
      reported by either researchers or patients using the therapy. As
      we've learned, urea, which is the principal solid ingredient of
      urine, has been synthesized and medically used with excellent
      results and with no side effects. But again, as you'll read in the
      next chapter, research has shown that whole urine can cure many
      disorders that urea cannot, because urine contains thousands of
      therapeutic agents, such as important natural antibodies, enzymes
      and regulating hormones that urea alone does not contain.<br>
      <br>
      Urine therapy not only has dozens of successful research trials
      supporting it, but also thousands of success stories from people
      all over the world. As many people today have discovered,
      conventional medicine held no answers for either their chronic or
      acute illnesses and health disorders – but urine therapy did.<br>

      Learning More About One of the Biggest Secrets in Medical History<br>
      <br>
      I realize that by now many of you are saying to yourselves, "All
      this information on the medical use of urine sounds fascinating,
      but can I really use this therapy at home? How would I get
      started, and how can I possibly get past my first fears and
      reluctance to try it for myself?"<br>
      <br>
      <b>GETTING STARTED</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In reality, beginning the therapy is completely simple and
      painless. You're going to be starting the internal therapy with
      extremely small amounts. 1 to 2 drops is all that is needed as a
      first internal dose, and as medical research studies presented in
      Chapter 4 show, (see Dr. C.E. Lewis and Dr N. Dunne), even a few
      drops can be therapeutically very effective. Also, if you prefer,
      you can make an extremely diluted form of urine called a
      homeopathic urine preparation, which gives excellent results and
      contains no taste or color. Chapter 6 contains complete and
      detailed instructions that will answer all your questions,
      including howto get started, how to prepare homeopathic urine,
      etc., and will make it easy for you to learn how to take advantage
      of this incomparable natural medicine in your everyday life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW TO USE THE BOOK</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is so much information contained in this book, that it may
      all seem somewhat overwhelming at first; more than 50 research
      reports by doctors and medical scientists on the use of urine
      therapy are reviewed, and all are filled with extensive case
      studies, as well as the doctor's comments and observations on
      their studies.<br>
      <br>
      If you have a specific disorder and feel that you don't want to
      read all of the studies in order to get to the one that applies to
      you, look up your condition in the Index listing which will tell
      you where the information on your disorder is located in the book.
      Also, make sure that you read the instructions in Chapter 6 before
      beginning the therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The use of urine in medicine is such a huge and previously
      untouched consumer subject that reading, organizing and compiling
      the pertinent information has presented quite a challenge. So to
      make it more comprehensible, I've devoted each chapter to
      particular, specific issues related to the medical use of urine.<br>
      <br>
      The first and second chapters have been a general introduction to
      the largely unknown medical uses of urine and its importance as a
      natural medicinal. In Chapter 3, we'll discuss why medical
      practitioners and the general public know nothing about the
      medical applications of urine even though there are centuries of
      historical anecdotes and volumes of modem scientific reports
      advocating its value.<br>
      <br>
      We'll also discuss more about why the use of the natural form of
      urine is preferable to urine extracts.<br>
      <br>
      Chapter 4 is an in-depth look at selected laboratory and clinical
      studies conducted by doctors and researchers on the medical
      applications and significance of urine therapy. These extensive
      research studies span a period of almost an entire century.<br>
      <br>
      Chapter 5 presents the interesting history of the use of urine
      therapy around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Chapter 6 contains directions for home use.<br>
      <br>
      Chapter 7 presents personal testimonials on specific disorders and
      disease conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In these days of anxiety and fear about health care, perhaps the
      most important thing for all of us to remember is that knowledge
      is our greatest strength and our best health insurance. The more
      we know about our bodies and how to use simple, safe remedies to
      correct diseases and chronic illnesses, the healthier and happier
      each one of us will be.<br>
      <br>
      By the time you finish reading everything that people, doctors and
      scientists have to say about urine therapy, you will agree,
      without a doubt, that it's one of the best and most valuable
      medical secrets that any of us have ever discovered. The medicinal
      properties of urine are so comprehensive and so astounding, yet so
      easily accessible that it gives each one of us amazing personal
      power over our own health that we never even knew we possessed –
      the cost-free, natural healing power of our own perfect medicine.n<br>

      <div align="center"><b>CHAPTER 3</b><br>
        <b>WHY NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE MOST RESEARCHED NATURAL
          SUBSTANCE IN MEDICINE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      One of the questions that I'm most asked about urine therapy is:
      "If it's so wonderful and there's so much scientific evidence
      supporting it, why don't my doctors and the public know about it
      and why isn't it more widely used?"<br>
      <br>
      Historically, the medical use of urine was qyute well known
      throughout the world. There are many reports that date back
      thousands of years, (see Chapter Five), which extol the virtues of
      urine both as a diagnostic tool and as a medicinal treatment for a
      wide variety of diseases, wounds and skin disorders.<br>
      <br>
      And yet today, even after nearly 100 years of consistent and
      authoritative modem medical research showing urine or urea to be
      one of the simplest, cheapest, most effective medicinal substances
      in existence, the vast majority of us, including even our own
      doctors, still mistakenly believe that urine is nothing more than
      a body waste or a medical diagnostic tool.<br>
      <br>
      About all that consumers today know about urine in medicine is
      that you hand a sample of it to the doctor's nurse when you go for
      an office visit so they can test it for whatever it is that they
      test it for. And it's pretty much the same for the doctors. So how
      have we and our doctors, who are supposed to know about these
      things, completely missed thousands of years of historical
      references and almost a century's worth of definitive modern
      research discoveries on the medical use of urine?<br>
      <br>
      To really understand why the extensive medical use of urine is
      largely unknown and unpublicized today, we have to look more
      closely at the background and the history of modern medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Before the advent of modem medicines, there were few man-made
      drugs, and even fewer doctors to administer them -and, for most
      people, no money for to pay the doctors even when they were
      available. So people generally treated their illnesses with prayer
      and such common sense approaches as good food, rest and whatever
      substances they found in nature that were traditionally known to
      have medicinal qualities - things like simple herbs, plants,
      minerals, urine, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This natural approach to healing had recognizable benefits and
      even well-known and historically respected doctors such as
      Hippocrates taught that the body's own natural defenses should be
      supported and emphasized in healing and that gentle, natural
      medical approaches should always be used first before resorting to
      stronger interventions.<br>
      <br>
      But throughout the known history of man and medicine, there has
      always been a type of "tagstaKm" going on between those who felt
      that nature was the best healer, and others who were convinced
      that man could intellectually devise healing techniques that would
      put Mother Nature to shame.<br>
      <br>
      One'of the most potent arguments on the side of those who favored
      science over nature were the various historical plagues of
      infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhoid, dysentery and the
      dreaded bubonic or “black plague” that would intermittently strike
      and wipe out millions of people in record time. Traditional
      medical approaches seemed of little use against such plagues, and
      westerners in particular began to search science for methods of
      overcoming these diseases.<br>
      <br>
      During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, science
      did discover man-made synthetic drugs like penicillin that seemed
      to prevent these killer plagues and other dangerous illnesses, and
      the age of modem synthetic medicine began. By the time the second
      half of the twentieth century had rolled around, mankind's
      scientific advances in medicine had produced a wide variety of
      sophisticated drugs and technology that seemed to make traditional
      health approaches obsolete.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently, mankind and technology had finally won the battle
      against nature. In some ways, it appeared that humanity had even
      overcome its dependence on God; as Robert Koch, who first
      discovered microbes commented, "In the nineteenth century, man
      lost his fear of God and gained a fear of microbes." And perhaps
      this is true, because, unlike our great-grandparents and other
      ancestors back to the beginning of time, most modern societies
      today depend much more on drugs and medical science than on God,
      or the medicines that nature provides for healing disease or
      correcting health disorders. This is largely because today's
      medical community has conditioned us to believe that medical
      science, drugs and surgery are all that are needed to keep
      humanity healthy, happy and disease-free.<br>
      <br>
      Medical science, not God and prayer, is now offered as our hope
      for increased longevity and a type of immortality, as scientists
      experiment with such things as cryogenics (freezing the body so
      that it can be 'resurrected' by future scientists), and surgical
      organ transplants that seem as though they could possibly extend
      our physical lives indefinitely. When infertility occurs, we can
      now turn, not to nature, or spiritual, or even psychological
      understanding, which often seem to fail to give us what we want,
      but to the mechanical manipulations of medical science which allow
      us to simply 'detour' around frustrating and 'unfair' natural
      impediments. In view of all of the apparent advances and
      advantages of twentieth century medical science, the simpler,
      traditional and more natural approaches to medicine like urine
      therapy have appeared to be pseless and ineffective to us, and we
      were right to have abandoned them in favor of 'objective'
      scientific medicine — or so we thought.<br>
      <br>
      The book, The Betrayal of Health, published in 1991 by Dr. Joseph
      Beasely, M.D., a medical doctor and former Harvard University
      administrator and dean of the School of Public Health at Tulane
      University, simply and eloquently tells the story of the
      development of modern medicine and its unfortunate, unforeseen
      consequences:<br>
      <br>
      "From the earliest days of medical science there have been two
      distinct but complementary approaches to health — the pursuit of
      well-being (the naturalistic school) and the cure of disease (the
      allopathic school). Hippocrates combined both approaches in his
      practice and medical teachings — stressing that the physician must
      be skilled in Nature and understand the patient in relation to his
      or her food, drink, and occupation, as well as the effect each of
      these factors has on the others.<br>
      <br>
      Health was an equilibrium between the mind and body and the
      external world, disease a disruption of this natural harmony.<br>
      <br>
      Treatment involved creating the conditions in which the body could
      maintain and cure itself through its internal healing mechanisms.
      When disease did manifest itself, specific intervention would be
      applied, but natural cures such as dietary changes were preferred
      over drugs."<br>
      <br>
      But as Dr. Beasley points out, this balanced; natural approach to
      medicine did not survive the twentieth century avalanche of
      enthusiasm for sophisticated synthetic drugs and surgery that
      seemingly freed us from the scourges of infectious disease
      epidemics and other serious illnesses:<br>
      <br>
      "The modern approach to illness and health developed over
      centuries of battles against a host of diseases. During most of
      those years, medicine was not particularly effective. Plagues and
      contagions wiped out entire populations as medical practitioners
      labored in vain to find a cure.<br>
      <br>
      These centuries of medical failure made the relatively recent
      century of medical success all the more impressive."<br>
      <br>
      As Dr. Beasley states, the medical community and the public became
      so sure that science could find a specific drug cure for every
      illness that everyone totally ignored the importance of factors
      like natural medicines, nutrition, environment and mental health
      in creating and maintaining good health:<br>
      <br>
      "The discovery and destruction of the germs responsible for
      disease led doctors (and their patients) to place their faith in
      the scientific [medical] model that had so miraculously saved
      humanity from its most ancient enemies.<br>
      <br>
      But in the process of developing modern medical methods, medicine
      has abandoned (or forgotten) some of its most ancient and
      worthwhile traditions. The complex interactions of nutrition were
      neglected even as they were being discovered. And there has been
      even less interest in the interactive effects of environmental
      agents or of long-term behavioral patterns on health"<br>
      <br>
      The seemingly enormous healing power of new synthetic drugs
      appeared to make common sense natural approaches to medicine
      obsolete. Now that we had miracle antibiotics that could
      apparently cure everything and powerful pain relievers and new,
      fantastic surgical techniques, who needed outmoded,
      unsophisticated natural medical approaches like urine therapy or
      nutrition or homeopathy or herbs?<br>
      <br>
      As the twentieth century progressed, people didn't treat
      themselves at home anymore with time-honored natural remedies. It
      you got sick, instead of treating yourself with more rest, better
      food and a simple traditional natural medicine, you went to the
      doctor or the drug store to buy whatever 'miracle' drug was
      popular at the time, or you had an operation.<br>
      <br>
      In our century, drug companies, and the medical researchers they
      hired, took the job of making and experimenting with medicines
      away from doctors and the public and withdrew into their
      laboratories.<br>
      <br>
      In scientific seclusion, far removed from the world of the
      doctor-patient relationship, researchers experimented with
      chemical compounds and isolated medically active ingredients in
      natural substances such as previously well-known herbs or urine,
      and then formulated drugs from these elements.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of urine therapy, urine was used in its natural form,
      or as simple urea in numerous clinical tests throughout our
      century, but these studies were never publicized, because, for the
      most part, the use of natural medicines had been discontinued in
      medical practice in favor of patented drugs and surgery.<br>
      <br>
      With our new system of modem medicine, people no longer felt that
      it was necessary or important for them to know how their bodies
      worked or how to treat themselves with simple methods at home.
      Most consumers felt that the knowledge of the body and how to heal
      it was best left in the hands of scientists and trained doctors
      and surgeons who knew so much more than we did about how to
      manipulate and alter the body and defeat disease.<br>
      <br>
      In this scenario, the use of urine therapy wasn't important to the
      public. No one talked about it or shared the information with
      their family and friends as they had in days gone by. And even
      though modem researchers were discovering amazing things about
      urine therapy, these discoveries were kept within the walls of
      academic research and were never or rarely shared with the public.<br>
      <br>
      But were we right to abandon traditional and common sense
      approaches to healing? Should natural healing methods like urine
      therapy have a place in our lives or should we just continue to
      completely surrender our personal health-care needs and concerns
      to doctors and medical researchers? Are chemical drugs and surgery
      really the answer to all our health problems? As most of us are
      aware today — they're not.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how many incredible discoveries medical science may have
      made during the twentieth century, millions of us are sick or even
      crippledby illness today. Our doctors don't know what to do. Our
      scientists continue to tell us that science, drugs and surgery
      will cure us, but they don't.<br>
      <br>
      As The Betrayal of Health points out, our modern miracle medicine
      is not the miracle we thought it was:<br>
      <br>
      "As the infectious diseases became less and less prevalent, and
      the chronic diseases advanced to the forefront of illness, cracks
      have begun to appear in the fortress of allopathic medicine. The
      methods that had produced the successes of Jenner, Pasteur, Koch,
      Fleming and Salk no longer seemed to be working. Further flaws in,
      and abuses of, modern medical techniques have become all too
      apparent. The unqualified successes of earlier decades have come
      up against the failures of modern medicine.<br>
      <br>
      The epidemic of chronic illness in the United States, particularly
      arterial disease and cancer, is the stellar embarrassment of
      medicine and its high-technology weapons.<br>
      <br>
      These degenerative illnesses — far from being bull's eye illnesses
      — are complex dysfunctions of bodily systems that must be
      approached systematically.<br>
      <br>
      With them, the model of specific cause/specific medical
      intervention simply isn't working. What is worse, many
      interventions, from prescription drugs to expensive surgery, cause
      more harm than good when they are overused or abused by doctors
      and patients.<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, the wonder drugs of the last century may never have
      worked as well as we thought. Medical historians report that the
      dramatic improvements in morbidity and mortality rates in the past
      hundred years were not exclusively, nor even mainly, due to
      doctors' intervention.<br>
      <br>
      The great health improvements of the nineteenth century were not
      the result of medical interventions per se, but of basic
      improvements in nutritional and living conditions that coincided
      with (and often preceded) these interventions." So even though we
      believed that drugs and medical science alone were responsible for
      saving us from smallpox and typhoid and other terrible diseases,
      this was never true. The truth was that we got fewer infectious
      diseases in the twentieth century because we had better living
      conditions. For the first time in history, we had widespread modem
      sanitation, clean water and more and better food distribution than
      ever before. In the modem environment of civilized nations,
      infectious diseases disappeared because the breeding grounds for
      germs, such as open sewers, contaminated water supplies and
      malnourished bodies were largely eliminated. But medical science
      undeservedly took and received the greatest credit and public
      acclaim for these tremendous health improvements. And the medical
      community today is still trying to convince us that no matter what
      goes wrong with our bodies, the solution will always be found
      within the realm of drugs and surgery.<br>
      <br>
      It is true that drugs and surgery can be extremely effective for
      critical care, health emergencies, structural deformities or
      accident cases, but these aggressive therapies should never have
      developed into everyday medical approaches that we automatically
      resort to almost immediately for every imaginable illness we
      contract.<br>
      <br>
      Western culture made a grave error when it eliminated all natural
      approaches to health in favor of drugs and surgery. Natural
      healing methods that gently stimulate and support the immune
      system without dangerous side effects have advantages that drugs
      and surgery can't offer. And it wasn't that traditional natural
      health therapies, such as urine therapy, hadn't worked in the past
      – it was simply that historically they weren't always applied
      within the context of good nutrition and sanitation and proper
      health practices because this knowledge wasn't available in the
      centuries preceding ours.<br>
      <br>
      And as Beasely points out, it was extremely ironic that even
      though modem science has proven the importance and impact of such
      common sense factors as diet and relaxation on health, the medical
      community and consumers have almost completely ignored these
      findings.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, if a typical consumer today is having trouble
      falling asleep chances are the person will immediately resort to
      Nytol, or Sominex, or whatever sleeping pill he or she saw
      advertised and promoted by drug companies on TV, and never even
      consider or try simple natural solutions such as taking a walk or
      warm bath, or drinking a soothing cup of tea, or eliminating the
      late-night snack of pepperoni pizza that's upsetting the stomach
      and causing insomnia – even though there is clear scientific
      evidence, not to mention common sense, that indicates that
      relaxation and dietary changes can help promote good sleep.<br>
      <br>
      This' same contradiction is also true for urine therapy. Medical
      scientists have proven the medical efficacy of natural urine and
      urea over and over again, but the medical community and drug
      companies have completely ignored these research findings – unless
      of course, a patentable drug form of urine such as Pergonal or
      Urokinase, can be developed.<br>
      <br>
      It's unfortunate that even as most people and practicing doctors
      forgot about the use of natural urine therapy, medical researchers
      were discovering incredible things about the medicinal value of
      urine.<br>
      <br>
      During this century, researchers sat in their laboratories and
      watched as simple urea or whole urine completely destroyed rabies
      and polio viruses, tuberculosis, typhoid, gonorrhea, dysentery
      bacteria and cáncer cells.<br>
      <br>
      They found that urine contains a huge array of incredibly valuable
      and medically important elements and they injected and orally
      administered urine and urea to thousands of patients in clinical
      tests.<br>
      <br>
      They watched as it saved the lives of cancer patients, cured and
      relieved asthma, eczema, whooping cough, migraines, diabetes,
      glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and a host of other illnesses. But
      the general public was never told about such discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors and consumers today are given access to urine-related
      drugs, but have no idea of the tremendous overall value and health
      benefits of the natural urine that the drug was derived from. And
      medical researchers see absolutely no reason why any of us should
      know about it. All we need to know, in their estimation, is that
      they've developed a drug for a disease and where or what it's
      derived from is of little or no importance.<br>
      <br>
      So why are many people like myself now resurrecting and using
      natural urine therapy instead of using sophisticated 'wonder'
      drugs and surgery? The answer is simple – drugs and surgery didn't
      work, but urine therapy did. -<br>
      <br>
      Urine therapy is regaining attention today because as the
      twentieth century draws to a close, millions of people are
      becoming aware that the keys to good health do not lie in the
      laboratory or the operating room.<br>
      <br>
      Many of us now realize that when we threw out our natural medical
      approaches and methods of self-care, we eliminated crucially
      important elements in healing that can't be replaced by drugs or
      surgery. Unlike naturally occurring medicines, chemical drugs are
      extremely concentrated synthetic substances. Yes, these abnormally
      high concentrations may seem to produce a "knock-out punch" to
      disease symptoms, but what good is it if the drug delivers the
      same knock-out punch to your health as a whole?<br>
      <br>
      We may think we're winning the battle against disease, but we all
      know we're losing the war. The AIDS epidemic and the other modern
      health epidemics of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, chronic
      fatigue syndrome, debilitating allergies, auto-immune diseases,
      ulcers, etc. aren't being cured by modem medicine. And one of the
      biggest reasons for this failure is that these modem epidemics are
      immune deficiency diseases which cannot be treated by
      immune-suppressing therapies such as drugs and surgery.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, every single drug or surgical technique that exists in
      some way weakens and impairs our immune system functions, so it's
      imposible for these methods to cure the immune-deficiency diseases
      that are now killing and maiming us.<br>
      <br>
      The health epidemics of today are the consequences of many
      environmental factors that strain and break down our bodies'
      natural immune defenses, so drugs and surgery which further weaken
      our immune systems do absolutely nothing to cure or help us. They
      seem to temporarily win the battle against the symptoms of
      illness, but in the end they lose the wax because they suppress
      and destroy the very thing that makes and keeps us well – our own
      natural body defenses.<br>
      <br>
      Natural urine therapy was abandoned and forgotten by the public in
      the twentieth century because we were so sure that drugs and
      surgery were the answers to all our health problems. But time has
      shown us our error.<br>
      <br>
      As we watch the often terrible and fatal consequences of decades
      of complete reliance on immune-suppressing synthetic drugs and
      surgical techniques unfold,we worriedly search the pages of
      history to rediscover and relearn the lost arts of caring for
      ourselves with simple, safe. and healthful natural healing.<br>
      <br>
      Urine therapy is a natural therapy that is not widely known today,
      but in reality, it is not a lost healing art. As the material in
      this book shows, urine therapy has been kept very much alive by
      modem medical science throughout the twentieth century, even
      though it has rarely been publicized.<br>
      <br>
      In reality,-urine therapy cannot even be accurately classed as a
      traditional folk-remedy today, because during the twentieth
      century it has been used almost exclusively by mainstream medical
      scientists and researchers and not by consumers themselves, but
      this is changing.<br>
      <br>
      So, in conclusion, it is the "surgery and drugs are all we need"
      philosophy of the present conventional medical system that is one
      major reason why you and your doctors have never heard of mine
      therapy. But there is another big reason why so many know so
      little about the world's least expensive and most powerful and
      effective natural medicine - very simply stated - there's no
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicine and Money</b><br>
      <br>
      I think that most of us are under the impression that somewhere in
      thesequestered halls of academia, benevolent,doctors and research
      scientists are altruistically slaving over their petri dishes and
      test tubes, feverishly searching for new medical methods and cures
      that will relieve and eradicate physical suffering and illness -
      and that as soon as they make these wondrous new discoveries
      they'll immediately release the results of their studies to a
      desperately expectant world of sick and suffering people.<br>
      <br>
      But as true as we want this scenario to be, it isn't the reality.
      The reality is that medical researchers are not the ones who
      ultimately decide what medical treatments the public receives as a
      result of medical research studies.<br>
      <br>
      The architects of today's medical system are not primarily medical
      researchers or doctors, but rather, the drug companies. Medical
      research requires funding and from the very beginning of the age
      of modem medicine, researchers have largely depended on
      pharmaceutical companies to supply those funds. So many times we
      hear what the companies, and not the researchers, want us to hear
      about research discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      The great pharmaceutical advances of the early 1900's that gave us
      the first new vaccines, penicillin, antitoxins and the
      'miraculous' sulfa drugs were financed in large part by big
      pharmaceutical companies like Bayer and I.G. Farben. Now, while
      the owners of these drug companies may have had some altruistic
      interests, the lifeblood of their companies was not medicine, but
      money.<br>
      <br>
      Simple, inexpensive medicines like herbs, homeopathic remedies or
      urine therapy that have been shown to be just as effective, safer
      and much less expensive than chemical drug compounds may be better
      for the public but they're no good for drug company profits and
      are therefore not promoted and sold.<br>
      <br>
      It's in the drug industry's best interest to ignore and invalidate
      medicines and traditional therapies that can't be patented and
      don't produce big profits. And in simple economic terms, this is
      how any business survives and prospers — by selling and promoting
      the products that make the most money. Pharmaceutical firms by
      their very nature must promote profit-making medicines to keep
      their companies alive.<br>
      <br>
      The way our medical system works today, drug companies are the
      primary entities that fund research, and test and prepare medical
      treatments for government approval, and this is also true in many
      countries throughout the world. And it's extremely expensive for a
      company to conduct research for a new method and get it through
      the approval process — to do this can cost as much as an estimated
      $150 million per treatment. So a pharmaceutical company has to
      promote the medical approaches that will assure big "pay offs" in
      order for the company to survive.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, medicines that keep drug companies alive and
      healthy, even if they're government approved, can often make
      people sick — or even kill them. Drugs like DES and thalidomide
      may have been big profit makers but they later created horrible
      health disorders and hideous fetal deformities when used by
      trusting consumers. Metabolic synthetic steroids, once hailed as
      miracle muscle-builders and used freely, are now killing and
      maiming many of their users. Aspirin was considered to be the
      ultimate miracle fever and pain reducer until it was discovered
      that it causes the Reyes syndrome that can kill children and can
      also cause severe abdominal bleeding in adults.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is that no matter how much research or how many amazing
      or successful clinical trials have been performed by researchers
      on safe, inexpensive medical approaches like urine therapy, if
      these therapies are not perceived as profitable by pharmaceutical
      companies, they will simply not be 'picked up' by the drug
      companies and presented for government approval, which means that
      the public will probably never hear about the research or receive
      the benefits of these substances, no matter how wonderful they
      are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FIDA) does not
      generally research or test medical treatments itself — it depends
      on private companies to do that. And because of this fact, the FDA
      does not have firsts hand knowledge of which treatments are
      effective and safe and which aren't; they rely on the company that
      has developed the treatment to tell them which treatments should
      be marketed to consumers.<br>
      <br>
      As the book, The Betrayal of Health reveals:<br>
      <br>
      "The drug industry is a business. In a regrettable Catch-22, the
      main sources of information for the regulation of the
      pharmaceutical industry are the companies themselves. The
      'watchdog' of the drug industry, the Food and Drug Administration,
      sets testing standards and then evaluates the test results
      submitted by the companies.<br>
      <br>
      In determining whether a drug is 'safe, the FDA does not perform
      clinical trials of new drugs and only rarely runs toxicity tests.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the FDA must make its decisions based on information
      provided by the very company that wants to market the drug. If the
      information provided is fraudulent, the FDA (and the public) is
      unlikely to find out about it until a significant problem
      occurs...<br>
      <br>
      Despite the conflict of interest inherent in such situations, drug
      companies continue to be the major fonder of research on most
      common diseases and their potential treatment.<br>
      <br>
      And it is no surprise that the research focuses on finding new
      chemical methods of managing disease — or at least symptoms.
      Indeed, could one expect A.H. Robbins or SmithKline or Ciba-Geigy
      to fund research on therapies (such as nutrition) that cannot be
      patented and will not significantly increase their market share?"
      The results of this unfortunate mix of medicine and money are
      reflected by the lack of attention given to research findings on
      urine and urea therapy. For example, urea, has been shown to be a
      much safer, simpler, less expensive and more effective diuretic
      than the diuretic drug, Diamox (see Urea — New Use Of An Old
      Agent, next chapter). Yet, in The Physician's Desk Reference,
      Diamox is mentioned under the diuretic category, but urea isn't —
      unlike simple urea, Diamox is a patented compound drug, insuring
      that the company's profits from the drug will be maximized and
      protected.<br>
      <br>
      Another example of how money and medicine don't mix is the
      conventional medical community's treatment of medicinal herbs.
      There are numerous research studies proving the effectiveness,
      safety and diverse medical applications of herbs, yet any
      conventional doctor you talk to will tell you that herbal medicine
      is ridiculously unscientific and ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors tell you this, not because it's true, but because their
      medical Training is completely centered around drug and surgery
      treatments promoted by the pharmaceutical industry<br>
      <br>
      In the book, The Scientific Validation of Herbal Medicine, the
      author, Daniel Mowrey, lists hundreds of scientific studies that
      not only validate the medicinal effectiveness of herbs, but in
      many cases, prove that the natural herb or herbal extract can be
      just as effective as its synthetic counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, the herb Cinchona was originally used for treating
      malaria and has been clinically proven to be just as effective as
      the synthetic drug quinine - and the herb is safe and non-toxic.<br>
      <br>
      But even though millions of pounds of Cinchona were imported for
      medical use into the U.S. before the development of synthetic
      quinine, drug companies today would never consider recommending or
      advertising Cinchona. Why? Because synthetic drugs, unlike herbs
      or other simple medicines, can be patented and sold for much more
      profit.<br>
      <br>
      And unfortunately, if the drug companies do not present a natural
      therapy such asurine therapy to the FDA-for approval because it's
      unprofitable for them, the therapy doesn't get approved for use.
      That means that neither you or your doctor will hear about it or
      use it.<br>
      <br>
      Urea is approved by the FDA and is used, as you've read, in
      several different commercial forms. But urea itself is extremely
      inexpensive and non-patentable so the truly important and often
      astounding medical breakthroughs using simple urea in research
      studies have never been given proper recognition, even though the
      researchers themselves have often stressed its importance and made
      repeated but unsuccessful attempts to bring the information to the
      attention of the medical community.<br>
      <br>
      Consumers, and especially doctors, over the last 50 years have
      been thoroughly and completely indoctrinated with the "a drug a
      day keeps disease away" promotion of the drug companies, and have
      neglected the simpler, safer methods like natural urine or urea
      therapy. But how do we know that our doctors are right and that
      the drug companies are telling the truth when they say that the
      drugs we're taking are safe and effective and will heal the health
      disorders that we're taking them for?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chemical Drugs - How Safe and Effective Are They?</b><br>
      <br>
      Many people are afraid to try urine therapy because it's not
      recommended by conventional doctors. And our doctors, if we ask
      them, will tell us that they've never heard of it and if they
      have, they don't recommend it because it's never been proven safe
      or effective, whereas the drugs they prescribe are scientifically
      proven safe and effective and therefore have passed FDA approval
      testing. Drug companies and researchers tell us the same things
      about their drugs.<br>
      <br>
      And like the uninformed health-care consumers that so many of us
      are, we believe them. But this information is, simply speaking, a
      big, fat lie.<br>
      <br>
      The statement that medical therapies like urine therapy or herbal
      medicines are dangerous, unproven or "quackery", and that only FDA
      approved drugs and therapies are safe and effective is a blatant
      falsehood.<br>
      <br>
      As you'll see after reading the research studies in the next
      chapter, not only does urine therapy have enormous scientific
      proof and validity on its side, but, unlike drugs and surgery, not
      one person has ever suffered adverse side effects or died while
      using urine and urea medicinally in nearly 100 years of scientific
      scrutiny and use.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, of the more than edicin that are available to
      anyone at anytime off any drug store or grocery store shelf, only
      1/3 of them have ever been demonstrated to be safe or effective
      and all are proven to have dangerous potential side effects and
      overdoses can even cause death.<br>
      <br>
      And don't take my word for it. Listen to what a large group of
      medical research scientists and doctors say about this issue in
      the book they wrote in 1983, entitled Over The Counter Pills That
      Don't Work. This book is a real eye opener, and will make you
      realize that just because a substance is FDA approved, available
      over the counter in the store, or doctor recommended, it has not
      necessarily been proven safe and effective:<br>
      <br>
      "...Every day, on television, on the radio, in newspapers, in
      magazines, drug= companies spend millions of your dollars to tell
      you about the wonders of their special and 'unique' over the
      counter drugs..."<br>
      <br>
      But fewer than ? of these over the counter drug ingredients have
      been shown to be safe and effective for their intended uses.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, many OTC [over-the-counter] drug products which
      you purchase contain one or more ingredients which do not meet the
      Federal drug law standards for safety, effectiveness, or both.<br>
      <br>
      Of the more than 1.0 billion dollars Americans spend each year on
      OTC drugs, at least 3 or 4 billion dollars are wasted on grossly
      overpriced products or products with ingredients lacking evidence
      of safety or effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      Since all drug ingredients have risks, extra ingredients which
      aren't effective or which lack evidence of effectiveness subject
      you to extra risks without providing compensating benefits. So you
      are not only wasting your money when you buy products with such
      ingredients, but you are also risking your health and that of your
      family.<br>
      <br>
      Starting 10 years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      established a large number of over the counter drug advisory
      panels –including physicians, pharmacists and other technically
      qualified people. They reviewed...the ingredients contained in
      approximately 300,000 brands of (OTC) drugs to determine if these
      ingredients werer safe or effective_according to the FDA's
      Director of OTC Drug Evaluation, Dr. William Gilbertson, only
      “about 1/3 of the ingredients reviewed by the panels have been
      shown to be safe and effective for their intended uses.” FDA
      officials under pressure from the OTC drug companies have not
      implemented the findings of their panel."<br>
      <br>
      The hundreds of drugs shown to be unproven for safety and
      effectiveness include well-known and widely used drugs like
      NyQuil, Alka-Seltzer Bayer, Bufferin, Dristan, Anacin, Eticeskin,
      Cope, “doctor recommended” Preparation H and many more.<br>
      <br>
      The same doctors and medical researchers who wrote this book on
      over-the- counter drugs, also wrote a consumer book on the dangers
      of prescription drugs entitled, Pills That Don't Work:<br>
      <br>
      "You go to the doctor because you don't feel well. You are
      listened to (sometimes), examined, tested and then the doctor
      usually writes one or more prescriptions for you. You go to the
      drug store to have the prescriptions filled. You go home and start
      taking the pills. Now every thing will be all right, right? Wrong.
      Neither you nor, in some instances, even your doctor realices that
      one out of every eight prescriptions filled...is for a drug not
      considered effective by the government's own standards. Since all
      drugs involve risks, this lack of effectiveness means you are
      exposing yourself to dangers without gaining compensating
      benefits. In other words, balancing the benefits versus the risks,
      these drugs are not soft..." Health care consumers today are
      witnessing and experiencing firsthand the collapse of a medical
      system based on profit and saturated with the mistaken assumption
      that man-made drugs can be guaranteed to be safe and can
      completely usurp the healing power of nature and the use of safe
      natural healing methods. Unfortunately, consumers in many cases
      are learning this error in medical thinking the hard way. A recent
      news-paper article on a new drug for the 'incurable' virus,
      hepatitis B, illustrates just how deadly this thinking can be:<br>
      <br>
      Human Guinea Pig Says He's Lucky to Be Alive -- Associated Press –
      Paul Melstrom of Phoenix warned the National Institutes of Health
      that the test drug he had taken was causing serious side effects.
      But no one listened.<br>
      <br>
      Now, he lives with a painful nerve disorder, but still considers
      himself lucky. Five other people who tested the drug are dead.<br>
      <br>
      Officials at the Institutes in Bethesda, Md., the premier federal
      medical research agency, acknowledge that the test went terribly
      wrong.<br>
      <br>
      "Catastrophe" is how Dr. Jay H. Hoofnagle of the Institutes, who
      oversaw the original study, described it.<br>
      <br>
      The federal Food and Drug Administration, which had given approval
      for the human trials is investigating what went wrong.<br>
      <br>
      And this is not an isolated incident. As The Betrayal of Health
      points out, drug safety testing by drug companies is seriously
      flawed, because of the pharmaceutical industry's desire to
      continually pump out new, even if speculative, drug treatments:<br>
      <br>
      "These speculative drug 'hand grenades' have done considerable
      damage over the course of pharmaceutical history. The best-known
      example was the tragedy of thalidomide, the tranquilizer that
      resulted in thousands of deformed children in Europe and Great
      Britain.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the pharmaceutical industry continues to produce and market
      drugs that have the potential to cause a comparable tragedy..."<br>
      <br>
      American consumers in particular are at risk from the side effects
      and consequences of medical drug abuse, because we take so many
      medications habitually: The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, January
      11, 1994<br>
      <br>
      "Americans as a society are over medicated, some experts say,
      because of a culture that no longer makes allowances for pain.
      Advertisements on television or in magazines, they say, have left
      the impression that there is a pill to make every pain or problem
      go away…<br>
      <br>
      But consumers may nevertheless find themselves in the doctor’s
      office either for complications arising from prolonged use of
      over-the-counter drugs themselves or for failing to recognize the
      [underlying] presence of a more serious illness." Another problem
      with our reliance on synthetic drugs is that medical scientists
      try to prove that synthetic drugs are safe and effective by doing
      "conclusive" double-blind studies that are supposed to eliminate
      risk factors and show that a specific drug will work a certain way
      on everyone that has the disorder that the drug is supposed to
      treat. But one important thing we have to remember in caring for
      ourselves is that there is no such thing as a generalized body or
      a specific cause for every illness. And in reality, there is no
      such thing as a completely conclusive doubleblind drug study
      because no two people are exactly the same even if they happen to
      have the same disease. So the drug that works for one person might
      not work well at all for another person even though both have
      'identical' disorders. As a result, no double-blind drug study is
      ever going to be completely objective or ultimately prove how a
      drug will affect everyone who takes it, which is another reason
      why drug fatalities and unforeseen side effects occur.<br>
      <br>
      We think that we can blindly trust the FDA and our doctors, simply
      because they say we can — but blind faith can be deadly. Health
      care in the U.S. is in crisis today, but the problem isn't too
      Little money, it's too little attention being given to our bodies'
      real health needs, such as the critical need to support and
      enhance our bodies' own natural defenses against disease through
      traditional methods and common sense approaches such as good
      nutrition, a balanced lifestyle, sufficient rest, and simple,
      safe, natural medicines.<br>
      <br>
      I've asked doctors and medical practitioners many times about
      urine therapy and, if they've ever even heard of it, (99% of then)
      haven't), they invariably tell me that, unlike the drugs they
      prescribe and recommend, it's not safe, it's an old wives tale,
      and it's never been proven effective. But the truth is that urine
      therapy is proven and is safe, far more so than chemical drugs.
      And in view of the real facts about drugs and the drug industry
      it's frighteningly obvious that the real, substantiated risks are
      not those posed by correctly used proven natural healing
      approaches like urine therapy, but by routine, unnecessary
      surgeries and by dangerous prescription and over-the-counter
      chemical drugs that are marketed as freely as food, clothing and
      laundry soap. <br>
      <br>
      <b>What's Wrong With Urine Extracts?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After reading the medical research on urine people are always
      impressed, but they often ask if it wouldn't be easier and better
      to use it as an extract or drug. But in addition to the health
      problems and side effects that drugs create, there are other
      reasons why urine extracts and drugs can't replace natural urine
      therapy. When it comes to personal health there are innumerable
      variables or differences in individual body chemistry, absorption
      rates, reactions, etc., and even these factors change within the
      same body, so it can be extremely difficult in many cases to find
      the exact medicine or therapy that works for each individual
      person. But it is this fact that each body is so different that
      makes whole, natural urine so tremendously valuable as a medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have discovered that urine contains thousands of
      elements that are specifically related to almost every function of
      each individual body:<br>
      <br>
      "Urine has been referred to as a mirror which reflects the
      activities within the individual's body ... urine provides
      information about the functions of the whole body." — Urinalysis
      in Clinical and Laboratory Practice<br>
      <br>
      When you use your own urine medicinally, yon get the protein or
      antibody or hormone, etc., in the correct concentration and
      structure that our own bod has manufacture or to respond to a
      health threat.<br>
      <br>
      And each of these medically important elements is in a perfect and
      immensely complex interrelationship with thousands of other
      important urine components. But this vital relationship of natural
      components is completely lost when we extract separate urine
      ingredients for medical use.<br>
      <br>
      Medical researchers want to extract these valuable urine
      components so that they can convert them into drug products that
      can be mass-marketed to consumers.<br>
      <br>
      But commercially produced urine extracts are not comparable to
      your own urine because your urine contains elements that reflect
      and treat your precise health condition and body functions - and
      these elements are too complex to be duplicated in an extract or
      drug.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, as this next newspaper article reveals, researchers
      have been hying extract an ingredient from urine that has been
      proven to promote healthy sleep so they can use it in drug form:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>FACTOR S:</b><b> Help for the Wee, Wee
          Hours</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A MYSTERIOUS biochemical substance that safely and naturally
      induces deep sleep has been found in human urine. Dubbed "Factor
      S" by the scientists at Harvard University and the University of
      Chicago, the substance has proved to be especially effective as a
      promoter of healthy sleep...<br>
      <br>
      Extensive trials of the biochemical are continuing but it is
      expected to take some years before a commercially produced version
      of Factor S will be available to the public.<br>
      <br>
      Now this article would have us believe that we can't utilize the
      benefits of Factor S until a commercially produced 'drug version'
      is made available to the public. But as urine therapy research
      shows, we can use urine in its natural form and experience its
      amazing benefits without waiting for a drug version or exposing
      ourselves to drug side effects.<br>
      <br>
      And there are important reasons why we should use natural urine
      therapy rather than urine extracts or synthetic drug forms.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, let's suppose that researchers do successfully
      produce a "Factor S" drug and that you're suffering from
      sleeplessness. You go to your doctor and are given the drug so
      you'll sleep better. But what you and the doctor don't know is
      that your insomnia is caused by an undiagnosed food allergy which
      isn't cured by taking the sleep drug. You take the drug for a few
      weeks, but now you're having side effects headaches, dizziness and
      drowsiness during the day. So you stop taking the Factor S drug.<br>
      <br>
      But as soon as you stop taking the drug, your sleeping disorder
      comes back, because the allergy that's causing the insomnia has
      never been identified or treated. If you had used natural urine
      therapy in this scenario, rather than the Factor S drug, you could
      have been treating and healing your undiagnosed allergy because
      your urine contained the exact antibody needed to overcome the
      food allergy, and at the same time, you'd have solved your sleep
      disorder because the allergy that caused it had been eliminated -
      all at no cost and without the danger of side effects.<br>
      <br>
      When we one component of urine or of any natural medicinal
      substance, we miss the often extraordinary benefits of all the
      other ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      Even some medical doctors themselves are now questioning the
      wisdom of using just one extracted ingredient of a natural
      substance rather than the natural substance itself in treating
      disease. Dr. Andrew Weil, M.D., is a nosed and certified American
      physician with a strong background on the use of natural medicinal
      plants in healing, who now utilizes natural plants in treating his
      own patients.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Weil has observed in his own research and practice that it is
      safer and often more effective to use a natural plant treatment
      rather than a refined derivative of the plant. He has observed, as
      have many other doctors, that isolated extracts are generally more
      toxic than their natural sources and sometimes even fail to give
      the same medical benefits as the natural sources they're derived
      from:<br>
      <br>
      "In their enthusiasm at isolating the active principles of drug
      plants, researchers made a serious mistake. They came to believe
      that all of a plant's desirable properties could be accounted for
      by a single compound...The erroneous idea that plants and isolated
      active principles are equivalent has become fixed dogma in
      pharmacology and medicine... [but] purified drugs are not the same
      as the plants they come from." — The Value of Using Whole Plants
      Health and Healing<br>
      <br>
      Another good example of why whole urine is a more desirable
      medicine than urine extracts is shown by research discoveries done
      on urea, the principal solid ingredient of urine.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers discovered almost one hundred years ago that
      concentrated urea itself can destroy many different strains of
      disease bacteria and viruses but seemed less effective on certain
      other bacterial strains, such as tuberculosis. But even though
      urea is less effective in killing TB, in the 1950's, research
      proved that whole urine has been shown to rapidly and in many
      cases, completely inhibit and destroy the TB bacteria!<br>
      <br>
      One of the unfortunate things about this story is that the
      researcher who discovered urine's anti-TB properties, rather than
      announcing that urine could essentially cure TB, instead spent
      years unsuccessfully trying to identify and isolate the urine
      component that killed the TB bacteria so that a drug could be
      formulated from it.<br>
      <br>
      You might think that in this day of modem antibiotics, TB isn't a
      relevant issue, but it is:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>TUBERCULOSIS ON RISE IN U.S.</b><br>
        <b>The Associated Press, Friday, October 8, 1993</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      WASHINGTON – New cases of tuberculosis are increasing at an
      alarming rate...congressional analysts reported Thursday. <br>
      <br>
      "This is a chilling report; it is an indictment of our
      public-health system," said Rep. Ed Towns, D-N.Y., chairman of the
      House Governmental Operations subcommittee on human resources...<br>
      <br>
      The congressional report said efforts to combat tuberculosis is
      complicated because of the emergence of strains resistant to
      anti-TB drugs..."<br>
      <br>
      A recent article in a doctor's publication also revealed that TB
      has now increased at an alarming rate among children, and is even
      causing fatalities, because the disease strikes children much
      harder than adults. And doctors are finding it extremely difficult
      to deal with this new TB epidemic because it's easily misdiagnosed
      and is now resistant to anti-TB drugs.— American Medical News,
      Feb. 14, 1994<br>
      <br>
      Isolating separate elements from natural substances and refining
      or chemically copying them as synthetic drug forms isn't the
      miracle technique that modern medical science would have us
      believe. Scientists and doctors throughout the twentieth century
      taught consumers that purified and refined isolated extracts were
      far more effective and just as safe as the natural substances they
      were derived from, but time has proven them wrong.<br>
      <br>
      Not only are hundreds of the drugs we routinely use everyday
      unproven and potentially dangerous, but this continual drug-taking
      also interferes with our body's ability to develop natural
      immunity to disease.<br>
      <br>
      As the artide on TB and others like it reveal, bacteria am
      successfully adapting to our drugs, but obviously, our immune
      systems haven't developed immunity to the bacteria, because we've
      relentlessly overridden our natural immune responses and functions
      with chemical drugs. Now the drugs don't work – so where does that
      leave us? It leaves us, by all accounts, in serious trouble.<br>
      <br>
      A recent report from the Centers For Disease Control (CDC) stated
      that in U.S. hospitals, a major disease-causing bacterium has now
      become resistant to antibiotics normally used to treat infected
      patients:<br>
      <br>
      In 1992, CDC reported that more than 2 million patients annually
      suffer from infections; in 1992, 19,027 people died from
      infections contracted in the hospital, and another 58,092 died
      from causes to which such infections had contributed. — Associated
      Press<br>
      <br>
      There is no doubt that drugs and surgery do play a part in
      medicine, but these therapies have their limitations, even in
      treating serious infectious diseases. Strong synthetic drugs have
      no place in the everyday health armamentarium of consumers. The
      only real reason why we and our doctors now unthinkingly and
      routinely overuse drugs and surgery is because they are so heavily
      promoted by the drug industry which makes billions of dollars each
      year from these methods.<br>
      <br>
      But you don't have to throw away your hard-earned money on unsafe,
      inappropriate drugs and put your health at risk with chemical
      drugs or surgery in order to get well.<br>
      <br>
      As many doctors themselves now believe, traditional natural
      medical methods like urine therapy are completely valid should
      play a prominent part in our personal health treatments and
      preventive health care.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Does The Doctor Really Know Best?</b><br>
      <br>
      If you still feel apprehensive about trying urine therapy because
      your doctor doesn't recommend it, consider what conventional
      doctors really do know about real healing - even when they use
      their own conventional medical techniques. In his book, What Your
      Doctor Didn't Learn in Medical School...and what you can do about
      it!, Dr. Stuart M. Berger, M.D. tells about the fallacies and
      flaws in our medical school regimens and teaching practices.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Berger tells about his medical apprenticeship at Tufts Medical
      School, Harvard School of Public Health and New York's prestigious
      University Hospital, where he and his classmates had access to the
      most sophisticated space-age medical technologies available,
      including masterful surgical techniques that seem to defy death.<br>
      <br>
      "We were learning immense amounts" says Dr. Berger, "but were we
      learning what we should? We were becoming doctors, to be sure, but
      were we becoming better healers?"<br>
      <br>
      Later in his life, when Dr. Berger's mother was nearly killed by a
      mistaken cancer diagnosis, he witnessed first-hand the often fatal
      breakdown of the medical system under which he and all allopathic
      doctors are trained. As Dr. Berger tells us, his mother's life,
      but for his intervention, might have been lost because of her
      doctors' mismanagement:<br>
      <br>
      "She had come only days away from being pumped full of the most
      lethal, debilitating agents - drugs quite capable of crippling or
      even killing her, for a cancer she never had...<br>
      <br>
      Her life could have been forfeited to delay, mismanagement, [and]
      the needless toxic interventions of a medical system run amok.<br>
      <br>
      I also know that the same is true of every man, woman and child
      who participates in our medical system - and that means all of us.
      This sorry state of things is a simple fact of American medicine,
      one that holds true for you, for your loved ones and for your
      friends.<br>
      <br>
      The truth is that we are all at risk simply because of how our
      medical system functions. Or, to put it another way, because of
      what our doctors didn't learn in medical school."<br>
      <br>
      Like many other conscientious doctors today, Berger urges everyone
      to become informed consumers. Just as Berger and thousands of us
      have experienced — your life may depend on what you, not your
      doctors, know about medical therapies and your own body.<br>
      <br>
      Another good book on the perils of modem medicine is Medicine on
      Trial by Charles Inlander, Lowell Levin and Ed Weiner. Lowell
      Levin is a professor at Yale University School of Medicine:<br>
      <br>
      "Twelve of the thirteen chapters in this book are devoted
      exclusively to evidence of misconduct and mayhem perpetrated on an
      unsuspecting public [by the medical profession]. 'Serious' is too
      tame a word… One has to wonder why the facts presented in this
      book have not heretofore been put on public view forcefully.<br>
      <br>
      Why has the honorable profession of medicine kept the facts of its
      mistakes to itself? Is the profession of medicine so venal that it
      is willing to risk the lives of people whose trust it enjoys? Can
      the [medical] profession and its institutions be so cynical as to
      treat patients and the public at large as incapable of
      understanding what is going on?<br>
      <br>
      People sense that physicians may not be the omniscient and totally
      dedicated care givers that organized medicine's image makers have
      been advertising. Personal experiences of family and friends drive
      home the reality of medicine's clay feet. There are growing signs
      that the public has had enough cover-up and outright deceit.
      People are not fools, even though they may have been fooled, or
      more likely, lulled, into believing that medical care has been on
      a steady course of progress, from one medical miracle to another.
      The overselling and hype about winning the war on cancer is an
      example... We have been fed a considerable number of public
      relations releases about medicine's successes, with little or no
      effort to portray its downside.<br>
      <br>
      Government studies now raise questions about the qualifications
      (or lack thereof) of physicians...their misdiagnoses, unnecessary
      or incompetent surgery, errors in medication, neglect and high
      hospital infection rates... Money, power, prestige and egos
      conspire to hold reformists [inside the medical system] to
      marginal, largely cosmetic changes."<br>
      <br>
      Anyone who is currently taking any doctor-recommended and
      supposedly therapeutic drug of any type also needs to read the
      book, The Informed Consumer's Pharmacy, The Essential Guide to
      Prescription and Over-the-Counter Drugs by Ellen Hodgson Brown and
      Lynne Paige Walker. This book is one of the clearest, most
      comprehensive guides to therapeutic drugs available, and if you
      value your good health, you'll definitely want to read it.<br>
      <br>
      As the authors of The Informed Consumer's Pharmacy comment:<br>
      <br>
      “Overdosing on drugs is the most popular form of suicide, but
      drugs in lesser amounts can kill as surely. Like time bombs, they
      just act more slowly. More Americans are killed each year by drugs
      than by auto accidents. The American Medical Association estimates
      as much as one-third of all illness may be 'iatrogenic' — caused
      by drugs and other medical therapies aimed at a cure.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been estimated that 70-80 percent of the people who
      visit doctors have nothing wrong with them that wouldn't be
      cleared up by a vacation, a raise, or relief from the stresses of
      their lives. Another 10 percent have diseases for which there is
      no cure. Only 10 percent would benefit from drugs or surgery. Yet
      57 percent or more come away with prescriptions.”<br>
      <br>
      The New York Times Medical Science section on August 17, 1993,
      reported that new research findings show that as many as
      two-thirds of patients who are treated with placebos for health
      complaints improve after taking the placebo — that's twice as many
      patients as originally calculated by researchers testing new
      drugs.<br>
      <br>
      A placebo is a sugar-pill or a drug that has no objective effect
      on the symptoms being treated. One doctor quoted in the article
      suggests that all doctors should start using the placebo effect to
      their advantage by giving patients drugs even though the doctor
      does not know what the patient's illness is, or if the patient is
      actually sick at all: "If a doctor believes in what he's doing and
      lets the patient know that, that's good medicine."<br>
      <br>
      Studies show that the majority of Americans today are so convinced
      that their "doctors know better" that they get better even when
      the drug substance they're given has nothing to do with treating
      the disorder they're suffering from. So, in essence, your doctor
      may have selected an unnecessary or incorrect drug for you to
      take, but you get better because psychologically you feel you
      should. Unfortunately, the health improvement may be imaginary,
      but the side effects of the drug that show up later won't be:<br>
      <br>
      "...However drugs are produced and distributed, a separate and
      equally important issue is how doctors prescribe them. As noted,
      physicians prescribe largely on the basis of information from drug
      houses. If the packaging and copy are effective and persistent
      enough, the physician will probably prescribe the product...<br>
      <br>
      [But] the disregard of contraindications for the use of drugs
      causes thousands of unnecessary illnesses every year"— Betrayal of
      Health<br>
      <br>
      Every medicine we use does not have to be synthesized and
      commercially produced in order to be effective and safe. And, as
      we've seen, drugs and surgery are the last forms of medicine that
      we should resort to, and not the first choice, as they are for the
      majority of us today<br>
      <br>
      As Hippocrates taught, nature first is the best health regimen. We
      all need to give common sense health care and non-invasive
      medicines an informed chance before we rush into dangerous
      chemical or surgical therapies that can create more symptoms and
      problems than they relieve.<br>
      <br>
      And many people are learning to think for themselves and not to
      take their doctors bad advice lying down, as a recent article in
      The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, demonstrates:<br>
      <br>
      "Al Iglehart figures his doctors pegged him for a fool.<br>
      <br>
      They knew his heart disease was congenital, without mysterious
      complications. Still, they suggested he undergo more tests, even
      repeat a $1200 one he had already passed. Thank you for the
      advice, Mr. Iglehart said. But absolutely not. 'The doctor just
      isn't God, and sometimes they're on autopilot,' says Mr Iglehart,
      who is 44 years old and live on Long Island, N.Y. 'There was no
      reason for any more tests. The biggest thing you can do [about
      medical treatments] is to be informed as a consumer and ask
      questions.'<br>
      <br>
      Iglehart is among a growing group of defiant health-care patients
      who are questioning the costs [and effectiveness] of medical
      procedures..."<br>
      <br>
      It isn't my intention to go into a lot of 'doctor-bashing' here,
      because doctors, of course, play a crucial role in medicine, but
      they have assumed, and we have given them an impossible role and
      responsibility in medicine today. We expect our doctors to behave
      like mechanics, to diagnose and to fix every possible thing that
      goes wrong with us, as if our bodies were cars or machines that
      could be repaired simply by pouring in some synthetic substance or
      replacing a part.<br>
      <br>
      But our bodies aren't machines, and our doctors should be relieved
      of their role as mechanics that we run to every time we feel sick.
      Our bodies are immensely intricate, sensitive, individually
      unique, living organisms that need gentle respect and care, not
      the incessant and routine overkill of concentrated drugs and
      invasive surgery.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors can certainly play an important role in urine therapy,
      especially in acute illnesses where injections of urea or urine
      could be life saving, as is dearly seen in one of the research
      studies in which jntravenoo, urea saved the life of a patient with
      severe cerebral edema caused by a brain tumor (see next chapter ).
      Also, natural urine therapy could most , definitely be enhanced
      and augmented by doctors' administrations of natural urine
      extracts or urea for serious illnesses. However, for most
      illnesses, we can treat ourselves with natural urine therapy and
      save our valuable doctors precious time and effort.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Learning to Care for Our Own Health</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Unfortunately, today's consumers have been exposed to the most
      intensive media advertising barrage in the history of medicine,
      and are now conditioned to expect medicines and health therapies
      to deliver an instantaneous "punch" - irregardless of the cost,
      side effects or ultímate consequences of such methods.<br>
      <br>
      If we get headaches, rather than getting more rest or eliminating
      the three chocolate bars and Coke we had for lunch, we 'whomp' our
      bodies with the strongest headache medicine we can buy - never
      mind that the infinitesimally small type on the label lists twenty
      different serious side effects of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      Many people have complained to me over the years that they've
      tried homeopathy or herbs or other types of natural healing
      instead of drugs with no success. But when we examine their
      situation in depth, I invariably find that they were Wring to use
      natural therapies in the same way that they use drugs - popping a
      pill from a bottle they picked up on a health food store shelf and
      waiting for a quick fix, or drinking a cup or two of herbal tea
      and then deciding, "Nope, don't feel better - didn't work for me."<br>
      <br>
      But the problem is not the natural medicines, the problem is the
      approach. The simple fact is that no matter what medicines we take
      or health therapies we try, natural or synthetic if we don't
      change our overall bad health habits and lifestyles we aren't
      going to be healthy and we aren't going to feel good.<br>
      <br>
      In order for natural therapies to work, you really have to begin
      to get in touch with what the requirements of good health really
      are. Real and lasting physical health is based on much more than
      continually knocking out unpleasant symptoms with medicines or
      surgery.<br>
      <br>
      A nutritious diet, rest, relaxation, exercise, a healthy living
      environment and a balanced, positive, peaceful and happy frame of
      mind are the indispensable foundations of good and lasting health.
      When you improve your basic health habits by incorporating these
      elements into your daily lifestyle, you enhance your natural
      immune defenses and improve your health and ability to fight
      disease. Natural medicines can be used, when necessary, in order
      to augment your healing if and when you do happen to get sick;
      this combination of a strong natural immunity and gentle,
      immune-strengthening natural medicinals is the best possible
      solution to our health problems.<br>
      <br>
      Trying to achieve good health by routinely using drugs and surgery
      to suppress disease symptoms produced by unhealthy lifestyles is a
      dead end - literally. Just because the generally accepted modern
      lifestyle has conditioned us to believe and accept that McDonald's
      is really a place to eat and that white sugar is a nutritive food,
      isn't going to change the fact that neither of those things is
      true. As doctors tell us:<br>
      <br>
      "Today's chronic diseases - both social and medical - are really
      symptoms of a much more vast underlying problem. They are the
      culmination of years of inadequate nutrition, a toxic environment,
      sedentary lifestyles, familial and social disruptions, and
      dependence on artificial agents (from cigarettes to cocaine) for
      happiness. Every cell in our bodies - from the brain to the immune
      system - is affected by these abuses."— Betrayal of Health<br>
      <br>
      You can't halfheartedly lay a veneer of natural medicines over
      your inherently unhealthy and destructive lifestyle and then
      announce to yourself and the world that you tried natural medicine
      and "it didn't work."<br>
      <br>
      Everyday as a nation we consumers drink millions of gallons of
      those toxic brews called Pepsi and Coke; we ingest millions of
      dollars worth of junk food, food additives and sugar, stuffing it
      all down at warp speed as we madly propel ourselves through
      overcrowded streets in cars belching carbon monoxide fumes, all
      the while breathing in the toxic aroma of the grossly polluted
      air.<br>
      <br>
      Arriving at our synthetically constructed domiciles, we subject
      our bodies and minds to relentless TV radiation and the dismal
      harangue of the nightly news, all the while "banging" our stress
      and sugar induced headaches, aches and pains with Bayer, or
      Excedrin, Anacin or Dristan, or whatever other 'wonder drug'
      flashes seductively across the screen.<br>
      <br>
      And then we ask ourselves "Why don't I feel good - why can't my
      doctor fix me once and for all?<br>
      <br>
      Because of our modem lifestyle, too few of us pause to rest and
      treat ourbodies When we go to the drugstore, our only thought is
      to find the fastest-acting, strongest drug available to relieve
      our discomfort and in essence, to 'shut the body up'. And drug
      companies and doctors know this - so they give us what we think we
      want, and what we erroneously assume is safe.<br>
      <br>
      So how do we start looking out for our own health concerns? We can
      start by not rushing to the drugstore or doctor for a quick-fix
      every time we don't feel well. We can change our lifestyles and we
      can learn how to gently stimulate our immune defenses, treat
      illness and relieve pain with simple natural medicines like urine
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      And we can change our diets. It's not that hard to get back to
      simple basics - get rid of the frozen and boxed dinners, the
      instant breakfast shakes, the sodas, the sugary, preservative,
      chemical-filled desserts and start eating real foods like whole
      grains and fresh green vegetables and salads and fruit. Our
      environment is so filled with chemical pollutants today that
      deliberately ingesting them in our food is an unwise practice and
      an added burden on our already overburdened immune systems.<br>
      <br>
      The use of basic natural foods and natural medicines, unlike
      synthetic drugs or surgery, requires a degree of self-love,
      self-discipline, and patience - listening to the body, observing
      the causes behind the symptoms of our illnesses, and changing
      unhealthy habits and attitudes, rather than relying on strong
      medical interventions to mask underlying disease factors by
      relieving symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how inconvenient these changes might seem now, just wait
      until you see how inconvenient cancer, heart disease and serious
      chronic illness can be if you don't make these changes.<br>
      <br>
      So as you can see, there is a chain of command within our present
      medical system that has made it difficult, or nearly impossible
      for the research information and findings on simple, inexpensive
      urine therapy to receive recognition:<br>
      <br>
      1) Getting FDA approval for medical therapies is astronomically
      expensive;<br>
      <br>
      2) Drug companies want high-profit, patentable therapies to pay
      for research and to boost company profits;<br>
      <br>
      3) Hospitals and doctors are indoctrinated and influenced by heavy
      promotion and pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, and so
      prescribe and use only drug company endorsed medical therapies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A New Era in Medicine</b><br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, attitudes in medicine are changing in response to the
      many problems that have surfaced with drug and surgical therapies.
      Recent articles show the general trend by both consumers and the
      medical community towards traditional, more natural health
      approaches. A study cited recently in the New England Journal of
      Medicine stated that:<br>
      <br>
      In 1990, Americans made 425 million visits to alternative health
      care practitioners, while 388 million visits were made to
      conventional health care providers.— Focus on Behavioral Health
      Magazine, July 9, 1993<br>
      <br>
      Another article in Forbes Magazine, reports on the new trend in
      medicine back to traditional, natural forms of healing:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>"New Support for Old Therapies"</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      "Does the doctor really know best? Not always, it would seem, if
      you take into account the increasing respectability being won by
      such non- conventional therapies as acupuncture, biofeedback,
      chiropractic and herbal medicine.<br>
      <br>
      In other cultures these therapies have been standard practice for
      ages, but most physicians educated in schools approved by the
      American Medical Association and affiliated with AMA hospitals
      have long dismissed these techniques as quackery.<br>
      <br>
      Today, however, signs of a new approbation for alternative
      medicine are everywhere. Even The National Institutes of Health
      now has an Office of Alternative Medicine."— Forbes, Dec. 20, 1993<br>
      <br>
      It's interesting to realize how much power we consumers have over
      our own lives.<br>
      <br>
      As this article demonstrates, individual consumers are the ones
      who can ultimately determine the course of medicine over the next
      century by the choices they make for medical treatments. And the
      medical establishment knows this, as another recent article
      reveals:<br>
      <br>
      The National Institutes of Health Begins a New Era...<br>
      <br>
      For the first time, it will systematically explore unconventional
      medical practices, decide which are effective and begin putting
      some of them into mainstream medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Groft, who heads the new effort, said a panel of experts
      will study many methods long scoffed at by traditional doctors,
      including acupuncture, naturopathy, homeopathy, Ayurvedic
      medicine, reflexology, massage therapy and Chinese herbal
      remedies."<br>
      <br>
      Sounds like good news, doesn't it? Unfortunately, though, these
      time honored proven natural methods are going to have to somehow
      be made to fit the modern scientific medical model — one which has
      already been shown to have largely failed:<br>
      <br>
      "Many scientists are actually excited to see that alternative
      methods are being scientifically evaluated,' Groft said. 'It is
      important to separate those that are working from those that
      aren't working for both patients and physicians... The task is to
      assess the scientific evidence already available, determine
      whether more research is worthwhile and give priority to
      funding."— Gannett News Service, August, 1993<br>
      <br>
      Sound familiar? It's the same old strains of the same old song —
      we, the scientific "experts" will tell you what works for you. But
      we've already examined where their 'proof' comes from and just how
      unreliable it is. Ironically, the agency that is calling for
      scientific evaluation of these natural health treatments is The
      National Institutes of Health that was itself responsible for the
      recent tests on the hepatitis drug that killed nearly all of the
      research participants. So just how valuable are the medical
      community's 'scientific' assessments?<br>
      <br>
      At this point in time, we need to stop examining and picking apart
      therapies that have hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of
      years of practical experience behind them. Rather than wasting
      their time and our money on the unnecessary contortions of trying
      to "scientifically" prove what hundreds of thousands of patients
      have already experienced over many centuries with these simple and
      safe natural techniques, the National Institutes of Health and
      their panel of experts' efforts would be infinitely better spent
      on deciding how to formúlate new and inexpensive FDA guidelines
      for approving traditional medical therapies and in qualifying
      responsible health care practitioners for both conventional and
      natural medicine.<br>
      <br>
      This simple adjustment alone could tremendously reduce health care
      costs and dramatically upgrade health care quality by providing
      and teaching effective, simple, inexpensive natural medical
      self-help approaches like urine therapy that can take the place of
      expensive and dangerous drugs and surgical therapies that should
      be rightly reserved for crisis and emergency care, and free up
      doctors' and specialists' precious time.<br>
      <br>
      We already know that traditional natural therapies like herbal
      medicines, urine therapy and homeopathy work, and many are still
      widely used in other civilized countries. Chinese hospitals and
      doctors even today largely depend on their traditional natural
      herbal medicine and acupuncture; England has homeopathic
      hospitals; Germans rely heavily on their herbal medicines which
      are even available in their drugstores. In France, too, pharmacies
      carry and doctors prescribe natural homeopathic and herbal
      medicines in addition to synthetic drugs.<br>
      <br>
      There are a wonderful variety of alternatives to invasive and
      synthetic medicine that have been proven to be safe and effective
      over centuries of use and observations, we just have to relearn
      the art of using them and cure ourselves of our dependency on
      drugs and surgery. Also, there are many more books (see Appendix)
      besides the ones I've already mentioned in this chapter which will
      help you to learn more about how to care for your health safely
      and effectively. The challenge of achieving and maintaining good
      health is in creating a balanced lifestyle and in finding the
      combination of natural treatments and remedies that are right for
      you individually.<br>
      <br>
      And as you'll discover in this book, urine therapy is the most
      powerful, most individualized natural medicine we could ever hope
      for. After reading all that urine therapy has to offer, I know
      you'll agree that even though man has failed to find the synthetic
      "magic bullet" medicine to cure every illness, Nature had already
      created it for us and given us an incredible, safe, cost-free and
      simple, natural tool to heal ourselves – our body's own amazing,
      natural medicine.<br>
      <br>
      <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="CHAPTER_4"></a><br>
      <div align="center"><b>CHAPTER 4</b><br>
        <b>THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE AND CASE STUDIES</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The medical applications of urine and its constituents have been
      tested, discussed, researched and utilized to such an extent
      throughout the twentieth century that it seems incredible that
      almost none of us, including the majority of our doctors and
      medical administrators have ever heard anything about it.<br>
      <br>
      But again, the reason for this is not entirely a mystery. As we
      discussed in the last chapter, even though the success of urine
      therapy was reported long before the 1900's, twentieth century
      medical researchers, doctors and the public were no longer
      interested in traditional natural medicines.<br>
      <br>
      So urine therapy was moved out of the home and doctor's offices
      and into the oblivion of research laboratories, where,
      unfortunately, it still largely remains today.<br>
      <br>
      As we've discussed, urine therapy largely disappeared from public
      use at the turn of the century and the knowledge of the therapy is
      now hidden in medical journals and research reports that people
      and doctors in general never see; also, urine ingredients are
      simply isolated and converted into unrecognizable drug forms.<br>
      <br>
      Even though there have been amazing scientific discoveries about
      the medical use of urine, medical researchers, for the most part,
      do not tell the public about their discoveries. Again, this
      situation is most likely the result of two factors. One, modem
      medical researchers are primarily oriented towards finding strong,
      monetarily profitable chemical "bullets" to knock out specific
      diseases – and not towards discovering natural medicines which
      augment the body's natural capacity to heal.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly, most medical researchers work for pharmaceutical
      companies and many are contractually bound not to reveal the
      results of their research until the research can be applied as a
      profit-making medical therapy that can be patented by the company
      who funded the research.<br>
      <br>
      Also, medical researchers tend to devote their research to
      extremely specialized branches of medicine, and these separate
      departments of medicine don't generally communicate their findings
      to departments outside of their own research fields. So the
      urologists, for instance, who discovered that urine can prevent
      and heal urinary tract infections might publish their findings for
      other urologists, but a doctor in general practice would probably
      not come in contact with these studies on the importance of urine
      in bladder or kidney infections.<br>
      <br>
      The public and most practicing doctors today consider urine to be
      nothing more than a body waste. But many medical researchers know
      that in reality, urine is an enormously comprehensive and powerful
      medical substance. Now you get to read what many scientists and
      doctors know, but haven't told us about the amazing curative
      effects of urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The research studies and articles selected for this chapter are
      each nurnbered and presented in chronological order to present a
      broad overview of how consistently and intensively urine has been
      researched during the twentieth century.<br>
      <br>
      You'll be amazed and astounded by these studies on the medical use
      of urine. As I was reading over these reports, and looking at all
      of the other many studies on urine therapy, I couldn't help
      exclaiming "Why didn't anyone ever tell us?".<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>More About Urea</b><br>
      <br>
      As an added note, many of these research studies were done using
      the urine extract, urea, which is the primary organic solid of
      urine. Urea, an organic salt formed in the liver, is the result of
      the body's use, or synthesis, of protein. The body eliminates
      excess nitrogen which is produced during protein metabolism in the
      form of urea. Urea is also used by the body to help in the
      mechanism which determines how concentrated the urine is, or in
      other words, how much water is excreted from the blood. Urea was
      discovered centuries ago, in 1773, when it was first separated
      from urine; later, in 1828, natural urea was synthesized or
      chemically "copied" in the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of urea was one of the most important events of
      modem chemistry and biochemistry because it was the first organic
      compound to be separated in a relatively pure state. Urea, which
      is critical to our body's use of protein, also provides
      innumerable profound keys as to how our bodies work and function.
      For this reason, chemists have been fascinated for years by urea
      and its amazing and diverse applications in the fields of science
      and medicine:<br>
      <br>
      "More scientific papers have probably been published on urea than
      on any other organic compound..."— Journal of the American Medical
      Association, July 1954, "De Urina"<br>
      <br>
      Urea has so many beneficial properties that it was used
      historically, and is still used today, in a wide variety of
      medical applications – for reducing excess fluid pressure on the
      brain, as a remarkable skin treatment for eczema, dry skin
      disorders, and fungal infections; as a moisturizer in cosmetic
      creams, as a safe and effective diuretic, and as an
      anti-bacterial, antiseptic treatment for healing serious wounds.<br>
      <br>
      People who have heard of the term "uremia", or uremic poisoning,
      often assume that urea itself is toxic and is therefore excreted
      in the urine. But this is not the case. Excess urea becomes toxic
      to the body only when the filtering mechanisms of the kidneys are
      damaged or impaired, and the urea level of the blood is not
      properly regulated But in this case, excessive amounts of other
      benign substances like wáter and sodium become toxic also if the
      kidney is unable to regulate them in the blood. As you'll discover
      in the research studies in this chapter, urea is not only not
      toxic, but in reality has tremendous medical and physiological
      value, and can be safely used even in large quantities.<br>
      <br>
      Urea is on the FDA list of approved drugs for medical use and many
      products made from urea are listed in the Physician's Desk
      Reference, (which is the book that doctors refer to in deciding
      what drug to prescribe), and in the U.S. Pharmacological Index.<br>
      <br>
      However, as wonderful as urea has proven to be in medicine, I want
      to stress that it cannot and should not be used to replace or
      supersede natural urine as a healing agent. As the research in
      this chapter proves, whole urine contains hundreds of known and
      unknown medically important elements that clearly and definitively
      are not found in urea alone.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as medical studies have unequivocally shown, each person's
      urine contains antibodies, natural 'vaccines' and many other
      critical physiological elements that are carried in the blood that
      are specific to each individual's health condition. These elements
      in whole urine are not found in either natural or synthetic urea
      alone.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, if you have an allergic reaction to wheat, your body
      produces a complex of antibodies to deal with the allergy and
      those antibodies are found in your urine. Medical studies have
      demonstrated that when you reintroduce these urine antibodies into
      your system by ingesting or injecting your own urine, that the
      allergy can be corrected. But urea alone would not contain these
      allergy-fighting antibodies.<br>
      <br>
      In using your own urine to heal yourself, you're getting medicinal
      elements that your particular body has produced in order to deal
      with your specific, intricate and often undetectable disturbances
      in your body's functioning.<br>
      <br>
      You could be exposed to polio, for example or tuberculosis and not
      even realize it until acute symptoms appear – but, as medical
      research has proven, your urine can contain antibodies to those
      diseases even if acute symptoms are not appearing. So regular use
      of urine therapy can most definitely provide extremely
      comprehensive therapeutic treatment that goes far beyond urea or
      other medicines.<br>
      <br>
      This is not to say that other therapies are not useful and
      effective, they are, of course, but urine therapy, correctly
      applied, should be the foundation for our health regimens and
      medical treatments and should definitely be used routinely in
      illness and preventive health care.<br>
      <br>
      I recently read a magazine article about a 12 year-old girl in the
      Midwest who was admitted to the hospital with a high fever,
      lassitude, and drooling heavily from the mouth. Doctors tried
      frantically but unsuccessfully to diagnose her condition but she
      deteriorated and died several days later. Only after her death was
      it discovered that she'd died of an undiagnosed and therefore
      untreated case of rabies.<br>
      <br>
      This is a good example of why urine and urea therapy should be
      incorporated into all types of medicine. In this girl's case,
      urine therapy could have been invaluable. In the first place, urea
      itself has been scientifically proven to dissolve or destroy the
      rabies virus, so it could most definitely have aided this little
      girl.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the rabies antibody would have been present in the
      girl's urine, so she would have gotten the benefit of both the
      urea and the rabies antibody after ingesting her urine. Her
      doctors couldn't diagnose her illness – but her body already had,
      and if she'd been given her urine orally, or by injection with
      perhaps, added urea, it might well have saved her life.<br>
      <br>
      And the real tragedy is that there is absolutely no downside risk
      here – absolutely none!. Urine is free, it's backed by almost 100
      years of medical testing, and in every single study ev r done on
      urine and urea's medicinal use in humans, no toxicity ha ever been
      reported. So what did this young girl have to lose by being
      treated with them?<br>
      <br>
      As hundreds of people have experienced, and as research has shown,
      urine is undoubtedly an amazing natural medicine that can give you
      health benefits beyond any other natural or chemical substance in
      existence.<br>
      <br>
      The information on the medical uses of urine most definitely
      deserves public recognition and frankly, if we don't routinely
      take advantage of this incredible natural remedy, we can't
      honestly say that we're doing all that we can to preserve and
      regain our good health.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes it's hard to believe that even with all our medical
      knowledge and technological genius, we still don't have strong,
      healthy, disease-resistant bodies – but the fact that widespread,
      crippling health disorders still abound should tell us that we're
      doing something wrong and overlooking something important.<br>
      <br>
      Let's not overlook this simplest and yet most useful of natural
      medicines.<br>

      <b>Report # 1 -- TITLE: PLEOMORPHISM, AS EXHIBITED BY BACTERIA
        GROWN ON A MEDIA CONTAINING UREA, 1906, by W. James Wilso</b>n,
      B.A., M.B, from the Pathological Laboratory of Queen's College
      Belfast, published in the Journal of Pathological Bacteria,
      London.<br>
      <br>
      SUBJECT: THE ANTI-BACTERIAL EFFECT OF UREA<br>
      <br>
      This laboratory study is presented first because it's one of the
      more thorough and earliest twentieth century laboratory research
      studies on the medical applications of urea.<br>
      <br>
      Don't be intimidated by the word 'pleomorphism'. In this context
      it just basically means that urea changed the shape, or stopped
      the normal growth of disease bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      After medical researchers discovered that certain types of living
      microorganisms, such as bacteria, could cause disease, it became
      almost their sole aim to discover ways of killing or stopping the
      growth of these microorganisms, or germs.In this particular study,
      the researcher, James Wilson, placed different disease-causing
      bacteria, such as Bacillus typhosus (typhoid) into petridishes
      containing urea solutions and found, as had other researchers,
      that the urea stopped the normal growth of the bacteria:<br>
      <br>
      "In October 1905, at the suggestion of Professor Symmers, I was
      investigating the action of the Bacillus typhosus and the B.Coli
      on urea. I.. found that as the percentage of urea in the medium
      varied, so did the amount of growth of the bacillus... with
      greater percentages of urea, the growth of the organism was
      inhibited; with 7 per cent (urea), very little growth occurred;
      with 8 per cent practically none... Urea has an antiseptic or
      inhibitory effect on the growth of microorganisms."<br>
      <br>
      This anti-bacterial effect of urea was also proven by several
      other researchers very early in the twentieth century. But rather
      than present each of these studies on urea separately, the most
      notable of these research findings are listed below in order to
      give a coherent overview on the important studies on urea that
      were conducted and published during the first decades of the new
      era of modem medicine:<br>
      <br>
      1900<br>
      <br>
      A German researcher by the name of Spiro reported his discovery
      that urea solutions have a remarkable ability to "dissolve"
      foreign proteins. This is medically important because viruses, for
      example, are molecular proteins as are allergens. Later research
      confirmed that urea has an amazing ability to rapidly and easily
      destroy viruses such as polio and rabies viruses, and during the
      1980's, urine was defined as an extremely effective treatment for
      a wide variety of allergies.<br>
      <br>
      1902<br>
      <br>
      W. Ramsden, another researcher, published a report in the American
      Journal of Physiology further detailing the protein dissolving
      properties of urea. Ramsden also discovered that urea prevented
      putrefaction in wounds. His work is often referred to by later
      researchers looking into the anti-bacterial applications of urea.<br>
      <br>
      1906<br>
      <br>
      Two French researchers, G. Peju and H. Rajat published a report on
      their detailed study of the effect of urea on various
      disease-causing bacteria. Their research demonstrated that the
      more concentrated the urea, the more it inhibited bacterial
      growth. In concentrated solutions of urea, no bacterial growth
      occurred. The research done by Peju and Rajat has been referred to
      many times over the years by other researchers who studied and
      clinically applied the anti-bacterial properties of urea. This
      research also supported the later use of urea as an antiseptic in
      the treatment of wounds and infections during the 1930's and 40's.<br>
      <br>
      1915<br>
      <br>
      In England, two other researchers, W. Symmers and T.S Kirk,
      published their report entitled "Urea as a Bactericide and Its
      Application in the Treatment of Wounds". Symmers and Kirk were
      actually military doctors, so of course their work with urea
      centered around its use as an antiseptic for wounds. In their
      report, they comment that "all the wounded soldiers under our care
      in the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital have been treated with
      urea, and it has been found that.. infected wounds dressed with
      urea once in 24 hours give better results than similar cases
      treated in any other way." Later 20th century researchers firmly
      established and proved that urea, both topically, and internally,
      provides a wide variety of excellent benefits and produces no
      adverse side effects.<br>
      <br>
      As you read more about the remarkable clinical data on the
      benefits of urea further on, you'll be extremely surprised that
      our medical community today has failed to emphasize the use of
      this incredibly inexpensive, effective and safe anti-bacterial
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report # 2 -- TITLE: AUTOTHERAPY, </b>(book), 1918, by Dr.
      Charles H. Duncan. The following report is taken from a chapter
      from Dr. Duncan's book entified "Urine as An Autotherapeutic
      Remedy". Dr. Duncan was the Attending Surgeon, Genito-Urinary
      Specialist and co-founder of the Volunteer Hospital, New York
      City. Dr. Duncan used the word Autotherapy, as have other doctors,
      to refer to the utilization of natural substances of the body to
      create a healing response. In his chapter on "Urine as An
      Autotherapeutic Remedy," Dr. Duncan describes his clinical
      observations on the use of urine therapy in his medical practice,
      and discusses reports from other doctors who were using urine
      therapy at the time.<br>
      <br>
      From an historical point of view, it's interesting to note the
      seriousness with which urine therapy was treated by even
      mainstream twentieth century doctors. Dr. Duncan was a practicing
      surgeon, founder of the Volunteer Hospital in New York City, a
      Genito-Urinary Specialist –and a supporter of natural urine
      therapy. Our medical community today in general would have us
      believe that urine therapists are traveling road-show quacks
      giving out ludicrous and unsubstantiated medical claims, but
      that's a gross misrepresentation of the truth.<br>
      <br>
      As Dr. Duncan observed:<br>
      <br>
      "There is scarcely a pathogenic (disease) condition which does not
      affect the urine contents...It may be said that urine is like a
      weather vane, sensitively registering any change in the patient's
      condition, be it great or small. Many pathogenic conditions...are
      quickly cured by the therapeutic employment of urine alone...it is
      significant, indeed, when Clark's Materia Medico gives many
      conditions in which uric acid and urea have been proved to be
      therapeutically effective.<br>
      <br>
      In the New York Medical Journal of December 14 and 21, 1912 and in
      the Therapeutic Record of January 1914, I reported that I was
      employing urine successfully in the treatment of many
      conditions...since then it has been employed successfully both by
      myself and many other physicians in treating patients suffering
      with a great variety of pathogenic conditions."<br>
      <br>
      Duncan goes on to cite several case studies in which he
      successfully used urine therapy. For instance:<br>
      <br>
      CASE 190.<br>
      <br>
      "Patient, male, 30 years, applied for treatment for cystitis that
      developed after a long drive in the rain. At night he had to void
      every hour or twa...A teaspoonful of morning urine one-half hour
      before meals completely cleared up the case within two days."<br>
      <br>
      CASE 198.<br>
      <br>
      "Patient, male, age 50 years, applied for treatment suffering with
      inflammation of the bladder and prostate...Upon rising from a
      sitting posture it was necessary to void urine within a minute. He
      had to get up at night five and six times. The usual remedies for
      such conditions gave little or no relief. It was then decided to
      treat him autotherapeutically. He was instructed to take a drachm
      of early morning urine a half hour before each meal.<br>
      <br>
      Within twenty-four hours his improved condition was so marked that
      be became alarmed thinking his recovery was too quick. [He stopped
      the therapy] and the pain and tenesmus (spasms) returned; he
      continued the treatment and improved greatly. He gradually
      improved and he is [now) apparently in good health."<br>
      <br>
      CASE 203.<br>
      <br>
      The following article by Dr. C.G. Moore was republished in the New
      Albany Medical Herald, February, 1915, from the Archives of
      Pediatrics:<br>
      <br>
      "I find diabetes mellitus an uncommonly difficult disease for the
      general practitioner to treat. April 14,1912, I was called to see
      a little seven-year-old girl. They gave me a history of her having
      felt badly for a few days and of having had some fever. On
      examining the child I found her to have a temperature of 102
      degrees F., but all other findings were negative. In a couple of
      days they informed me her temperature was normal and she was
      feeling all right, but she was passing a large (sticky) amount of
      urine frequently.<br>
      <br>
      Having tried all methods of treatment on several other patients
      whom I have had within the past few months suffering with
      glycosuria (sugar in the urine), I decided to try Autotherapy, for
      I had known cases of icterus (jaundice) which had failed to
      respond to any medical treatment, but cleared up in a very short
      time when they were given their own urine to drink.<br>
      <br>
      I gave this little girl three ounces of her own urine three times
      daily and then examined for the sugar percentage and found that
      when she was taking the urine, the percentage of sugar dropped,
      and that when it was withdrawn, the percentage increased. I could
      also see some improvement in her general condition. She did not
      urinate so often or so much; did not drink so much water; her skin
      was more moist, she was not so nervous…<br>
      <br>
      CASE 202<br>
      <br>
      From the report of Dr. Deachman of N.Y.: “Patient, male, 49, was
      extremely nervous and irritable; he had wandering pains all over
      his body, headache and general lassitude. He complained a great
      deal of pain in the lumbar region and in the abdomen.<br>
      <br>
      He improved on nothing I gave him...microscopic urine examination
      showed red blood cells, pus cells, renal cells and abundance of
      calcium oxalate crystals. The treatment consisted of a twenty
      minim injection of urine diluted 1 to 100 with distilled water. He
      improved with this to a certain point but did not entirely recover
      until I used a less diluted urine, after which he made a prompt
      recovery. Two months after he recovered a urinalysis showed
      absence of pus and renal cells and a normal volume of urine.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Deachman comments:<br>
      <br>
      "These are but a few of the many cases I have successfully treated
      by this method, the value of which I consider inestimable.<br>
      <br>
      I make this statement after a wide experience in using urine] in
      treating many patients suffering with chronic diseases and
      particularly in the use of urine as an autotherapeutic agent. I am
      free to say that the results obtained with urine therapy are [far
      better] than the usual recognized methods."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Duncan's reports on the use of urine therapy are quite
      detailed and include many other extensive observations on his and
      other doctors' clinical treatments and case studies on the effects
      of both orally and hypodermically administered urine therapy.<br>

      </b><b>Report # 3 -- TITLE: THE ANTISEPTIC AND BACTERICIDAL ACTION
        OF UREA, </b>1935, by John FL Foulger, M.D., and Lee Foshay,
      M.D., Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. From the
      Departments of Pharmacology and Experimental Bacteriology,
      University of Cincinnati.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers in this study, Foulger and Foshay, found that urea
      was extremely effective in curing or preventing a wide variety of
      bacterial infections and, unlike sulfa drugs, which were widely
      used at the time, had no deleterious side effects:<br>
      <br>
      "...In an account of the action of urea...Ramsden (1902) made the
      very interesting observation that urea prevents putrefaction...the
      first detailed study of urea as a bactericide, (destroys
      bacteria), is that of Peju and Rajat...no great attention was paid
      to the bactericidal action of urea until Symmers and Kirk (1915),
      (who) found urea of undoubted value as a wash in the treatment of
      diphtheria carriers (and) the treatment of wounds. That urea is
      innocuous to human tissues was adequately proved.<br>
      <br>
      In one case with a chronic staphylococcus blood infection, urea
      (powder) was sprinkled between the layers of tissue and the wound
      then... closed with sutures. Healing followed with no sign of
      infection. ... Infected wounds dressed with urea powder gave
      better results than similar wounds treated by other methods...<br>
      <br>
      Unaware of the work of Symmers and Kirk, one of us (J.F,) selected
      as material for a clinical study of urea a few cases of purulent
      otitis media (middle ear infection)...all of the cases which had
      failed to respond to other local medicaments responded to urea...<br>
      <br>
      A boy of ten developed otitis media and hemorrhagic nephritis...
      (kidney inflammation) about the third week of hospitalization for
      scarlet fever... urea treatments were started. The ear discharges
      at once became less foul...At the same time the blood gradually
      disappeared from the urine...<br>
      <br>
      The results so far obtained suggest that urea may be of
      considerable value in the treatment of purulent discharges of many
      types and in the treatment, also of suppurating wounds producing
      foul odors. This latter use of urea has been reported recently by
      Millar (see next report)...<br>
      <br>
      The cheapness and harmlessness of urea should encourage other
      investigations of its clinical use.<br>
      <br>
      As an added note, Foulger and Foshay also discovered, as did other
      urea researchers later, that destroying strong bacterial strains
      such as those which cause staph and strep infections required
      longer exposure to urea than some other types of bacteria, which
      is something to keep in mind when using urine therapy to combat
      staph and strep infections.<br>

      <br>
      From the Department of Surgery, College of Medicine of the
      University of Cincinnati.<br>
      <br>
      SUBJECT: USE OF UREA CRYSTALS IN TREATING CANCEROUS LESIONS<br>
      <br>
      Following Foulger's and Foshay's work on the antibacterial action
      of urea, Dr. Millar began using urea crystals to heal external
      cancerous ulcerations:<br>
      <br>
      "The peculiarly penetrating odor of a sloughing cancer is one of
      the horrible aspects of this disease. For the past year at the
      Tumor Clinic of the Cincinnati General Hospital, urea crystals
      have been advocated and prescribed in such cases. If they are
      packed into the wound, the odor will be stopped to a great extent.<br>
      <br>
      Although they dissolve in a few minutes, the offensive character
      of the ulcer becomes less with each application.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals are cheap, they possess a considerable antiseptic
      value, and there is no fear of a systemic reaction..."<br>
      <br>
      As research progressed through the twentieth century, the
      antibacterial properties of urea became increasingly well-known
      and it was used in<br>
      <br>
      The Research Evidence and Case Studies<br>
      <br>
      The treatment of wounds and infections in Europe and the U.S.
      until the development of antibiotic creams in the latter half of
      the century, when it appears that its antiseptic use was
      discontinued in favor of the newer and supposedly more effective
      drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Urea, or urine, is cheap, effective and, as a natural substance,
      causes no adverse reactions in the body. It's proven antibacterial
      properties make it an excellent treatment for wounds and burns of
      all kinds.<br>

      TITLE: AUTO-URINE THERAPY, 1934, by Dr. Martin Krebs,
      (pediatrician), from a lecture delivered at the Society of
      Pediatricians, Leipzig. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Krebs, a practicing pediatrician in Dresden, like other many
      other physicians, was intrigued by reports of the medical uses of
      patients' own urine to treat and cure a wide variety of disorders.
      Like Dr. Duncan and other practitioners, he referred to this
      practice as autourine therapy. Dr. Krebs began injecting urine in
      the course of his own medical practice and was surprised at the
      rapid and often extraordinary response:<br>
      <br>
      "Through intramuscular injections of the patient's own urine,
      allergies and certain spastic conditions in children are
      remarkably improved. Extraordinary improvement can be seen with
      asthma and hayfever.<br>
      <br>
      The use of auto-urine therapy is also indicated in the treatment
      of muscular spasms caused by birth traumas to the brain.<br>
      <br>
      I treated an eight-year old boy with hay-fever by injecting 5 cc.
      of his own urine, and was surprised at the result. The boy
      immediately began breathing better, and in a few minutes the
      extreme redness of the eyes disappeared. Another child who had
      spent 31/2 months in a sanatorium for treatment of his asthma,
      received an injection of 4 cc. of urine. After only 6 minutes, he
      was able to breathe deeply and then slept well.<br>
      <br>
      After my first experiences with the therapy, I was encouraged to
      try it on other types of cases, and subsequently treated a 10
      month old child who had exhibited partial paralysis and muscle
      spasms apparently caused by birth trauma. After the first
      injection of urine, he began to loosen and open his fists, his
      general movements were freer and he laughed, something which his
      parents had never seen him do. Also, the attacks of angina which
      he had experienced, stopped after the injection.<br>
      <br>
      Urine therapy has been indicated as a treatment for:<br>
      <br>
      1) toxemia in pregnancy,<br>
      2) allergic conditions,<br>
      3) pertussis,<br>
      4) spasms<br>
      5) increasing breast milk<br>
      6) hayfever<br>
      7) asthma<br>
      8) migraine-like conditions<br>
      9) eczema<br>
      <br>
      I believe that Auto-Urine Therapy is worthy of being applied in
      the area of pediatric medicine. I highly recommend the therapy in
      the treatment of hayfever and asthma, and I would like to see
      further follow-up clinical studies done on its application to the
      other conditions that were mentioned."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Krebs undertook further clinical research studies in 1940
      using natural urine in treating children. His study, entitled The
      Use of Convalescent Urine in the Mitigation of Acute Infections,
      demonstrated that urine therapy (administered by means of enemas)
      was safe and effective for treating childhood infections such as
      whooping cough, measles and chicken pox.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Krebs was impressed by the results of his treatments on 58
      infected children, and recommended urine therapy to other
      physicians as a treatment for infections in children.<br>
      <br>
      Krebs, like many other doctors and researchers, discovered
      excellent uses for urine therapy and he instructed some of the
      parents of his young patients how to use it at home for treating
      their children.<br>

      </b><b>TITLE: AUTO-URINE VACCINE THERAPY FOR ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC
        NEPHRITIS,</b> 1934, by Dr. R. Tiberi, Institute of Clinical
      Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.<br>
      <br>
      Nephritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the kidney or in
      other words, a kidney infection, which can be a serious health
      threat and is difficult to cure. The kidneys are essential for
      maintaining proper nutrient and water balances in the blood, but
      nephritis interferes with this function, often causing the
      bloodstream to become overloaded with excess elements such as
      water and salt. The body's ability to utilize protein is also
      often impaired during kidney infection, and protein, or albumin
      can be abnormally excreted in the urine.<br>
      <br>
      Symptoms of nephritis are chills, fever, urgent and frequent
      urination, back and abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea and
      vomiting. Blood in the urine and cloudy urine are also symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      This study revealed that urine injections significantly reduced
      the symptoms and successfully eliminated kidney infections in most
      cases:<br>
      <br>
      "The modern therapeutic tendency for acute infectious diseases is
      typically an etiologic tendency; it is exactly from this basis
      that the concept of vaccine therapy, for example, autogenous
      (individual, natural) vaccines and protein-therapy, has entered
      today's standard practice.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, there are many infectious diseases far which this type
      of treatment is utilized...<br>
      <br>
      Since 1926, Professor Silvestrini has been using urine vaccine
      autotherapy for cases of nephritis; however until now, a
      systematic and particularly a clinically statistical study which
      could offer a precise indication of its effectiveness had not been
      compiled. Therefore, I have collected the medical histories of
      numerous patients who underwent this therapy during previous

      <b>CASE STUDIES</b><br>
      <br>
      CASE 111. A patient came into the clinic presenting albuminuria
      (protein) and blood cells [in the urine], fever, edema (water
      retention, or swelling), and cyanosis (blue discoloration of the
      skin). The patient was treated with a course of seven injections
      (7 cc. each) of auto-urine vaccine. An examination of the
      patient's urine was done after the third injection and showed only
      small traces of albumin and blood cells and the edema and cyanosis
      had disappeared. After completing the treatment course, the
      patient was discharged from the hospital, completely healed.<br>
      <br>
      CASE IV. The patient came into the clinic presenting albuminuria
      and blood cells in the urine, temperature, but no edema. The
      patient received urine injections, and after the eighth injection,
      all of his symptoms had gone into total remission. Three weeks
      after the treatments, the patient continues to remain completely
      healed.<br>
      <br>
      CASE V. Upon entering the clinic, the patient's examination
      revealed considerable protein and blood in the urine and visual
      disturbances in the left eye. After only three injections of the
      urine vaccine, the symptoms completely disappeared and the patient
      was released completely cured.<br>
      <br>
      This Italian research study on nephritis and urine therapy was an
      extremely in-depth report, detailing 18 cases of clinical
      nephritis which were successfully treated with urine injections.<br>
      <br>
      Another similar study on the treatment of nephritis, entitled,
      Treatment Of Glomer-ulonephritis By Antigen, published in the
      London Lancet, in Dec., 1936, by Dr. H.B. Day, (London), also
      demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple, natural urine extract
      on several cases of both acute and chronic nephritis:<br>
      <br>
      "Treatment by injection of urine extract appeared of distinct
      value in acute glomerulonephritis and for exacerbations or
      relapses in chronic active forms of the disease...In chronic
      cases, the effect of this treatment is often striking."<br>
      <br>
      Day also noted that:<br>
      <br>
      Tests on patients without nephritis showed that the urine extract,
      even in large doses, had no adverse effect on renal function or on
      the blood pressure.<br>

      <br>
      In this report, the author, Dr. Garotescu, describes his
      experiences in treating cystitis, a painful inflammation, or
      infection of the bladder which commonly affects women and can lead
      to more serious conditions, such as kidney infections.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Garotescu treated numerous cases of cystitis with injections
      of the patients' own urine, and discovered that these treatments
      produced excellent results, which were corroborated by laboratory
      tests showing that the cystitis bacteria had completely
      disappeared after the urine injection treatments. For example:<br>
      <br>
      CASE #1: A thirty-two year-old woman with typical symptoms of
      cystitis including frequent, painful urination; also complained of
      chronic constipation for which she has been taking laxatives
      unsuccessfully for several years. She was treated with 12 urine
      injections and all symptoms completely disappeared. The success of
      the treatment was verified by laboratory tests which showed a
      complete absence of colibaccilli (cystitis bacteria) in her urine.<br>
      <br>
      CASE #2: A 28 year-old woman complaining of frequent and painful
      urination. Laboratory analysis of urine sample revealed the
      presence of numerous colonies of colibacilli. Patient was given 4
      injections of auto-urine, after which all symptoms and signs of
      the infection were completely ameliorated.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Garotescu reported that he gave 220 urine injections to
      patients without any adverse side effects whatever, other than an
      occasional, temporary redness and swelling at the site of the
      injection which is commonly reported with urine injections, or
      injections of any kind.<br>

      <b>Report #8 TITLE: VIRUCIDAL (RABIES AND POLIOMYELITIS) ACTIVITY
        OF AQUEOUS UREA SOLUTIONS,</b> 1936, by Dr. Eaton M. MacKay and
      Dr. Charles R. Schroeder, published for the American Proceedings
      of the Society of Experimental Biology<br>
      <br>
      SUBJECT: DESTRUCTION OF THE RABIES AND POLIO VIRUS BY UREA.<br>
      <br>
      This report on urea's ability to destroy viruses is extremely
      interesting and important in view of the fact that even today,
      almost 60 years after this study was published, there is still no
      medical cure or effective drug treatment for viral infections. And
      as we know, viruses can be deadly. After experimenting with the
      effect of urea on the polio and rabies viruses, McKay and
      Schroeder report that:<br>
      <br>
      "...The effect of urea in strong concentration on these viruses
      (rabies and polio) proved interesting. As first recorded by Spiro
      and Ramsden, urea in aqueous solution has a remarkable ability to
      'dissolve' proteins... We conclude...that the strong solution of
      urea not only attenuates (weakens) or dilutes the poliomyelitis
      virus in the sense that it is noninfective but actually destroys
      it...<br>
      <br>
      Urea is such a relatively inactive substance and certainly not a
      protoplasmic poison such as are most virucidal agents that it is
      in a way surprising that rabies and poliomyelitis are killed so
      easily by urea solutions...<br>
      <br>
      It is true that neutral and inactive as it is, urea, like
      alkalies, denatures protein when dissolving it and this reaction
      may be associated with the death of the virus. This denaturation
      occurs in a very few minutes..."<br>
      <br>
      This report appears to hold important implications for the
      treatment of the AIDS virus, HIV. Because concentrated urea has
      been proven to destroy viruses without harming the body, oral
      urine therapy, which increases urea concentrations (see Dr. D.
      Kaye), would logically be an extremely important addition to
      treatment regimens; especially in view of the fact that urine
      therapy also provides a wide variety of antibodies (including HIV
      antibodies in infected patients) and other important immune
      defense supporting agents.<br>
      <br>
      No one with HIV or AIDS can afford to ignore the information on
      urine therapy, especially considering the danger and
      ineffectiveness of the 'accepted' AIDS treatments such as AZT. A
      separate section on AIDS and urine therapy is presented further on
      in this chapter. Again, because urine therapy is easily accessed,
      inexpensive and proven to be completely safe, there is absolutely
      no downside risk to using it in treating AIDS and other viral
      iinfections.<br>

      TITLE: TREATMENT OF INFECTED WOUNDS WITH UREA, 1938, by Leon
      Muldavis (Senior Casualty Officer at the Royal Free Hospital,
      London) and Jean M Holtzman (Demonstrator in Physiology, London
      School of Medicine for Women). Published in the English medical
      journal, The London Lancet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #9 - SUBJECT: HEALING INFECTED WOUNDS, SKIN ULCERS AND
        BURNS WITH UREA</b><br>
      <br>
      Drawing on earlier research into the treatment of wounds with
      urea, Muldavis and Holtzman began using urea crystals extensively
      in theirhospital treatments of serious wounds and burns: <br>
      <br>
      "The protein solvent properties of urea were first investigated by
      Spiro (1900) and independently by Ramsden (1902)... Symmers and
      Kirk (1915) reported on its bactericidal properties together with
      its use in the treatment of wounds. In spite of this article, the
      use of urea for wound therapy has apparently enjoyed little
      popularity in this country [England].<br>
      <br>
      In America, however, it has recently been used for the treatment
      of various infected wounds by Robinson (1936) and by Holder and
      McKay (1937), who found it extremely efficient. Moreover, it is a
      substance that is readily obtainable in quantity and is both cheap
      and stable. For these reasons it was thought desirable to test its
      efficacy in the casualty department of the Royal Free Hospital
      (London)...<br>
      <br>
      No toxic effects have been recorded even though the urea has been
      applied in solid form. We therefore decided to use both the
      saturated solution and crystals throughout.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure employed was as follows: The wounds were syringed
      free from pus and necrotic (dead) material with a saturated
      solution of urea, excessive moisture was removed and the urea
      crystals were then liberally applied. Waxed paper was placed next
      to the crystals to keep them in contact with the wound and to
      prevent the dressing becoming soaked.<br>
      <br>
      For a period of six months cases of the following types have been
      treated: (1) Abscesses–superficial and deep lesions, (2) Infected
      traumatic wounds of all descriptions, (3) infected hematomas
      (bruised areas), (4) Cellulitis, (inflamed subcutaneous tissue),
      (5) Septic wounds due to burns of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree, (6)
      varicose ulcers, (7) carbuncles (external staph infections), (8)
      Infected tenosynovitis (inflamed tendons) of the hand. In all, 170
      cases have been treated. Notes were kept on the progress of all of
      them...<br>
      <br>
      With a view to comparing the efficiency of urea with that of other
      solutions, the cases at first selected for treatment were those
      which had either behaved sluggishly with other antiseptics or had
      actually retrogressed. 'The results obtained were so favorable
      that we began to use urea more generally.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TYPICAL CASES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      CASE 1. A man aged 27 presented a varicose ulcer...of the left
      leg...He had it for nearly 18 months without its having healed.
      During this time it had been treated with Eastoplast and various
      other substances. At the time the urea treatment was begun the
      ulcer was of oval irregular outline with everted swollen edges and
      a floor covered with a whitish, foul smelling slough. The ulcer
      received the urea dressings daily for 14 days. After 2 days the
      foul odor had disappeared and after 4 days the base of the ulcer
      was covered by a mass of bright red granulations (new tissue). By
      the 14th day the skin edges had grown in and the size of the ulcer
      was 3/4 by 1/2 in. The floor was dry. The patient had a dry
      dressing and was discharged. The ulcer was again examined 10 days
      after the patient's discharge and was found to be completely
      healed.<br>
      <br>
      CASE 2. A male aged 47 had a septic area on the...third right
      finger. This was drained but discharge of pus continued. The wound
      was opened again when it was found that the infection had entered
      the tendon sheath. Adequate drainage was provided and the finger
      X-rayed. The wound was then treated with eusol baths. After
      several days there was no attempt at healing. Urea treatment was
      started and after 3 days the slough was removed thus exposing the
      underlying tendon. Healthy granulations (new tissue) were present
      at this time. The urea treatment was continued. The patient was
      discharged 22 days after the treatment was begun, the wound having
      healed completely. There was no loss of function... As will be
      seen from the above, we have used urea in a variety of casualty
      department cases. Owing to the extreme diffusibility of urea even
      the deepest wound can be treated effectively.<br>
      <br>
      A very definite response to urea treatment is nearly always
      obtained after two or three applications...septic bums, even
      though they cover a very wide area, under this treatment become
      clean and form granulations so quickly that the surrounding
      epithelium is able to grow in with but little delay. The same
      prompt response is often obtained in varicose ulcers. Coupled with
      this is a considerable decrease of edema as the local circulatory
      conditions improve. For the carbuncles (external staph
      infections), treated, we found urea preferable to any other
      dressing after initial incision...<br>
      <br>
      In none of the cases of our series did we observe any skin
      reaction which could be called a urea dermatitis (rash), nor have
      we evidence of any toxic effects. We never saw a spread of sepsis
      (infection) under urea treatment or any undermining of the wound
      edges.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the urea treatment are as follows: (1) It is
      cheap, the crystals costing one shilling per pound...(2) It
      produces no dermatitis. (3) It deodorizes foul smelling wounds.
      (4) By dissolving necrotic (dead) material, it produces a clean
      wound, so allowing healing to proceed. (5) Local circulatory
      conditions are improved and healthy granulations (new tissues) are
      produced. (6) It has no toxic effect and causes no necrosis
      (death) of living material. For this reason, unlike strong
      anti-septics it does not destroy the "leucocytic barrier"
      essential to the organism's defense. (7) Urea treatment has been
      successful where other treatments have failed. (8) We found no
      contra-indications to its use."<br>
      <br>
      It seems extremely unfortunate, after reading this study, that
      safe, effective and inexpensive urea was ignored as a general
      antiseptic and wound treatment in favor of cortisone and
      antibiotic creams. Cortisone has been proven to be dangerous and
      toxic and antibiotics destroy good bacteria along with the bad.
      Also by using antibiotics routinely, we have greatly reduced their
      effectiveness as bacterial strains have developed increasing
      resistance to them.<br>

      SUBJECT: TREATMENT OF STOMACH ULCERS WITH URINE EXTRACTS<br>
      <br>
      This is a report on clinical and laboratory studies indicating
      that urine extracts taken from pregnancy urine and normal urine,
      when given intravenously or injected, have beneficial and
      therapeutic effects on chronic duodenal ulcers and other types of
      stomach ulcers in humans and on experimentally induced animal
      stomach ulcers.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers reported, among other things, that:<br>
      <br>
      1) urine contains a type of gastric secretory suppressant (or
      antacid) called urogastrone, that can protect against irritation
      of the stomach lining that may lead to ulcers.<br>
      <br>
      2) certain urine extracts also encouraged healing of ulcers by
      stimulating the growth of new cells, tissues and blood vessels in
      the damaged area.<br>
      <br>
      The study also discusses a pregnancy urine extract called
      Antuitrin S which was reported to have a beneficial therapeutic
      effect on experimentally induced ulcers in animals..<br>
      <br>
      In the report, urine extract therapy is compared to other ulcer
      drug treatments and diet changes and it was found in human testing
      that: "...a higher per cent of those [ulcer patients] treated with
      urine extract became symptom free during treatment (thus, a
      greater number enjoyed a maintenance diet sooner) and a much
      higher percent enjoyed longer symptom free intervals (thus, a
      greater number continued with a more liberal diet over a much
      longer period of time).<br>
      <br>
      This study references 13 other research studies before 1941 that
      were also conducted on the beneficial effects of urine extracts in
      the treatment of stomach ulcers.<br>

      TITLE: THE WATER OF LIFE, (book) 1944, by John Armstrong. Report
      #11<br>
      <br>
      This book was not written by a doctor or researcher, but it's the
      most compelling and powerful book of testimonials ever written on
      the use of urine therapy and deserves to be included in any work
      on urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      John Armstrong was just an "ordinary" Englishman with an
      extraordinary insight. When he contracted tuberculosis at the age
      of 34 and later diabetes, he went to various doctors for help, but
      after two years of unsuccessful treatments, decided to look for
      his own solution to his health problems. The solution he
      discovered was urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      After fasting for forty-five days on nothing but urine and water
      Armstrong reported that "I felt and was 'an entirely new man'. I
      weighed 140 lbs., was full of vim and looked about eleven years
      younger than I actually was."<br>
      <br>
      Armstrong was so amazed at his own recovery, that he began to
      advise other people on how to cure themselves with urine fasting.
      His technique was so successful that many hundreds of people with
      everything from cancer to heart disease, gangrene, kidney disease,
      venereal disease, obesity, prostrate problems and many other
      difficult disorders came to Armstrong for help and were cured.
      Armstrong himself reportedly lived healthily and happily ever
      after, well into his eighties, by maintaining a good diet, a
      healthful lifestyle and by ingesting a small daily dose of urine.<br>
      <br>
      One thing lacking in Armstrong's book is scientific evidence, but
      the stories are so full of the incredible drama of dreadfully sick
      people getting miraculously well that most people who read it
      cease to care about corroborative laboratory studies. Armstrong's
      book is a wonderful inspiration, but the fact that so much
      scientific evidence supporting urine therapy does exist needs be
      recognized and made public because until it is, the majority of
      people will be scared away from urine therapy by doctors and
      medical practitioners who insist that there are no laboratory and
      clinical studies supporting it.<br>
      <br>
      Also, Armstrong's method of extended urine and water fasts is very
      radical and is definitely not advisable for home use, especially
      since Armstrong supervised his patients extremely carefully and
      provided certain conditions for his fasts which are not easily
      duplicated today. John Armstrong's book is an inspiring
      compilation of testimonials and makes excellent reading for
      everyone interested in urine therapy<br>

      <b>Report #12 -- ITLE: THE ACTION OF UREA AND SOME OF ITS
        DERIVATIVES ON BACTERIA,</b> by Louis Weinstein and Alice
      McDonald, 1946, From the Evans Memorial, Massachusetts Memorial
      Hospitals, and the Department of Medicine, Boston,Massachusetts.<br>
      <br>
      SUBJECT: THE BACTERIA-DESTROYING PROPERTIES OF UREA DISCUSSION:
      THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF USING SYNTHETIC URINE DERIVATIVES.<br>
      <br>
      This study is only one of several conducted on the anti-bacterial
      properties of urea by the two researchers, Weinstein and McDonald.
      In this report, they discuss previous research into the
      antibacterial effect of urea and report that their studies also
      confirmed that urea will both inhibit the growth and destroy many
      different types of bacteria such as those that cause dysentery,
      typhoid, and staph and strep infections: "Urea and urethane are
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal for a number of gram-negative and
      gram-positive bacteria..."<br>
      <br>
      In other words, this study proved, as did others like it, that
      urea can stop the growth or kill many different types of disease
      bacteria. This particular study on urea is also good example of
      why synthetic drug compounds should not routinely be considered
      for use in the place of basic or natural medicinal elements. As
      Weinstein and McDonald stated, they used both urea and a
      chemically synthesized urea compound called urethane to kill
      bacteria and they recommended both urea and urethane for medical
      use as anti-bacterial agents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Research Evidence and Case Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Weinstein and McDonald discovered that urethane (made by heating
      urea and mixing it with alcohol and other synthetic agents) was
      sometimes a faster and deadlier "kill" than urea alone on
      bacteria, and so emphasized its use over simple urea. But what
      they didn't realize at the time was that urethane has a
      carcinogenic (cancer-causing) effect on the body.<br>
      <br>
      As the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens, 1985 stated: "This
      substance (urethane] may reasonably be anticipated to be a
      carcinogen". A review of urethane's carcinogenic action was also
      reported in the journal of Advanced Cancer Research in 1968. So
      you can see how extremely dangerous errors can be made by
      scientists experimenting with new and "improved" synthetic drugs.
      In Weinstein and McDonald's day, there was no way of knowing or
      predicting how urethane would affect the body in the long term.
      And the same is true today of new drugs that initially seem like
      miracle cures but later tum out to be deadly substances.<br>
      <br>
      Compound urine-derivative drugs may seem superior in the minds of
      medical researchers, and even consumers, but what good are they if
      they later prove to be harmful or even fatal? Simple urea and
      urine have been shown to be safe over nearly a full century of
      scientific study and use, so it certainly makes sense to start
      using them routinely in medicine before resorting to potentially
      dangerous compound chemical drugs.<br>
      <br>
      TITLE: URINE THERAPY, 1947, by Professor J. Plesch, M.D., From an
      article in the English medical journal, The Medical Press
      (London).<br>
      SUBJECT: USE OF URINE THERAPY 1/N THE TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS
      DISEASES, ASTHMA, ALLERGIES, MIGRAINES, VIRAL INFECTIONS,
      HAYFEVER, DIABETES, GOUT, DYSFUNCTION OF THE ADRENAL AND THYROID
      GLANDS, HEART CONDITIONS.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Plesch, an English physician, used natural urine injections in
      his medical practice extensively and with excellent success on a
      large variety of disease conditions: "...In fact, my
      recommendation to use the urine of the infected person for
      auto-vaccination is only an extension of the methods of Jenner and
      Pasteur and therefore it is strange that auto-urine vaccination
      has not been used before. The main difference between the
      Pasteur-Fenner methods and auto-urine therapy lies in the fact
      that by inoculating the fresh urine of the patient the active
      infectious material has been weakened by passage through the
      recipient's own body.<br>
      <br>
      I am convinced from my experience that it is worthwhile
      investigating this method systematically with respect to all
      infectious diseases, including poliomyelitis, etc. Moreover,
      during the application of this therapy, I observed some remarkable
      effects. Among my first patients whom I treated by urine therapy
      was a typical case of asthma. Immediately after the first
      injection and before the vaccination effect had time to develop,
      this patient lost his daily attacks of asthma.<br>
      <br>
      Following up this clue, I found that anaphylactic (allergic)
      persons could be desensitized by the auto-urine injection.
      Subsequent investigation convinced me that auto-urine therapy
      could be used with considerable advantage against all kinds of
      anaphylactic (allergic) diseases, such as hayfever, urticaria,
      (hives), disfunction of the intestinal tract such as cramps, etc.
      It also relieved migraine and other spastic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Since I started the auto-urine therapy three years ago, I have
      given several hundred injections and I have not come across a
      single case where the patient suffered any harm. It is for this
      reason, and because the method is so simple that is can be used by
      any practitioner without any difficulties, that I decided to
      publish my findings at this early stage.<br>
      <br>
      The observations which I have quoted are without doubt sufficient
      to indicate to the expert that a completely new field of research
      is being opened up which may entail considerable additions to our
      knowledge of bacteriology, immunology and serology. The fresh
      urine of men is practically sterile and that of women, too, if the
      exterior genitalia have been cleaned previously. For purposes of
      immediate injection the urine may therefore be collected directly
      into sterile vessels...<br>
      <br>
      The application is very simple indeed. The most suitable method is
      intragluteal injection. When using urine as an auto-vaccine I
      found that usually one injection of a quarter to a half cc. of
      fresh urine is sufficient. In anaphylactic (allergy) cases I have
      found it useful to start with 5 cc. of fresh urine and to repeat
      the injections with diminishing doses down to 1/2 cc. of fresh
      urine... Thus urine can be used for immunization or
      desensitization. Treatment with the patient's own urine is
      indicated against bacterial or virus infections and against
      allergic conditions...Moreover, the hormonal end products and
      enzymes contained in the urine make it probable that this method
      may be useful against metabolic disturbances such as diabetes and
      gout and against derangements of the ovarial or thyroid, etc.

      T<b>ITLE: ON THE EFFECT OF HUMAN URINE ON TUBERCULE BACILLI, 1951
        by Dr. K.B. Bjornesjo, From the Department of Medical Chemistry,
        Uppsala, Sweden.</b><b><br>
      </b><b>SUBJECT: ANTI-TUBERCULE EFFECT OF URINE -- Report #14</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although some medical researchers for many years had been aware
      that different body fluids such as serum and saliva had an
      inhibitory effect on tuberculosis bacteria, Bjornesjo, a
      Scandinavian researcher, discovered that urine was much more
      effective that any other body fluids in arresting the growth of
      tuberculosis bacilli:<br>
      <br>
      "In a preliminary experiment performed in this laboratory
      employing (solutions of) saliva, serum and urine from different
      subjects...it became apparent that under the experimental
      conditions the inhibitory effect of saliva and serum was very
      weak...On the other hand urine seemed to have a considerably
      stronger inhibitory effect and a concentration of 50 per cent
      urine in (a) medium completely inhibited the growth of the
      tubercule bacilli in most cases..."<br>
      <br>
      Bjomesjo conducted extensive testing of the anti-tuberculosis
      property of urine and concluded that:<br>
      <br>
      1) The majority of urines examined showed a strong inhibitory
      effect of the growth of the tubercule bacteria.<br>
      2) Human urine also has a bactericidal (bacteria-killing) effect
      on tuberculosis bacteria.<br>
      3) The anti-TB element of urine was shown in laboratory tests to
      be present in tuberculin positive and negative individuals and
      also in healthy vegetarians and in patients with active
      tuberculosis.<br>
      4) The presence of urine in the urinary tract exerts an anti-TB
      effect that can influence the course and spreading of tuberculosis
      in the urinary tract itself.<br>
      <br>
      Bjomesjo's experiments dearly demonstrated that human urine could
      inhibit the growth and even completely destroy the tuberculosis
      bacteria, but he was unable to identify which element in urine is
      responsible for its anti-tubercule activity<br>
      <br>
      Actually, Bjornesjo tried for many years to determine the
      anti-tubercular element in urine, so that it could be isolated,
      but he was never successful. It wasn't until 1965 that Japanese
      researchers discovered and isolated this mystery anti-TB element
      in urine —14 years after Bjomesjo's first attempts.<br>
      <br>
      Bjomesjo considered the possibility that urea is the
      antitubercular agent in urine, but he ruled this out, perhaps
      prematurely. In his experiments, Bjornesjo<br>
      only considered the anti-bacterial strength of a 2 per cent
      solution of urea, which is the average amount of urea found in
      normal urine. However, as later research in 1961 (see Dr.
      Schlegel), showed, urea in higher concentrations (8%) does inhibit
      or destroy both gram negative and gram positive bacteria. So even
      though specific anti-tubercular agents other than urea are in
      urine, urea most likely also plays a role.<br>
      <br>
      But again, if we were to use a urea extract alone in treating TB,
      rather than whole urine, the important anti-tubercular element in
      whole urine that Bjornesjo discovered would be eliminated from our
      treatment, which indicates that a combination of whole urine and
      urea could offer an extremely effective TB treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TITLE: STUDIES ON THE TUBER-CULOINHIBITORY PROPERTIES OF
        ASCORBIC ACID DERIVATIVES AND THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN INHIBITION
        OF TUBERCULE BACILLI BY URINE,</b> 1954, by Dr. Quentin Myrvik,
      R. Weiser, B. Houglum, and L. Berger. From the Department of
      Microbiology, University of Washington School of Medicine,
      Seattle, Washington.<br>
      <br>
      When Bjornesjo discovered that urine can inhibit or destroy the
      bacteria that causes tuberculosis, , rather than use this
      information to support traditional urine therapy, he conducted
      several more intensive research studies in an attempt to determine
      what exactly if was in the urine that killed the TB bacillus so
      that it could be isolated and produced in drug form but, as we
      said his research was unsuccessful.<br>
      <br>
      This particular study was another attempt by several other
      researchers to find the mystery element in urine that destroyed TB
      bacteria and they suggested that it might be the ascorbic acid
      (vitamin C) in urine: "The idea that the ascorbic acid of urine
      and serum may exert tuberculostatic action is not new...These
      observations are not inconsistent with the concept of the present
      writers that the tuberculostatic activity of urine reported by
      Bjornesjo in some way depends on ascorbic acid."<br>
      <br>
      This assumption was incorrect. It wasn't until several years
      later, in the following study done in 1965, that Japanese
      researchers were able to partially identify what it was in urine
      that stopped the growth of TB bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Report #16 TITLE: ISOLATION FROM HUMAN URINE OF A POLYPEPTIDE
      HAVING MARKED TUBERCULOSTATIC ACTIVITY, 1965, by Shusuke Tsuji,
      et. al, From the Fifth Division of the Tuberculosis Research
      Institute, Kyoto University, Japan.<br>
      <br>
      In one of the opening statements of this report, the researchers
      comment that: "The vast majority of Japanese adults are tuberculin
      positive..." which is apparently why the laboratory evidence of
      urine's anti-TB property was of interest to Japanese researchers
      and why they conducted their own search for the anti-TB element in
      urine: "In short, although it has been a well known fact that
      human urine has definite capacity to inhibit the growth of
      tubercule bacilli...the chemical nature of the active substance
      has been obscure. In our investigations it . has become clear that
      at least one of the active agents is a polypeptide."<br>
      <br>
      Although these researchers did identify one of the active elements
      in urine's tuberculostatic activity as a polypeptide (which is a
      chain of amino acids), they also admitted that there are other "as
      yet undetermined agents" responsible for urine's anti-TB property.<br>
      <br>
      Most of us in the U.S. have no concept of the seriousness of
      tuberculosis, because our plentiful food sources, excellent
      sanitation and modern drugs seemed to have eliminated this
      formerly dreaded disease. But only recently, this article, which
      was mentioned in Chapter 3, revealed that TB is a modern-day
      threat:<br>
      <br>
      The Associated Press, Friday, October 8, 1993<br>
      WASHINGTON— New cases of tuberculosis are increasing at an
      alarming rate, posing a special threat to the poor and people with
      the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
      congressional analysts reported Thursday...The congressional
      report said EFFORTS TO COMBAT TUBERCULOSIS ARE COMPLICATED BECAUSE
      OF THE EMERGENCE OF STRAINS RESISTANT TO ANTI-TB DRUGS... (my
      caps)<br>
      <br>
      The fact that TB and other disease microorganisms are now
      resistant to many of our chemical drugs should set off an alarm
      somewhere in our consciousness. The whole point of evolution is
      adaptation and survival, and as this article, and others like it
      reveal, disease germs are obviously surviving by adapting natural
      defenses to our chemical drugs - but are we adapting natural
      defenses to the germs?<br>
      <br>
      How can our natural immune defenses possibly develop and adapt
      normally to new and stronger strains of disease microorganisms,
      when we constantly override our bodies' natural responses to
      disease with unnatural drugs? For years, we've interfered with
      even the most basic of our bodies' natural defenses, such as
      fever, by substituting chemical drugs for critical natural immune
      responses to infections and disease. A crucial fact that we have
      overlooked in this era of modern medicine is that the body itself
      has the innate natural ability to adapt and change to new disease
      influences, but chemical drugs do not.<br>
      <br>
      We might think that medical scientists can keep coming up with
      newer and stronger drugs to combat new microorganisms, but drug
      research isn't routinely successful and it takes many years to
      develop new treatments. Many of us could well be victims of these
      new bacteria and viruses, such as AIDS, long before our scientists
      figure out what these organisms are and how they kill us.<br>
      <br>
      Natural medicinal substances, like herbs or urine, or homeopathic
      medicines, are traditionally known for their ability to gently
      assist and support our bodies' own immune functions rather than
      overriding them through strong chemical intervention, which is why
      we need to emphasize their use and decrease our dependence on
      drugs. The 'immunebashing' methods of today's conventional
      medicine may prove to be our undoing if we continue to use them as
      irresponsibly as we do today.<br>

      </b><b>Report #17 TITLE: EFFECT OF UREA ON CEREBROSPINAL FLUID
        PRESSURE IN HUMAN SUBJECTS</b>, 1956, From the Joumal of the
      American Medical Association.<br>
      SUBJECT: REDUCTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID PRESSURE WITH UREA; USE
      OF UREA AS A DIURETIC AND IN MENINGITIS.<br>
      <br>
      This is an interesting and precedent-setting study The two
      university doctors who conducted this research were intrigued by
      the possibility that urea, which was known to be an excellent
      natural diuretic, could also be used to reduce excess fluid
      pressure on the brain and spinal cord which were created by
      various disease conditions or abnormalities such as brain tumors,
      hydrocephalus (water on the brain), cerebral hemorrhage or
      meningitis.<br>
      <br>
      Excessive intracranial pressure can be extremely dangerous and, if
      severe and unrelieved, can cause death, so it is of utmost
      importance to relieve this pressure or inflammation as quickly and
      effectively as possible without causing harmful side effects.
      Swelling and pressure in the cerebral cavity and spinal area also
      create problems during brain surgery. The researchers, in this
      preliminary study, laid the groundwork for the use of urea in
      reducing such pressure:<br>
      <br>
      "The purpose of this report is to describe findings in a
      preliminary study to determine the safety and efficiency with
      which urea might be used intravenously for the purpose of reducing
      intracranial pressure. Many (other) agents have been used for this
      purpose but each has some undesirable action that limits or
      prohibits its use." <br>
      <br>
      In the study, the doctors report good results in clinical trials
      on patients with excessive cranial pressure: "...it was found that
      the average pressure drop produced by urea was 4.5 times greater
      than that caused by sucrose or dextrose (and)...the urea effects
      were much longer lasting."<br>
      <br>
      The clinical use of urea as a diuretic is also discussed: "Urea
      has, however, been used clinically for other purposes than
      reduction of intracranial tension. It has long been recognized to
      be an effective diuretic agent.<br>
      <br>
      Salter states: 'One of the most effective diuretic agents is urea,
      nature's own non-electrolytic diuretic.' For the purpose of
      promoting diuresis it is administered by the oral route, 20 gm.
      two to five times daily."<br>
      <br>
      Urea's successful historical use in combination with sulfa drugs
      is also commented on in relation to treating meningitis with urea:<br>
      <br>
      "LaLonde and Gardner gave urea in conjunction with sulfonamides in
      the treatment of meningitis... It is thus evident that the
      clinical use of urea is not without precedent. It is a normal body
      metabolite that is well tolerated in large doses..."<br>
      <br>
      The success of this preliminary study on the use of urea in
      neurosurgery encouraged further research. The next study was one
      of several follow-up research projects and clinical trials that
      established urea as an effective agent in treating many different
      disorders involving excessive fluid pressure in the body.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Report #18 -- TITLE: UREA—NEW USE OF AN OLD AGENT</b>,
      1957. From a Symposium on Surgery of the Head and Neck.<br>
      SUBJECT: UREA TREATMENT OF EXCESS CEREBRAL AND SPINAL PRESSURE,
      INOPERABLE BRAIN TUMORS, EDEMA (FLUID PRESSURE) OF THE BRAIN,
      PREMENSTRUAL WATER RETENTION, MENINGITIS, CHRONIC GLAUCOMA,
      HYDROCEPHALUS, DELIRIUM TREMENS AND EPILEPSY<br>
      <br>
      Because of the encouraging results of the previous urea research,
      doctors conducted this more intensive study which included
      extensive clinical trials using urea on 300 patients with a wide
      variety of disorders including brain tumors, hydrocephalus (water
      on the brain), migraines, glaucoma, meningitis, brain abscess,
      retinal detachment and premenstrual edema.<br>
      <br>
      Results of these trials were so successful, doctors concluded
      that: "This agent (urea) has a definite place in the therapeutic
      armamentarium of neurologists and neurosurgeons... The combination
      of urea and 10 per cent invert sugar is now used routinely in the
      neurosurgical service for intravenous administration..."<br>
      <br>
      There were reports on remarkable cases in which the clinical use
      of urea was literally life-saving as in the case of a woman who
      developed severe swelling or edema of the brain after the surgical
      removal of a small brain tumor:<br>
      <br>
      On" the fourth postoperative day, she developed signs of increased
      intracranial pressure. In the course of a few hours, she became
      progressively lethargic and then suddenly she became
      unresponsive...Her pupils became dilated and fixed, her systolic
      blood pressure rose... Preparations were underway to take her to
      the operating room for the removal of a bone flap.<br>
      <br>
      Urea was administered intravenously as an emergency measure.
      Within 20 minutes from the start of injection her blood pressure
      had returned to normal and her pupils began to react...to light.
      From this time on, her recovery was uneventful... In this case,
      urea was definitely life-saving, because prior to its
      administration the patient was in critical condition and her
      survival until surgical decompression could be done was
      unlikely... In many similar instances urea was found to be
      life-saving."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers commented on the urea treatment of another patient
      who had a brain tumor surgically removed but developed another
      massive brain tumor three months later: "...the patient received
      256 ml. of 30 per cent urea. The bulging mass "...had completely
      disappeared by the end of two hours. On the diuretic properties of
      urea, the doctors reported: "Urea is one of the most useful
      nonmetabolized, nonelectrolyte diuretics. Its diuretic property
      does not diminish after prolonged administration, as is the case
      with acid-producing salts."<br>
      <br>
      In observing its effect on relieving fluid pressure on the eyes in
      glaucoma and other ophthalmic patients, researchers stated that:
      "Urea has been administered to 25 patients with acute and chronic
      glaucoma, orbital tumors, retinal detachment and other conditions.
      In comparing the effect of urea with Wiamoz1 on intraocular
      pressure, urea was found to be more effective..."<br>
      <br>
      Urea, as studies and doctors and researchers have proven, is a
      safe, non-toxic, remarkably effective and inexpensive diuretic –
      but unfortunately, it's not even listed in any diuretic capacity
      in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) which is the doctors guide
      to approved drug treatments. But Diamox, the synthetic diuretic
      which doctors said was less effective than urea, is listed in the
      PDR – even though it's been proven that urea was safer and more
      effective than Diamox and several other synthetic diuretics and
      urea is FDA approved. So why should Diamox be recommended to
      physicians rather than urea for diuretic use?<br>
      <br>
      Diamox is a sulfa drug and like all sulfa drugs, it can be
      dangerous. The Physician's Desk Reference (1992) warns that
      "fatalities have occurred" with Diamox and that it can cause
      severe allergic reactions, bone marrow depression, a decrease in
      white blood cells, anemia, and a host of other equally horrific
      side effects.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, urea is an effective, inexpensive diuretic and
      has no side-effects or toxicity and it's FDA approved. But doctors
      don't know this – instead they are directed to prescribe Diamox or
      some other 'recommended' form of diuretic drug treatment being
      pushed by the drug companies. It's hard to believe that the
      conventional medical establishment is complaining to patients and
      the media about "snake-oil" sellers and phony medical claims that
      the public supposedly needs protection from, when obviously cogent
      medical research like that done on urea is p so completely
      ignored. Another point to consider is that synthetic diuretics
      alter the sodium/potassium (or electrolyte) balance of the body
      which can cause havoc with your health. But as the researchers
      pointed out, urea is a non-electrolytic diuretic that safely
      reduces fluid pressure in the body and its effects last longer
      than other diuretics. Most people and practicing doctors have
      never heard of the oral use of urea, but it's not uncommon in
      medical research. The doctors in this study and many other
      researchers have given large doses of urea by mouth, as well as
      intravenously: "... Urea has also been used by mouth in tablet
      form, or in powder dissolved in such [things) as unsweetened fruit
      juices..." This study like so many before it, again proved that
      urea was a safe medicinal agent, even in large doses, as well as
      being extremely simple and effective: Dosages. "...After urea was
      proved to be a safe agent which was well tolerated in large doses,
      the dosage was increased until, today, in the majority of the
      patients, it is 1 gram per kilogram of body weight..." Because of
      the success of the preliminary clinical trials using urea on a
      variety of disease conditions doctors recommended that: "Further
      trials of urea are warranted in [the treatment of]:
      encephalopathies (abnormal conditions of the structure of function
      of tissues of the brain)... Meniere's disease (disease of the
      inner ear), 'prei menstrual edema, eclampsia (the gravest form of
      toxemia in pregnancy), ocular surgery, glaucoma, delirium tremens,
      epilepsy..." Researchers reported that they were undertaking

      SUBJECT: UREA AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS.""<br>
      <br>
      Drawing on earlier historical research into urea's anti-bacterial
      properties, Schlegel and his associates conducted this study to
      determine what effect urea would have on bacteria commonly found
      in urinary tract infections such as bladder and kidney infections:<br>
      <br>
      "It has been known since 1906 that urea has a bacteriostatic
      effect in altering the shape of pathogenic organisms (Peju and
      Rajat and Wilson). Symmers and Kirk in 1915 used urea powder as a
      disinfectant in the treatment of wounds. It has also been used
      locally for preventing the spread of disease in surgery. Foshay
      (1935) used urea locally in otitis (ear infections) with good
      results. McKay and Schroeder (1936) experimented with the use of
      urea on polio and rabies viruses and found that the viruses were
      weakened and finally destroyed by urea. Holder and Mackay (1943)
      used urea locally to stimulate new tissue in wounds and to remove
      dead tissue... Weinstein and McDonald (1945) showed the
      bactericidal effect of urea on microorganisms„.11 was shown to be
      effective against typhoid, paratyphoid and dysentery bacilli...
      Based on these findings, we proceeded to study the effect of urea
      in concentrations within physiological ranges on certain bacteria
      commonly found in urinary tract infections." Even though they were
      unable to determine the mechanism whereby urea inhibited or killed
      the bacteria, Schlegel and his associates did conclude that:<br>
      <br>
      "From the results obtained, it would appear that urea had a
      bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect on all organisms tested...As
      would be expected, the higher concentrations of urea and longer
      exposure were more effective."p<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Research Evidence and Case Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This point is important because it demonstrates that as we
      increase the urea concentrations in our urine, we increase the
      germ-fighting properties of our urine, which is an important
      function of the body in resisting or defeating bacterial invasions
      as in bladder and kidney infections. So how do we increase our
      bodies' urea levels? As the following study by Dr. Donald Kaye
      demonstrated, one way is by taking urea orally or by injection, as
      patients in his clinical trials did; another method is by
      ingesting our own urine, which, because it naturally contains
      urea, also increases urea concentrations in our systems. One
      popular conventional medical treatment for urinary tract
      infections that does not increase urea levels, but actually
      dilutes urea, is the practice of force- drinking copious amounts
      of water or liquids to supposedly help cure urinary tract
      infections. This practice of force-drinking water to increase
      urine excretion is called water diuresis. As Schlegel, and other
      researchers and clinical trials demonstrated, concentrated urine
      is actually a vital natural defense against urinary tract
      infections, including kidney infections, and diluting it by
      greatly increased forced-water intake is apparently an erroneous
      practice. As Schlegel and his associates commented: "Water
      diuresis results in urea concentration in urine so low that there
      would be no bactericidal effect due to urea. One consequently
      wonders about the rationale of instituting water diuresis by
      forced water intake as supportive therapy in acute pyelonephritis
      [kidney infection] or other urinary tract infections." In other
      words, Schlegel is saying that it isn't logical to drink large
      amounts of water to combat urinary tract infections, because the
      water dilutes the urine and its urea content which subsequently
      destroys or greatly decreases the urine's natural anti-bacterial
      action which the body uses as a natural defense against urinary
      tract infection. Schlegel also observed that chronic kidney
      infection is associated with an inability to concentrate urine.
      This means that the kidney infection may be fueled by the fact
      that the urine or urea in the system isn't concentrated enough to
      exert its anti-bacterial action, and consequently can't help fight
      the infection:<br>
      <br>
      "This finding helps to confirm that with a loss of ability to
      concentrate urine and the accompanying loss of ability to
      concentrate urea, as seenYour Own Perfect Medicine in advanced
      chronic pyelonephritis [kidney infection], the anti-bacterial
      concentration of urea cannot be achieved."<br>
      <br>
      As Schlegel comments, when the body's urea concentration is
      diluted by such things as drinking large quantities of water or by
      kidney malfunction, the body loses its important natural capacity
      to use urea as an anti-bacterial defense. Researchers have also
      discovered that acidic urine is more anti-bacterial than
      non-acidic urine. But again, drinking water large amounts of water
      makes urine less acidic and therefore less anti-bacterial.<br>
      <br>
      In the book Urinalysis in Clinical Laboratory Practice written in
      1975 by two researchers from Miles Laboratories, the researchers
      also observe that by drinking large amounts of water, the natural
      anti-bacterial-promoting acidity of urine is destroyed:<br>
      <br>
      "If a large amount of water is ingested by a human, a
      corresponding diuresis or increase in urine excretion occurs. At
      this time, the pH of the urine tends to become relatively fixed at
      a value quite close to neutrality. This phenomenon may be
      interpreted as an indication that the normal process of urine pH
      adjustment does not have an opportunity to function
      effectively..." The researchers also stated that:<br>
      <br>
      "The presence of a urinary tract infection may cause the urine to
      become quite definitely and persistently alkaline due to the
      action of urea splitting organisms."<br>
      <br>
      In other words, an infection itself makes the urine less acid and
      therefore less anti- bacterial than it should be, so logically, it
      doesn't make sense to further dilute the urine's bacteria-fighting
      properties by drinking large amounts of water as a treatment for
      the infection.<br>
      <br>
      Cranberry juice has been suggested as a method for increasing the
      antibacterial acidity of urine, but as the next study by Dr.
      Donald Kaye demonstrated, the urea concentration and not the
      acidity of the urine appears to be the primary factor in urine's
      antibacterial activity, and force-drinking fluids does not
      contribute to urea concentration in the urine.<br>
      <br>
      For women who have or have had urinary tract infections, more
      commonly referred to as bladder infections, you know what your
      doctor invariably tells you to do — drink lots of fluids and take
      medication, right?r<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Research Evidence and Case Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      But there are two major problems with this scenario. First, as
      we've discussed, drinking large amounts of fluid dilutes the
      antibacterial activity of your urine which makes it harder for
      your body to overcome the urinary tract infection.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly, one of the medications which doctors invariably
      prescribe for the pain associated with bladder infections is
      Pyridium, (phenazopyridine hydrochloride). Unfortunately, Pyridium
      is a known carcinogen.<br>
      <br>
      The 1985 Handbook of Toxic and Hazardous Chemicals and Carcinogens
      states that Pyridium, (also known as Bisteril, Pyridicil and
      Uridinal), which has been used for 40 years as an analgesic drug
      to reduce the pain of urinary tract infections, is actually a
      known carcinogen:<br>
      <br>
      "...in female mice it significantly increased the incidence of
      adenomas and carcinomas (cancer), and...In male and female rats it
      induced tumors of the colon and rectum."<br>
      <br>
      4.4 million prescriptions of this drug were dispensed in 1980, and
      it is still routinely prescribed for the pain of urinary tract
      infections today. The next time you get a urinary tract infection,
      try urine therapy first — it's indisputably safer, cheaper, and
      much more effective than water, cranberry juice and Pyridium. And
      you can monitor your own progress at home with the same dipsticks
      the doctors use to determine if you have a urinary tract infection
      (see section on urine testing you can do at home in Chapter 6.)<br>
      The next research study was also done on the role of urine in
      preventing or healing urinary tract infections, and it also
      demonstrated that urine can inhibit or kill bacteria when the urea
      concentration is sufficiently elevated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #20 -- TITLE: ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF HUMAN URINE,
        1968, by </b>Dr. Donald Kaye (Associate Professor of Medicine,
      Cornell University Medical College, New York).<br>
      <br>
      Many researchers in the past have looked for the answer as to why
      urine from one person is anti-bacterial, while a urine sample from
      another individual is not. Several studies over the course of the
      twentieth century confirmed that urine can definitely be
      anti-bacterial and, based on a number of these studies,
      researchers speculated that increased acid levels in urine made it
      antibacterial (which is the reason why cranberry juice, which
      acidifies the urine, is recommended for urinary tract infections).<br>
      <br>
      But, Dr. Donald Kaye disagreed that acidity was the major factor
      in making urine anti-bacterial. He felt that, although acidity
      contributed to urine's anti-bacterial properties, no one had yet
      confirmed the real factor behind this natural activity of urine.<br>
      <br>
      So in 1968 he undertook a research study in order to demonstrate
      that the bactericidal properties of urine were related not so much
      to acidity or other factors, but more to the urea concentration in
      the urine. In the study, Kaye showed that it was primarily urea
      levels, rather than organic acids or other factors that were
      responsible for the antibacterial action of urine:<br>
      <br>
      "The results of the present study provide evidence for the role of
      urea in human urine as an antibacterial agent.<br>
      <br>
      They also suggest that within the ranges of concentration commonly
      achieved in human urine, antibacterial activity is more a function
      of urea content than of organic add concentration, or ammonium
      concentration."<br>
      <br>
      Kaye demonstrated that by increasing the concentration of urea in
      urine, you could directly increase the urine's ability to stop the
      growth of the disease-causing bacteria:<br>
      <br>
      "...These experiments demonstrated that supplementation with urea
      markedly increased the inhibitory quality of the urine..." Kaye
      also mentions several other researchers who had demonstrated that
      concentrated urea was anti-bacterial:<br>
      <br>
      "There are previous studies suggesting that urea may contribute to
      antibacterial activity of urine...Schlegel, Cuellar and O'Dell
      found that urea in nutrient broth...has antibacterial activity in
      concentrations of 1- 4 000 ml... Neter and Clark showed that
      addition of urea to human urine markedly increased antibacterial
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, Schlegel, Raffi, Flinner, and O'Dell, Brazil, and
      Schlegel were able to decrease the incidence of urinanj tract
      infection in dogs and rats by administering urea after
      introduction of bacteria into the urinary tract."When you
      re-ingest your urine, you are essentially ingesting additional
      urea. And as Kaye demonstrated in his study, by orally ingesting
      additional urea, we increase the concentration of urea in the
      system, and consequently increase the antibacterial action of our
      urine: "Urine collected from volunteers after ingestion of urea
      demonstrated a marked increase in antibacterial activity, as
      compared with urine collected before ingestion of urea...<br>
      <br>
      In each subject the urea concentration was increased by at least
      0.5 grams of urea nitrogen/100ml of urine after ingestion of
      urea.",<br>
      <br>
      There is evidence that there is a link between acidity in urine
      and its antibacterial action, but, as Kaye comments:<br>
      <br>
      "None of the studies made an intensive effort to elucidate the
      factors that may contribute to inhibitory activity of urine and to
      determine the relative importance of each factor."<br>
      <br>
      Kaye also demonstrates, as did Schlegel, that drinking large
      amounts of water to promote urine output (diuresis) markedly
      decreases the antibacterial activity of urine, which in turn
      decreases one of your body's natural infection-fighting
      mechanisms:<br>
      <br>
      "Urine...collected before diuresis was bactericidal for E. Coli
      strain 14, whereas urine obtained during diuresis supported the
      growth of this strain...<br>
      <br>
      The results of the present study and those of Roberts and Beard
      and Asscher et al. suggest that antibacterial activity of human
      urine may be an important factor in preventing urinary tract
      infection and may also help to select (affect the reproduction of)
      bacterial strains when infection does occur."<br>
      <br>
      In view of all this supportive data on the antibacterial
      properties of urea, it becomes dearer as to why urine therapy has
      long been observed to be extremely effective in combatting many
      different types of infection.<br>

      <br>
      SUBJECT: NATURAL ANTIBODIES FOUND IN URINEThe research in this
      study was based in large part on several previous studies on the
      presence of important natural antibodies that have been found in
      urine. <br>
      <br>
      Actually, there are so many research studies that have been done
      on the presence of antibodies in urine that it would be impossible
      to discuss them all, so we'll look at this study and one other,
      both of which give a good general overview of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      We all know the importance of anti-bodies in fighting disease.
      When we are exposed to foreign organisms which our bodies sense as
      threatening, our immune system produces a wide variety of
      antibodies which attack, weaken and destroy the intruders. Most of
      us think that these antibodies are found only in our blood. But
      numerous research studies have proven that a wide variety of
      antibodies are also present in our urine when we are fighting
      disease - and these important antibodies can be reused by the body
      in urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      As this study in 1962 revealed, urine antibodies are extremely
      effective disease-fighters and are capable of actively
      neutralizing or destroying even the aggressive polio virus:<br>
      <br>
      Neutralizing activity for the poliovirus was demonstrated in
      protein concentrates prepared from the urine of a number of normal
      subjects. The biologic characteristics of the neutralizing
      activity in the urine resembled those of specific antibody found
      in blood. This neutralizing substance of the urine has the
      essential characteristics of antibody. Further studies on the
      biochemical and physical characterization of this and other
      urinary antibodies are in progress.<br>
      <br>
      This report also revealed that several other types of urine
      anti-bodies have been found in other research studies:"Antibodies
      to cholera and typhoid have been found in the unconcentrated urine
      of normal volunteers immunized with the corresponding vaccine.
      Antibodies to diphtheria, pneumonia, leptospira and salmonella
      bacteria have also been found in the urine of immunized or
      infected individuals."<br>
      <br>
      The medical community may argue that the re-use of urine
      antibodies through urine therapy isn't significant because
      antibodies aren't always found in urine during disease and they
      are not sufficiently concentrated enough to control or combat
      disease even when they are found – but this isn't true.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers in this study on polio urine antibodies clearly
      stated that even minute concentrations of detected or undetected
      antibodies can control and fight disease: "It is known, however,
      that the presence of antibody, even in amounts which are not
      detectable by conventional methods, may prevent disease and
      detection of virus...".<br>
      <br>
      In another research report published in 1967 by immunologists from
      Mount Sinai Hospital in New York on the presence of polioantibody
      in urine, the researchers confirmed that:<br>
      <br>
      "It is clear that IGA polioantibody is present in...urine...It
      seems likely that antibodies of this type may play a part in the
      defense against invasion of micro-organisms." (Demonstration of
      IgA Polioantibody in Saliva, Duodenal Fluid and Urine, 1967)."<br>
      <br>
      In other words, as these two studies demonstrate, natural urine
      antibodies do not necessarily need to be chemically concentrated
      in drug form in order to be active and effective, and, as we've
      seen, natural substances in their natural environment are safer
      and less toxic to use, which means that reusing urine antibodies
      through urine therapy is extremely significant.<br>
      <br>
      Another important aspect of reusing urine antibodies during urine
      therapy that I've mentioned before is the fact that your urine
      antibodies are specific to your particular health conditions. When
      you reingest your urine, you get the benefit of your body's
      "custom-made" antibodies to combat diseases you may not even know
      you have.<br>
      <br>
      The recent outbreaks of food poisoning from contaminated beef and
      chicken presents an important indication for the use of urine and
      urea therapy. Urine, as you've read, contains natural antibodies
      to food contaminants such as salmonella in infected individuals,
      and many people have reported excellent success in treating food
      poisoning with urine therapy. Also, concentrated urea's excellent
      bactericidal properties can also contribute to treating bacterial
      infections such as food poisoning. In serious, hospitalized cases,
      the administration of the patient's urine combined with injected
      or intravenous urea would provide a combination of natural
      antibodies, critical immune defense factors and concentrated urea
      levels that could prove to be of enormous efficacy in treating
      food poisoning and bacterial and viral infections of all kinds.<br>
      <br>
      As a nation, we spend an enormous amount of time and money hying
      to diagnose what disorders we have and usually end up with an
      antibiotic or drug that may or may not be the right one for our
      'non-specific' illness. Urine therapy provides an alternative to
      this practice, because we don't have to diagnose every condition
      we have in order for it to be effective. Urine therapy is
      completely safe and applicable to a huge variety of conditions, in
      addition to being an excellent preventative health treatment.
      There are many instances when your immune system is dealing with a
      health threat long before overt symptoms appear. With urine
      therapy, however, urine antibodies, hormones, enzymes and
      extremely complex nutritional elements can help combat illnesses
      before symptoms appear and even before they're detectable by
      conventional diagnostic studies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #22 TITLE USE OF EXOGENOUS AND ENDOGENOUS UREA FOR
        PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN NORMAL AND UREMIC SUBJECTS,</b> 1963, by
      Dr. Carmelo Giordano, from the Renal Laboratory, Naples University
      School of Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      This study has to do with one of the most difficult problems in
      renal, or kidney disorders, which is the patient's impaired
      ability to synthesize, or in other words, break down and use
      protein. Protein is normally broken down into nitrogen and other
      constituents by both the liver and the kidneys, but when the
      kidneys malfunction because of infection, damage, etc. and can't
      break down protein efficiently, protein depletion occurs, nitrogen
      levels are altered in the body and the person's health is severely
      threatened.<br>
      <br>
      However, some researchers, such as Giordano, have discovered that
      ca urea, (which is produced during protein synthesis and therefore
      contains nitrogen), can actually play a role in helping kidney
      patients to use protein more efficiently and to achieve proper
      nitrogen balance in the body.<br>
      <br>
      The study demonstrated that:<br>
      <br>
      "If urea was added to the diet, enough synthesis of nonessential
      amino acids occurred to achieve equilibrium or even positive
      nitrogen balance."<br>
      <br>
      As Giordano points out:<br>
      <br>
      "With the use of a synthetic diet containing essential amino acids
      in low quantity, it is shown that urea, either if given
      exogenously or if taken endogenously from waste nitrogen retained
      in uremia, is utilized for the synthesis of non-essential amino
      acids."<br>
      <br>
      Utilization of urea has shown progressive clinical improvement in
      uremic patients and is under study as a treatment of renal
      [kidney] failure.<br>
      <br>
      Another report on the role of urea in kidney disease was delivered
      at an international symposium in Florida in 1968, entitled Urea
      and the Kidney, In the report, Mackenzie Walser, of the Johns
      Hopkins University School of Medicine, stated that:<br>
      <br>
      "In uremics [kidney patients] on diets containing small amounts of
      protein, urea apparently provides the principal source of nitrogen
      for protein synthesis. Further exploration of these findings may
      yield valuable information in the treatment of renal failure."
      Walser also points out that:<br>
      <br>
      Urea can no longer be regarded as an end-product of nitrogen
      metabolism but may be used for protein synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, studies have shown that urea is not just a "waste"
      or by-product of the body's use of protein, but is actually an
      important part of our bodies' process of metabolizing protein and
      maintaining proper nitrogen levels which are critical to health
      and functioning.<br>

      with serum (blood) immunoglobulin or (antibodies).<br>
      <br>
      The report also revealed that:<br>
      <br>
      Antibody activity in urine has been demonstrated against several
      microorganisms including cholera, salmonella, diphtheria, tetanus
      and polio.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the doctors who used urine therapy on patients early in
      the twentieth century such as Duncan, and Plesch noted that the
      ingestion or injection of an individual's own urine had an often
      amazing curative effect on a surprisingly wide variety of
      bacterial and viral-related illnesses such as hepatitis, whooping
      cough, mumps, chicken pox and influenza.<br>
      <br>
      It's interesting to see that modem medical researchers have
      confirmed the presence of a variety of disease antibodies in urine
      that apparently play a role in the successful dinical applications
      of urine therapy. There are many other references to urine
      antibodies in medical literature, a few more of which I will list
      here.<br>

      It's extraordinary to realize that we have such easy access to
      these extremely important natural antibodies and other critical
      immune elements of the blood through the simple use of urine
      therapy – especially in view of the AIDS scare which makes the use
      of any public source of blood-related medical treatments
      frightening to many people today.<br>

      In general, most of us have no idea that urine is an extraordinary
      body fluid derived from the blood that is filled with hundreds of
      health supporting ingredients – but, for that matter, this is a
      fact that scientists themselves have only begun to fully
      understand within the last few decades.Your Own Perfect Medicine<br>
      <br>
      As Free and Free explain:<br>
      <br>
      "Literally thousands of compounds have been identified in
      normal.urine and the vast majority of these have been derived from
      the blood...<br>
      <br>
      The understanding of the composition of the urine has gradually
      evolved as the sciences of chemistry and physiology have
      developed..<br>
      <br>
      It is now recognized that the urine contains thousands of
      compounds, and as new, more sensitive analytical tools evolve, it
      is quite certain that new constituents of urine will be
      recognized"<br>
      <br>
      This' report goes on to give a detailed listing of approximately
      200 constituents of urine, but as the researchers comment: "this
      table is not considered to be complete, but identifies [only]
      compounds of interest."<br>
      <br>
      Listing all 200 of the ingredients here would be a bit much, so
      I'll give a sample of some of the ingredients in urine that are
      most recognizable because many of them are the same ingredients
      that you see on your vitamin supplement labels, or that you've
      read or heard about from various sources.<br>

      Again, we never think of urine as a nutrient, but as this analysis
      of urine shows, there are numerous elements of nutritional value

      An interesting point about many of these urine ingredients is that
      many of them are naturally synthesized forms of key nutritional
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, the synthesized, or "digested" forms of vitamin B6
      (pyridoxine) are found in urine - Pyridoxal (70 mg/day) and
      Pyridoxamine (100 mg/day). When you ingest B6 (pyridoxine) in your
      food or as a vitamin supplement, the body breaks it down into
      simpler substances that it can use, namely, pyridoxal and
      pyridoxamine.<br>
      <br>
      These two substances have tremendous nutritive value. They're
      essential for the synthesis and breakdown of amino acids, the
      conversion of tryptophan to niacin, the breakdown of glycogen to
      glucose, the production of antibodies, the formation of heme in
      hemoglobin, the formation of hormones important in brain function,
      the proper absorption of B12, and the maintenance of the balance
      of sodium and potassium which regulates body fluids.<br>
      <br>
      In using natural urine therapy, you are not only ingesting B6
      itself, but you are also ingesting the already synthesized forms
      of B6, which can be extremely important to people who have an
      impaired ability to utilize B vitamins or other essential
      nutrients in their systems due to such factors as poor digestion
      and assimilation, aging, the use of drugs, oral contraceptives,
      antibiotics, etc.<br>
      <br>
      • There are many "pm-digested" nutritional products on the market
      today for people whose bodies have a difficult time breaking down
      more complex nutritional substances into elements that the body
      can use efficiently. But urine in itself is an incredibly complex
      and complete mixture of your own already pre-synthesized nutrients
      that no chemist anywhere could ever duplicate.<br>
      <br>
      As a matter of fact, Bjomesjo, the researcher who did the studies
      on the anti-tuberculin activity of urine, did conduct experiments
      using an artificial urine concocted in the laboratory. He found,
      however, that whereas natural urine did kill or stop the growth of
      the TB bacteria, the artificial urine did not, because the natural
      anti-TB urine element could not be synthetically duplicated.<br>
      <br>
      Several of the following research reports deal specifically with
      urine therapy treatments of cancer, AIDS, mental disorders, skin
      conditions and urea's dermatological and cosmetic uses, and these
      particular reports have been grouped in sections under their
      appropriate category titles to make it easier for you to review

      <b>URINE THERAPY FOR CANCER</b>, by Dr. J.H. Thompson, 1943,
      published in the British Medical Journal, (7/31/43).<br>
      <br>
      In the late 1930's and early 40's, many medical researchers such
      as Dr. Thompson, were experimenting with an anti-cancer urine
      extract referred to as H-11.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the hundreds of researchers who had conducted the studies
      on ONLY-11 in cancer treatments over approximately a 12-year
      period experienced excellent results which unfortunately were
      ignored by the medical community. The researchers reportedly
      demanded that a medical research council be set up to review their
      complaints, stating that their research findings on successful
      H-11 cancer treatments were being unjustly ignored by the medical
      establishment. A council was set up in 1948, However, despite
      thousands of laboratory studies and hundreds of cases of clinical
      proof demonstrating the efficacy of H-11 in treating cancer, it
      was set aside by the council as an accepted medical treatment for
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The clinical and laboratory findings on the use of this extract on
      cancer patients was reported in the British Medical Journal by Dr.
      J.H. Thompson, and revealed that over 300 independent doctors and
      researchers had found that H-11 was clinically effective in
      inhibiting the growth of malignant cells in humans.The Research

      CASE #2: A 60 year-old woman with metastatic malignant tumors in

      4 injections, both subjective and objective improvement was noted,
      as corroborated by radiological x-rays showing marked tumor
      reduction. After six weeks, there were no obstructions noted in

      </b><b>SUBJECT: EFFECTS OF A URINE EXTRACT ON MALIGNANT CANCER
        TUMORS</b><br>
      <br>
      This study was done on an anti-cancer element that has been
      extracted from urine called "retire`: "Certain fractions of the
      urine of children have been shown to stop the growth of
      transplanted malignant cancer tumors in mice. The substance
      responsible for this action was called "refine". We have since
      found a similar activity in the urine of adults of about 20-25
      years."<br>
      <br>
      After studying the effect of refine on several different types of
      cancerous tumors, the researchers observed that:<br>
      <br>
      "Smaller doses of refine inhibit growth of the tumors, while
      bigger ones actually make the tumors regress."<br>
      <br>
      In the study, a group of mice were injected under the skin with 30
      million live cancer cells, and developed subsequent tumors. The
      mice were then treated with refine for a week and the researchers
      noted that:<br>
      <br>
      "The tumors of the mice treated with 6 units of refine for a week,
      upon examination, were found to contain very little live cancer
      tissue and consisted chiefly of dead cancer cells."<br>

      Unfortunately, reline has not been publicized as an anti-cancer
      agent, but this study, as do others, demonstrates that there are
      important anticancer factors in urine that have been shown to be
      amazingly effective in destroying and stopping the growth of

      </b><b>Report #28 TITLE: TREATMENT OF GASTRIC CANCER WITH HUD, AN
        ANTI-GENIC SUBSTANCE OBTAINED FROM PATIENT'S URINE</b>, 1968, by
      Dr. Momoe Soeda, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
      <br>
      This research report presents the remarkable results of a cancer
      treatment study utilizing a urine derivative called HUD (Human's
      Urine Derivative). HUD was found in significant amounts in the
      urine of cancer patients and was shown to have distinct
      anti-cancer properties:<br>
      <br>
      "A variety of people were tested and it was found that the urine
      of cancer patients almost invariably contains a considerable
      amount of a natural immune defense substance named HUD (Human's
      Urine Derivative). HUD was clinically applied to an intractable
      case of metastatic (spreading) ovarian cancer in June, 1965 and we
      were very impressed with its excellent effect on regression of
      metastatic tumors."<br>
      <br>
      After the HUD treatment was applied the researchers noted that
      "Almost all metastases completely disappeared during a course of 3
      months after the start of HUD therapy, and the patient was
      discharged under a quite favorable condition. More than 30 months
      have passed since she was discharged and now she is completely
      well and enjoying the rest of her life."<br>
      <br>
      HUD therapy was also applied to several patients with gastric
      cancer after surgery in order to prevent the common post-surgical
      reoccurrence of the cancer:<br>
      <br>
      "8 patients were treated with HUD immediately after operation. In
      5 cases in this group, the cancer had invaded the stomach wall and
      involved the lymph nodes. The postoperative prognosis for this
      group of patients was very poor, and their 3-year survival rate
      was considered to less than 40 percent.<br>
      <br>
      However, following HUD treatments, 3 years passed and 7 out of the
      8 patients treated are completely well and participating in almost
      full activities without any signs of recurrence.<br>
      <br>
      In view of these facts it is apparent that HUD is effective in
      suppressing the post- operative recurrence of gastric cancer and
      that such effect may presumably be due to its ability to reinforce
      the immune system of the cancer patient."Your Own Perfect Medicine<br>
      <br>
      These researchers also commented on the danger and ineffectiveness
      of radiation and chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer:<br>
      <br>
      "Radiation therapy and anti-cancer chemotherapy have been
      extensively tested for many years to control postoperative
      spreading and growth of tumor cells, however, it may be fairly
      said that both measures have almost completely failed this purpose
      up to the present time."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers comment on the extreme importance of maintaining
      the integrity of the immune system in treating cancer and they
      discuss how radiation and chemo destroy the immunological defenses
      of the body, especially plasma cells which are involved in
      antibody production and natural resistance to cancer. The report
      recommends that:<br>
      <br>
      "Emphasis should be placed on discovering anti-cancer agents, such
      as HUD which exert an inhibitory effect on malignant cells without
      damaging the body's natural immune defenses."<br>
      <br>
      A reinforcement of this medical opinion on the ineffectiveness of
      chemotherapy is another study done in 1985 which was published in
      Scientific American and stated that:<br>
      <br>
      "Only 2 to 5 percent of cancer deaths are prevented by
      chemotherapeutic drugs, and their side effects are devastating." —
      Informed Consumers Pharmacy<br>
      <br>
      As research suggests, preserving and reinforcing the immune system
      during cancer treatment is critical. The researchers in this study
      on HUD noted that patients with inoperable, advanced cases of
      gastric cancer whose immune systems were severely damaged often
      did not improve after HUD therapy.<br>
      <br>
      But here again is an example of how natural urine therapy could
      been of more assistance than an isolated urine extract. The HUD
      extract is only one infinitesimal fraction out of hundreds of
      immune defense factors and other proven anti-cancer agents which
      whole urine contains.<br>
      <br>
      So these advanced cancer patients treated with HUD received only
      one single beneficial urine element when they could have been
      receiving the full range of benefits that whole urine has to
      offer. Perhaps, ideally, clinical treatments of cancer could
      incorporate natural urine therapy, augmented by the administration
      of concentrated urine extracts to enhance healing.<br>
      <br>
      Many cancer patients who have successfully used natural urine
      therapy to treat their cancer have reported it to be a safe and
      effective cancer treatment which rids the body of cancerous
      manifestations while at theThe same time greatly enhancing the
      immune system. But in consideration of all of the nutrients,
      enzymes, antibodies and other immune defense factors such as
      refine or HUD that urine contains, it's not surprising that it has
      been found by many to be such an effective cancer treatment.<br>

      <b>TITLE: ANTINEOPLASTON A IN CANCER THERAPY, 1977, by Stanislaw
        R. Burzynski et al</b>, published in Physiological Chemistry and
      Physics, a publication that reports fundamental new research in
      biochemistry and biophysics. Report #29<br>
      <br>
      This report is one of many published by Dr. Burzynski on
      anti-cancer agents which he discovered in human urine called
      "antineoplastons". In this and many succeeding laboratory and
      clinical studies on antineoplastons, Burzynski demonstrated
      remarkable success in treating various types of cancer with these
      urine extracts:<br>
      <br>
      "In recent years we were able to describe a number of peptide
      fractions [proteins], isolated from normal human urine, that
      produce remarkable inhibition of ..various neoplastic cells
      [cancer tumors] without showing significant inhibition in normal
      cells...In our experiments we chose normal human urine as the most
      economical source for the isolation of antineoplastons."<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski's work using antineoplastons in cancer treatment, which
      has been suppressed by the conventional medical establishment,
      brings up the huge issue of alternative cancer therapies. This is
      an enormous subject and not one which can be examined in great
      detail here without straying miles down the road from the subject
      of urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      But the fact is, that if you have cancer, you absolutely need to
      read the arguments against conventional treatments with radiation
      and chemotherapy — and there are many convincing ones, such as the
      last report on HUD in which medical researchers themselves
      discourage the use of toxic and generally ineffective accepted
      cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In 1979, Gary Null, a famous New York City talk show host and
      consumer advocate, published a series of excellent articles on the
      suppression of cancer cures in the U.S. One of the cancer
      treatments that has been suppressed involves the use of these
      antineoplastons that naturally occur in urine, discovered by Dr.
      Burzynski. Gary Null, interviewed Burzynski in October 1979 and
      revealed hidden facts on Antineoplaston A:<br>
      <br>
      "We can see how the cancer blackout works by looking at the case
      of a young Polish doctor named Stanislaw Burzynski. In the past
      few years, this doctor has published ten papers on the positive
      results of a substance called antineoplaston a on certain types of
      tumors. One of the youngest men in his native country to hold an
      M.D. and a Ph.D degree, Dr. Burzynski found life under communism
      difficult and decided to come to the United States to seek more
      freedom for his scientific research...<br>
      <br>
      Documented cases of spontaneous remission and prolonged cancer
      arrest in humans led Dr. Burzynski to consider how the body might
      fight cancer on its own. The body must have some way, he thought,
      to correct errors that occur in cellular differentiation and to
      redirect potential cancer cells into normal paths. The theory is,
      of course, that cancer cells have lost the 'information' needed to
      develop into differentiated body- organ cells.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski's antineoplaston a allegedly supplies that 'information'
      in the form of a protein peptide, (a chain of amino acids) – one
      of the best biological information carriers – that would reprogram
      cancer cells into normal growth.<br>
      <br>
      Although antineoplastons are found in all normal body tissues and
      fluids, THEY ARE MOST EASILY EXTRACTED FROM URINE (my caps). They
      appear to "normalize" cancer cells without inhibiting the growth
      of normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, urine therapy has been used as folk remedy for cancer
      and other ailments for over 2,000 years. Even within the past 30
      years, at least 45,000 injections of urine or urine extract were
      given in the United States and throughout Europe without any toxic
      side effects."<br>
      <br>
      In reality, unknown to Gary Null and most of us, there have been
      several hundred thousand oral administrations and injections of
      urine and urea given by doctors and researchers over the last 30
      years. Null continues:<br>
      <br>
      "In our search for antineoplastons, says Burzynski, 'we were able
      to find peptides in normal human urine...that were active against
      every type of human neoplasm (tumor) we tested, including
      myeloblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,
      cancer of the uterine cervix, colon cancer, breast cancer, and
      lymphoma.'.. research, and his superiors discouraged his pursuit
      of cancer therapy."<br>
      <br>
      The article continues with details of the extraordinary results of
      Burzynski's treatment in one particular case:<br>
      <br>
      "Working for the past two years in the relative freedom of his own
      lab, Dr. Burzynski has amassed some impressive results. For
      example, there was the case of a 63-year old white male with lung
      cancer that had spread to the brain. Before coming to Dr.
      Burzynski, the patient had received chemotherapy and cobalt
      treatment, whereby a part of the brain tumor had been reduced.
      However, a new tumor had sprung up in another part of his brain,
      and doctors decided that nothing more could be done. Undaunted,
      the patient's family searched out Dr. Burzynski, who examined the
      patient and cautiously agreed to help. After just two weeks of the
      antineoplaston treatment, in which the patient was given the
      substance intravenously, the tumor on the left lung decreased
      substantially. After six weeks it disappeared entirely. After a
      month both brain metastases decreased in size and, in six weeks,
      also disappeared. Amazingly, the only side effects of this highly
      effective treatment were chills and fever. These were attributed
      to the release of toxic products into the bloodstream after the
      breakdown of cancer cells. Contrast this with the deleterious
      effects of conventional therapy, which in this patient's case had
      increased the metastasis..."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Burzynski still uses his treatment successfully in his lab in
      Houston today, although he is continually assaulted by the medical
      society in Houston and has been refused research grants from the
      American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute — even
      though his findings on the anticancer properties of antineoplaston
      A have been confirmed in tests by prestigious research centers all
      over the U.S. on leukemia and other types of cancer, including
      breast cancer. Urine extracts such as H-11, refine, HUD and
      antineoplastons, as the research has demonstrated, gave excellent
      results in treating cancer patients, but, again, these anti-cancer
      elements are already available in natural urine and can be simply,
      safely and easily accessed, whereas accessing urine extract
      treatments can be difficult and extremely expensive — and<br>
      <br>
      I know this from my own experience. After several unsuccessful
      surgeries for endometriosis, I was told that Iwould need more
      surgery. After my doctor told me that he was scheduling another
      operation for me, I canceled the surgery and flew to Mexico to get
      an alternative treatment for cancer patients that I was told also
      had possibilities for treating my case.<br>
      <br>
      The cancer clinics in Mexico reminded me of something out of
      Sartre – shaven-headed terminal cancer patients lined up by the
      dozens with IV tubes dangling from their arms, some of them with
      huge, ulcerated, open cancerous lesions oozing blood. The man in
      the bed next to mine had a cancerous brain tumor the size of a
      large grapefruit bulging from his head. One of his eyes, nearly
      eaten away by the cancer, was now just a mass of bloody,
      unrecognizable tissue.<br>
      <br>
      But as I soon discovered, the people in the clinic were the
      "lucky" ones. As I sat listlessly in my chair with my IV tube
      pumping a $10,000.00 course of "immune builders" into my body, I
      watched as a steady procession of cancer patients came through the
      clinic, asking for information on other less expensive cancer
      treatments because they couldn't afford the fees for the
      alternative clinics. The stories, most of which I could overhear,
      were all the same – these cancer victims had gone through months
      or years of radiation and chemo, the cancer was back, and now they
      were dying; they'd turned to natural medicine as a last resort,
      but couldn't afford the $10,000 to $50,000 that the alternative
      clinics charged. These were hopeless, desperate people, many of
      them only in their twenties and thirties – but what could they do?
      Conventional medicine hadn't worked, they had no knowledge about
      natural therapies, no idea about how to help themselves – it was a
      scenario of gruesome and devastating personal ordeals that the
      American Cancer Society and the AMA never reveal.<br>
      <br>
      And these people are not in the minority. It has been reported
      that:<br>
      <br>
      "Nearly two-thirds of all cancer patients will eventually die of
      their diagnosed cancer, either before or after the arbitrary
      five-year limit."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Betrayal of Health</b><br>
      <br>
      It's always bothered me that I didn't know about urine therapy at
      that time, because I saw so many people who could have benefitted
      so much from it. A young girl came into the clinic alone one day,
      and I happened to talk to her. She was twenty-four and had been
      diagnosed with ovarian cancer which had not responded to
      aggressive surgery, radiation and chemo, and her doctors said
      there was nothing more they could do for her. Her parents couldn't
      help her financially, she wasn't married, couldn't work, and had
      no money of her own, so she was unable to pay for alternative
      treatments like the one I was receiving. She told me that in
      desperation she had gotten into her car and driven from her home
      in the Midwest to Mexico in hopes of finding some help. She asked
      me if I knew of any place that she could buy laetrile — she
      thought that perhaps she could treat herself with it, but I was
      unable to help her.<br>
      <br>
      The bleak look of hopeless despair on her face was horrifying, and
      I would have loved to have been able to hand her a book on urine
      therapy — it was something she could have used herself, for free,
      in her own home, that undoubtedly would have given her control
      over her health and, at the very least, an excellent fighting
      chance. After all, she had everything to gain and nothing to lose
      by using this safe, proven natural therapy. The urine therapist of
      the 1930's and 40's, John Armstrong, recounts many stories of
      curing cancer with urine fasts, massages and compresses:<br>
      <br>
      "And now I will mention the case of a lady who came to me in 1927.
      It is instructive as showing once again that operations merely
      deal with effects and do not remove the cause of the disease from
      the body. The lady in question was 45, and had a growth of some
      size in her left breast, the right one having been removed two
      years previously for a similar growth.<br>
      <br>
      She fasted and was treated according to my method for nineteen
      days, and then reported that the growth had entirely vanished...On
      the 28th day, there was no trace of the lump...<br>
      <br>
      Lady of 62; diagnosed cancer of the bowel. Colostomy advised by
      the profession but refused...after urine therapy, complete cure.<br>
      <br>
      Lady of 42, diagnosed cancer of the breast. Excision advised...but
      only faint hope of cure...Patient refused operation. Complete cure
      by the fasting-urine method. Is still alive and well after 21
      years."<br>
      <br>
      Naturally Armstrong's experiences, having no scientific support,
      were completely ignored by the medical establishment. But it's
      interesting to discover that medical research later revealed
      significant anti-cancer elements in urine that are extremely
      effective in treating and healing a wide variety of cancers. This
      modem scientific evidence provides corroboration to Armstrong's
      experiences, illustrating that his cures were much more than
      figments of his imagination. Cancer is a frightening disease, but
      with the assiduous and wise use of natural healing methods such as
      urine therapy, proper nutrition, herbs, rest, homeopathic
      remedies, etc., many have controlled and cured their cancer
      without resorting to methods which damage the immune system such
      as chemotherapy or radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Before you resort to any conventional cancer treatment, go to your
      local library and research your case by reading material related
      to different treatment options. It's crucial to find out the real
      success statistics on conventional treatments – don't just blindly
      accept your oncologist's recommendations.<br>
      <br>
      I have a dose relative who learned this lesson the hard way. After
      surgery for colon cancer, she called me and said that her
      oncologist wanted her to take a follow-up course of chemotherapy,
      "just in case", even though the surgery had taken out all existing
      non-metastasized tumors. I told her what I had read about the
      extreme side effects, dangers and inadequacy of chemo, but under
      pressure from her oncologist, she took the "treatment".<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, she had a severe allergic reaction to the
      chemicals, nearly died and spent several totally unnecessary and
      horribly painful weeks in the hospital recovering from the
      extremely harmful effects of the chemotherapy, some of which were
      irreversible. The use of chemotherapy and radiation is so damaging
      and traumatic to the body and it's success rate is so low that
      it's difficult to understand why anyone would resort to it once
      they are made aware of the truth of its danger and inadequacy
      without first trying aggressive urine therapy and other forms of
      natural healing. Many doctors themselves are acutely aware of the
      futility and danger of the conventional cancer treatments:<br>
      <br>
      "In 1955, the late Dr. Hardin Jones, professor of medical physics
      at the University of California, after studying cancer statistics
      for the previous thirty- three years, concluded that untreated
      cancer victims lived up to four times longer than treated
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jones pointed out that the cure rates most often cited by
      doctors were (and continue to be) based only on the conventional
      treatment of the most favorable cases. If the less 'curable' cases
      were figured in,The Research conventional therapies would emerge
      as having little, no, or even aggravating impact on cancer
      patients overall."<br>
      <br>
      A recent article in Forbes Magazine in June of 1993 entitled "An
      Educated Consumer is the best patient", describes a woman, Janice
      Guthrie, who was diagnosed with a rare type of ovarian cancer
      (granulosa cell tumor). She had emergency surgery, and, to her
      consternation, her oncologist recommended radiation therapy as a
      follow-up:<br>
      <br>
      "To regain some control of her life, Guthrie went straight to the
      University of Arkansas medical school library in Little Rock. 'I
      wanted to see what was involved in my treatment,' she says, and to
      try to counteract any of the negative side effects.' But in the
      course of her reading, Guthrie discovered that radiation therapy
      didn't keep granulosa patients alive any longer than those who
      opted for regular checkups after surgery. Guthrie's oncologist
      didn't think much of her research. 'You can know too much,' he
      warned. Recalls Guthrie, 'It really made me mad'.<br>
      <br>
      In the end, Guthrie ignored her oncologist and through her
      research, found a doctor at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
      Houston who successfully helped her condition without radiation.
      So become an educated consumer about your cancer, and above all,
      vigorously support your body's own natural defenses with excellent
      nutrition, rest, relaxation and assiduous, educated use of natural
      healing methods like herbs, homeopathy, and of course urine
      therapy<br>
      <br>
      The body has amazing curative powers of its own, and if we would
      simply support our natural healing powers rather than beating them
      down with toxic chemical interventions and poor health habits, our
      ability to overcome cancer would be greatly increased and the
      unnecessary suffering associated with accepted cancer treatments
      would be eradicated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #30 TITLE: DHEA: "MIRACLE" DRUG? </b>1982, by Saul
      Kent, published in Geriatrics, September, 1982. SUBJECT: AIDS,
      OBESITY, CANCER, AGING<br>
      <br>
      This report deals with a substance which is found in large
      quantities in the urine called dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA to
      us. DHEA is a hormone that is already present in the body, and is
      actually related to testosterone, a male hormone.<br>
      <br>
      Within the last decade, scientists have been analyzing and
      experimenting with this hormone because it apparently has
      significant anti-cancer, anti-obesity and anti-aging properties
      and has even been used in AIDS treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As Dr. Kent comments, DHEA has been found by researchers to have
      several different biologic actions in animal studies:<br>
      <br>
      "DHEA was added to a culture medium containing two potent chemical
      carcinogens. It was discovered that DHEA was remarkably successful
      in protecting cultured rodent cells against the cancer-causing
      agents that were added to the cells."<br>
      <br>
      While studying the anti-cancer effects of DHEA, another
      researcher, Dr. Schwartz also reported that the experimental
      animals gained much less weight as they grew older than normal
      animals:<br>
      <br>
      "Apparently, DHEA was keeping body weight down without suppressing
      appetite or restricting food intake...In one study Lit was] found
      that DHEA could even prevent weight increase in mice genetically
      bred to become obese in adulthood."<br>
      <br>
      Further research also revealed that mice treated with DHEA had a
      much younger appearance, showing much less coarsening and graying
      of the hair than animals not receiving DHEA:<br>
      <br>
      "This suggests that DHEA may have an anti-aging effect as well as
      anti-cancer and anti-obesity effects."<br>
      <br>
      Users of urine therapy have reported for years that they weighed
      less and looked remarkably younger after consistent use of urine
      therapy, so it's interesting to read these studies on DHEA in
      urine which most likely also plays a role in urine therapy's
      excellent success in treating cancer, obesity and aging.<br>
      <br>
      Another important thing that was brought out in this report is
      that studies have shown that women with breast cancer have
      lower-than - normal levels of DHEA, sometimes for years before
      they even develop the cancer. So it certainly makes sense to
      supplement DHEA in the body, which you can do easily, safely and
      at no cost with urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Uric acid, which was mentioned previously, has also been
      discovered to destroy free radicals which are thought to
      contribute to the development of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY ON CANCER AND URINE THERAPY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Not only does urine contain innumerable easily assimilable
      nutrients, hormones, enzymes, anti-bacterial agents and antibodies
      that help support the immune system during cancer, but urine also
      contains proven anti-cancer agents such as:<br>
      <br>
      • Human Urine's Derivative (HUD)<br>
      • H-11 Extract<br>
      • Refine<br>
      • Antineoplastons<br>
      • DHEA Hormone<br>
      • Uric Acid<br>
      <br>
      Urine therapy is obviously an excellent natural cancer treatment.
      Its nutritional benefits alone are phenomenal, not to mention the
      immense value of its innumerable other health-promoting,
      therapeutic agents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETECTING CANCER THROUGH URINE TESTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another important thing to consider in terms of cancer diagnosis
      is the fact that research has shown that certain components of
      urine sediment can be of great importance in identifying bladder,
      kidney and prostrate malignancies. In 1975, it was reported that
      urine studies are done on all urology patients at the Mayo Clinic
      to help detect cancer:<br>
      <br>
      "Cancer cells from early-stage urinary system tumors appear in the
      urine, which allows for detection of such new tumors before they
      are readily perceived by other diagnostic methods.Your Own Perfect
      Medicine Cells of urine sediment have been used in the same way
      that vaginal smears have been used to gain information on ovarian
      functioning. As a matter of fact, it was reported in 1971 that
      urine testing was actually shown to detect more cases of abnormal
      cell activity than the usual cervical Pap smear.<br>
      <br>
      Urine testing for urinary tract malignancies is a safe, easy
      procedure which can replace or supplement other forms of cancer
      detection." -- Urinalysis in Clinical Laboratory Practice<br>
      <br>
      This type of diagnosis is so important today because, as many
      doctors and patients are finding, cancer patients can actually be
      harmed by the diagnostic tests themselves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #31 -- URINE THERAPY AND AIDS Report #31 RESEARCH
        INDICATIONS FOR AIDS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As we've seen, DHEA, which is present in large amounts in urine
      has many diverse health applications and has also been reported as
      an AIDS treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The January, 1988 publication of Aids Treatment News, had an
      excellent article on the use of DHEA in AIDS. The article stated
      that Researchers suspect that AIDS patients have abnormally low
      levels of DHEA. Additionally, it is now believed that DHEA itself
      may have a direct anti-viral effect.<br>
      <br>
      With urine therapy, AIDS patients have easy, unlimited access to
      DHEA, which reportedly has been forced from the consumer market by
      the FDA for no apparent reason.<br>
      <br>
      Raising DHEA levels in the body through intemal urine therapy
      certainly is a safe, simple procedure that both cancer and AIDS
      patients can undoubtedly benefit from. But DHEA is only one of, as
      we have seen, many hundreds of vitally important immune boosting
      and health supporting elements in urine.<br>
      <br>
      Because of urine (and urea's) remarkable anti-viral properties,
      and its extraordinary capacity to heal and strengthen the immune
      system, it's obviously an immensely significant natural treatment
      for AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, urine therapy in treating AIDS has already been in the
      news, although it's still not widely known or accepted because, up
      until now, the scientific evidence and proof supporting the
      efficacy of urine therapy has never been compiled and publicly
      presented.<br>
      <br>
      An article done on AIDS treatments in 1988 in the magazine, SPIN,
      discusses the use of urine therapy in AIDS:<br>
      <br>
      "One of the latest and most interesting treatments for which the
      alternative community is holding a lot of hope is probably the
      oldest natural remedy known to man. It's called urine therapy and
      consists of drinking one's own urine and rubbing one's entire body
      with it... The idea of drinking urine for medicinal purposes
      certainly takes some getting used to, but consider the facts about
      urine...<br>
      <br>
      'Urine therapy has been around for a long time...' said one NYC
      private practitioner who supports the therapy...When you have
      something that works, that's been around for a long time, even
      though it doesn't fit into any of the 'scientific' approaches, and
      there are many things that don't, I would say try it...if I had
      AIDS I would definitely try it.'"<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, urine therapy is one of the most scientifically
      corroborated of all natural therapies, and has been a scientific
      healing approach used for almost a century by mainstream medical
      researchers.<br>
      <br>
      The article goes on to describe the case of one AIDS patient who
      reportedly had excellent results with urine therapy:<br>
      <br>
      "Quique Palladino was diagnosed with AIDS, Kaposi's Sarcoma (a
      type of cancer common to AIDS patients), and numerous infections
      last year. Today, he claims to have gone into complete remission
      thanks to urine therapy. 'At first I just laughed and made jokes,
      he says...but they said that you could start by applying it
      topically...'<br>
      <br>
      'I had a terrible case of athlete's foot/ringworm that nothing
      seemed to work for. I started applying urine to it. After three
      days, the infection was completely gone. After that I was, so
      convinced that I didn't mind drinking it.'<br>
      <br>
      'All my KS (cancer) lesions are [now] gone. The mouth ulcers that
      used to plague me have not returned. I used to have monthly
      outbreaks of genital herpes, but that's gone too. And even more
      importantly, my T-cell count has gone up.<br>
      <br>
      The article continues:<br>
      <br>
      "More and more people are trying urine therapy now and they're
      reporting amazing results,' says Gene Ledorko, president of H.F.A.
      (Health, Education, AIDS Liaison), a group that meets weekly in
      New York City to discuss alternative and often holistic therapies
      for AIDS." There's also another extremely important recent medical
      discovery regarding urine and AIDS:<br>
      <br>
      Bay Area Reporter, August 9, 1990 :"Thanks to the research of Dr.
      Alvin Friedman-Kien and his staff at the New York University
      Medical Center it was discovered in 1988 that the antibodies to
      HIV-1 appear in the urine of patients diagnosed with AIDS:<br>
      <br>
      _According to the involved researchers 'urine is not considered
      infectious because it has not been shown to contain the virus,
      only the antibodies'. Blood often contains the HIV-1 and other
      potentially infectious agents such as hepatitis B.<br>
      <br>
      Urine is a 'sterile' fluid that is not found to contain viruses
      such as HIV-I or hepatitis B except in individuals who may have an
      underlying kidney disease.—<br>
      <br>
      A recent article in a doctors' journal that emphasizes natural
      medical treatments revealed that Dr. S. Burzynski, who discovered
      the naturally occurring anti-cancer urine proteins called
      antineoplastons, is now conducting FDA-approved research on the
      use of urinary antineoplastons in treating AIDS:<br>
      <br>
      "According to Dr. Burzynski's research, antineoplastons are
      naturally occurring peptides and amino acid derivatives which are
      components of a biochemical defense system which parallels our
      immune system and protects us by reprogramming, or normalizing
      defective cells that may lead to disorders such as cancer, AIDS,
      autoimmune diseases, benign tumors, etc." Townsend Letter For
      Doctors June, 1993<br>
      <br>
      During allergy research studies (see following section on
      allergies), in using natural urine therapy for allergy patients,
      it was also noted that urine:r<br>
      <br>
      "...greatly increased immune response, noticeably affecting and
      increasing the T- cell population and the body's resistance to
      viral infections." Physician's Handbook on Immuno-Tolerance This
      same research report also revealed that:<br>
      <br>
      "There seems to be an enhanced response or stimulation of the
      immune system, mostly of the T-cell population (with the use of
      urine therapy]. While under treatment, patients reported an
      absence of viral diseases (flu, colds, etc.), or greatly decreased
      symptoms. On a few patients who exhibited low T-cell counts, the
      T-cell population was restored to normal after finishing their
      treatment..." hi the studies that have been presented so far,
      we've seen that many doctors and researchers using natural urine
      therapy have produced amazing cures for a wide variety of viral
      and bacterial illnesses, all of which is significant for AIDS
      patients.<br>

      <b>URINE THERAPY AND ALLERGIES</b><br>
      <br>
      The field of allergy research is so huge and so complicated that
      the average person, let alone allergy researchers, fmd it
      difficult to understand it all. But one thing we do all know about
      allergies is that now almost everyone has one – or more.
      Scientists don't really know for certain just what exactly is the
      mechanism in the body that is responsible for allergic reactions,
      but they do know that for some reason, an allergy sufferer's
      immune system begins to identify ordinarily harmless substances as
      harmful.<br>
      <br>
      All of us know that our body produces white blood cells that
      search out and destroy harmful bacteria or viruses in the body,
      but in the case of most allergies, for some reason, the white
      blood cells attack substances that may be no threat to the body at
      all. Like plant pollen, for instance. Pollen is a natural, vital
      substance in our environment which we normally breathe in with no
      problem. No problem, that is, for some people – but a big one for
      those whose immune systems identify it as a foreign and
      health-threatening substance; then the sneezing, sinus congestion
      and headaches, etc. of the "common" allergy attack begins. <br>
      <br>
      We all eat foods like breads and grains because we know from
      centuries of experience that they're good for us. But in reality,
      more and more people today are discovering that foods that are
      great for everyone else produce often violent, negative reactions
      in their bodies. So why does a person's immune system identify
      historically harmless substances as enemies? No one knows the
      answer to that, but what scientists do know is that when the
      immune system does identify a substance as a threatening foreign
      protein in the body, it sends out specific white blood cells (T
      and B lymphocytes) to attack it. The "B" cells search out,
      identify and actually bind with the foreign protein (called an
      allergen or antigen), while the "T" cells rapidly divide,
      producing antibodies and large numbers of new T cells that will
      also be programmed to attack this antigen. Both the T and B cells
      actually have the ability to 'remember' this antigen, or foreign
      protein, and will attack it again when and if it reappears. In
      immunology, which is the study of immune system functions, this
      allergic response is referred to as the antigen-antibody conflict.<br>
      <br>
      This is one reason why we have allergic reactions to the same
      substance over and over again – because our body has been
      programmed to attack even an ordinarily harmless substance, as
      though it's a threat to the body This allergic reaction may
      sometimes be controlled by just eliminating the foods or cat hair,
      or soap, etc. that you're allergic to, but sometimes it's not that
      simple.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes it's impossible to avoid what we're allergic to and,
      even worse, a person's immune system can further malfunction and
      actually begin to attack the body's own internal cells, resulting
      in what are called autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid
      arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      These auto-immune diseases are, of course, damaging to the body
      and in some cases can even be life-threatening. Modern medicine
      has no cure for allergies and autoimmune diseases. And what is
      more disconcerting, allergies and related disorders are becoming
      more and more prevalent in our industrialized societies.
      Researchers and doctors who deal with allergies, called
      immunologists, largely believe that allergies are essentially
      induced by unidentified weaknesses or alterations in the immune
      system. When the immune system is weakened or impaired, its
      ability to distinguish between harmless and harmful substances
      also becomes impaired. So your white blood cells, whose work it is
      to search out and destroy harmful proteins in the body, may begin
      to attack even ordinarily beneficial or benign proteins such as
      those that come from normal foods.<br>
      <br>
      Immunologists also speculate that because our bodies are now
      exposed to enormous numbers of new chemical substances in our
      modem industrialized societies, that the immune system can become
      overwhelmed in its efforts to identify and deal with each new
      substance:<br>
      <br>
      "It has been estimated that in the industrialized countries, man
      comes in contact with 150,000 man-made substances; pesticides,
      plastics, chemicals, etc., and that every year 5,000 new ones are
      manufactured. Is it any wonder then, that the immune system is
      hard-pressed to cope with this tremendous amount of 'foreign
      substances'?" It is all too possible that in the coming years,
      100% of the population of the United States will suffer, to a
      lesser or greater degree, from some form of allergy or
      intolerance." Immuno-Tolerance Physician's Handbook, 1982<br>
      <br>
      Conventional doctors offer allergy sufferers decongestants,
      antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, etc.,
      but the problem with these treatments is that they suppress or
      interfere with the optimal functioning of our immune systems,
      further weakening them and making us even more susceptible to
      disease and allergic reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Many people with simple or severe allergies get extremely
      discouraged because they spend a fortune going from doctor to
      doctor without getting results. Not only do they not get rid of
      the allergic symptoms, but in many cases, they can't even find out
      what they're allergic to because our current diagnostic methods
      for allergies are crude and ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      Identifying the specific antigen that a person is reacting to is a
      huge headache for doctors and their patients. And even if the
      allergy is identified, there's still no effective conventional
      treatment for it.<br>
      <br>
      This is where urine therapy comes in. Researchers have discovered
      that urine contains specific anti-allergen antibodies that are
      manufactured by the body itself and that when re-introduced back
      into the body through urine therapy, the allergic response is
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      Also, with urine therapy, there is less need to identify all the
      different things that you may be reacting to because the body will
      identify the allergens and will produce an antibody to correct the
      body's improper immune response that produced the allergy in the
      first place.<br>
      <br>
      In extensive clinical testing with urine therapy on allergy
      patients, both in Europe and the U.S., allergy researchers and
      physicians noted incredible and often dramatic, rapid
      improvements, and also observed that urine is effective on an
      extremely wide range of food and chemical sensitivities. The
      following reports demonstrate the seriousness with which urine
      therapy has recently been utilized in the field of allergy
      treatment and research. As medical researchers have discovered,
      allergic responses are caused by "renegade" white blood cells that
      inappropriately attack substances even when they may be no threat
      to the body. So it is the activity of these renegade white blood
      cells, called antigen receptors, that needs to he corrected in
      order to cure the allergy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Report #32 TITLE SPECIFIC IMMUNOLOGIC UNRESPONSIVENESS, 1982,
        by Dr. William D. Linscott, PhD,</b> (published in Basic and
      Clinical Immunology).<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Linscott's studies showed that when these antigen receptors
      (or renegade white blood cells), were re-introduced into the body,
      the body actually developed antibodies to these antigen receptors,
      and the antibodies then stopped the allergic response:<br>
      <br>
      "These antigen receptors are found in low concentrations in urine.
      By injecting the receptors, it has been possible to induce
      antibody against the antigen receptors which can then limit or
      even abort an ongoing allergic response. These antibodies may in
      fact be an important regulator of the immune response."<br>
      <br>
      Linscott's study was one of the important works on which recent
      investigations into the use of urine in allergy treatments was
      based, because it gave allergists the clue as to how the body can
      be naturally stimulated to internally correct allergic reactions.
      Realizing that the urine of allergic individuals contains the
      allergy-causing white blood cells, allergy researchers, as in the
      next report, reasoned that by giving allergic individuals their
      own urine internally, their bodies would develop antibodies to the
      renegade white blood cells contained in the urine which would then
      stop the allergic response.<br>
      <br>
      When urine therapy was administered during clinical allergy
      treatments, it produced excellent and often incredible results, as
      you'll see in the following reports.The Research Evidence and Case
      Studies<br>

      </b><b>Report #33 -- TITLE: THE USE OF INJECTED AND SUBLINGUAL
        URINE IN THE TREATMENT OF ALLERGIES, 1981, by Dr. Nancy Dunne.</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nancy Dunne was medical advisor to the Irish Allergy Treatment
      and Research Association, founder of the Irish Orthomolecular
      Medical Association and a member of several allergy research
      societies:<br>
      <br>
      "A simple technique for treating allergies — Auto-Immune Urine
      Therapy (A.I.U.) is rapidly gaining recognition in the United
      States and may well prove to be the method of the future. The
      rationale behind it is that by re-cycling the patient's urine, the
      protein globulins of which contain specific antibodies to
      allergens currently producing reactions, immunity from the
      antigen-antibody conflict (allergic reaction) is brought about.<br>
      <br>
      I first learned of the method from Dr. William Fife (of
      California), while studying psychiatric developments in the U.S.
      in 1979. Dr. Fife, a neuropsychiatrist for 40 years had, some
      years previously, been forced to resign from his practice through
      ill health. Extensive investigations showed no disease. By chance
      he heard of A.LU. therapy and following this treatment, enjoyed
      health and vigor he had not experienced for many years. He resumed
      full-time practice and now employs the same technique on his
      patients.<br>
      <br>
      The main attraction of A.L U. is that it eliminates the need to
      identify specific allergens — instead it makes use of the body's
      own identification system which is infallible for each individual.
      No sophisticated equipment is needed and the method, which is
      uncomplicated and safe, can be learned quickly. In addition, after
      treatment the patient is free to eat and drink without developing
      symptoms. These factors bring A.I.U. therapy within the reach of
      the average busy general practitioner who has not the time for
      detailed study of the varied diagnostic and therapeutic techniques
      used in this area of clinical ecology...<br>
      <br>
      Injections are normally given once weekly. The number of
      treatments required to render a patient asymptomatic varies with
      the individual...In a series of clinical trials by Dr. Fife and
      his co-workers, A.I.U. therapy provided clinical relief lasting
      many years without further treatment in over 80% of cases.
      Statistics from his clinic showYour Own Perfect Medicine 92.6% of
      patients had more than 50% relief, while the average reported by
      patients themselves was 70%...<br>
      <br>
      In the process of treating psychiatric patients, Dr. Fife found
      many apparent physical illnesses co-incidentally relieved, such as
      multiple sclerosis, colitis, hypertension, lupus erythematosus,
      rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, hyper-activity, pancreatic
      insufficiency, psoriasis and eczema, diabetes, herpes zoster,
      mononucleosis and so on...<br>
      <br>
      Serious adverse reactions to urine injection therapy are
      unknown—in over 100,000 treatments, Dr. Fife has not had one.<br>
      <br>
      Minor reactions are limited to occasional resurgence of familiar
      allergic symptoms or slight temporary malaise...<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after my own experience, I mod d the technique to treat a
      5- year-old hyperactive asthmatic male...eczema which covered the
      entire skin surface was present from birth. His face and scalp
      exuded yellow fluid, his eyelids drooped permanently and his nails
      blackened and felloff<br>
      <br>
      Patches of secondary infection from scratching produced frequent
      bouts of fever and adenitis (an inflammatory condition of a lymph
      node or gland). He could not use his hands which were semi-closed
      crusted claws and his whole appearance was revolting. When kept in
      one position for any length of time he stiffened and was unable to
      walk. He had constant earaches and fits of hysteria...Specialists,
      hospitalizations and even forms of alternative medicine failed to
      give any relief. He was on regular antihistamines and sedatives
      and had many courses of antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      I instructed his mother to collect his midstream urine at the
      height of exacerbation of symptoms and, using an eye dropper,
      place 3 drops of urine under his tongue four times daily. The
      first time she used it he was having a screaming fit which usually
      lasted half-an- hour — within one minute this subsided and he
      relaxed totally.<br>
      <br>
      By the fourth day, there was noticeable discharge of viscous
      matter from the eczematous surface with the development of red
      spots everywhere. He also began each day sneezing and coughing
      with flowing mucous. His mother became alarmed at the copious
      discharge but was persuaded to persist, while at the same time
      tapering off all medication. By the sixth day the red spots
      changed to white, clear patches of skin were appearing, his
      eyelids no longer drooped and he was sleeping 4 hours nightly at a
      stretch. After 2 weeks, he was off all medication, able to use his
      hands and walk freely, and no longer developed asthmatic attacks
      near grass or neighbor's pets.<br>
      <br>
      I increased his drops to six q.i.d. and he began to pass a much
      greater volume of urine daily with heavy whitish sediment. His
      hair darkened, healthy nails began developing and adults remarked
      on how placid he had become with his peers...two months later, his
      hyperactivity, hysteria, etc. were gone; he was sleeping soundly
      at night for the first time since birth — and apart from two small
      dry areas behind the knees, his skin was completely clear, and he
      was asymptomatic...<br>
      <br>
      Auto-Immune Urine Therapy has much to offer compared to other
      alternate treatments. Tedious identification of all possible
      antigens (allergens) is not necessary. Equipment is minimal.
      Urine, being sterile, needs no preservatives. It is safe as
      [weakening] of the allergens] by the body eliminates the risk of
      anaphylactic shock...Drugs and chemicals — possible causes of side
      effects in sensitive patients — are not needed."<br>

      #34 the International Immunology Institute, Canoga Park,

      This report is an extremely comprehensive and thoroughly detailed
      investigation into historical and current uses of urine therapy in
      treating allergies:<br>
      <br>
      "The application, ingestion and injection of urine has been in
      existence for at least 4,000 years. It seemingly dies, only to
      reappear again, time after time. While other 'fad' or 'quack'
      treatments have disappeared, urine treatment has remained..."<br>
      <br>
      The report goes on to mention several substantial clinical trials
      using urine therapy with excellent results. Researchers noted that
      urine injections not only provided a large measure of relief from
      allergic symptoms, but also seemed to boost the immune system:<br>
      <br>
      "There seems to be an enhanced response or stimulation of the
      immune system, mostly of the T-cell population [with the use of
      urine therapy]. While under treatment, patients reported an
      absence of viral diseases (flu, colds, etc.). or greatly decreased
      symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Young children, especially, seem resistant to colds (while under
      treatment), while their sisters and brothers (not receiving urine
      therapy) suffer from the usual repeated viral infections.
      Asthmatic patients with repeated sino-pulmonary infections report
      a remarkable decrease or absence of such repeated infections. <br>
      <br>
      On a few patients who exhibited low T-cell counts, the T-cell
      population was restored to normal after finishing their treatThis
      information is not only important for allergy sufferers, but, as
      mentioned, to AIDS patients as well, in that this disease is
      characterized by abnormally low T-cell counts that contribute to
      immune dysfunction.<br>

      <b>Report #38 TITLE: AUTO-IMMUNE THERAPY AGAINST HUMAN ALLERGIC
        DISEASE: A PHYSIOLOGICAL SELF DEFENCE FACTOR, </b>1983, by
      C.W.M. Wilson and A. Lewis. Department of Geriatric Medicine, Law
      Hospital, Carluke, Scotland.<br>
      <br>
      Wilson and Lewis, drawing on previous allergy research, and after
      their own extensive experimentation with the use of urine therapy
      in animals as a natural treatment for allergies, undertook the
      following research study on humans to determine the efficacy and
      correct dosage of urine in treating allergies. Wilson and Lewis
      referred to urine therapy as Auto-Immune Buccal Urine Therapy
      (AIBUT). Buccal therapy is the oral administration of a medicine
      in which the substance is placed or held between the cheek and
      teeth or gurus.<br>
      <br>
      This research report stated that:<br>
      <br>
      "It has been demonstrated that specific antibodies are secreted
      into the wall of the urinary tract. These findings indicate that
      allergens are secreted into the urine and that a subsequent
      antigen-antibody reaction is responsible for production of
      patients' allergic symptoms. In these circumstances it would be
      anticipated that administration of a patient's urine would prevent
      development of specific reactions caused by the range of allergens
      to which the patient is sensitive... A pilot investigation has
      been carried out in twenty-five patients in order to discover an
      effective method of administration of urine, and toThe establish
      whether its therapeutic administration can alleviate allergic
      symptoms...<br>
      <br>
      It was rapidly appreciated that undiluted urine was
      therapeutically effective for carrying out Auto-Immune Buccal
      Urine Therapy (AIBUT) in human beings. AIBUT was initiated at
      times when it became obvious that the allergic condition had
      become uncontrollable, often in association with concurrent
      increased concentrations of extrinsic antigens in the air, such as
      pollens, molds, water particles in association with urban
      pollution, or increase in house dust or organic fumes associated
      with increase in central heating, house cleaning or painting...
      AIBUT is performed by sub-lingual administration of pure urine.
      Use of diluted urine may produce incomplete symptom relief or
      actual potentiation of symptoms...The urine is obtained and
      administered prior to the principal meals against which it is
      providing protection... Symptoms from which the patient suffered
      prior to urine administration were noted.<br>
      <br>
      The neutralizing dose is indicated when sensations of taste and
      temperature of the administered urine are no longer detected. The
      phenomenon of taste has been shown to be based on an immune
      reaction...<br>
      <br>
      During the process of administration of AIBLIT, allergic symptoms
      initially increase and then diminish as the sensation of taste and
      temperature alter and intensify and then disappear following
      repeated sublingual application of the urine drops...<br>
      <br>
      The total number of drops administered constitutes the
      neutralizing dose. This dose should be administered before meals
      using urine collected since the preceding meal. The neutralizing
      dose is measured by the patient in terms of number of drops...It
      is administered with the aid of a mirror. The last 4 drops are
      administered separately in order to confirm by the absence of
      taste and temperature that the neutralizing dose is being taken.
      (We conclude that] AIBUT is capable of controlling a wide range of
      food, extrinsic and chemical sensitivities."<br>
      <br>
      After completing this clinical study, Wilson conducted additional
      research in 1984 on the use of urine in allergy treatment, and
      again concluded that it was an effective and highly desirable
      allergy treatment:<br>
      <br>
      "The major advantage of AIBUT over other forms of anti-allergic
      therapy is that the allergic patient manufactures and uses his own
      urine for his own therapy...<br>
      <br>
      From a therapeutic aspect, AIBUT has advantages over other
      treatments such as dramatic restriction of allergenic foods, by
      food immunotherapy and by food neutralization.<br>
      <br>
      It is effective, it costs nothing and is easy to administer. The
      patient can be taught on the first occasion by the physician to
      recognize the neutralization end-point-The patient can then
      continue to administer AIBUT to himself, varying the dose as
      necessitated by changing food and environmental challenge." Wilson
      conducted additional experiments in order to determine the correct
      dosage of urine that would be therapeutically effective in both
      animal and human studies.<br>
      <br>
      He finally concluded that urine therapy for allergies should be
      administered by giving sublingual drops of urine until no taste or
      temperature was detected:<br>
      <br>
      "The therapeutically effective dose of urine is determined as the
      point at which sublingual administration of urine drops cannot be
      detected by sensations of abnormal buccal (oral) taste or
      temperature by the patient when the drops are administered."<br>
      <br>
      In his study in 1984, Wilson also demonstrated that urine was
      effective as a treatment for the Raynaud Phenomenon, a condition
      which creates discoloration, coldness and sweating of the
      extremities, particularly the hands:<br>
      <br>
      "Cold-water induced Raynaud symptoms were reduced in severity
      after administration of effective doses of unboiled urine in
      AIBUT." <br>
      <br>
      These reports on urine therapy and allergies are extraordinary
      indications of just how powerful and comprehensive urine therapy
      is and how may diverse health benefits it can offer, especially in
      view of the fact that so many of the illnesses we suffer from
      today are related to allergies.The Research Evidence and Case

      <b>MENTAL CONDITIONS GENERAL RESEARCH INDICATIONS Report #36</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The effect of urine therapy on depression and other mental
      disorders such as hysteria, tantrums, etc. have been reported by
      many users of urine therapy including Drs. Dunne and Fife, the
      allergy specialists who were already mentioned:<br>
      <br>
      "In the process of treating psychiatric patients, Dr. Fife found
      many apparent physical illnesses co-incidentally relieved, such as
      multiple sclerosis, colitis, hypertension, lupus erythematosus,
      rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, hyper-activity, pancreatic
      insufficiency, psoriasis and eczema, diabetes, herpes zoster,
      mononucleosis and so on...<br>
      <br>
      The reverse has also been noted by others who, in treating
      allergic physical illnesses find their patients' mental symptoms
      are concurrently abolished."<br>
      <br>
      I also have a newspaper clipping which reports that researchers
      have discovered that clinical depression may be caused by low
      levels of a brain chemical called PEA (phenylethylamine), which is
      a natural amphetamine-like substance that is constantly produced
      and broken down by the brain:<br>
      <br>
      "Abnormally low amounts of PEA cause a lack of interest and
      concentration, loss of pleasure, forgetfulness, withdrawal from
      other people and other symptoms characteristic of depression.
      Researchers have learned that a key breakdown product of PEA,
      called PAA (phenyl acetate), is excreted in the urine in
      measurable amounts." PAA in urine may well play a part in the
      improvements in mental disorders that have been noted by users of
      urine therapy, although there are innumerable nutrients,
      therapeutic agents and undoubtedly other as yet unidentified
      elements in urine, such as hormones and other brain chemicals,
      that can also contribute to such improvements.<br>

        TITLE: BACTERICIDAL PROPERTIES OF URINE FOR</b><b> NEISSERIA
        GONORRHOEAE 1987</b> by Robert C. Noble, M.D. and M. Parekh, MS
      (From the Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine,
      University of Kentucky College of Medicine). Published in the
      journal, Sexually Transmitted Diseases)<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBJECT: EFFECT OF URINE ON GONORRHEA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This study was a follow-up to another research program
      (McCutcheon, et. al, 1977) that had investigated the gonorrhea
      bacteria-killing properties of urine and had reported that
      sufficiently concentrated urine can destroy the causative organism
      of gonorrhea and provide a natural immunity to the disease.<br>
      <br>
      In 1987, Noble and Parekh confirmed McCutcheon's findings that
      concentrated urine could indeed kill gonorrhea bacteria:<br>
      <br>
      'These results show that sufficiently concentrated, acidic urines
      kill gonorrhea bacteria by an unknown mechanism."<br>
      <br>
      Noble and Parekh also closely examined which constituents in the
      urine might be responsible for its anti-gonorrheal properties and
      concluded that increased acidity and concentration give urine its
      ability to destroy gonorrhea:<br>
      <br>
      "Our study, like that of McCutcheon, et. al, found both the pH and
      the concentration of the urine to be important factors in the
      bactericidal activity of urine for gonococci."<br>
      <br>
      This research also demonstrated, as did Schlegel's, Cuellar's,
      O'Dell's and Kaye's, that elevated urea in urine was also capable
      of inhibiting gonorrhea bacterial growth:<br>
      <br>
      "There was no growth of the gonorrhea bacteria after exposure to
      100 mg of urea/ml."<br>
      <br>
      Again, oral urine therapy will increase urine acidity and urea
      concentrations in the system which in turn, as we've seen, can
      destroy a wide variety of disease organisms including gonorrhea.
      We can also control and elevate urine acidity, if needed, through
      diet (see Chapter 6 for information on how to do this and also how
      to monitor your urine pH levels at home).The Research Evidence and
      Case Studies<br>
      <br>
      <b>IDENTIFICATION OF A SPECIFIC INTERLEUKIN-1 INHIBITOR IN THE
        URINE OF FEBRILE PATIENTS,</b> 1984, by Zenghua Liao, et.al,
      published in the Joumal of Experimental Medicine, Jan. 1984. (Dr.
      Liao was an exchange scholar from the Fujian Medical Center in
      China, and this study was supported by grants from the National
      Institutes of Health and others).<br>
      <br>
      Interleukin-1 (IL-1), among other things, is one of the body's
      immune defense substances which stimulates fever. Fever, as many
      of us know, helps the body destroy harmful microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      But researchers have discovered that not only does the body
      produce IL-1 during infection or attack, but that it also produces
      a substance that slows down, or suppresses the production of IL-1,
      presumably so that the body does not become too feverish or
      dangerously inflamed during the illness. This substance that keeps
      fever under control is called an IL-1 inhibitor.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers discovered that this important IL-1 inhibitor
      substance was found not only in the blood, but in the urine also.
      In this study, the researchers found that the IL-1 inhibitor
      substance was present in both normal urine and the urine of
      febrile patients:<br>
      <br>
      "These findings indicate that the IL-1 inhibitor is a normal
      constituent of human urine, but that the urine levels of this
      material are significantly increased in febrile states... We have
      found that the urine of febrile patients contains a potent IL-1
      inhibitor.<br>
      <br>
      The urine of febrile patients has been found to contain high
      concentrations of IL-I," Practitioners of urine therapy, including
      Duncan, Plesch, Armstrong, Wilson, Dunne and others have reported
      that internal urine therapy brings down fever during illness or
      inflammation during allergy attacks. This IL-1 inhibitor substance
      in urine may well play a part in urine's anti-inflammatory
      properties.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Urine Therapy</b><br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>1. Collect Midstream Urine in a Clean Cup or Container ---</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      A dean glass or clear plastic container is best for collecting the
      urine. In the research studies, urine is usually collected by
      means of a "clean catch" in which the genital area is cleansed
      before collecting the urine. This is important for women in
      particular when using urine therapy internally and can be done by
      simply washing with a little soap and water. Collect the midstream
      urine only. You can take along pre-packaged clean catch kits which
      include a sterile cup and antiseptic paper towelettes for
      convenience during travel or whenever unsanitary living conditions
      or contaminated water are a problem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Always Use Fresh Urine Immediately Upon Collection</b> -- <br>
      <br>
      Urine breaks down quickly outside the body so use it internally as
      soon as you collect it. If you are going to use it for external
      use only, this isn't as important, as you can use either fresh or
      old urine for most external applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Begin With Oral Drops Then Increase Dosage As Needed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Once you've read the book and are ready to begin using the
      therapy, Start by taking a only few drops each day in order to let
      your body adjust gradually. Fill a clean medicine dropper from the
      cup of urine and place one or two drops under your tongue. This
      method lets you get used to the taste slowly and will still give
      you health benefits. You. can slowly increase and adjust the
      amount later when you've determined what amount is right for your
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      1. Start by taking 1-5 drops of morning urine on the first day.<br>
      <br>
      2. The second day, take 5-10 drops in the morning.<br>
      <br>
      3. Third day, take 5-10 drops m the morning, and the same amount
      in the evening before you go to bed.<br>
      <br>
      4. Once you feel accustomed to the therapy, gradually increase the
      amount as needed for obtaining results for your condition. As you
      use the therapy, you will learn to adjust the amount you need by
      observing your reactions to the therapy. More information on
      dosage is given further on in this chapter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Do Not Boil Or Dilute The Urine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Research studies show that boiling urine destroys many oi its
      medicinal properties, so when taking it internally, use it only in
      its fresh, natural form. Research studies have also shown that
      diluting urine (or urea) decreases its antibacterial activity, so<br>
      rather than diluting it in juice or water to get accustomed to
      using it, use a few oral drops instead.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Homeopathic Urine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The importance of using urine collected at the beginning or height
      of acute symptoms of illness, particularly infections and
      allergies, has been suggested by some researchers, because this
      urine contains the greatest amount of antibodies and
      immune-defense agents with which the body is already fighting the
      illness. A homeopathic preparation preserves this potent
      first-stage-illness urine and can then be used throughout the
      duration of the illness. Homeopathic urine is also excellent for
      children. For those of you with extreme sensitivity or toxicity,
      who may feel that you are getting too strong a reaction to the
      urine initially, try using it as a homeopathic dilution. I<br>
      <br>
      6. Monitor And Balance Your Ph -- pH refers to the acid/alkaline
      condition of the body. The body is normally mildly acidic, and
      maintaining the proper pH is crucial in urine therapy. pH values
      naturally change throughout the day. Morning urine is generally
      more acidic than mid-day urine, and pH also changes in response to
      diet - in general, foods like meats, coffee, alco- hol, milk, eggs
      and beans make the body more acidic while most fruits and
      vegetables have an. alkaline effect. (See Appendix for a more
      complete listing of add/alkaline foods). It's always good to keep
      an eye on both your urine and saliva pH levels, because both
      should present a proper acid/alkaline balance. The ideal pH range
      of saliva is about 6.4 - 7.2, (below 6.4 is too acidic, above 72.
      \s too alkaline). Saliva usually becomes more alkaline after
      eating and with a vegetarian diet. Urine pH should ideally vary
      from approximately 5.0 (acid in the morning) to 8.0 (alkaline at
      night) during each 24-hour period. If your urineor saliva pH
      levels are consistently out of range for a long period, of time,
      it means that your body is not functioning correctly or that your
      diet is consistently too add or too alkaline. pH measuring strips
      with numerical values are commercially available for testing your
      acid/alkaline levels and make it simple to regularly monitor your
      pH at home, (or see order form on last page). The tendency to
      overacidity is called acidosis which can be caused by such things
      as kidney, liver or adrenal disorders, improper diet, starvation,
      anger, stress, fear, fever or excess vitamin C, aspirin or niacin.
      Symptoms may include insomnia, water retention, migraine
      headaches, frequent sighing, abnormally low blood pressure, dry
      hard stools, alternating constipation and dianhea, sensitivity of
      the teeth, difficulty swallowing and recessed eyes. Alkalosis
      (when the body is too alkaline) can be caused by such things as
      excessive use of antacids or by poor diet, excessive vomiting
      (bulimia), endocrine imbalances, high cholesterol,
      osteo-arthritis, or diarrhea. Symptoms may include drowsiness,
      protruding eyes, creaking joints, sore muscles, bursitis, edema,
      night coughs, menstrual problems, allergies, night cramps, chronic
      indigestion, or asthma. The first and easiest methods that you can
      use to correct pH are to increase relaxation, rest, fresh air, and
      exercise, decrease stress and make dietary adjustments. If you're
      too acid, decrease acid foods in your diet and eat more alkaline
      foods; if you're too alkaline, decrease alkaline foods and eat
      more acid foods. (For a list of acid or alkaline foods see the
      Appendix at the back of the book).<br>
      <br>
      It's extremely important to monitor your pH levels during urine
      therapy because if your urine is too alkaline, it may decrease its
      antibacterial activity. On the other hand, if the urine is
      consistently excessively acidic, urine therapy could create too
      much of an acid burden in your body. In this case, make certain
      that your diet is primarily alkaline-promoting foods, so that you
      are balancing your pH and not adding to your body's acid burden
      through ingesting extremely acidic urine. Also, if you have a
      severe chronic problem with acidosis (this is often tine of
      diabetics), use only a few drops of urine at a time, or substitute
      a homeopathic urine preparation. Test your urine pH once or twice
      each day for a few days when using urine therapy for the first
      time or when using it intensively. Do not ingest the same urine
      that you dip the pH strip into for testing. If you are taking only
      a small maintenance dose per day, test pH once every three to five
      days in order to determine whether dietary adjustments are needed.
      If you find that your urine pH is very acid, add a pinch of baking
      soda to the urine you'll be ingesting to reduce the acidity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Do not use urine therapy if you are pregnant without a</b><b>
        doctor's supervision:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although pregnant women have been treated with successfully urine
      therapy for morning sicimess or edema, the therapy should not be
      used during pregnancy without the supervision of a doctor familiar
      with the medical use of urine. Doctors have reported that they
      have used urine therapy for morning sickness in pregnancy with
      excellent results, but there are reports of two spontaneous
      abortions which occurred after urine therapy treatments (Dunne and
      Plesch), possibly because of the natural release of toxins which
      occur with urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Fertility: On the other hand, if you're trying to get pregnant,
      several successful fertility drugs such as Pergonai are made from
      urine extracts and a few women have reported to me that they feel
      urine therapy helped them to conceive. The best and safest method
      in this case is to use urine therapy for a certain time period
      (six months) before trying to conceive and to discontinue its use
      during the days that you're attempting to conceive. You can use
      urine diagnostic tests to determine when you're ovulating and when
      you've conceived, and you can gear your use of urine accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Urine Therapy and Drugs: In the past I have recommended that you
      do not use urine therapy if you are taking any type of drugs or
      are a heavy smoker, alcohol user or coffee drinker. However, new
      research has come to my attention that shows that urine therapy
      can be beneficial under all of these conditions. Dr. William Hitt,
      an American doctor who actually has urine therapy clinics in
      Mexico, has reported to me that he has treated 20,000 patients in
      a 2 ? year period with urine therapy injections. These patients
      include those with cancer, asthma and other diseases and also
      patients with severe alcoholism, drug and smoking addictions. Dr.
      Hitt reports startling success with no side effects in using urine
      infections for addictive disorders and also in combination with
      pre-scription. drugs. The amount of drugs or contaminants passed
      into urine is so infinitesimal that they pose no threat and, in
      fact, appear to act as vaccine-type agents which improve or cure
      these types of disorders. This is also supported by the book
      Urinalysis in Clinical Laboratory Practice from Miles
      Laboratories, in which the authors state that even in a case of
      severe mercury poisoning, the actual amount of mercury passed into
      the urine is infinitesimal. When these types of conditions are
      present, start on 1-5 drops orally per day for 3-5 days in order
      to avoid heavy detoxificatiorL Increase the drops by one or two
      each day according to how well you're tolerating the therapy,
      gradually increase the amount as needed to obtain results for your
      individual condition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. Improve Your Diet &amp; Avoid Meat When Using Urine</b><b>
        Therapy Intensively Before Fasting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In general, your diet should consist of balanced amounts of whole
      grains, fresh vegetables and small amounts of lean meats and fish.
      If you are eating large amounts of refined foods, sugar, soda,
      coffee, etc. you will not get the full benefits of urine therapy
      and, depending on how poor your diet is, you may experience
      unpleasant symptoms of headache, nausea, etc., as your body
      regulates and expels undesirable elements. If you're only using a
      few oral drops of urine or ingesting one or two ounces once a day,
      your meat intake can remain normal as long as your usual intake is
      moderate. As studies on urea and the kidney have shown (Dr. C.
      Giordano), urea helps your body break down proteins more
      efficiently,, which may mean that when using urine therapy, you
      can get the increased benefits of protein intake even. though you
      are eating less meat and other sources of protein. This
      information will probably also be of value to vegetarians who rely
      on mach less concentrated protein sources in their foods than
      regular meat eaters. Decrease or elinrunate meat in your diet
      while ingesting large amounts of urine or preparing for a fast, as
      combining intensive urine therapy and high meat intake may lead to
      excess add levels in the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>9. Detoxifying Symptoms</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When you first begin urine therapy, you may initially experience
      symptoms such as headache, nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, or skin
      rashes. In many of the research studies in Chapter 4, the doctors
      often observed such symptoms in their patients, which are the
      body's natural responses as stored toxins from illness and
      disorders are excreted and removed from the body. These symptoms
      normally disappear within 24 to 36 hours. Also, by starting your
      therapy with a few oral drops, you may avoid or lessen the
      severity of detoxificadon. If you. have begun your therapy with
      larger amounts, and are experiencing unpleasant symptoms, decrease
      the amount you are ingesting and continue with smaller doses.
      Homeopathic remedies and simple herbs can also be used and are
      often of great help during detoxificarion to relieve headache,
      nausea, diarrhea, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>10. Children</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several research studies, such as those done by Drs. Krebs,
      Piesch, Duncan, Lewis and Dunne, deal specifically with the
      treatment of children with urme therapy. The easiest internal form
      of the therapy for children is oral drops of the child's own freSh
      urine. As mentioned in the studies, for acute flu, colds, viral
      infections, measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc., small frequent oral
      doses of 1-10 drops during illness have been shown to be very
      effective. For allergies, the research studies indicate that
      several drops of fresh urine should be given orally before and
      after meals containing allergenic foods, or when allergic symptoms
      are present. Drs. Dunne and Lewis give very specific, simple
      instructions for using urine therapy for treating allergies in
      children which are included in their reports. Another very
      effective method recommended by Dr. Dunne is to prepare a
      homeopathic dilution of the child's urine for use throughout the
      illness or allergy attack. Collect urine at the onset of symptoms
      and prepare according to the instructions given in the section
      Homeopathy and Urine Therapy. Research studies also indicate that
      symptoms of illness may temporarily increase immediately following
      the first few doses of urine therapy, but, in all cases, these
      symptoms dissipated within 24 - 48 hours. For ear infections,
      fresh, warm urine drops in the affected ear can give excellent and
      often instantaneous results. Repeat as needed. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DOSAGE</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Maintenance Dose</b><br>
      <br>
      A daily mamtenance dose is usually considered by those who use
      urine therapy regularly to be one to two ounces of morning
      midstream urine. but this dose may also be as little as 5-10 drops
      per day, or every other day, depending on your individual
      condition and needs. Many lifetime users of urine therapy such as
      the former prime minister of India, have commented that regular
      use of urine therapy noticeably assists in maintaining energy
      levels, reducing aging and in preventing illness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Severe, Acute And Chronic Illnesses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For those with chronic or severe illnesses such as cancer, some
      urine therapy users such as John Armstrong strongly recommend
      ingesting as much urine as you pass or as much as possible during
      the day for several days, however, much smaller doses have also
      been reported to be effective. If you are ingesting large amounts,
      fasting or sharply decreasing your solid food intake during this
      time reduces the burden on the .kidneys and allows&nbsp; the body
      to use more energy for healing, rather than digestion. It would be
      extremely unadvisable for most people to undertake the kind of
      prolonged urine fast that John Armstrong suggests, and short urine
      and water fasts of one to three days can be very effective. Stop
      ingestion shortly before bed at night so that the body can rest,
      and resume when you awake in the morning. If you do not want to
      fast, but feel that you need to ingest larger amounts of urine,
      eat small, simple, light meals, preferably, fresh home-made
      unseasoned vegetable soups. If you leci you need a grain, use
      plain millet or rice, or whole grain, salt-free crackers.<br>
      <br>
      There is more information on fasting. Long-standing, difficult
      conditions naturally may require a longer period of treatment.
      What I discovered in my own treatment was that I needed to ingest
      a large amount initially (about 2 ounces 4-5 times/day) every day,
      for about two weeks, at which point, I switched to small frequent
      doses (one to two ounces) three to four times a day for another
      two weeks and then tapered off to 1-2 ounces twice a day, then
      every other day, etc. The maintenance dose is 5-10 drops per day.
      This was my approach, but you may find that your individual
      require-ments or more or less than these amounts. If you are
      suffering from an acute illness such as an infection, the
      traditional treatment is to fast completely or to eat only light
      meals such as homemade, unseasoned vegetable broth while ingesting
      frequent doses of urine for at least one day, or until you feel
      that your improvement is complete and stable. I have found, as
      have many others, that eating heavily too soon after recovering
      from a viral or bacterial infection may produce a<br>
      relapse, so make sure that you're feeling stable before starting
      to eat normally again. Always break your fast by slowly
      reintroducing light foods, homemade fresh vegetable soups, then
      crackers, grains, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rest, Rest, Rest</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Once you have healed .a serious illness and achieved improved
      health, continue the practice of a daily maintenance dose of urine
      therapy and a good diet. Also, never allow yourself to become
      consistently exhausted or overtired. Consistent proper rest is
      much more crucial to health than most people realize. And once you
      have recovered fit&gt;m a majorillness, you must be extremely
      vigilant in getting abundant rest and relaxation. I have seen many
      instances in which people completely cure them-selves of even
      'incurable' diseases through urine therapy and natural healing and
      remain well far a number of years, only to completely undo all the
      good they've accomplished by over-confidently pushing themselves
      to extremes in their work or recreation. One of the saddest
      examples of this error that I know of was the case of a young,
      bright, determined AIDS patient who had completely cured himself
      of all visible and clinical evidence of the disease, but
      subsequently consistently and relentlessly overworked at his
      demanding corporate job. Eventually, he fell ill, relapsed and was
      not able to recover. However, in another case, a person who had
      recovered from a seriousillness experienced a relapse from
      overexertion, but complete rest and intense urine therapy led to
      an excellent recovery. But why put your-self through that ordeal
      and risk the chance of seriously undermining your body's hard- won
      repair work?<br>
      <br>
      Assiduous urine therapy can give you such renewed vigor and
      energy, that it's easy to become overconfident and overdo, which,
      is not a huge problem for normal people. But for people recovering
      from major illnesses, exhaustion can pose a life-long threat, so
      protect your new-found health and your natural immune defenses
      with lots of rest, fresh air, moderate exercise and minimized
      stress.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Kidney Disorders</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      If you have a history or presence of a kidney infection, limit the
      initial amount of oral urine therapy you take to small doses such
      as 1-5 drops once or twice a day, or use a homeopathic dilution as
      described in the section on. Homeopathy and Urine Therapy in this
      chapter. Decrease or eliminate meat ingestion. and acid-forming
      foods before beginning the therapy. Also, check your acidity
      levels with pH strips, and begin urine therapy when your acid
      levels have normalized or decreased substantially.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Allergies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the clinical research studies done on urine therapy and
      allergies, practitioners such as Dunne and Wilson used oral drops
      with excellent' results. Refer to these studies for directions and
      again, begin with one or two drops and then gradually increase the
      number of drops, or as Wilson suggests, take the drops until you
      can no longer sense the urine taste or temperature. If you know
      what your allergies are, take the drops before eating a food that
      you're allergic to; if you don't know what you're allergic to,
      take several drops of fresh urine immediately upon the appearance
      of symptoms, and repeat this method each time the symptoms
      reoccur. Homeopathic urine preparations, as described by Dr.
      Dunne, are also excellent for allergies, as you can preserve the
      urine collected at the height of allergy symptoms for long term
      treatment of the allergy. See the section on preparing homeopathic
      urine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Food Poisoning</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several of the research studies show that urea is a proven anti-
      bacterial agent (Drs. Schlegel, Kaye, Weinstein etc.), and urine
      has been found to contain antibodies to food contaminants such as
      salmonella bacteria in infected individuals (Lemer and Remington).
      Begin by taking 1-5 drops. Increase dosage as tolerated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fasting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fasting on urine is an excellent therapy that can produce
      extraordinary results, especially for intractable diseases and
      tough chronic conditions, but always work into a fast slowly.
      Begin with oral drops for two to three weeks, increase your dosage
      to 1- 3 ounces during the next two or three weeks, and begin
      fasting the following week. Eliminate all meat intake at least
      three days before the fast. When I first started urine therapy, I
      was so seriously ill with so many different conditions and in such
      extreme pain, that I rushed into aweek-long fast on urine and
      water alone. But I don't recommend this approach because I've
      found that it isn't necessary to rush into the ther-apy in order
      to get good "results. Pushing your body too quickly can produce
      often severe detoxifying symptoms such as headaches, fever,
      nausea, depression, or fatigue that you can lessen or avoid by.
      Simply adjusting to the therapy gradually with a few oral drops
      each day. During the fast, ingest as much urine as you pass during
      the day until it becomes completely dear; stop ingesting for a few
      hours and then resume. Decrease or stop your intake at night and
      begin again when you awake in the morning. Alternate urine intake
      with small sips of cool water or ice-chips if desired. Drink as
      much water as you feel thirsty for, and stay well-hydrated at all
      times, but do not force-drink large quantities of water; as
      research shows (Kaye and Schlegel), this can dilute the urine, and
      decrease the urea's anti-bacterial action. Force-drinking water,
      in addition to urine ingestion, may also stress the kidneys.
      Combine urine fasting with urine skin massages, particularly on
      the face, neck and feet. John Armstrong insisted on this method
      because he felt that it gave extra nourishment to the body while
      fasting and eliminated possible headaches and nausea. The rubs are
      also refreshing and make the skin dear and soft. When breaking the
      fast, start by eating a simple homemade fresh vegetable soup broth
      such as one made of fresh kale, carrots, fresh green leeks,
      scallion tops and a little fresh ginger. Do not add salt or
      seasonings. Eat only the broth for a day or two, the broth and
      vegetable the next day, and begin gradually adding in more
      vegetables and carbohy-drates such as rice and millet over the
      next few days. Short periods of fasting (1-3 days) can be an
      extremely effective method for cleansing and healing the body;
      long fasts should always be under-taken with caution and
      supervision.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Homeopathy and Urine Therapy</b><br>
      <br>
      In the course of using urine therapy, I found that combining the
      therapy with homeopathic medicines in particular can produce
      incredible results, even for the toughest, most stubborn chronic
      conditions. Severely weakened, debilitated, chronically ill
      individuals often develop extreme sensitivities to ordinarily
      helpful herbal, vitamin, mineral and other medicinal preparations,
      but are able to tolerate homeopathic medidnes very well.
      Homeopathic medicines are simply extremely diluted natural sub-
      stances such as plants, minerals, etc. that gently stimulate a
      healing reaction in the body. A homeopathic medicine is prepared
      by diluting a minute amount of a particular natural substance with
      water; the dilution is shaken several tunes and then alcohol may
      be added to the solution as a preservative. You can take the
      homeopathic medicine in its liquid form, or as a small sucrose
      pill which has been saturated with the liquid. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Homeopathic Urine</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nancy Dunne, the allergy researcher, reported that her
      colleague, Dr. Fife, used urine in the form of a homeopathic
      dilution with excellent results. Homeopathic urine is excellent
      for children and may be helpful to those with extreme
      sensitivities. It also provides a means of preserving urine
      collected during the first stages or the onset of illness,
      at,which time the urinary antibodies and iinmune defense agents
      are most reported to be most numerous and active.<br>
      <br>
      Pre-prepared homeopathic urea can also be purchased, although this
      would contain only urea and none of the antibodies or immune
      factors of a whole urine homeopathic preparation. The traditional
      book for selecting and using homeopathic medicines is referred to
      as the Materia Medica, which contains a listing of the remedies
      and Lndications for their use. These lists are referred to as
      Repertories, such as Boericke's Repertcay and Kent's Repertory.
      These books are actuallymvery enjoyable to learn to use, and the
      Boerickc's Repertory in particular can guide you to very specific,
      effective remedies for virtually every disorder.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Dunne reported that the following procedi.ire for preparing a
      homeopathic dose oi urme was used by Dr. Fife, and had produced
      remarkable healing:<br>
      <br>
      1. To 5 mis (1/6 of an ounce) of distilled water in a sterile
      bottle add one drop of fresh urine.<br>
      <br>
      2. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously 50 times (this is the first
      dilution).<br>
      <br>
      3. Take one drop of this mix and add to another 5 mis (1/6 oz.) of
      distilled water; shake 50 times.<br>
      <br>
      4. Take one drop of this mix and add to 5 mis (1/6 oz.) of 80 to
      90 proof vodka which acts as a preservative.<br>
      <br>
      5. Place three drops under the tongue hourly until there is
      obvious improvement or temporary exacerbation of symptoms. As
      improvement progresses, lengthen the interval between treatments.
      After 3 days, suspend treatment to avoid pushing the immune
      system. Treatment is resumed if progress remains static or relapse
      occurs.<br>
      <br>
      For beginners who feel unsure about how to use homeopathy, the
      best book I have found as an overall introduction to self-care
      through home-opathy is The Fanfily Guide to Homeopathy, Symptoms
      and Natural Solutions, by Dr. Andrew Lockje. This is a
      tremendously comprehensive self-help guide which introduces the
      fundamentals of how the body functions, how and why specific
      illnesses and disorders are contracted, and what homeopathic
      remedies will best augment the body's natural healing. This book
      is an extraordinary adjunct to urine therapy and contains helpful
      material about a wide range of disorders that I have never found
      anywhere else.<br>
      <br>
      When using homeopathy, you have a choice of two different
      dilutions referred to as "x " potencies or "c " potencies. The "x"
      potencies are sold commercially in health food stores, etc. I have
      found that the c potencies are excellent for home use, as their
      effect seems more pronounced than the commercial preparations;
      many homeopathic doctors also prefer the “c” potencies.
      Homeopathic medicines are safe and produce no side effects. These
      medicines are considered to be FDA approved, because they were
      widely used in the U.S. earlier in the century and so were
      "grandfathered" in to the FDA list of approved medical treatments;
      some home-opathic remedies are sold in health food stores or can
      be obtained froin a homeopathic doctor or catalog. Combining
      homeopathy with urine therapy was, for me, incredibly effective
      for a wide variety of serious disorders as well as for mild
      disorders such as headaches, colds, indigestion, etc. For more
      information on using homeopathy with urine therapy, you can also
      refer to the book I've written Healing Yourself with Homeopathy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>External Use</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Skin Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Applying urine to the skin is an excellent treatment for every
      imaginable type of skin disorder including all rashes, eczema,
      psoriasis, acne, etc. The urea in urine, as the research studies
      demonstrated, is also excellent for cosmetic use as an overall
      skin beautifier and moisturizer.<br>
      <br>
      1. Use either fresh or old urine for skin applications, although
      old urine has a higher ammonia content and has been found to be
      more effective in treating many stubborn skin disorders such as
      eczema or psoriasis.<br>
      <br>
      2. When treating skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, rashes,
      etc. pour a small amount of urine onto a cotton ball or pad and
      pat or massage it lightly onto the affected area, making sure that
      the area is well saturated.<br>
      <br>
      3. Discard the pad and saturate another clean pad with fresh urine
      and reapply, lightly patting and soaking the affected area.
      Continue reapplying in this manner for 5-10 minutes or as many
      times as desired - the more that the affected area is treated, the
      better.<br>
      <br>
      4. Secure a clean soaked pad to the affected area with a gauze or
      cotton ~vrap and leave secured for several hours for additional
      healing. These urine packs are also incredibly effective for any
      type of insect sting, bite or poison oak or ivy. (See Urine Packs
      and Compresses).<br>
      <br>
      5. Another method is to pour old or fresh urine into clean,
      plastic spray bottle and spray the rash, eczema, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Skin Massages</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Always augment your use of oral urine therapy with skin massages
      particuJariy on the face, neck and feet John Armstrong recommended
      this practice especially when fasting for an acute condition, and
      people who use it, swear by it. These massages have a tonifying,
      refreshing, relaxing effect and are said to allow for gradual
      absorption of urine nutrients through the skin. Pour either old or
      fresh urine into a wide, shallow container and dip your hands into
      the liquid. Shake off excess, then vigorously massage into a small
      area of skin anywhere on the body until hands and skin are dry.
      Rewet hands and begin massaging another area until dry; repeat
      this step until all skin areas have been well massaged. Rinse with
      warm water. Do not attempt these massages on extremely elderly or
      infirm individuals. Also, make certain that you use normal urine
      for massages. If your own urine is dark, turbid or abnormal
      looking, wait until you have used the urine internally over the
      course of two or three days, at which time the urine usually
      appears clear and can then be used for massages. Urine from a
      normal healthy person other than yourself may also be used for
      your external massage. If you are a heavy smoker, or are taking
      therapeutic or recreational drugs, do not use your own urine
      externally or internally (or use only extremely small amounts).<br>
      <br>
      <b>COSMETIC APPLICATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      1. For cosmetic use or moisturizing, pour a very small amount of
      nor mal fresh urine or urme which has been stored, for a day or
      two into your hand and massage lightly into the skin until dry;
      then pour additional urine into your hand, massage it into another
      area of the skin until dry and so on.<br>
      <br>
      2. Rinse well with warm water when completed, but wash without
      soap. Your skin is naturally slightly addic, and this natural
      aridity is usually destroyed by soaps which are all alkaline and
      diminish the skin's natural protective add mantle.<br>
      <br>
      3. You can apply a moLsturizer after the massage, but make sure
      that it's a simple, natural one that doesn't contain lot of drying
      alcohol or other chemicals. Also, you can add a few drops of urine
      to a small amount of your moisturizing cream each time you apply
      the cream.<br>
      <br>
      As the research studies show, urea replenishes the water content
      of the skin because it binds hydrogen and attracts moisture to the
      skin in a way that no mineral oil or glycerin-based lotions or
      creams can.<br>
      <br>
      You 'll be absolutely amazed at the softness and beauty of your
      skin after even one treatment with a urine massage. Old dead skin
      immediately flakes away, and your skin becomes wonderfully soft,
      rosy and with time, even wrinkles will disappear. Urine massages
      have also been reported to eliminate varicose veins and cysts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Urine Packs And Compresses</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Skin Disorders</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Urine packs give added healing to skin disorders such as eczema,
      psoriasis, athlete's foot, ringworm, poison ivy and oak, etc. in
      addition to urine massages and soaks;<br>
      <br>
      1. Soak gauze bandages or cotton balls m fresh or old urine and
      place them over the affected areas.<br>
      <br>
      2. Cover the urine pack with light plastic (like Saran-wrap) and
      tie in place with gauze strips.<br>
      <br>
      3. Try to keep the pack on as long as possible, especially with
      more, severe conditions. Add additional urine to the pack with a
      medicine dropper every few hours to keep the pack wet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bites And Stings</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Urine packs are tremendously useful and effective for relieving
      the discomfort of all insect bites and stings.<br>
      <br>
      When I first moved to Arizona, I was stung on the foot by a
      scorpion. My foot immediately swelled to almost double its size
      and was unbelievably painhil. I dragged myself into the house,
      applied a soaked urine pack and tied it in place. Within 15
      minutes, the pain had disap-peared and the swelling had lessened
      considerably. I kept the pack on overnight, and when I removed it
      in the morning, the swelling and redness had completely
      disappeared. The pain and irritation of bee stings and mosquito
      bites is also wonderfully relieved by this method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Snake Bite</b><br>
      <br>
      Urine packs should also be used immediately for poisonous snake
      bites. Follow emergency first-aid instructions to inrise the wound
      and remove venom, if possible. Then apply fresh normal urine to
      the wound and secure a well-soaked urine pack over it. Keep pack
      wet until medical help can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Growths And Tumors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Armstrong reported in great length on the remarkable effects of
      urine compresses in reducing and eradicating a wide variety of
      internal and external tumors, cysts and abnormal growths.<br>
      <br>
      1. Compresses should be used in combination with internal urine
      therapy for treating any type of abnormal growth.<br>
      <br>
      2. In preparing a compress, use a thick pad of clean white folded
      cotton material (such as an old T-shirt).<br>
      <br>
      3. Soak the pad in a container of fresh or old urine. Warm the
      urine by pouring it into a glass container, then place the jar in
      a container of hot water. While lying down, place wet compress
      over the affected area and cover with a clean folded towel. Keep
      the compress applied for as long as possible, reapplying warm
      urine as needed to keep the compress wet. Urine compresses have
      also been reported to be effective for many internal disturbances
      and for arthritic and rheumatic pains. Wounds, Burns And Abrasions
      As so many research and clinical studies have shown, urea is a
      tremen-dously effective anti-bacterial agent and an excellent
      healing treatment for wounds and burns of all types. Use fresh,
      normal urine for treating open wounds.<br>
      <br>
      1. Saturate a thick gauze bandage or cotton pad with fresh urine,
      place it over the wound or bum and secure it with additional
      gauze; cover with plastic or soft towel to prevent leakage.<br>
      <br>
      2. Reapply fresh urine with clean medidne dropper directly onto
      the existing inside compress. Reapply fresh compress as often as
      possible. Urine is also known to prevent scarring, so keep the
      urine pack applied as long or as often as possible until healing
      is complete. Many people have applied urine compresses to burns
      and cuts with amazing results. The pain is quickly relieved and
      the burn or wound heals rapidly without scarring.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Eye And Nose Drops</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are reports from people who have used urme drops for both
      eye and nose drops, for relief of eye itching or inflammation, or
      for nasal congestion. In both cases, make certain that you are
      using fresh, clear, normal urine only and that the acidity factor
      of the urine is normal (see previous section on Monitoring Your pH
      in this chapter). Also, make certain that the eye dropper you use
      for the eye drops is sterilized. A compress of fresh normal urine
      is also excellent for external eye inflammations such as styles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT URINE THERAPY</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Can my doctor administer urea, as the researchers in the
        studies did?</b><br>
      <br>
      The urine extract, urea, is FDA approved and can be administered
      by your doctor. A Physician's Guide to Your Own Perfect Medicine
      is available if your doctors would like additional information
      contained in the research studies on the clinical application of
      urea. As the research studies indicate, oral or injected urea has
      been shown to be extremely effective and safe in treating cases
      where excess fluid production is a problem (see pgs. 99-103).<br>
      <br>
      Urea's anti-bacterial, anti-viral and diuretic properties. <br>
      <br>
      Using urea in conjunction with natural urine therapy can be
      discussed with your doctor, once he or she has been made aware of
      the research findings relating to urea and urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. What about urine injections?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many people have asked me about the efficacy of urine injections,
      and as you've seen, many of the research studies presented in
      Chapter 4 utilized injections of urine as part of the therapy. But
      doctors have also used oral urine or urea therapy in non-
      emergency cases with equally good results and urine injections
      have the reported side effect of occasional redness and sweJling
      at the site of the injection which doesn't occur, of course, with
      oral therapy. Oral urine therapy also allows for slower
      application and absorption which can decrease any possible
      de-toxifying symptoms. Injections deliver an abrupt, forced
      introduction of medicinal substances into the body, without
      allowing for the body's gradual adjustment to the substance.
      However, there really isn't any need for this sudden forcing of a
      medicinal substance into the body unless there is an emergency
      situation. that requires it.<br>
      <br>
      Gradual introduction of urine therapy, or any medical therapy is
      always important, but even more so if you have a history of poor
      nutrition or chronic, serious illnesses which weaken the body and
      promote poisons and toxins in the system. Introducing a new
      therapy too rapidly places a strain on an ah-eady weakened system
      and can cause a sudden release of toxins that may make you feel
      ill unnecessarily. As clinical studies have demonstrated, oral
      urine or urea can be fust as effective for non-emergency cases as
      injected urine. And, as doctors themselves have commented, oral
      urine therapy can be used at safely and effectively at home
      without the unnecessary cost- and inconvenience of a doctor's
      office visit, while injections can be reserved for those with
      urgent needs under a doctor's care.<br>
      <br>
      However, if your situation is extremely severe, urine injections
      can definitely be of benefit. Dr. William Hitt (whom f mentioned
      earlier) runs two urine therapy cimics in Mexico and has
      administered hundreds of thousands of injections to severely HI
      patients with remarkable success.<br>
      <br>
      For more information on Dr. Hitt's clinics call 1-800-800-8849.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Can too much uric acid or urea be harmful?</b><br>
      <br>
      As several of the dinical studies showed, urea, even in large
      doses, has been found to be harmless to the body, Researchers,
      (Urea - New Use of An Old Agent), reported that they safely
      administered urea daily to several patients for a period ranging
      from several day» to weeks, and in some cases, even several
      months, without any side effects, in doses ranging from 100 mg.
      per kilogram of body weight to as much as 600 mg. per kilogram of
      body weight. Decaux, et. al, (5-Year Treatment of SIADH with Oral
      Urea), prescribed 30 grams/day for more than 5 years for a patient
      with excess water and salt retention (hyponatremia), and
      occasionally prescribed doses up to 60-90 grams per day for one or
      two days without side effects. Normal urine contains approximately
      2% urea, and you normally excrete about 24.5 grams/day, which is
      well below the dosages just mentioned. So even. if you ingested
      all of the urine you passed during the day, (approximately 25
      grams of urea), this amount is much less than the dosages
      mentioned above, especially in view of the fact that you would not
      be ingesting all the urine you pass every day for long periods of
      time. Uric acid, usually thought to be a toxic waste product of
      the body, has been found by researchers to actually be a natural
      body defense against cancer and aging, allowing us to live much
      longer than other mammals (Omni Magazine article, 1982). Most
      people think that uric add causes gout, but strictly speaking, it
      is not the uric add alone that causes the gout, but rather an
      overall, ongoing and chronic overacidity in the body which can be
      caused by many different factors including improper, overly-arid
      diet, kidney, liver and adrenal disorders, obesity, diabetes,
      chronic stress, undereating (anorexia), etc. Normally, the amount
      of uric add contained in urine is not a problem during urine
      therapy, because the body will excrete the amount it does not
      need. However, when the body's ability to excrete excess acids is
      impaired, uric arid excretion is, of course, also impaired. If you
      fed that you have a problem with chronic, ongoing overacidity (see
      section on Monitoring Arid/Alkaline Levels in this chapter), make
      certain that you decrease or eliminate meat while using urine
      therapy. Also, improve your diet by eating more alkaline foods,
      and decreasing arid foods before and after you start on urine
      therapy. Monitor your add/alkaline level with pH strips to
      determine when your pH has returned to a normal or more balanced
      condition. In cases of chronic addosis (over-acidity), do not do
      extended urine fasts or ingest large quantities over long periods
      of time.<br>
      <br>
      Use oral drops to begin; start with 1-2 drops once a day, and
      gradually increase to 5-10 drops two to four times a day, for one
      to three weeks, depending on your need. Monitor your pH levels and
      your symptoms (see symptoms of addosis in this chapter). You can
      also dilute the urine in water, or use a homeopathic preparation
      of your urine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. How long should i use urine therapy?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The amount of time needed to achieve results with urine therapy is
      different for every person and each condition. Many people have
      found that chronic, long-standing complaints require a longer
      period of time to heal, while others experience rapid resuite.
      Logically speaking, it probably depends on the condition, of your
      body's immune hunctions, ability to repair itself, amount of
      damage to the body that has been sustained during illness, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In general, do not use large amounts of urine infernally for more
      than two to three weeks at a time. Once you have achieved solid
      results at whatever dose you're taking, begin decreasing the
      amount and number of days that you use the therapy internally, and
      use only a maintenance dose from. then on, unless you come down
      with a cold, infection, etc., at which time you would increase
      your dosage amount and frequency during the period of illness. A
      maintenance dose for many people is one to two ounces of morning
      urine per day, although even 2-5 drops of morning urine per day or
      every oiher day could be considered a good maintenance dose,
      especially for those with acidosis or weak kidneys.<br>

      </b><b>6. Can I do diagnostic urine tests at home?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are several excellent urine testing kits that have been
      developed in the last few years that can be used at home and can
      save you an amazing amount of time and money. Now you can perform
      many of the same urine tests at home that your doctor performs in
      his office. Also, these tests are particularly helpful when using
      urine therapy because you can monitor your own health progress
      easily and inexpensively. The booklet. Simple Diagnostic Tests You
      Can Do at Home gives a wide range of information. on what tests
      are available, how to use them, and how to interpret these tests.
      The booklet also explains how to interpret your urine color and
      appearance which are important additional indicators of health
      conditions.<br>

      <b>7. Can pets be treated with urine therapy?</b><br>
      <br>
      Many of the research tests on urine recycling have been undertaken
      with animals, and vetermarians have used urine therapy for
      treatment by catherizing the arumal and administering oral urine
      drops with reportedly good results. Urine home test strips are
      available to test for these conditions and many others:<br>
      <br>
      o Kidney and Urinary Tract Infections<br>
      o Diabetes<br>
      o Blood in the urine<br>
      o Pregnancy<br>
      o Ovulation<br>
      o Liver Function<br>
      <br>
      You can purchase these strips in drugstores or they are available
      by catalog<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Remember to begin your treatment slowly with a few oral drops and
      increase the amount to a well-tolerated dosage. Make sure that
      you're eating well and decreasing your meat intake as you increase
      your urine intake. Do not use the therapy while ingesting heavy
      amounts of nicotine, caffeine or while using recreational drugs or
      therapeutic drugs than small amounts. If you do decide to use it,
      however, use only very small amounts (3-5 drops 1x day.) Frequent
      small doses of one to three ounces for two to three weeks can be
      extremely effective; larger amounts can be taken for several days
      if needed and if you have no history or presence of kidney
      disease; gradually decrease the amount once your symptoms have
      abated and healing is apparent. Drink as much water as you feel
      thirsty for, and keep well-hydrated, but do not force-drink large
      amounts oi fluid during the therapy. Do not fast for long periods
      of time without competent, professional supervision. Daily
      maintenance doses vary from a few drops to one to two ounces of
      morning urine, depending on your sensitivity and preference.<br>

      <b>The Do's And Don'ts of Urine Therapy (UT)</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Do:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. Start with small amounts and work up to larger amounts
      gradually for internal use.<br>
      <br>
      2. Use only fresh, urine internally.<br>
      <br>
      3. Test your pH to make certain that you are not overly acidic
      before using the therapy and continue to monitor your pH
      periodically during internal use of UT.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Do not:</b><br>
      <br>
      1. Rush into the therapy with large amounts.<br>
      <br>
      2. Do Not combine urine therapy with a starvation diet (or
      fasting) unless you have been using the therapy for at least two
      months.<br>
      <br>
      3. Do Not continue to work while fasting on UT. If you are
      ingesting large amounts of UT and fasting, you must rest and relax
      in order to avoid possibly stressing the kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      4. Do Not ingest large amounts while eating a consistently acidic
      diet.<br>
      <br>
      Here are many excellent testimonials and case studies on specific
      illnesses that have already been mentioned throughout the book,
      which you can refer to by looking in the Index under the name of
      the specific disorder that concerns you.<br>
      <br>
      I'll also mention a few more personal stories here as they relate
      to specific illnesses. These stories are taken from personal
      letters that I have read or from other published collections of
      testimonials on urine therapy, in particular, The Miracles of
      Urine Therapy, by Margie Adelman and Beatrice Barnett, and an
      Indian publication, Practical Guide to Auto Urine Therapy, by
      Acharya Jagdish. The stories are listed under specific condition
      titles, but many of the individual stories report on a number of
      different conditions, so you might want to read through all of
      them if your particular disorder does not appear to be mentioned.
      Also, if you'd like to read more personal testimonials, I highly
      recommend John Armstrong's book, The Water of Life which is
      replete with inspiring stories of remarkable cures with urine
      therapy, although his method of strict, long-term fasting of one
      to two months is extremely radical, and should never be undertaken
      without supervision. Your specific condition may not be mentioned
      here, but that doesn't mean that urine therapy can't help you.
      Urine contains such a huge array of medicinally valuable elements,
      many of which have not even as yet been identified, that its use
      is indicated in all approaches to healing.<br>
      <br>
      Even if feel that you're in good health, a small maintenance dose
      of urine therapy provides excellent energy-promoting nutrients,
      hormones, enzymes, etc., as well as purported longevity agents
      such as DHEA that everyone can benefit from, while natural urine
      antibodies enhance preventive health care and contribute to
      overall and lasting good health.<br>

      <b>Personal Testimonials</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>AIDS</b><br>
      <br>
      Mr. B.- Age 38. HIV positive. T4 210. Lympodenopathy, mild
      fatigue, severe acne on back. Commenced urine therapy and gland
      swelling reduced entirely within 48 hours of treatment. Fatigue
      gone within days. Acne dissipated dramatically over the following
      two weeks and more so once topical application of urine was begun
      - three week course of tetracycline (500 mg. 4 x/day) had
      negligible results. When urine therapy is skipped for more than
      two days, gland swelling and fatigue return. After urine therapy,
      I am feeling much better, normal again. No other treatment used. I
      am so grateful for this gift of life. Mr. M.- 46 years old. T4160.
      Heavy night sweats and fatigue (18 hours of sleep a day) for three
      months prior to urine therapy. Symptoms totally resolved within 10
      days. Skin had taken on a dry, ashy look which was also resolved.
      Within 2 weeks of treatment, was playing one-hour games of
      basketball daily. No other treatment used (or available) for
      treating symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. R.B. - 32 years of age. T4 210. T4/T8 ratio .3. Commenced
      urine therapy and mild fatigue and dizziness dissipated over a
      month. At 32 oz./day, experienced some diarrhea and cramps. Cut
      back to 8 oz. every 8 hrs. Lymph gland swelling has reduced by
      more than 50%. For over a year before urine therapy, experienced
      intense eye itching. A few drops of fresh urine in the eyes stops
      the itching immediately. Regular use of urine therapy prevents
      return of fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. L.- I am a PWA (person with Aids). My only symptom was a low
      T-cell count. I have been doing urine-therapy for four months now.
      My last test showed that my t-cell count went up from 285 to 489.
      Mr. M. - I am a PWA. My major problem was parasites. My stool
      sample contained pus, large amounts of yeast and several
      parasites. After urine therapy, my last test came back totally
      clear. No more pus and no more parasites.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed earlier in the book, the medically proven anti-viral
      properties of urea could possibly be enhanced through
      administration of urea extract (which is an FDA approved
      treatment) in addition to natural urine therapy. Consult with your
      doctor on using urea orally or by injection, to augment urine
      therapy in treating AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-viral, anti-bacterial and diuretic properties of urea
      have been repeatedly proven and could certainly be of tremendous
      value in treating the HIV virus and the concomitant bacterial and
      viral infections, excess fluid production, etc. As the clinical
      studies conducted by the researchers in the report, Urea- New Use
      Of An Old Agent, (see research studies) clearly demonstrated,
      urea, even in extremely large doses, is completely safe, so using
      it to enhance the activity of natural urine might well produce
      outstanding results.<br>

      <b>CANCER</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. V.P. - I am a qualified medical doctor and was diagnosed with
      cancer of the epiglottis (throat) with enlarged cervical lymph
      nodes. After receiving chemotherapy and a course of cobalt therapy
      I was to receive surgery. However, before continuing with
      conventional treatments, I began using urine therapy. After using
      urine therapy for more than a month my symptoms disappeared and
      the proposed surgery was cancelled. I am now leading a fully
      active professional life.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. R.R. - I was officially diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma of the
      chest with possible infiltration of the left lung two years ago.
      While I was in the hospital because of the concurrent symptoms
      (collapsed lung with 8 liters of bloody fluid) I was in a
      desperate struggle to stop production of the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      My bowels had stopped for a period of 5 days. I then came across
      information on urine therapy. As soon as I ingested my urine it
      was miraculous. I had five major bowel movements. The relief was
      incredible and the fluid production subsequently died down, to the
      doctors amazement. They had no recourse but to remove my chest
      tube. They wanted to continue with proposed treatments (chemo,
      radiation, surgery), but I signed out of the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Needless to say I am still here after two years even though my
      parents were informed that I had only four months to survive. I
      employed a number of holistic approaches (colonies, herbs, etc.),
      but to be perfectly honest I know it was the internal and external
      use of this therapy that has saved my life. I hope you can
      circulate my story to others to spread hope through this miracle
      cure.<br>
      <br>
      Mrs. E. -In the summer of 1983 I was diagnosed with cancer in my
      spine. I had radiation treatments and the pain subsided. After
      that I treated myself by natural means. Three years later I became
      sick again and was diagnosed with metastatic cancer of the liver.
      My doctors gave me pain killers and told me there was nothing they
      could do and sent me home. I tried another therapy but in November
      my condition worsened and I developed hepatitis with high fever
      and intense pain. I then tried urine therapy. I drank only my
      first morning urine. By the fifth day I felt more energetic. By
      the lOth day I returned to the doctor. He could not believe I was
      still alive. I drink my urine every morning. As of June, my liver
      is slightly swollen, but I do not have any pain. This woman's
      experience is interesting in terms of determining how much urine
      to ingest in treating cancer. She reports she drank only her
      morning urine with good results, but the liver swelling later
      returned, whereas, another woman who reported that she had an
      inoperable uterine tumor drank all the urine she passed daily for
      seven days, at which time she reported that the tumor had
      disappeared, which may be an indication that larger amounts are
      required for dealing with such disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. L. -Diagnosed with Kaposi's Sarcoma, (form of cancer that
      often accompanies AIDS), cellulitis and edema. Used urine therapy
      daily for 3 months internally and externally. He reported that he
      did not experience any detoxifying symptoms with urine therapy and
      attributes this to several weeks of high enemas (one a week) taken
      before beginning urine therapy. He noted that the water retention
      in his legs disappeared with urine therapy and the major lesions
      on his legs opened and healed. He found that maintaining a healthy
      diet and the use of urine (fasting and external applications) has
      kept his cancer in a prolonged state of remission.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1984 we have been using urine therapy in our practice and
      have found it beneficial for many diseases ranging from skin
      problems and even carcinomas. We would welcome more information on
      urine therapy and would be pleased to participate in an
      international conference. Bodylife School of Practical Healing

      <b>BURNS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mrs. B. - One day I wanted to make sure my iron was turned off
      before I left the house, so I checked the iron surface with the
      palm of my hand expecting it to be cold. To my surprise, the iron
      was hot and I burned my hand severely. Then I remembered that some
      weeks earlier I had stored a bottle containing urine. I used the
      urine from the bottle and covered my burns with it. The pain soon
      subsided and a few hours later, my hand looked and felt as though
      nothing had happened to it. No blisters, no scars and no redness
      remained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CANDIDA</b><br>
      <br>
      Ms. L.M. -My experience with urine therapy was that I was able to
      solve a difficult chronic yeast infection, as well a chronic
      constipation problem. Also, I began my menstrual flow after a
      three year cessation after using urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Ms. M.G. - I have had a chronic case of severe candida for many
      years as a result of taking large doses of antibiotics for a long
      period for a sinus infection. I tried every drug my doctor would
      give me, such as Nizoral and Nystatin, and also many herbs, but
      the candida would not go away and even showed up in blood tests.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I heard about urine therapy and began drinking it three
      times a day. After only a few days, the relief was tremendous. The
      vaginal burning and itching stopped completely, the water weight
      disappeared, and my energy returned. I've been taking it for some
      time now, my headaches and general itching are gone, and I feel
      better than I have in years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CHILDREN'S COMPLAINTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ms. M.D.- I am raising a grandchild who got a very back start in
      life, she was bombarded with antibiotics for inner ear infections
      and other problems. With good diet and care she got much better,
      but she was wide open for eery allergy imaginable, (she had severe
      skin rashes, scaling, etc.). When she was 2,3, and 4-years-old,
      she could hardly breathe at night and was always stuffed up.<br>
      <br>
      I started her on three then five drops of her own urine one time
      per day about a week ago. Let me tell you that this child is a
      different person.<br>
      Her nose is completely free of mucus and I can't believe the
      personality change. From a whiny, clingy irritating child, she is
      acting happy, attacks her school work with a vigor I never saw
      before. She sleeps clear through the night, with no restlessness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CYSTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Mrs. D. - Was seeking relief from sebaceous cysts which were all
      over the face and neck. She had the cysts for over a year and had
      been to many doctors, taken medication and tried countless skin
      creams. Then she decided to try urine therapy. After rubbing urine
      on the cysts for about a week, the cysts opened and drained, and
      new skin began to form. Over a period of three weeks, her skin
      completely healed. She commented that she now applies urine to her
      face daily and that her complexion has never looked as good.<br>
      <br>
      <b>COLITIS</b><br>
      <br>
      Mr. M. - I have been hospitalized three time in the past year for
      gastrointestinal problems created by my strong negative reactions
      to antibiotics administered for lung infections. I refused to
      continue with the medication, however, my rectal bleeding from
      colitis and internal hemorrhoids continued.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, a friend told me that he was familiar, from
      childhood, with the use of urine enemas for problems such as mine,
      so I began using urine for daily enemas for a week. By the end of
      the week, the bleeding had stopped completely and now, several
      months later, I have not passed a single drop of blood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEPRESSION, IMMUNE DEFICIENCY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. D. -I was suffering from an undefined immune deficiency
      problem. I had many skin problems (rashes and ulcers) and for
      weeks was running a low grade fever. I always felt tired and very
      depressed. I could not work and this just added to my problem of
      financial difficulties from all the doctor bills and medication I
      had tried. One night I was extremely depressed. I had heard about
      urine therapy and, even though I was very skeptical, I tried it.
      Within a week my energy came back by at least 60%. My diet had not
      been very good, and after beginning urine therapy, I experienced
      detoxifying symptoms of rashes and high fever for several days. I
      realized that my body had been trying to get rid of these toxins
      through my skin for a long time (which was why I had chronic skin
      problems), but I had suppressed it with many medications. I
      continued with the therapy. Today, I am back at work again, the
      depression is gone and I am a different person.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DIABETES</b><br>
      <br>
      Miss D. -Reported to have juvenile diabetes. After ingesting urine
      for about a month, she found that she can eliminate her evening
      dose of insulin. She tested her blood sugar constantly. About a
      month later, she reported that she was ready to further reduce her
      insulin intake. While using urine externally, she also noticed her
      varicose veins starting to diminish. She is feeling well and has
      had no other problems while on urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Mrs. Kunjama, Ban galore, India - This lady was suffering from
      diabetes, was overweight and had occasional breathing troubles for
      about 12 years and had to be frequently hospitalized whenever her
      temperature ran high every two or three months. Ayurvedic,
      homeopathic and other medicines had no effect. Insulin injections
      reduced her suffering to a certain extent, but there was no
      diminution in her + 2.75 of sugar in her urine at any time.<br>
      <br>
      Mrs. Kunjama began the intake of her own urine as many times as
      she passed and sipped water. The nurse did the required massage of
      the body with old urine and helped the lady to wash herself with
      lukewarm water. On the first day she suffered slightly from
      diarrhea. After three weeks, her weight was reduced and her
      breathing trouble ceased. The family doctor was surprised when he
      detected no trace of sugar in her urine at the end of the
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HEPATITIS 8</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. R. W and Mr. R. T. - We are both practitioners of the Natural
      Health Theory here in Switzerland. Due to the kindness of a close
      acquaintance of ours in the U.S. we recently received a copy of
      your most interesting book, Your Own Perfect Medicine, which
      greatly impressed us. The 'natural medicines theory' with urine is
      not new to us ... for quite some time now we have been applying
      this theory as well as doing experimental research work on the
      subject with extremely positive and successful results. Among
      other things, for the cure of Hepatitis B, to mention just one
      point.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LUNG CONDITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. N. - Complained of chest, lung and sinus congestion. After
      approximately two weeks of both internal and external urine
      therapy, the congestion disappeared and he was able to breathe
      easily.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MULTIPLE DISORDERS</b><br>
      <br>
      Ms. A.R.- I have always tried to take good care of myself, but
      somehow over the years, several diseases crept up on me. In my 40s
      and 50s, I developed alopecia areata (extensive hair loss). Later,
      I developed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sclerosis (hardening of body·
      and nerve tissues). I also contracted systemic scleroderma (an
      autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks it own tissues) and
      Raynaud's Disease (a circulatory disorder that cuts off blood flow
      to fingers and toes). Epstein-Barr developed, too.<br>
      <br>
      When the Alopecia began, I would get 3-4 bald spots on my head. My
      doctor would inject them with cortisone, but eventually I went
      totally bald. Then I lost all my eyelashes, the hair in my nose
      and on my arms and legs. It was absolutely horrible. With the
      Raynaud's, my fingers stung as though they were stuck to ice. I
      would cry and run hot water over them, but it just came back. I
      was terribly depressed and really didn't want to live anymore.
      Then I found out about Your Own Perfect Medicine and decided that
      I had to try it. I started with one drop a day and then gradually
      increased to six drops a day after a week. Then I noticed that my
      fingers were not hurting nearly as much as usual. I started urine
      therapy in November, 1994. By Feb 1995, I was taking eight large
      eye droppers and by now I began to see short patches of hair
      appearing. I continued on the therapy and my hair continued to
      grow in steadily. On May 29, 1995, off came my wig and I also
      noticed my eyelashes growing back. By July 1995 I had all my hair,
      eyelashes, nose hair, arms and legs. by September 1995, I was
      taking 20 large eyedroppers a day, and I now have a beautiful head
      of hair - thicker than ever. My skin is softer and I feel really
      good. The Raynaud's symptoms, chronic fatigue, arthritis are all
      gone. On August 24, 1995, I had a physical -everything was OK!
      Urine therapy is the answer. I thank God every day for this
      miracle. I want to yell it out to the world!<br>
      <br>
      <b>MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. B. W.- I am extremely thankful for this safe and free method
      to rid ourselves of many chronic diseases. After using urine
      therapy, I have<br>
      improved greatly. My diagnosis of chronic progressive multiple
      sclerosis has now become something to be cleared away, and not an
      impenetrable wall as it was before my discovery of urine therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROSTATE PROBLEMS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. J.S.- I had begun to experience pain and difficulty in
      urinating in my early thirties, but as I got closer to forty, the
      problem became much<br>
      worse and my doctor gave me antibiotics and pain medication, which
      not only did not improve the situation but actually made the
      symptoms worse. The doctor told me that he felt that the symptoms
      were due to a problem with my prostrate. I was going to undergo a
      battery of tests when a friend told me about auto-urine therapy. I
      began ingesting just a few drops a couple of times a day, and
      noticed a decrease in pain on urinating almost immediately. I
      continued taking small amounts, and then later fasted for about
      three days. After the fast, all symptoms disappeared. It's been
      more than a year now, and I am completely free of any pain or
      problems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RADIATION THERAPY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ms. S.G.- I've used UT on my hair for years- in fact all through
      radiation therapy (aimed just above the eyebrow on the right), I
      kept my hair. It was a nightly ritual to pour that into my hair
      (collected in the A.M.), rub cod liver oil into it, wrap with a
      towel and soak in a hot tub of water!! It works!<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>RAYNAUD'S SYNDROME</b><br>
      <br>
      Ms. E.P- At 78 years old, I have a great abundance of miseries.
      Recently I developed symptoms of Raynaud's disease and know that
      the prognosis is grave at best.<br>
      <br>
      I have been on UT about one week following the instructions in
      your book. My pleasant surprise is that in that short time my
      symptoms have been reduced 50%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SURVIVAL, MALARIA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Colonel M.L. - This man first discovered the life-enhancing
      qualities, as he called them, of urine while serving with the
      British Army in the western Sahara during World War II. He had
      become separated from his unit after a night skirmish and had been
      slightly wounded on the temple by a ricocheting bullet.<br>
      <br>
      When he awoke the following morning, he found himself alone, at
      the foot of a sand dune with caked blood all over one side of his
      face and head and his water bottle nearly empty. His first
      thoughts were of the horrors of dying of thirst. He then recalled
      that he had been taught in basic training that drinking urine
      could save one's life in a waterless emergency, and he tried it,
      saving the last of his water for drinking afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      He drank two-thirds of a cup of urine and used the remainder to
      moisten his handkerchief which he used as a poultice for his head.
      He reported that when his platoon members returned to look for
      him, they had expected to find a corpse and instead found a
      somewhat parched but cheerful and feverless fighting man who
      returned to action with his platoon three days later.<br>
      <br>
      When, later in the war, his regiment was sent to the Far East to
      fight, he contracted malaria which he cured himself in just three
      days on a urine and water fast, and he reported that he never had
      a recurrence. He continued to drink his urine every day since that
      episode, and after nearly 35 years (at age 59) he reported that he
      was lean, strong and healthy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VENEREAL DISEASE, PARASITES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. S. - One and one-half months ago I was diagnosed with
      gonorrhea and herpes. I took medication and the condition
      improved. But two weeks later the herpes came back and was even
      worse. I then started urine therapy. Within two or three days,
      everything cleared up totally. What was even more amazing to me is
      the parasite problem which I suffered with for quite some time,
      was inadvertently resolved while treating my herpes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WEIGHT LOSS</b><br>
      <br>
      Ms. B.- I not only weighed 198 pounds, but I also had several
      other health problems including rheumatoid arthritis, severe
      chronic migraines and an external fungal infection on my foot. I
      had tried everything to correct these conditions, but nothing had
      worked. I heard about urine therapy and tried it externally on my
      foot, because I had tried every possible medication on the fungal
      infection with no results. I soaked my foot in urine about three
      times a day. Five days later, the fungus was gone. My husband
      thought it was a miracle. Both of us started drinking our urine
      the very next day and to my surprise, my weight loss speeded up
      incredibly. Four and one half months later, I weighed 130 pounds.
      I lost a total of 68 pounds! My arthritis is gone, my headaches
      are gone and I feel like I'm 20 years old!<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHOOPING COUGH</b><br>
      <br>
      Mr. J.R. - When I was 5 or 6 years old I had a whooping cough. The
      doctor told my mother to give me urine. Two to three days later,
      my cough was cured and at the same time worms cam out of my body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WOUNDS</b><br>
      <br>
      Mr. K. - I was involved in an accident in which a huge rock fell
      from a height of about four feet directly onto my left foot. I was
      not wearing closed shoes and the stone ripped almost all the flesh
      and my toe nail from, luckily, only the middle toe.<br>
      <br>
      As I was traveling in a foreign country, I was unable to get
      proper medical care and I was extremely worried about infection. I
      applied an antiseptic creme that I had, but with no results.<br>
      <br>
      After a few days, my toe was an indefinable mass of black and red
      tissue. Then I met a woman who told me to wrap my foot in a cloth
      soaked in urine. I did it and was amazed to see how quickly my toe
      started to heal. New pink skin appeared, pieces of old and damaged
      skin fell off and within a couple of days, the toe looked nearly
      normal again. I kept the cloth wet all the time with fresh urine
      and occasionally with old urine which I collected in a bottle.<br>
      <br>
      Now I have become accustomed to drinking my urine and have my
      share of the "water of life" every morning.<br>
      <br>
      As I mentioned before, John Armstrong's book, the Water of Life,
      and Margie Adelman's, Miracles of Urine Therapy, contain many more
      inspiring testimonials which make extremely interesting and
      enjoyable reading.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I wish each one of you the very best of health and hope that you,
      as so many others have done, find renewed health, vigor and long
      life with your body's own perfect medicine.<br>
      <br>
