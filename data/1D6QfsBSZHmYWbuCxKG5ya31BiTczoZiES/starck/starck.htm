      -To reduce this speed of takeoff and especially the vitl-se

      <br>
      In order to remedy.vantages of these drawbacks, we made of
      aircraft in which the cell sustenance such AIL, combined with a

      both gran speeds and take-offs and landing at reduced speed.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stark AS20 of 1942</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Not a captured aircraft, this machine was designed and flown under
      the German occupation and was painted with a swastika for flight
      evaluation only. André Starck started to design his first
      aircraft, the AS20, in 1938. It was to have the so-called
      Nénadovich biplane configuration with the tandem-mounted wings
      providing a continuous slot effect for exceptional c.g. travel and
      very low stalling speed. In 1941 construction commenced with the
      permission of the German occupation authorities. The first flight
      with André Starck himself as pilot took place on 23 October 1942.
      The aircraft reached speeds of more than 200 km/h. The flight
      evaluation resulted in some modifications. When the French pilot
      Finance failed in his 'escape bid' to Great Britain with the
      Holste MH20 (he had to make a forced landing) all flying of
      French-owned aircraft was prohibited by the German authorities.
      Minus its engine the AS20 was stored at Villacoublay where it
      still remained after the war.<br>
      <br>
      A photo of this machine was published in the German magazine "Der
      Sportflieger" of 1942. <br>

      Bonjour<br>
      <br>
      On ne trouve que très peu d'information sur le constructeur André
      Starck.<br>
      <br>
      Il faut quand même savoir que c'est un avion Starck qui a reçu le
      premier CNRA juste après la guerre.<br>
      <br>
      Pour un avion de 1946, ce Starck AS 70 quelque peu modifié dans
      les années 70 à quand même de la gueule<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">STARCK ATTITUDE</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      André Starck fait partie de ces concepteurs d'avions légers en
      marge de ses contemporains.<br>
      <br>
      Discret, il conçut néanmoins une véritable lignée d'avions de
      sport dès les années 1940, qui, pour certains marquèrent leur
      temps, tel que l'AS - 10, biplace à moteur en étoile.<br>
      <br>
      Au début des années 1970, les sports aériens s'orientèrent vers
      une discipline émergeante du vol libre, qui provoqua un bel
      engouement populaire : le deltaplane.<br>
      <br>
      André Starck, quant à lui, étudia la plupart de ses appareils
      autour d'un concept d'ailes décalées, dotées d'ailerons, à
      l'inverse de la formule Pou du Ciel, qui en était dépourvue.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">UN DELTAPLANE GOUVERNABLE</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      André Starck créa notamment l'AS - 37, un curieux avion à ailes
      décalées reliées entre elles, monomoteur, mais propulsé par deux
      hélices de part et d'autre du fuselage et dirigées vers l'arrière.<br>
      <br>
      En 1974, s'intéressant à la cause des pilotes sportifs et ultra -
      légers, Starck se pencha sur un planeur léger, toujours
      caractérisé par sa formule d'ailes décalées et rejointes entre
      elles à leurs extrémités. Ce planeur respectait le pilotage
      manuel, fidèle aux deltaplanes, mais ses caractéristiques,
      notamment en matière de sécurité et de performances, surclassaient
      les ailes dites delta.<br>
      <br>
      Starck le diffusa sous la forme de plans destinés aux
      constructeurs amateurs et, en vendit de nombreuses liasses.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">L'ANECDOTE :</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Le Stabiplan, baptisé ainsi par André Starck, fait partie de ces
      machines volantes un temps soit peu fantaisistes... On ne sait pas
      si cette aile volante, formule Starck, volait bien, malgré la
      centaine de liasses diffusées.<br>
      En outre, poursuivant l'étude de son appareil, André Starck
      extrapola aussi une version ULM - Ultra Léger Motorisé - de son
      appareil, qu'il désigna AS - 07 M. Un moteur de tronçonneuse
      suffisait à le propulser...<br>
      <br>
      L'AS - 07 Stabiplan se présentait comme un biplan de sécurité à
      fente pilotable, à structure auto - compensée de 23 kg.<br>
      <br>
      De bonnes finesse et stabilité, il était doté d'empennages dits
      papillon, en forme de V, qui le différenciait des deltaplanes
      traditionnels.<br>
      <br>
      L'appareil possédait l'avantage de ne pas décrocher.<br>
      <br>
      Il était de fabrication simple et légère en tubes de duralumin
      entoilés et , pouvait être démonté rapidement.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nenadovich biplanes?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      April 08, 2011<br>
      <br>
      In the French press I have seen the term "Nenadovich biplane"
      applied both to tandem-wing designs (Mignet, Delanne, etc.) and to
      aircraft with conventional tail surfaces but using two biplane
      wings in a staggered, box-wing configuration (Stark AS.27 and
      AS.37, for example).&nbsp; The key concept seems to be the slot
      effect between the two wings.&nbsp; Does anyone know any more
      about the origin of this terminology and, presumably, the aircraft
      designed or built by Mr. Nenadovich that inspired it?<br>

      Miroslave Nenadovitch was working at the Institut Aeronautique of
      St Cyr, close to Paris, in 1936.<br>
      <br>
      Rush translation of the article (below) from Aviation magazine
      concerning the Starck AS-27 (date ?).<br>
      <br>
      "Nenadovitch tested in wind-tunnel around 150 biplanes
      configurations. His configuration presented a lower Cx max and
      higher Cz max than an equivalent monoplane formula. His
      configuration did not stall at high incidence angles. In fact the
      top of the polar was absolutely flat. The two planes parameters
      interacting as a big slot always open."<br>
      <br>
      I don't think he designed an aircraft as such, out of his wind
      tunnel tests. But André Starck did design and test his AS-20 in
      1942 retaining this formula, then he used it on his AS-27 and
      AS-37.<br>

      The Starck AS80 Holiday was designed in 1947 by French designer
      Andre Starck. It is a two seater in a similar class to the Piper
      Cub; its 75hp Regnier engine enables it to cruise at 90mph, and it
      has a range of 200 miles. Gross weight is 1,210lb; it is 21 feet 5
      inches long and has a wing span of 32 feet 5 inches.<br>

      <br>
      03/31/2008. Avions André Starck of Boulogne-Billancourt, France
      designed a half a dozen single and two-seat light aircraft.
      Intended for the homebuilder, the Holyday two-seater of 1947 was
      the largest with a span of 32 ft 10 in (10.0 m). The prototype was
      powered by a 75 hp Régnier four-cylinder in-line inverted
      air-cooled engine, a range of 65 to 75 hp alternative engines
      could be used. At a cruising speed of 88 mph (142 kmh) the
      aircraft had a range of 200 mls (315 km).<br>
      <br>
      The pictured aircraft was produced in 1948 by Mr. Lavadoux and was
      first registered as F-WGGA, after it received its CofA it was
      reregistered as<br>
      F-PGGA. It came on the UK register on June 17, 1981. It is powered
      by a 65 hp Continental A65-1 engine. <br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> 04/30/2008. Remarks by Walter
          van Tilborg: "The small company of André Starck built several
          light aircraft designs after WW2 and the A.S.70 was first
          flown on May 23, 1945. The aircraft had one 45 hp Salmson 9Ad
          radial engine and was during the 1990s completely restored and
          is still active as homebuilt. However, rather then being
          registered in the F-P... homebuilt series, it retained its
          F-AZGY registration in the antique/classic series. The sole
          A.S.70 was followed by a small number of aircraft, A.S.71 to
          A.S.75 (differing in the engine installed) and by the A.S.27,
          A.S.37, A.S.57, A.S.80 and A.S.90 designs."<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The ability of
      a sinusoidally plunging airfoil to produce thrust, known as the
      Knoller–Betz or Katzmayr effect, is investigated
      experimentallyandnumerically.Water-tunnel experiments are
      performed providing owvisualization and laser Doppler velocimetry
      data of the unsteady wakes formed by the plunging foils. Vortical
      structures and time-averagedvelocity pro les in the wake are
      compared with numerical computationsfrom a previously developed
      inviscid, unsteady panel code that utilizes a nonlinear wake
      model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are excellent over
      a broad range of reduced frequencies and Strouhal numbers,
      indicating that the formation and evolution of the
      thrust-indicative wake structures are primarily inviscid
      phenomena. Results at Strouhal numbers greater than about 1.0
      (based on plunge amplitude) demonstrate nonsymmetric, de ected
      wake patterns, where both an average thrust and an average lift
      are produced. These highly nonlinear wake formations are generated
      reproducibly, both experimentally and numerically.<br>
