    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">TEL-AVIV,
      Israel, June 11 /PRNewswire/ -- HCL CleanTech
      (http://www.hclcleantech.com), an Israeli company co founded by
      Prof. Avram Baniel and Prof. Ari Eyal has developed a proprietary
      full HCL recovery process, which makes an old, industrially-proven
      German Cellulosic to fermentable sugars and Ethanol process
      economically very attractive. The new technology can also "clean"
      and improve other HCL dependant industries. Modern Chemical
      technology makes the implementation straightforward and immediate.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">The study and
      development of chemical processes which use acids for the
      conversion of Lignocellulosic material (biomass) to fermentable
      sugars and ethanol have been going on for about a century. The
      main reason none of them have been economically viable is that in
      most of them yields are low due to the formation of useless
      by-products at a significant percentage of the desired sugars.
      There is however one particular process that provides near 100%
      conversion to constituent sugars and that has been fully proven
      through years of operation on a large industrial scale. The only
      reason that this excellent process (usually named Bergius after
      its Nobel Prize winning developer) was used extensively only
      during World War II period were the high operating costs. The use
      of fuming acid (HCL gas) in the Bergius process ensures high
      yields, but the costs of recovery and reconcentration of the HCL
      has made the process costs too high for economic viability - until
      now.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">HCL-CleanTech
      proprietary technology changes this Lignocellulosics to Ethanol
      process and makes it economically attractive by dramatically
      reducing the most costly part of the process. Recovering HCl in
      gaseous form directly from its solutions, by means of the
      HCL-CleanTech proprietary process provides for drastic costs
      reduction while preserving the high yields of the industrially
      proven Bergius cold hydrolysis.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">This concept
      allows for a large variety of feedstock, requires very little
      water and is virtually self sufficient energetically. Calculations
      done by a US Chemical Engineering company in a study for HCL
      CleanTech indicate that costs per 1 gallon of Ethanol manufactured
      using this concept will be below $1 (US).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">HCL CleanTech's
      technology for the recovery of HCl from aqueous solutions and
      industrial processes based on the core technology can provide
      complete acid recovery solutions to HCL dependent industries (such
      as the PVC industry). This would not only significantly reduce
      operating costs, but would make those industries far more
      environmentally friendly.<br>

          hydrochloric acid to make cheap sugar from cellulose</b></font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in;">Biofuels
      start-up HCL Cleantech has received a first infusion of venture
      capital funding from Burrill &amp; Co. and Khosla Ventures, two
      big names in clean energy investing. HCL, based in Tel-Aviv,
      Israel, has revived a World War II-era process for converting
      cellulosic feedstocks to sugar, a potential biofuel feedstock,
      using concentrated hydrochloric acid.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">HCL Cleantech was founded in
      December 2007 to commercialize technology adapted from an
      invention by Nobel Prize-winning German chemist Friedrich Bergius.
      The Bergius process was used in Germany during World War II when
      the country suffered from a shortage of fuel and sugar. But
      difficulties in recovering the concentrated hydrochloric acid made
      the process too expensive to commercialize.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">HCL CEO Eran Baniel says his company
      has figured out how to completely recover 42% hydrochloric acid
      through solvent extraction. Baniel claims that using the acid
      makes for a simple and low-cost conversion to sugar compared to
      other methods such as enzyme-based degradation. He says the
      technology can hydrolyze a wide variety of cellulosic feedstocks
      without drying or pretreatment, uses little water or energy, and
      produces high sugar yields with fewer unwanted byproducts.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">Initially, Baniel says, the company
      planned to go into ethanol production, but "we promptly realized
      we have little to contribute to fermentation technology. We'll go
      as far as we can to be the best at producing low cost sugars, and
      we’ll find enough partners in the U.S. who can go from sugar to
      any end product."</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">Some of those partners may be other
      Khosla-backed ventures in the renewable fuels sector, such as
      Amyris, LS9, and Gevo.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">Peter J. Reilly, professor of
      engineering at Iowa State University's Department of Chemical and
      Biological Engineering points out that most cellulosic biofuels
      firms use sulfuric acid because its cheap, or enzymes because they
      can be engineered for high yields. He says he is intrigued by
      HCL's Cleantech’s process. "The use of solvent to recycle
      hydrochloric acid is interesting—that's the key part of this
      story." Reilly says that one possible problem with using
      hydrochloric acid would be corrosion in the production vessels,
      though the company may resort to using glass-lined tanks.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in;">HCL did not disclose the amount of
      funding it has received, but the company plans to invest the money
      in a pilot plant in North Carolina that will go on-line by the end
      of 2010. The plant will take in 1.25 tons per day of cellulosic
      feedstock.</p>

      -- The invention provides a process for the recovery of HCI from a
      dilute solution thereof, comprising: a) bringing a dilute aqueous
      HCI solution into contact with a substantially immiscible
      extractant, said extractant comprising: 1) an oil soluble amine
      which amine is substantially water insoluble both in free and in
      salt form; 2) an oil soluble organic acid which acid is
      substantially water insoluble both in free and in salt form; and
      3) a solvent for the amine and organic acid; whereupon HCI
      selectively transfers to said extractant to form an HCI-carrying
      extractant; and b) treating said HCI-carrying extractant to obtain
      gaseous HCI.</p>
