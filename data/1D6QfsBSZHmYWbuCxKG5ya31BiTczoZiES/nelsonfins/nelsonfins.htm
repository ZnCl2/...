          A fin and a method providing thrust from an unusually low drag
          kick by a swimmer are disclosed. The fin includes a fin for
          use by a swimmer comprising a foot pocket adapted to receive a
          foot of the swimmer; a foil shaped blade extending from the
          foot pocket; composite hydrodynamic flex control framework
          configured to allow the blade to bend within a narrow range of
          angles of attack under a wide range of loads while enhancing
          hydrodynamic performance. The method comprises providing a fin
          comprising a foot pocket, a foil shaped blade, an aperture,
          and two living hinges positioned adjacent to foot pocket. The
          method also comprises bending the blade relative to the foot
          pocket about an axis that is nearer the heel of the swimmer to
          reduce centrifugal forces while controlling the bending of the
          blade by providing living hinges formed to increase resistance

          place with the swimmer's feet staying within the swimmer's
          slip stream.<br>

          drive (forward propulsive thrust) and decreasing effort
          (resistance to vertical motion) to provide a greater

          Methods are disclosed for increasing lift and decreasing drag
          on hydrofoils and swim fins. These methods include providing a
          hydrofoil with a highly swept back leading edge portion and
          orienting the hydrofoil at a significantly reduced angle of
          attack in which the reduced angle of attack occurs at an angle
          that is substantially transverse to the hydrofoil's direction
          of movement through a surrounding fluid medium. The lee
          surfaces of the hydrofoil is provided with a substantially
          unobstructed flow path as well as a separation reducing
          contour so as to permit lift generating attached flow
          conditions to form along such lee surfaces. Substantially
          rigid structural reinforcement is provided to prevent the
          hydrofoil from deforming significantly during use. Methods are
          disclosed for providing a hydrofoil with a substantially
          longitudinal recess or venting system located substantially
          along the center axis of the hydrofoil. The attacking surfaces
          of such a hydrofoil is provided with an anhedral contour that
          forms a substantially lengthwise channel with the recess or
          venting means located along the center axis of this lengthwise
          channel. The anhedral contour directs water toward the center
          axis of the lengthwise channel, and the central recess or
          venting system permits water to flow through it toward the lee
          surfaces in order to reduce the occurrence of outward directed
          spanwise flow conditions along the attacking surfaces and
          encourage inward directed spanwise flow conditions to occur
          along the attacking surfaces. The central recess or venting
          system also permits the water flowing in an attached manner
          along the lee surfaces of the hydrofoil to merge with the
          water flowing from the attacking surfaces through the recess
          or venting system so that lift is efficiently generated.
          Methods are disclosed for applying these lift generating and
          drag reducing methods to both non-flexible and flexible
          hydrofoil blades that are used in reciprocating propulsion
          strokes through a fluid medium. Methods are disclosed for
          permitting flexible hydrofoils to deform in a manner which
          permits such efficient flow conditions to form under
          significantly light reciprocating strokes while simultaneously
          providing sufficient structural reinforcement to enable such
          flow conditions to be maintained without experiencing
          undesirable forms of deformation. Also provided are methods
          for significantly controlling and reducing the build up of
          torsional stress forces within a flexible hydrofoil as it is
          encouraged to twist to a reduced angle of attack during use so
          that such a twisted form is created with significant
          improvements in efficiency, contour, and ease.<br>
