      Do you suffer from chronic lung congestion? Has Bronchial Hygiene
      Therapy (BHT) been recommended to you?<br>
      <br>
      Now, thanks to the Lung Flute, you can breathe easier.<br>
      <br>
      The Lung Flute is indicated for Positive Expiratory Pressure
      therapy, which is an important part of BHT. BHT can be used for a
      variety for congestive conditions such as: COPD, bronchitis,
      pneumonia, asthma, emphysema or other chronic respiratory
      ailments.<br>
      <br>
      When you endure lung congestion with thick, chronic mucus that is
      difficult to break up, breathing can be a constant struggle. You
      may have to rely on medications, inhalers, oxygen therapy or even
      surgery to open up your airways. Everyday activities can become an
      effort.<br>
      <br>
      The Lung Flute from Medical Acoustics can help.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA-cleared Lung Flute is the only product that uses sound
      vibration to stimulate your body's natural mucus-clearing system –
      effectively thinning and dislodging mucus deep in the lungs so
      that it's easier to cough up. The small, reusable, plastic device
      is non-invasive, easy to use and drug-free – just blow into the
      mouthpiece and the device will do the rest.<br>
      <br>
      Clinical tests have proven the Lung Flute's ability to break up
      mucus in the lungs, making it equally effective for both
      therapeutic and diagnostic use. Unlike other devices, which rely
      on pressure and can't reach deep lung mucus, the Lung Flute's
      technology is based on low-frequency acoustic waves that are
      produced when you blow into the flute-shaped device.<br>

      A lung flute is a medical device used to clear mucus from
      congested lungs with low-frequency sound waves. The device
      consists of a mouthpiece and a plastic reed which vibrates within
      a chamber to create sound waves in the chest cavity. These sound
      waves vibrate and break up mucus deposits in the lungs, allowing
      cilia to more easily move these deposits from the lungs to the
      throat.<br>
      <br>
      Invented by acoustics engineer Sandy Hawkins, the lung flute is
      currently in use as a diagnostic tool in Japan, Europe, and
      Canada,[1] and on January 4, 2010 was granted approval by the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United
      States.[2]<br>

      </b>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FOWLER-HAWKINS SANFORD ELLIOT
      <br>
      <br>
      A device for thinning lung secretions comprises a housing, a reed
      disposed in the housing, and an acoustical resistance. The reed
      produces a low-frequency audio shockwave in a range of about 12 Hz
      to about 30 Hz when vibrated. The acoustical resistance couples a
      patient lung cavity to the audio shockwave, thereby vibrating the
      patient's lung cavity to thin lung secretions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The human lungs comprise a natural means for clearing mucus. Human
      lungs contain tiny clearing cilia that vibrate at approximately 18
      Hz. At that frequency, mucus has a significant phase change from a
      viscous to fluid to thinner secretions. Accordingly, the cilia
      operate to loosen the mucus by making it more fluid. Once the
      mucus is more fluid, it can be more easily expelled.<br>
      <br>
      Some patients with weak lungs, disease, or other ailments have
      lungs that cannot create a sufficient phase change in the viscous
      mucus. Additionally, a doctor may need to induce a sputum sample
      from a patient. Accordingly, an artificial means of vibrating the
      lungs at approximately 18 Hz can be used to supplement the
      patient's natural mucus system. In some cases, an artificial means
      of vibrating the lungs can produce the same phase change in mucus
      as produced by the lungs' natural cilia.<br>
      <br>
      One conventional method for artificially vibrating a patient's
      lungs is by using pulses of air pressure introduced through the
      mouth and into the lungs. However, such a method can produce
      dangerously high air pressures, which can damage the fragile air
      sacs in the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      Another conventional method for artificially vibrating a patient's
      lungs is by using low frequency audio of approximately 18 Hz to
      make lung secretions thinner. Low frequency audio does not induce
      potentially dangerous high air pressures in the lungs that are
      associated with the air pulses discussed above. However,
      conventional methods require very high audio power to cause
      vibration at low frequencies. Common loudspeaker components can be
      used to provide a high-powered audio source for vibrating the
      lungs. However, the life expectancy of the high-powered audio
      drivers is low, and the cost of the high-powered audio drivers is
      high. Additionally, powered subwoofers and loudspeakers typically
      are not disposable or portable.<br>
      <br>
      A patient's lungs and vocal cords make a particularly efficient
      loudspeaker in the vocal range. However, low frequencies are not
      efficiently produced because both the vocal cords and the lungs
      are too small. If the lungs could be made larger, they would
      support low frequency audio production, and they also would couple
      efficiently to a low frequency audio source.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a need in the art exists for a system and method that
      can provide a low-cost, disposable, and/or portable, artificial
      means of vibrating a patient's lungs to cause a viscous change in
      mucus contained therein. A need in the art also exists for an
      efficient means of coupling a patient's lungs with an audio source
      to produce a low frequency vibration in the lungs. Additionally,
      there exists a need in the art for a non-powered, low-frequency
      audio source for artificially vibrating a patient's lungs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention can provide a device and method for
      artificially vibrating a patient's lungs to cause a viscosity
      change in mucus contained therein. The device and method can be
      used to clean mucus from the lungs or to induce a sputum sample
      for diagnostic purposes from the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      The lung vibrating device and method according to the present
      invention can allow the lungs to produce low frequency audio that
      can vibrate the lungs at the desired frequency to change the
      viscosity of mucus. Typically, human lungs are too small to
      produce low-frequency audio sound. The lung vibrating device and
      method according to the present invention can comprise an
      acoustical resistance that can increase the apparent volume of the
      lungs, thereby allowing the lungs to produce low-frequency audio
      in the desired range. The acoustical resistance can allow the
      lungs to couple efficiently to an audio source to produce
      low-frequency shockwaves. The acoustical resistance can make the
      audio source behave as if it is operating in a much larger volume
      than the body cavity alone, thereby allowing low-frequency audio
      to be produced and considerably improving energy transfer
      efficiency. The present invention can generate relatively low
      frequencies efficiently by using an acoustical coupling technique
      based on Thiele-Small loudspeaker parameters.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the present invention can use the
      acoustical resistance to improve the transfer of audio energy to a
      body cavity such as the lungs. The device can produce low
      frequency audio and then can use the body cavity as a loudspeaker
      enclosure. The acoustical resistance can couple the body cavity
      efficiently to the low frequency sound. Additionally, the
      acoustical resistance can efficiently couple the
      sound/audio/shockwave to the body cavity to vibrate the lungs at
      the desired frequency. Accordingly, small and inexpensive sound
      sources can efficiently generate low frequency audio in body
      cavities.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary aspect of the present invention, a lung vibrating
      device can comprise a reed disposed in a housing. A patient can
      blow air through the housing, which can cause the reed to vibrate
      and produce an audio shockwave. An acoustical resistance of the
      device can couple the audio shockwave produce by the reed with the
      lungs to produce low-frequency vibrations. Accordingly, the
      acoustical resistance can provide a back pressure that can
      transmit the low-frequency vibrations into the lungs to cause a
      viscosity change in mucus.<br>
      <br>

      invention will become apparent from the following detailed
      description of the exemplary embodiments, read in conjunction
      with, and reference to, the accompanying drawings.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described
      below with reference to FIGS. 1-12 in which the same reference
      numerals represent similar elements.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1A illustrates a perspective, cut-away view of a lung
      vibrating device 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. FIG. 1B illustrates a cross-sectional, side
      view of the exemplary lung vibrating device 100. The device 100
      comprises an unpowered, disposable audio noisemaker. As shown in
      FIGS. 1A and 1B, the device 100 comprises a harmonica-type, free
      reed 104 in a housing 102. The device 100 also comprises an
      acoustical resistance 106 disposed within the housing 102.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 102 can comprise a standard respiratory tube or other
      suitable material. As shown, the reed 104 can be coupled at point
      P to an insert 102a disposed in the housing 102. Alternatively,
      the reed 104 can be provided in a separate end cap (not shown)
      that couples to an end of the housing 102. The reed 104 can be
      coupled to the housing 102, or to the housing insert 102a, by any
      suitable method. For example, the reed 104 can be glued or
      sonically welded to the housing 102 or insert 102a.<br>
      <br>
      The reed 104 can be formed from any suitable material such as
      plastic, wood, or metal, or combinations of those materials. In
      one exemplary embodiment, the reed 104 can be formed of solid
      brass. In another exemplary embodiment, the reed 104 can be formed
      of Mylar. In another exemplary embodiment, the reed 104 can be a
      composite of several materials. For example, the reed 104 can be
      formed of two Mylar sheets with an inner stiffening material. The
      stiffening material can be any suitable material, for example, tin
      foil.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of the reed 104 can be increased by providing a
      weight (not shown) on its free end. For a more complete discussion
      of weighting the free end of the reed, see the discussion below
      with reference to FIGS. 9A-9F. The weight can assist the reed 104
      in vibrating as air flows past it. Alternatively or additionally,
      the efficiency of the reed 104 can be increased by providing an
      airfoil (not shown) on its free end. As air flows past the reed
      104, the airfoil provides lift, which cause the free end of the
      reed 104 to rise. As the airfoil rises with the free end, the
      airfoil stalls, causing the reed 104 to fall.<br>
      <br>
      Because the lung clearing cilia of most patients operate at
      approximately 18 Hz, the device 100 does not need to reproduce a
      wide frequency range of sound. Accordingly, in an exemplary
      embodiment, the device 100 can be tuned to an operating frequency
      of about 18 Hz, or it can be tuned to match the operating
      frequency of a specific patient's cilia. Matching the acoustical
      resistance of the device to the patient's lung cavity can make the
      device efficient and inexpensive. In an alternative exemplary
      embodiment, the device can be tuned to operate in a frequency
      range of about 12 Hz to about 24 Hz. In another alternative
      exemplary embodiment, the device can be tuned to operate in a
      frequency range of about 16 Hz to about 20 Hz. In other exemplary
      embodiments, the device can be tuned to operate at a frequency
      within ranges of about 12 Hz to about 30 Hz, about 20 Hz to about
      30 Hz, and about 25 Hz to about 30 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding the vibration frequency of the device, a reed can be
      tuned to vibrate at the desired frequency. Alternatively, a
      process called sub-harmonic doubling can be used. In that process,
      the reed can be tuned to vibrate at a frequency that is about
      double the desired frequency. However, in sub-harmonic doubling,
      an additional shockwave is produced at about one-half of the
      vibration frequency. Accordingly, the additional shockwave is
      produced at about the desired frequency. For example, the reed can
      be tuned to vibrate at about 36 Hz, thereby producing an
      additional shockwave at the desired frequency of about 18 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the
      acoustical resistance 106 can comprise a small piece of foam, a
      medical HEPTA filter of the desired acoustical resistance, or a
      cone tapering down to a smaller diameter. In another alternative
      exemplary embodiment, a variable acoustical resistance can be used
      to tune the system to a particular patient. For example, the
      acoustical resistance 106 can be a variably compressed piece of
      foam, interchangeable HEPTA filters having different resistances,
      or a variable shutter or valve giving an adjustable exit diameter.
      Alternatively, the acoustical resistance 106 can be replaced with
      a movable piston (not shown) disposed on the exit end of the
      housing 102. The movable piston can control the amount of
      resistance provided to air exiting the housing 102.<br>
      <br>
      To use the device 100 for lung cleaning or sputum sample
      induction, a patient exhales through the housing 102 of the device
      100 for about 3 minutes or less. As the patient exhales through
      the housing 102, air enters the housing in the direction A through
      end 102d of the housing 102 and exits the housing 102 and end
      102e. The air passing by reed 104 causes the reed 104 to vibrate.
      The reed 104 can be tuned to vibrate at about 18 Hz (or to a
      frequency corresponding to the patient's cilia). The device can
      produce a volume of about 10 dBa to about 75 dBa. In alternative
      exemplary embodiments, the device can be tuned to produce a volume
      of about 10 dBa to about 20 dBa or about 65 dBa to about 75 dBa.
      The pressure resistance produced can be about 2.5 cm H2O at 100
      Lpm. In terms of pressure or power, 70 dBa is about three orders
      of magnitude less than typical activities such as yelling or loud
      continuous coughing.<br>
      <br>
      While the device 100 only applies about between about 75 to about
      100 dBa to the airway, it can drive the thorax hard enough to feel
      the lungs vibrate through thick clothing. By vibrating the lungs
      at approximately 18 Hz, the lung secretions can become thinner,
      allowing the natural cleaning action of the lung's mucus pump to
      dispose of the secretions. After using the device 100, the
      secretions collect at the back of the patient's throat for
      approximately 3 to 12 hours. The patient then can swallow the
      secretions or orally expel them.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a cross section of an exemplary housing insert 102a
      illustrating an exemplary embodiment of the reed 104 disposed in
      the housing 102. To prevent the reed 104 from breaking off and
      being swallowed by a patient (for a patient using the proper end
      of the device 100 but inhaling too hard through the device), a
      free end 104a of the reed 104 can be made large enough that it
      will not fit through the end of the housing insert 102a and into
      the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      If the device 100 is used backwards and the reed vibrates when a
      patient inhales, lung secretions can be driven deeper into the
      lungs. In an exemplary embodiment, to prevent a patient from using
      the device 100 backwards and vibrating the reed 104 while
      inhaling, one or more holes (not shown) can be provided in the
      housing 102 between the acoustical resistance 106 and the exit end
      102e of the housing 102. The hole(s) can allow enough air to enter
      the housing 102 to prevent the reed 104 from vibrating. If a hole
      is provided in the reed end of the housing 102, it can be provided
      between the reed 104 and the acoustical resistance 106.<br>
      <br>
      A powered system (not shown) using the non-powered disposable
      device 100 also can be encompassed by the present invention. An
      exemplary powered system can comprise an external voice coil that
      drives the reed 104 with a small steel element added to the tip of
      the reed 104. The coil can be activated alternately to vibrate the
      reed 104. Some potential applications such as an intensive care
      unit ("ICU") or neonatal lung cleaning may require an externally
      powered system if the patient is unable to exhale through the
      device. Additionally, a powered system can be useful with
      unconscious patients or patients with excessive lung secretions or
      extensive scarring. Another advantage of the powered system
      according to the present invention is that all parts in contact
      with the patients are disposable.<br>
      <br>
      A powered system should not be used while inhaling, as the lung
      secretions can be driven deeper into the lungs. To prevent
      operation of the system while inhaling, the powered system can
      comprise a pressure sensitive flap in the housing 102 that opens
      on inhale, thereby reducing the acoustical coupling and the low
      frequency efficiency below that necessary to cause vibration of
      the reed 104.<br>
      <br>
      The unpowered lung vibrating device 100 also can include the
      intake flap described above. However, the flap may not be
      necessary on the unpowered device, because the reed may not
      vibrate on inhale and the reed seal makes it difficult to inhale
      (if the user is blowing through the right end of the device).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a side view illustrating a lung vibrating device 300
      according to an alternative exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the exemplary lung
      vibrating device 300 illustrated in FIG. 3. As shown, the lung
      vibrating device 300 comprises a first end cap 302 coupled to a
      housing 304. The housing 304 can comprise a substantially uniform
      cross section, as indicated by the substantially equal heights H1.<br>
      <br>
      The first end cap can comprise a mouth piece through which a
      patient blows air in the direction A into the housing 304. A reed
      402 is disposed within the housing 304. The reed 402 comprises a
      fixed end 402a and a free end 402b. As shown in the exemplary
      embodiment of FIG. 4, the fixed end 402a can be compression or
      friction fitted between the first end cap 302 and the housing 304.
      In an exemplary embodiment, one of the housing 304 and the end cap
      302 can comprise a positioning channel (not shown) that positions
      the reed 402 along a center of the housing 304. In another
      exemplary embodiment, one of the housing 304 and the end cap 302
      can comprise ribs (not shown) that contact the fixed end 402a of
      the reed 402 to hold the reed 402 in place. In another exemplary
      embodiment, the fixed end 402a of the reed 402 can comprise a
      T-shape (not shown) that extends outside the end cap 302. The
      T-shape can maintain the reed 402 at the proper position within
      the housing 304 by preventing the reed 402 from slipping into the
      housing 304.<br>
      <br>
      In alternative exemplary embodiments (not shown), the fixed end
      402a of the reed 402 can be glued, sonically welded, or taped to
      either the end cap 302 or the housing 304. Any suitable method for
      coupling the reed to the device is within the scope of the present
      invention. In an exemplary embodiment, an entrance opening of the
      end cap 302 can be small enough to prevent the reed from exiting
      the device and being inhaled by a patient. In an alternative
      exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can comprise vanes (not
      shown) that reduce the open area of the end cap 302 to prevent the
      reed from passing therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 304 can comprise a rectangular or square shape to
      minimize air flow around the reed 402. However, the present
      invention is not limited to only those shapes and encompasses
      other shapes. For example, the housing 204 can be circular, oval,
      or any other suitable shape. Those shapes may incur a slight
      efficiency drop, which can be compensated for by adjusting the
      acoustical resistance of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The reed 402 can comprise any material having a suitable stiffness
      that will not absorb excessive energy from the vibrations. For
      example, the reed 402 can comprise plastic, wood, bone, metal, or
      combinations of those materials. In an exemplary embodiment, the
      reed 402 can comprise Mylar. The Mylar thickness can be in a range
      of about 3.75 mils to about 10 mils. In the exemplary embodiment
      of FIG. 4, the reed comprises Mylar having a thickness of about 5
      mils and a length of about 12.25 inches.<br>
      <br>
      The end cap 302 can be shaped externally to allow a patient' mouth
      to achieve a suitable seal around the end cap 302. For example,
      the end cap 302 can have a circular or oval external shape. Other
      external shapes that achieve a suitable seal are within the scope
      of the present invention. For example, the external shape can be
      square or rectangular.<br>
      <br>
      The end cap 302 can be coupled to the housing 304 by various
      methods. In an exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can be glued
      or sonically welded to the housing 302. In an alternative
      exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can be compression or
      friction fitted onto the housing 304. In another alternative
      exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can interlock with the
      housing 304 through the use of a hook and latch or other suitable
      type of clipping device. In any case, the end cap 302 can be
      coupled to the housing 304 such that the air moving in direction A
      will not leak between the end cap 302 and the housing 304 in an
      amount sufficient to reduce the effectiveness of the device 300.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the housing 304 can be
      suitably shaped on its entrance end to perform the function of a
      mouthpiece. In that embodiment, the end cap 302 can be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the lung vibrating
      device 300 in operation according to an exemplary embodiment of
      the present invention. In operation, a patient blows air in the
      direction A into the first end cap 302. As the air passes in the
      direction A over the reed 402, the free end 402b of the reed 402
      vibrates up and down, as indicated by the arrow B. The vibration
      produces an acoustical shockwave within the housing 304.<br>
      <br>
      An acoustical resistance in the device 300 couples the patient's
      lungs to the acoustical shockwave to allow production of
      low-frequency audio shockwaves. The acoustical resistance provides
      a back pressure of the acoustical shockwave back through the end
      cap 302 and into the patient's lungs. In the exemplary embodiment
      illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the acoustical resistance can
      comprise an air mass provided in the housing 304. In that
      exemplary embodiment, a length L and the height H1 of the housing
      304 can comprise a volume sufficient to provide an air mass large
      enough to produce the desired acoustical resistance (and back
      pressure).<br>
      <br>
      Additionally or alternatively, a size or compliance of the reed
      402 can provide the acoustical resistance. For example, the size
      or compliance of the reed 402 can be increased until the amount of
      air required to vibrate the reed 402 is sufficient to provide the
      desired acoustical resistance and back pressure into the patient's
      lungs.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating
      device 600 according to an alternative exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. As shown, the device 600 comprises the first
      end cap 302 and a housing 604. The reed 402 is disposed within the
      housing 604. The housing 604 can have a horn shape, whereby a
      first portion has a height H1 and a second portion has a height
      H2, which is larger than the height H1. Accordingly, a
      cross-sectional area of the first portion is less than a cross
      sectional area of the second portion. In operation, the free end
      402b of the reed 402 vibrates up and down in the second portion of
      the housing 604. Accordingly, the free end 402b has additional
      space to vibrate up and down. Additionally, the free end 402b is
      less likely to contact the housing 604. The horn shape also
      increase the air flow through the device. The increased air flow
      can have several benefits. For example, the increased air flow can
      provide additional air that reduces fogging of the housing by
      drying condensation that forms on the housing. Additionally, the
      increased volume can increase the acoustical resistance of the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating
      device 700 according to another exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. As shown, the device 700 comprises an end cap
      702 and a housing 704. The device 700 also comprises the reed 402
      disposed in the housing 704. The end cap 702 and the housing 704
      can have correspondingly tapered ends 706a, 706b. The tapered ends
      can provide an improved compression fit between the end cap 702
      and the housing 704. Additionally, the tapered ends 706a, 706b can
      prevent drawing and excessive amount of the fixed end 402a of the
      reed 402 out of the housing 704 as the end cap 702 and the housing
      704 are pushed together.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates an exit end view of a lung vibrating device
      according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As
      shown, the housing 304 can comprise four separate pieces coupled
      together. The pieces can be coupled together by gluing, sonic
      welding, taping, or other suitable means. Alternatively, the
      housing 304 can be molded as a single piece (not shown). The
      housing 304 can be formed from plastic, wood, metal, or other
      suitable material.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, inner surfaces of the housing 304 can
      comprise a substantially smooth surface (not shown). In the
      alternative exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 8, a lower
      inner surface 802 and an upper inter surface 804 of the housing
      304 can comprise one or more grooves 806. The grooves 806 reduce
      the surface area of the inner surfaces 802, 806 of the housing 304
      that can contact the reed 402. Accordingly, any condensation that
      accumulates on the upper and lower inner surfaces 802, 804 of the
      housing 304 can collect in the grooves 806. The free end 402b of
      the reed 402 contacts a smaller surface area of the housing 304.
      Additionally, as shown by the grooves in the upper inner surface
      804, the grooves can be rounded to further reduce the surface area
      contacting the reed 402. In an alternative exemplary embodiment
      (not shown), the grooves can be pointed to provide a minimum
      surface area that contacts the reed 402. Thus, the reduced surface
      area reduces adhesion of the reed 402 to condensation on the inner
      surfaces 802, 804 of the housing 304.<br>
      <br>
      The grooves 806 also can provide other benefits. For example, the
      grooves 806 can provide an air path that will tend to lift the
      reed off the inner surfaces of the housing. Additionally, in an
      exemplary embodiment, a surface of the grooves can be rough (not
      shown). Moisture is more likely to condense on the rough surface
      area in the grooves 806 rather than on the smooth surface area
      that contacts the reed 402. Accordingly, moisture on the housing
      surfaces that can contact the reed 402 can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is not limited to the shape of the groove
      806 illustrated in FIG. 8. Any suitable shape that reduces the
      surface area of the housing 304 that contacts the reed free end
      402b is within the scope of the present invention. For example,
      the grooves 806 can comprise a semi-circular shape, a V-shape or
      other suitable shape. Additionally, the grooves 806 can be
      provided along the entire length of the housing 304.
      Alternatively, the grooves 806 can be provided along only a
      portion of the housing 304, or along intermittent portions of the
      housing 304. For intermittent portions, the grooves 806 may appear
      more like individual squares, rectangles, or other shapes in the
      inner surfaces of the housing 304.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, and 9F illustrate alternative, exemplary
      embodiments of a weight provided on a free end 904 of a reed 902.
      In FIG. 9A, a reed 902 is illustrated. The reed 902 can comprise a
      reed as described above. A weight can be provided on the reed's
      free end in the location illustrated by reference numeral 904.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9B is a side view illustrating a reed weight 906 according to
      an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9C is an
      end view of the reed weight 906 illustrated in FIG. 9B. As shown
      in FIGS. 9B and 9C, the weight 906 can comprise a weight coupled
      around the reed 902. In an exemplary embodiment, the weight 906
      can comprise tape provided on the end of reed 902.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9D illustrates an alternative reed weight 908 according to
      another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown,
      the reed weight 908 can envelop the end of the reed 902.
      Additionally, the reed weight 908 can have a tip end 908a that is
      tapered. In an exemplary embodiment, the tip end 908a can be
      thinner than a thickness of the reed 902. The decreased thickness
      on the tip end 908a can increase the efficiency of the reed 902 to
      lower the frequency achievable by the reed 902. In an exemplary
      embodiment, the thinner tip end of reed weight 908can be provided
      by using a tape material having the desired thickness.
      Alternatively, the free end of the reed weight 908 can be tapered
      by grinding, or notches can be provided in the free end of the
      reed weight 908 to reduce the surface area of the end of the reed
      weight 908. In an exemplary embodiment, the reed weight can
      comprise tape having a thickness of about 0.5 to 1.5 mils. In one
      exemplary embodiment, the tape can comprise medical tape.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9E illustrates a reed weight 910 according to another
      alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The
      reed weight 910 comprises a weight disposed on an end of the reed
      902. And that exemplary embodiment, the reed weight can simply
      increase the thickness and weight of the reed 902 at its free end.
      In an exemplary embodiment, the reed weight 910 can comprise a
      material that is the same as the reed 902. In an alternative
      exemplary embodiment, the reed weight 910 can comprise a material
      different from the material of the reed, such as tape. In another
      exemplary embodiment, the free end of the reed/weight combination
      can be tapered or notched as described above.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9F illustrates a reed weight 912 according to another
      alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The
      reed weight 912 can comprise a double portion of the reed 902. In
      that regard, the end of reed 902 can be doubled over onto itself
      to produce the reed weight 912. In an exemplary embodiment, the
      free end of the reed/weight combination can be tapered or notched
      as described above.<br>
      <br>
      An area of the end of any reed/weight combination can be reduced
      to improve the efficiency of the reed 902. The area can be reduced
      by grinding to taper the end of the reed weight. Alternatively,
      the area can be reduced by providing grooves or holes in the free
      end of the weight and reed combination. The grooves or holes
      remove surface area of the end of the weight, thereby reducing the
      area.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the reed weight can comprise a first
      material, and the reed can comprise a second material. A
      compliance of the first material can be in a range of about
      one-eighth to about one-half of a compliance of the second
      material. In another exemplary embodiment, the compliance of the
      first material can be about one-fourth of the compliance of the
      second material. The differing compliances can increase the
      efficiency of the reed.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the reed can be exchangeable to allow
      replacement after the reed reaches the end of its useful life.
      Accordingly, the lung vibrating device can be reconstructed by
      replacing the reed.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment the reed can comprise, either
      alone or with a weight, a wear indicator on its free end. The
      indicator can indicate to a user when the reed has reached its
      useful life and cannot provide the proper operating frequency. In
      one embodiment, the reed can comprise an inked indicator that
      vibrates off over the useful life of the reed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 1000
      according to another alternative exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. As shown, the lung vibrating device 1000
      comprises an acoustical resistance plug 1002. The acoustical
      resistance plug 1002 can comprise a HEPTA filter or a foam plug.
      Furthermore, the device 1000 can comprise additional acoustical
      resistances. For example, the device 1000 can comprise an
      acoustical resistance produced by a size of the reed 402, as
      described above with reference to FIG. 4. Additionally, or
      alternatively, the device 1000 can comprise an acoustical
      resistance composed of an air mass provided in the housing 304, as
      described above with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 1100
      according to another alternative exemplary embodiment of the
      present invention. As shown, the lung vibrating device 1100 can
      comprise a second end cap 1102 provided on the housing 304. The
      second end cap 1102 can function as an acoustical resistance by
      restricting the air flow from the housing 304. Additionally, the
      second end cap 1102 can provide a means to connect the device 1100
      to a respirator. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the
      second end cap 1102 can provide a means to connect the device 1100
      to a respirator without serving as an acoustical resistance. When
      connected to a respirator, the respirator can draw air through the
      housing 304 to drive the reed 402 to produce the acoustical
      shockwave in the patient's lungs.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary power make up
      device 1200 for a lung vibrating device according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown, a fan 1202 can push
      air through a duct 1204 in the direction of the arrows A. The duct
      1204 can comprise an aperture 1006. An exit opening of a lung
      vibrating device 1208 can be provided in proximity to the aperture
      1206. The air moving in the direction A within the duct 1204 can
      draw air in the direction B through the lung vibrating device
      1208. Accordingly, the power make up device 1200 can produce at
      least a partial vacuum in the lung vibrating device 1208 by
      drawing air from the lung vibrating device 1208 in the direction
      of the arrow B. In an exemplary embodiment, the device 1200 can
      produce about 1.5 inches of negative water pressure in the lung
      vibrating device 1208.<br>
      <br>
      As evident to those skilled in the art, the lung vibrating device
      according to the present invention can incorporate many features
      not illustrated in the attached figures. For example, exemplary
      embodiments can comprise a space-saving design, incorporating a
      foldable, hinged, or telescoping housing. Another embodiment
      encompasses a device formed from a thin material that can be
      crumpled and disposed.<br>
      <br>
      The lung vibrating device can be used to perform many functions.
      For example, the device can be used to induce sputum to clear the
      lungs or to provide a diagnostic sample, improve muscillary
      clearance post operatively, prevent lung collapse (atelectasis),
      improve oxygenation, improve lung capacity or lung clearance in
      athletes prior to performance, or treat smoke inhalation.<br>
      <br>
      The efficient coupling of an audio source and a body cavity to
      produce low-frequency sound can be used for other applications.
      The acoustical resistance can be adjusted to provide the proper
      frequency based on the particular application. Additionally, the
      reed can be tuned by changing its size, shape, or material to
      provide the proper frequency. For example, other applications can
      include the following:<br>
      <br>
      Coronary Plaque: One application can be erosion of coronary
      arterial plaque by vibration. An adaptation of the powered system
      may erode coronary arterial plaque by internal thoracic vibration,
      which would be a useful clinical application.<br>
      <br>
      Sinus and Ear: Several variations of the powered and non-powered
      lung cleaning systems can be used for sinus drainage and middle
      ear clearing. Operation requires a simple frequency adjustment of
      the lung cleaning system by an adjustment of the acoustical
      resistance. For uses such as sinus drainage and middle ear
      clearing, the systems can operate in a range between about 15 Hz
      and about 60 Hz with an output of from about 75 dBa to about 100
      dBa. The systems also can operate between about 40 Hz and about 60
      Hz, and at about 44 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Diagnostics: A lung vibrating device according to the present
      invention can provide the basis of a sophisticated diagnostic tool
      for lung diseases such as pneumonia, COPD, asthma, and lung
      cancer. The diagnostic system can monitor the voltage to current
      phase of the loudspeaker motor and then derive the dynamic
      compliance of the lungs at different frequencies and different
      pressures and vacuums. Lung compliance varies with different
      secretion loads and also shows changes in elasticity caused by
      long term lung tissue deterioration. Accordingly, the results can
      be correlated with existing conditions. Early asymptomatic results
      also can be correlated with later disease conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Intestines/Colon: Another application is to efficiently couple a
      patient's colon to an audio source to clean the patient's
      intestines or colon. That application can remove intestinal
      blockages, which can prevent such blockages from causing a
      dangerous infection.<br>
      <br>
      Lung Sample Collection and Diagnostics: In another exemplary
      embodiment, the low-frequency sound lung vibrating device of the
      present invention can be used to collect lung or other body cavity
      samples through absorption, precipitation, or condensation.
      Additionally, an indicator drug can be placed in the lung
      vibrating device to detect the presence of specific biological
      materials when contacted by a collected sample.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, a lung vibrating device can comprise a
      sample collection carrier that collects a diagnostic sample
      exhaled from the patient's lungs. The sample collection carrier
      can comprise any suitable carrier for collecting a liquid, solid,
      or air sample from the material expelled or exhaled from the
      patient's lungs through the lung vibrating device. As the patient
      exhales through the housing of the lung vibrating device, portions
      of the exhaled air condense within the housing. The sample
      collection carrier can collect the condensate for use as a
      diagnostic sample. Additionally, the sample collection carrier can
      collect moisture within the air expelled from the patient's lungs,
      and the sample collection carrier can collect a solid material the
      contacts the carrier when expelled from the patient's lungs. Then,
      the sample collection carrier can be removed from the lung
      vibrating device to test the collected sample. Alternatively, the
      lung vibrating device and/or the sample collection carrier can be
      rinsed with distilled water. The rinse water will wash the
      collected sample from the sample collection carrier. Then, the
      rinse water can be collected and tested.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the sample collection carrier can comprise an
      indicator drug or liquid that tests for the presence of specific
      biological materials in the collected sample. For example, the
      indicator drug or liquid can react chemically with specific
      biological materials of the collected sample, thereby changing
      color or texture to indicate the presence of the biological
      material in the collected sample.<br>
      <br>
      Using a sample collection carrier with the lung vibrating device
      of the present invention can obtain improved lung samples. The
      lung vibrating device can loosen the lung secretions, thereby
      allowing the patient to exhale air and secreted material from deep
      within the lung cavity.<br>
      <br>
      Exemplary sample collection carriers will be described with
      reference to FIGS. 13 and 14. FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of
      a lung vibrating device 1300 comprising sample collection carriers
      according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. FIG.
      14 is a cross-sectional view of a portion of a reed 1402 and
      weight 1404 comprising sample collection carriers according to
      exemplary embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment the sample collection carrier can
      comprise an absorbent reed 1302. The absorbent reed 1302 can
      comprise a material such as paper, cloth, fiber, foam, or other
      absorbent material that absorbs samples as the patient exhales
      through the housing 704 of the lung vibrating device 1300. If
      desired, a spine (not shown) of suitable stiffness can be coupled
      to the absorbent reed 1302 to produce a reed that will vibrate at
      the desired frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise an absorbent weight 1304 on the end of the reed 1302. The
      absorbent weight 1304 can comprise a material such as paper,
      cloth, fiber, foam, or other absorbent material that absorbs
      samples as the patient exhales through the housing 704 of the lung
      vibrating device 1300.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise perforations 1408 or indentations 1406 in the reed 1402
      or in the weight 1404 on the end of the reed 1402. The
      perforations 1408 or indentations 1406 collect the diagnostic
      sample by collecting condensation as the patient exhales through
      the housing of the lung vibrating device.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise absorbent strips 1305 coupled to an inside wall of the
      housing 704 of the lung vibrating device 1300. Alternatively, the
      absorbent strips can be coupled to the reed. The absorbent sirips
      1305 can comprise a material such as paper, cloth, fiber, foam, or
      other absorbent material that absorbs samples as the patient
      exhales through the housing 704 of the lung vibrating device 1300.
      The absorbent strips 1305 can be coupled to the housing 704 by
      adhesive, tape, or other suitable meam. For example, the bousing
      704 can comprise a pocket, frame, or other suitable holder (not
      shown) into which the absorbent ships 1305 can be inserted and
      removed.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise indentions 1306 on an inside of the housing 704. The
      indentations 1306 collect the diagnostic sample by collecting
      condensation as the patient exhales through the housing 704 of the
      lung vibrating device 1300. In another exemplary embodiment, the
      sample collection carrier can comprise indentation strips 1308 of
      rigid or semi-rigid material having indentations, which can be
      placed inside the housing 704 of the lung vibrating device 1300.
      The indentation strips 1308 can be placed loosely in the housing
      704. Alternatively, the indentation strips can be coupled to the
      housing 704 by adhesive, tape, or other suitable means. For
      example, the housing 704 can comprise a pocket, frame, or other
      suitable holder (not shown) into which the indentation strips 1308
      can be inserted and removed.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise protrusions 1310 inside the housing 704 of the lung
      vibrating device 1300. The protrusions 1310 can increase the
      surface area of the housing 704, thereby providing more area onto
      which condensate can collect. The sample can be collected by
      rinsing the housing 704 with distilled water and collecting the
      rinse water.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise a cup-shaped protrusion 1312, with the opening in the cup
      facing the mouthpiece of the lung vibrating device 1300. The
      cup-shaped protrusion 1312 collects condensate and prevents the
      condensate from exiting the housing 704's exit end.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary embodiment, the sample collection carrier can
      comprise an absorbent acoustical resistance disposed in the
      housing. For example, the acoustical resistance can comprise an
      absorbent foam acoustic compliance plug. The plug absorbs the
      condensate as the exhaled air passes through it.<br>
