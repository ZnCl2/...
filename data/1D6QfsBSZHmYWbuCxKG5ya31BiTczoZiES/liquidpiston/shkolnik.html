      <div align="center"><i>Engine startup LiquidPiston has radically
          shrunk a go-kart engine, but it's the military applications
          that has everyone really excited.</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      Connecticut-based startup LiquidPiston announced today that they
      have built a small, compact engine that is powerful enough to
      drive a go-kart. Their X-mini engine weighs just 4 pounds and has
      three moving parts, and yet can produce 3 horsepower, enough to
      replace the default 40-pound piston engine that normally powers
      the go-kart.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston says that their X-mini is still in a testing phase,
      and they hope to get the weight down to 3 pounds and the power up
      to 5 hp. (The 40-pound piston engine produces about 6.5 hp.) In
      the meantime, their little engine already packs a punch, as you
      can see in the video below.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston announced last year that they received a $1 million
      DARPA grant to develop their X-mini engine, and it appears that
      they've succeeded. The 4-pound, 3-hp engine is small enough to fit
      in the palm of your hand, yet it can power everything from
      vehicles to generators to drones. The X-mini uses LiquidPiston's
      proprietary rotary engine design and thermodynamic cycle which
      offer vast improvements over both a traditional Wankel rotary
      engine and common piston engines.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston says the X-mini can run on Jet Propellant 8, the
      military's fuel of choice, making it an ideal candidate for all
      sorts of military applications. For instance, the X-mini is small
      and light enough to power a UAV, it can be part of a generator
      that can be carried in a backpack, or it can even be used to power
      military robotics. According to Alec Shkolnik, LiquidPiston's
      co-founder and president, "[DARPA] is kinda agnostic as to the
      actual application … they have so many different applications that
      need power."<br>
      <br>
      Shkolnik said that the X-mini is still early in testing, and they
      have only just built their first working prototype, but he's
      hopeful that the engine could see a commercial release sometime in
      the next few years. When that happens, the X-mini could find its
      way into lawnmowers, emergency generators, and even small vehicles
      like mopeds. <br>

      <br>
      As automakers augment the reciprocating piston engine with hybrid
      systems and improved accessories, independent inventors are busily
      working to make huge improvements to the basic efficiency of the
      internal combustion engine. Novel designs are popping up at
      engineering expos everywhere, and the newest comes from
      Bloomfield, Conn.-based LiquidPiston. Its X1 engine is a simple
      machine with just three moving parts and thirteen major
      components, but it aims to raise thermal efficiency from the 20
      percent of a normal gas engine to more than 50 percent, with
      drastic reductions in weight and size. How? By wasting much less
      energy during the course of an combustion cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Up to 80 percent of the energy in fossil fuels is thrown away
      normal engines through the heat and pressure of exhaust, or dumped
      to the atmosphere through the radiator. LiquidPiston's design
      attempt to capture all of that waste within a tiny package. "We
      stretched the performance curves in every direction to get much
      higher efficiency," said Alec Shkolnik, President and CEO of
      LiquidPiston, "We took the best parts of many different thermal
      cycles and combined them." The design is theoretically capable of
      75 percent thermal efficiency, but the group is targeting 57
      percent in real world applications, still a huge jump.<br>
      <br>
      The basic idea is similar to a Wankel rotary, but turned on its
      head. Where the rotor holds the seals in a normal Wankel, the
      housing does that job in the X1 engine. This allows significant
      reduction in oil consumption over a regular rotary motor. Other
      enhancements include direct injection, a high compression ratio at
      18:1, and a dramatic change to the geometry of the combustion
      chamber, which maintains a constant volume during ignition. This
      change means the air-fuel mixture auto-ignites like a diesel, and
      can be burned much longer than normal. The result is a more
      complete combustion ending in low emissions and very high chamber
      pressures. This high pressure is allowed to act on the rotor until
      it reaches nearly atmospheric pressures, so almost all the
      available energy is extracted before the exhaust is physically
      pushed out. Again, this is different than a normal internal
      combustion engine, which releases very energetic, high-pressure
      exhaust gas.<br>
      <br>
      Some other slick features: Since the engine is designed to convert
      so much more heat energy into mechanical force, less heat has to
      be removed from the block, so there's actually no water cooling
      system. In cases where the engine is under load and needs to cool
      down, it can skip an fuel injection event and just suck in cool
      air, which is then heated by the block and gets exhausted. Another
      option is to inject water into the combustion chamber. This has
      three effects: cooling the engine, reducing NOx emissions, and
      converting some of the water to steam, which increases power.<br>
      <br>
      The compact design of LiquidPiston's lab engine currently tips the
      scales at 80 lbs for the 40-hp model. It would weigh less than 50
      lbs in production, the company claims, far less than a comparable
      40-hp diesel that would tip the scale at around 400 lbs.
      LiquidPiston's current aim is to continue developing the engine
      with an eye on the sub-100 hp market — compressors, hybrid
      range-extenders, military applications, boat engines — and license
      the intellectual property to manufacturing customers. We love
      seeing plucky inventors like these to completely rethinking the
      gasoline engine.<br>

      <br>
      A “High Efficiency Hybrid Cycle” (HEHC) thermodynamic cycle is
      explored. This four-stroke cycle borrows elements from Otto,
      Diesel, Atkinson, and Rankine cycles. Air is compressed into an
      isolated combustion chamber, allowing for true isochoric
      combustion, and extended duration for combustion to proceed until
      completion. Combustion products expand into a chamber with greater
      volume than intake. We provide details of a compact HEHC design
      implementation using rotary pistons and isolated rotating
      combustion chambers. Two Pistons simultaneously rotate and
      reciprocate and are held in position by two roller bearings. One
      Piston performs intake and compression, while the other performs
      exhaust and expansion. We predict a reduction of energy losses,
      moving part counts, weight and size over conventional engines.<br>

      <b>Abstract:</b><br>
      <br>
      In this paper we discuss a rotary implementation of the High
      Efficiency Hybrid Cycle (HEHC) engine. HEHC is a thermodynamic
      cycle which borrows elements of Diesel, Otto and Atkinson cycles,
      characterized by 1) compression of air only (e.g. Diesel), 2)
      constant volume heat addition (e.g. Otto), and 3) expansion to
      atmospheric pressure (e.g. Atkinson). The engine consists of a
      compressor, an isolated combustion chamber, and an expander. Both
      compressor and expander consist of a simple design with two main
      parts: a rotor and an oscillating rocker. Compared to conventional
      internal combustion engines, in which all processes happen within
      the same space but at different times, in this engine, all
      processes are occurring simultaneously but in different chambers,
      allowing for independent optimization of each process. The result
      is an engine which may offer up to 57% peak efficiency, and above
      50% sustained efficiency across typical driving loads.<br>

      This paper describes the development of small rotary internal
      combustion engines developed to operate on the High Efficiency
      Hybrid Cycle (HEHC). The cycle, which combines high compression
      ratio (CR), constant-volume (isochoric) combustion, and
      overexpansion, has a theoretical efficiency of 75% using
      air-standard assumptions and first-law analysis. This innovative
      rotary engine architecture shows a potential indicated efficiency
      of 60% and brake efficiency of &gt;50%. As this engine does not
      have poppet valves and the gas is fully expanded before the
      exhaust stroke starts, the engine has potential to be quiet.
      Similar to the Wankel rotary engine, the ‘X’ engine has only two
      primary moving parts – a shaft and rotor, resulting in compact
      size and offering low-vibration operation. Unlike the Wankel,
      however, the X engine is uniquely configured to adopt the HEHC
      cycle and its associated efficiency and low-noise benefits. The
      result is an engine which is compact, lightweight, low-vibration,
      quiet, and fuel-efficient.<br>
      <br>
      Two prototype engines are discussed. The first engine is the
      larger X1 engine (70hp), which operates on the HEHC with
      compression-ignition (CI) of diesel fuel. A second engine, the
      XMv3, is a scaled down X engine (70cc / 3HP) which operates with
      spark-ignition (SI) of gasoline fuel. Scaling down the engine
      presented unique challenges, but many of the important features of
      the X engine and HEHC cycle were captured. Preliminary
      experimental results including firing analysis are presented for
      both engines. Further tuning and optimization is currently
      underway to fully exploit the advantages of HEHC with the X
      architecture engines.<br>

      A rotary internal combustion engine includes crank-driven gates to
      synchronously form chambers for the intake, compression,
      combustion, expansion and exhaust of a working medium during a
      high-efficiency hybrid engine cycle. A variety of rotor geometries
      and sealing apparatuses may work with a rotary engines in the
      execution of various engine cycles including, but not limited to,
      a high-efficiency hybrid engine cycle.<br>

      A rotary engine has a cycloid rotor and a sealing grid including a
      face seal that rotates with the rotor, and including other seals
      that do not rotate with the rotor. As the rotor rotates within a
      housing, the rotor, housing and seal grid form at least one
      working chamber between them, the chamber undergoing a change from
      initial volume V1 to V2, which is less than V1, thus compressing a
      working medium, and subsequently expanding to volume V3, which may
      be larger than V1, such that the chamber volume is a smooth and
      continuous function of rotor's rotational angle.<br>

      An internal combustion rotary engine includes an air passage
      configured to allow cool air to flow through the rotor as the
      rotor moves relative to the housing within the engine. Some
      embodiments include a removable fuel cartridge.<br>

      An internal combustion engine includes in one aspect a source of a
      pressurized working medium and an expander. The expander has a
      housing and a piston, movably mounted within and with respect to
      the housing, to perform one of rotation and reciprocation, each
      complete rotation or reciprocation defining at least a part of a
      cycle of the engine. The expander also includes a septum, mounted
      within the housing and movable with respect to the housing and the
      piston so as to define in conjunction therewith, over first and
      second angular ranges of the cycle, a working chamber that is
      isolated from an intake port and an exhaust port. Combustion
      occurs at least over the first angular range of the cycle to
      provide heat to the working medium and so as to increase its
      pressure. The working chamber over a second angular range of the
      cycle expands in volume while the piston receives, from the
      working medium as a result of its increased pressure, a force
      relative to the housing that causes motion of the piston relative
      to the housing.<br>

      Engines and methods execute a high efficiency hybrid cycle, which
      is implemented in a volume within an engine. The cycle includes
      isochoric heat addition and over-expansion of the volume within
      the engine, wherein the volume is reduced in a compression portion
      of the cycle from a first quantity to a second quantity, the
      volume is held substantially constant at the second quantity
      during a heat addition portion of the cycle, and the volume is
      increased in an expansion portion of the cycle to a third
      quantity, the third quantity being larger than the first quantity.<br>
