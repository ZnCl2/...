      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract: </span>Materials
      scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have designed a
      way to harvest small amounts of waste energy and harness them to
      turn water into usable hydrogen fuel. The process is simple,
      efficient and recycles otherwise-wasted energy into a usable form.<br>
      <br>
      "This study provides a simple and cost-effective technology for
      direct water splitting that may generate hydrogen fuels by
      scavenging energy wastes such as noise or stray vibrations from
      the environment," the authors write in a new paper, published
      March 2 in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. "This new
      discovery may have potential implications in solving the
      challenging energy and environmental issues that we are facing
      today and in the future."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers, led by UW-Madison geologist and crystal
      specialist Huifang Xu, grew nanocrystals of two common crystals,
      zinc oxide and barium titanate, and placed them in water. When
      pulsed with ultrasonic vibrations, the nanofibers flexed and
      catalyzed a chemical reaction to split the water molecules into
      hydrogen and oxygen. UW-Madison Mechanical Engineering Professor
      Xiaochun Li lent theoretical and experimental expertise to the
      ultrasonic vibrations part of the research.<br>
      <br>
      When the fibers bend, asymmetries in their crystal structures
      generate positive and negative charges and create an electrical
      potential. This phenomenon, called the piezoelectric effect, has
      been well known in certain crystals for more than a century and is
      the driving force behind quartz clocks and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      Xu, who is part of the Materials Science Program administered
      through the UW-Madison College of Engineering, and his colleagues
      applied the same idea to the nanocrystal fibers. "The bulk
      materials are brittle, but at the nanoscale they are flexible," Xu
      says, like the difference between fiberglass and a pane of glass.<br>
      <br>
      Smaller fibers bend more easily than larger crystals and therefore
      also produce electric charges easily. So far, the researchers have
      achieved an impressive 18 percent efficiency with the
      nanocrystals, higher than most experimental energy sources.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Xu says, "because we can tune the fiber and plate
      sizes, we can use even small amounts of [mechanical] noise — like
      a vibration or water flowing to bend the fibers and plates. With
      this kind of technology, we can scavenge energy waste and convert
      it into useful chemical energy."<br>
      <br>
      Rather than harvest this electrical energy directly, the
      scientists took a novel approach and used the energy to break the
      chemical bonds in water and produce oxygen and hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a new phenomenon, converting mechanical energy directly
      to chemical energy," Xu says, calling it a piezoelectrochemical
      (PZEC) effect.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical energy of hydrogen fuel is more stable than the
      electric charge, he explains. It is relatively easy to store and
      will not lose potency over time.<br>
      <br>
      With the right technology, Xu envisions this method being useful
      for generating small amounts of power from a multitude of small
      sources — for example, walking could charge a cell phone or music
      player and breezes could power streetlights.<br>
      <br>
      "We have limited areas to collect large energy differences, like a
      waterfall or a big dam," he says. "But we have lots of places with
      small energies. If we can harvest that energy, it would be
      tremendous."<br>
      <br>

      Kuang-Sheng Hong and research scientist Hiromi Konishi, who were
      co-supported by Li.<br>

      School, National Science Foundation, NASA Astrobiology Institute
      and the U.S. Department of Energy. <br>

      Materials scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have
      discovered a phenomenon—the direct conversion of mechanical energy
      to chemical energy—which they termed the piezoelectrochemical
      (PZEC) effect. They then applied the PZEC effect to generate
      hydrogen and oxygen via direct water splitting.<br>
      <br>
      Their study, they write in a paper published online 2 March in
      ACS’ Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, provides a simple and
      cost-effective technology that may generate hydrogen fuels by
      scavenging energy wastes such as noise or stray vibrations from
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism of the water decomposition via the PZEC effect
      relies on the piezoelectric properties of the materials. Although
      the piezoelectric effect has been known for over 100 years and has
      been demonstrated in many fields, little work has been done to
      address its application in wet conditions (such as in solution)
      and particularly in the direct conversion of mechanical energy to
      chemical energy.<br>
      <br>
      "...conditions. In this study, we use microfibers of ZnO and
      dendritic BaTiO3 to initiate a phenomenon and drive a
      nonspontaneous redox reaction, the formation of H2 and O2 gases
      from water, by using mechanical energy. Here, we show the
      capabilities of these materials for scavenging energy waste from
      the environment, such as noise and vibration, to generate hydrogen
      and oxygen gases."<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —Hong et al.<br>
      <br>
      “We have limited areas to collect large energy differences, like a
      waterfall or a big dam. But we have lots of places with small
      energies. If we can harvest that energy, it would be tremendous.”<br>
      —Huifang Xu<br>
      <br>
      The researchers, led by UW-Madison geologist and crystal
      specialist Huifang Xu, grew nanocrystals of two common crystals,
      zinc oxide and barium titanate, and placed them in water. When
      pulsed with ultrasonic vibrations, the nanofibers flexed and
      catalyzed a chemical reaction to split the water molecules into
      hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      When the fibers bend, asymmetries in their crystal structures
      generate positive and negative charges and create an electrical
      potential. Smaller fibers bend more easily than larger crystals
      and therefore also produce electric charges easily. So far, the
      researchers have achieved an 18% efficiency with the nanocrystals,
      higher than most experimental energy sources.<br>
      <br>
      "The physics and chemistry of generating hydrogen and oxygen gases
      from pure water arise from the combination of piezoelectric
      properties of ZnO fibers and BaTiO3 dendrites and the redox
      reaction of water. Both ZnO and BaTiO3 are well-characterized
      piezoelectric materials...Specific morphological aspects of ZnO
      and BaTiO3 such as fibers and dendrites will acquire electric
      potentials on their surfaces if an external mechanical energy is
      applied that results in a bending (deformation) of the fibers or
      dendrites. The strain induced electric potential formed on the
      fiber or dendritic surface in wet conditions (i.e., in pure water)
      is available for the reduction and oxidation reaction via charge
      transfer to species such as water molecules adsorbed on the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      "Note that the developed potential must be greater than the
      standard redox potential of water (1.23 eV) to make electrons
      available to initiate the redox reaction in this experiment.
      Residual charges or potentials lower than 1.23 eV will not
      participate in reactions to form H2 and O2 from water." — Hong et
      al.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, they noted, in the PZEC effect, the catalyst—i.e.,
      the zinc oxide and barium titanate—participated in the direct
      water splitting reaction by donating strain-induced electrons and
      holes without being oxidized, reduced, or decomposed. TEM and XRD
      observations showed that no metal species or other extra phases
      appeared in our experiment samples before and after the reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Because the fiber and plate sizes can be tuned, said Xu, even
      small amounts of mechanical noise—such as a vibration or water
      flowing—could bend the fibers and plates. With the right
      technology, Xu envisions this method being useful for generating
      small amounts of power from a multitude of small sources—for
      example, walking could charge a cell phone or music player and
      breezes could power streetlights.<br>
      <br>
      "Using fibrous ZnO and dendritic BaTiO3 catalysts with
      piezoelectric properties, we have demonstrated the PZEC effect for
      generating H2 and O2 from water. We have successfully verified a
      direct conversion of mechanical energy to chemical energy. Finding
      an optimum fiber length and introducing the resonance frequency of
      ZnO and BaTiO3 for the direct water splitting process, it may be
      possible to obtain a much greater H2 and O2 production rate.<br>
      <br>
      "Utilizing the piezoelectric fibrous samples, the phenomena
      demonstrated could usher in a new era in the field of recycling
      environmental energy wastes. Vibrational energy waste generated in
      the environment from noise, wind power, running water, or water
      wave action can be scavenged or harvested as a driving force for
      direct water splitting, thereby forming H2 and O2 by means of PZEC
      fiber arrays implanted on a substrate. The fiber arrays can also
      be used to harvest artificial energy wastes such as traffic noise
      and vibrations and convert them into hydrogen and other chemical
      energies.<br>
      <br>
      "The principle of the PZEC effect using these fibers could be a
      very important step forward in nanotechnology that recycles the
      energy wastes from the environment into precious alternative
      chemical energy. This work will open a new field of study on
      hydrogen generation, redox reactions, and energy
      recycling."&nbsp;&nbsp; —Hong et al.<br>

      Every drop of water is stuffed with the greenest of fuels,
      hydrogen, but getting it out is a challenge. A new material raises
      the prospect of doing so using noise pollution – from major roads,
      for example.<br>
      <br>
      A team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison made crystals of
      zinc oxide that, when immersed in water, absorb vibrations and
      develop areas of strong negative and positive charge. These
      charges rip apart nearby water molecules, releasing hydrogen and
      oxygen gas.<br>
      <br>
      "This is like a free lunch," says lead researcher Huifang Xu. "You
      are getting energy from the environment just like solar cells
      capture energy from the sun."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Underwater operator</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Xu and colleagues generate hydrogen using a new variation on
      piezoelectric crystals – materials that generate a voltage when
      strained and which are being investigated as a way to generate
      electricity from movement.<br>
      <br>
      The new crystals, however, are designed to be submerged, so the
      charge they generate instead pulls apart water molecules to
      release hydrogen and oxygen gas, a mechanism Xu's team calls the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">piezoelectrochemical effect</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Xu and colleagues grew thin microfibers of highly flexible zinc
      oxide crystals that flex when subjected to vibration, for example
      due to sound waves. They showed that ultrasonic vibrations under
      water cause the fibres to bend between 5 and 10 degrees at each
      end, creating an electrical field with a high enough voltage to
      split water and release oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Growing fibres with different dimensions changes the type of
      vibration they absorb best. For instance, it should be possible to
      tune them to maximise energy production from the vibrations caused
      by water flowing past or any other sound, say Xu.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Efficiency issue</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Xu says that lab tests suggested the material <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">can convert 18 per cent of the energy
        it absorbs from vibration</span> into energy locked up in
      hydrogen gas, which can be released by burning.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional piezoelectric materials are not as efficient at
      converting vibrations into electricity, and typically achieve
      around a 10 percent conversion rate. Using the charge a material
      generates indirectly, to split water, instead of directly to drive
      current, accounts for the difference, says Xu. The new materials
      could be used to develop systems that generate hydrogen from the
      noise of anything from machinery to crashing waves, he adds.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a good idea," says Jinhui Song of Georgia Tech University,
      Atlanta. Because there is no need to create a circuit, devices
      based on the new crystals could be simpler than those based on
      conventional dry piezoelectrics, he points out. "They can reduce
      the complexity of the device."<br>
      <br>
      However, he's sceptical that the wet devices should necessarily be
      more efficient. In principle, says Song, the energy generated by a
      material should be the same however it is deployed.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A mechanism of
      initiating a redox reaction, such as hydrogen gas production by
      direct-water-splitting, is provided in which a piezoelectric
      material is mechanically stressed by actively applying a
      mechanical stress to the material. The mechanical stress applied
      to the piezoelectric material causes an electrical potential build
      up on the surface of the material due to the piezoelectric
      properties of the material. When the piezoelectric material
      stressed in this manner is placed in direct contact with the redox
      reaction reactant(s), the potential on the polarized surface can
      be used as chemical driving energy to initiate the reaction, such
      as to split water and generate hydrogen gas. In this manner the
      mechanical energy applied to the piezoelectric material, such as
      vibration energy from natural or man-made sources, can be
      converted directly into chemical energy to initiate the reaction.<br>

      <br>
      [0004] As the world today rapidly increases its demand of the
      fuels, energy shortage becomes one of the most challenging issues
      the human being is facing. Fossil fuels, which currently
      contribute more than 85% of the world's energy supply, are
      expected to be depleted in the following 30.about.50 years. In
      addition, it is extensively believed that burning the fossil fuels
      is the major cause for global-warming and long term climate change
      leading to natural disasters, further pressing on the need for
      reductions in fossil fuel usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] These possible near-future environmental disasters have
      attracted people's attention and resulted in a vast and growing
      interest in development of alternative renewable energy resources.
      Among the studies that have been done, hydrogen energy is
      considered as an alternative to fossils fuels as a source of
      energy, and is expected to have enormous growth potential as a
      result of recent advances in technology. Hydrogen is renewable,
      very flexible in conversion to other forms of energy, and no air
      pollutants or green house gases are produced from the combustion
      of hydrogen. In an idealistic, long-term vision, a
      hydrogen/electricity interchangeable energy source can provide
      power for all aspects of the energy economy such as
      transportation, industrial, and residential usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Traditionally, hydrogen gases are produced primarily via
      the processes of steam reforming methane and electrolysis of
      water. The former produces CO.sub.2 (a green house gas) that is
      released into the atmosphere, while the later uses electricity
      generated from fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In recent years, the alternative production method of using
      solar energy to produce hydrogen has triggered great interest.
      Specifically, photocatalytic water splitting using oxide
      semiconductors under irradiation has received great attention. A
      tremendous amount of research articles have recently been
      published on the topic, such as concerning the use of a
      titania-based photocatalyst, which is the most common material for
      hydrogen production, in photovoltaic cells, as well as in
      environmental decontamination. Thousands of studies are ongoing
      concerning improving the performance of this and other
      photocatalysts in two main areas: 1) quantum efficiency, such as
      oxide-doping and metals additions; and 2) solar efficiency,
      including anion doping, and physically/chemically implanting the
      transition metals in the photocatalyst. Yet, all the research
      currently being done contains many limitations and drawbacks
      including the small number of available photocatalysts, their
      limited efficiency, cost, and device life-time, which still remain
      unsolved up to this point.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] As a result, it is highly desirable to develop a mature and
      commercially available technology for hydrogen production that can
      be put directly into application in daily usage.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] According to one aspect of the present invention, a novel
      method of hydrogen production is provided that employs direct
      water-splitting. Instead of utilizing existing semiconductor
      materials (i.e., TiO.sub.2-based materials), and the limitation of
      sun harvesting to generate hydrogen from these materials, the
      present invention involves the direct conversion of mechanical
      energy into chemical energy for splitting water and forming
      hydrogen and oxygen gases. The mechanism for this conversion is a
      novel phenomenon, i.e., the direct conversion of mechanical energy
      to chemical energy, which is termed the Piezoelectrochemical
      (PZEC) Effect. The mechanism of the water decomposition via PZEC
      effect relies upon the piezoelectric properties of the materials
      utilized in the process. Although the piezoelectric effect has
      been known for over one hundred years and has been demonstrated in
      many fields, little work has been done to address its application
      in wet conditions, such as in solution, and particularly in the
      direct conversion of mechanical energy to chemical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] More specifically, certain piezoelectric materials,
      including but not limited to .alpha.-quartz (SiO.sub.2), ZnO, or
      BaTiO.sub.3, among others, have unique piezoelectric properties
      where the piezoelectricity is an intrinsic property of the
      material, such that no physical/chemical doping (cations or
      anions), chemical additives (including transition metals) or any
      forms of implantation are needed to create these properties. In
      addition, one of the materials having these properties, i.e.,
      quartz, is also one of the most abundant minerals on the Earth's
      surface (i.e. beach sands). As a result, by using quartz as a
      material in the process, the hydrogen production via
      direct-water-splitting can be achieved at a low cost, and, because
      quartz is a natural material that is environmental friendly, no
      pollution issues are created by the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] When a mechanical force is applied to materials having
      these properties, the materials generate an electrical response in
      the form of positive and negative charges being generated at the
      surface of the material. This electrical charge can then interact
      with the surrounding the chemical species in the environment
      surrounding the material, which can take various forms in the
      present invention, such as an aqueous environment. This
      interaction takes the form of catalyzing an oxidation/reduction
      reaction, such as a water-splitting reaction with the water
      molecules in the aqueous environment in which the
      mechanically-stressed piezoelectric material is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] According to another aspect of the present invention, the
      mechanical stress applied to the piezoelectric material to
      generate the electrical response can be supplied from any of a
      number of potential sources of mechanical force, such as the
      forces exerted on a roadway or walkway over which cars and
      pedestrians are passing, or the force generated by sound waves
      striking a surface, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] According to still another aspect of the present invention,
      the piezoelectric material can take various forms depending upon
      the particular environment and/or mechanical force supply with
      which the material is to be utilized. The piezoelectric material
      can be formed as fibers of various configurations, lengths and/or
      thicknesses that are optimized for the mechanical force supply for
      the piezoelectric material. Also, a support for the piezoelectric
      materials can be formed to maximize the exposure of the materials
      to the chemical species in the environment surrounding the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Numerous other aspects, features and advantages of the
      present invention will be made apparent from the following

        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0051] With reference now to the drawing figures in which like
      reference numerals designate like parts throughout the disclosure,
      the present invention is a method and apparatus for converting
      mechanical energy applied to piezoelectric materials into chemical
      energy for the formation of hydrogen for use as an alternative
      energy source. This is accomplished by positioning a number of
      fibers of a piezoelectric material within an aqueous environment
      and applying the mechanical force to the piezoelectric fibers to
      initiate a water-splitting reaction at the surface of each
      piezoelectric fiber, thereby producing hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0052] Electrochemistry of
        Direct-Water-Splitting</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0053] In an electrochemical cell, electrons flowing from the
      anode to the cathode are driven by electromotive force (emf),
      which is produced by the difference in electrical potential energy
      between the two electrodes. The quantity of the electrical work
      produced is defined as a function of potential energy difference
      and the number of electrons:<br>
      <br>
      Electrical work=Number of Electrons*Potential Energy Difference<br>
      <br>
      Note that the charge on a single electron is
      1.6022.times.10.sup.-19 C, where the coulomb (C) is defined as a 1
      ampere flow for 1 second. The emf of an electrochemical cell (or
      commonly named cell voltage), indicates the amount of work a cell
      can produce for each coulomb of charge that the chemical reaction
      produces. The standard cell voltage (E.sup.o) is measured under
      standard conditions, in which all reactants and products must be
      present as a pure form at 1 bar pressure or 1 M concentration. The
      cell voltage of any reaction is obtained by using the standard
      voltages of the half-reactions that occur at the cathode and
      anode:<br>
      <br>
      E.sup.0.sub.cell=E.sup.0.sub.cathode-E.sup.0.sub.anode<br>
      <br>
      By definition, the standard hydrogen electrode, in which hydrogen
      gas at 1 bar pressure is bubbled over a platinum electrode
      immersed in aqueous acid solution, with an activity of hydrogen
      ions of 1 at 25.degree. C. is assigned the value of 0 V:<br>

      bar)+2H.sub.2O(1) E.sup.o=0.0 V<br>
      <br>
      Thus, all other standard electrode potentials are measured in
      values relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Some
      additional redox potentials are listed in Table 1 for comparison.<br>

      [0054] From Table 1 it is found that the reduction half-reaction
      of water at the cathode is defined as 0.0V, while the oxidation
      half-reaction of water to oxygen requires 1.229V of 20 potential.
      Thus, the overall reaction requires 1.229 V (1.229-0=1.229V) of
      chemical potential energy. As a result, the Gibbs free energy of
      splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen under a standard
      condition can be expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      .DELTA.G.sup.0=-nFE.sup.0.sub.cell<br>

      <br>
      [0056] Quartz or .alpha.-quartz is a well known mineral form of
      SiO.sub.2 that is stable below 573.degree. C. at low pressure.
      Quartz is usually found in sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, and
      hydrothermal mineral environments, particularly in continental
      regions. However, quartz rarely forms in oceanic rocks. Quartz has
      both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties, and it contains
      very limited amount of impurity in substitution. The polymorphs of
      quartz include .beta.-quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, coesite,
      stishovite, moganite, and keatite.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Quartz is usually colorless and the luster is vitreous.
      Many other colored varieties, however, have been described
      including citrine (yellow), smoky quartz (gray), amethyst
      (purple), and rose quartz (pink). There is no cleavage on quartz,
      which thus reveals its conchoidal fracture. The hardness of quartz
      is seven (7) with the density of 2.67 g/cm.sup.3. Optically,
      quartz is uniaxially positive with a maximal birefringence of
      0.0095. Table 2 below shows some physical constants of quartz.<br>

      [0058] The structure of quartz consists of SiO.sub.4 tetrahedrals
      with corner-sharing. In other words, each Si is bonded to four
      oxygen, and each oxygen is connected with two Si. This structure
      forms an open three-dimensional (3D) framework (framework
      silicate). Quartz usually refers to the stable form .alpha.-quartz
      at atmospheric temperature and pressure. .alpha.-quartz is less
      dense then the high pressure forms coesits and stishovite; whereas
      it is denser than tridymite and cristobalite, which are the high
      temperature polymorphs of quartz. Low temperature a-quartz with
      trigonal symmetry will reversibly transfer to hexagonal
      .beta.-quartz above 537.degree. C. Crystallographic data and
      structure for quartz are illustrated in Table 3, Table 4, and FIG.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0059] Piezoelectric Effect of
        Quartz</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0060] The piezoelectricity of quartz was found by Pierre and
      Jacques Curie in 1880, when they observed that a pressure exerted
      on a small piece of quartz caused an electrical potential between
      deformed surfaces, and that application of a voltage effected
      physical displacements. The piezoelectric property of quartz is
      caused as the result a pressure applied to the quartz, which
      deforms the crystal lattice and causes a separation of the centers
      gravity of the positive and negative charges. As a result, a
      non-zero dipole moment is found in each molecule. Assuming a
      quartz electrode has been short-circuited and stress is applied,
      free negative charges will be drawn toward the electrode in the
      direction of positive charge separation, and the free positive
      charges will move in the opposite direction. When the stress is
      released, the charges will flow back to their normal position. If
      a resistance is attached into the circuit with an application of
      sinusoidal stress to the quartz, an alternating current will flow
      through the load, and consequently mechanical power will be
      converted to the electrical power. In reverse, an alternating
      voltage in the circuit will produce alternating stress energy
      (mechanical energy) in the quartz.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIGS. 2A-2C illustrate Kelvin's model of molecules. Based
      on the diagram, there are two type of stress that will produce a
      charge separation normal to the axis: longitudinal and shear
      stress. If a quartz crystal is stresses along the x- or electrical
      axis as shown in FIG. 2B, the apex molecules are then been
      separated farther apart without changing the separation between
      the other molecules. This results in a separation of the center of
      gravity of the positive and negative charges, in which the
      positive charge moves to left while the negative charge moves to
      the right. The separation is still along the electric axis, but is
      in the opposite direction to that caused by a stress along the
      y-axis. Consequently, a longitudinal stress can produce charge
      along the electrical axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] However, if we apply a sheer stress to the quartz as in
      FIG. 2C, the separation of the center of charges can occur along
      the mechanical axis of the crystal, such that the simple shear
      stress is acting normal to the direction of space separation. From
      the diagram, the shear stress induces the charges to be displaced
      form their original position. This causes the current of positive
      charges and negative charges to move downward and upward along the
      y-axis, respectively. The piezoelectric effect of quartz including
      the shearing stresses on the molecules in YZ and XZ plane can be
      quantitatively expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      P.sub.X=-d.sub.11X.sub.X+d.sub.11Y.sub.Y-d.sub.14Y.sub.ZP.sub.x
      P.sub.Y=-d.sub.11X.sub.Y+2d.sub.14X.sub.Y<br>
      <br>
      where P.sub.x is the charge per unit area on the electrode surface
      to the x-axis due to the applied longitudinal stresses X.sub.x and
      Y.sub.y; P.sub.y is the charge per unit area normal to the y-axis
      caused by the shearing stress X.sub.y; d.sub.11 and d.sub.14 are
      the piezoelectric constant, in which
      d.sub.11=-6.76.times.10.sup.-8 (e.s.u/dyne),
      d.sub.14=2.56.times.10.sup.-8 (e.s.u/dyne).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In conclusion, the piezoelectricity of materials depends on
      the symmetry of the crystals, i.e., if there is center of
      inversion in the crystal, piezoelectric effect will not occur.
      Quartz is one of about 20 crystal groups out of a total of 32
      possible point groups that have a piezoelectric effect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0064] Piezoelectricity</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0065] As stated above, piezoelectricity is a linear effect where
      a material having the piezoelectric property becomes electrically
      polarized when they are strained, or where the material becomes
      strained when placed in an electric field. This phenomenon is also
      named direct piezoelectric effect. The origin of the
      piezoelectricity is due to the displacement of the ionic charge in
      a crystal structure. Under a stress condition, the charge
      distribution is no longer symmetrical, which leads to the
      formation of a net electric dipole moment not equal to zero and
      results in an internal electric field. Note that only a material
      without symmetry center can be piezoelectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The piezoelectric effect was first discovered in quartz,
      tourmaline, and Rochelle slat for the generation of electrical
      charge under pressure conditions. In 1935, Busch and Scherrer
      discovered piezoelectricity in potassium dihydrogen phosphate
      (KDP), which was the first major family of piezoelectric and
      ferroelectrics to be found. The major breakthrough of the
      piezoelectric materials was the discovery of barium titanate and
      lead zircronate titanate (PZT) family in 1940 and 1950,
      respectively. Currently, PZT is one of the most widely used
      piezoelectric materials in the world. Note that both barium
      titanate and PZT are based on the perovskite structure (FIG. 3),
      which has a general formula of ABO.sub.3.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In perovskite, the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra are
      linked in a cubic array with smaller cations such as Ti, Zr, Sn,
      Nb etc. (B-site), and larger cations such as Pb, Ba, Sr, Ca, Na,
      etc., filling the interstices between octahedra (A-site). Note
      that perovskite structure allows for multiple substitutions on the
      A and B-site to form complex compounds including (Ba,Sr)TiO.sub.3,
      (Pb,Sr)(Zr,Ti)O.sub.3, and (KBi)TiO.sub.3.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Some piezoelectric materials are also ferroelectric,
      particularly under their Curie temperature (Tc), which possess a
      spontaneous polarization that can be reversed in direction by
      application of an electric field over some temperature range. A
      ferroelectric hysteresis loop can be formed by applying an
      alternating electric field to cause the polarization to reverse,
      in which it relates the polarization P to the applied electric
      field E. A typical field-polarization loop is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The electric displacement D and the polarization P are
      related to each other through a linear equation:<br>
      <br>
      D.sub.i=P.sub.i+.epsilon..sub.0E.sub.i<br>
      <br>
      Both D and P are non-linear function of the field E. In the
      equation above, .epsilon..sub.0 is the permittivity of free space
      (8.85.times.10.sup.-12 C/V*m). Two important characteristics of
      the P-E loop (FIG. 4) are coercive field Ec and the remnant
      polarization P.sub.r., in which E.sub.c is the field at which the
      polarization is zero, while P.sub.r is the value of the
      polarization when the electric field is zero. When both P.sub.r
      and E.sub.c no longer vary, the loop is known as saturated. In
      addition, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are frequency and
      temperature dependent. By the same analogy, polarization switching
      leads to strain-electric field hysteresis for piezoelectric
      materials (FIG. 5). Because of the shape, the strain-electric
      hysteresis loop often referred to as the "butterfly loop", in
      which the converse piezoelectric effect dictates that a strain
      results as the electric field is applied. When the field is
      increased, the strain is no longer linear with the field as domain
      walls start switching.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The possibility of piezoelectricity in a material can be
      further determined by the specific symmetry of the crystal unit
      cell. Note that all crystals can be divided into 32 point group
      from 7 basic crystal systems (cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral,
      tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic). Of the 32
      point groups, 21 of them do not have a center of symmetry, and 20
      are determined piezoelectric, which are 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4,
      422, 4 mm, -42 m, 3, 432, 3 m, 6, -6, 622, 6 mm, -62 m, 23, -43 m.
      Note that although it lacks a symmetry center, cubic class 432 is
      not piezoelectric because of its cubic symmetry. The absence of a
      symmetry center in these groups represents that the net movement
      of cations and anions as a result of stress induces a non-zero
      electric dipole moment in the structure. However, a piezoelectric
      material with randomly oriented domains is piezoelectrically
      inactive. In response to this, "poling" is a common method to
      orient the domains in the piezoelectric material by applying a
      static electric field to the material such that the domains rotate
      and switch in the direction of the electric field. During the
      process, the expansion and contraction of the material along the
      field axis and perpendicular to the field axis is obtained,
      respectively, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] When expressing the piezoelectricity in constitutive
      equation, the changes of strain and electrical displacement must
      be considered, which both are orientation-dependent. Therefore,
      tensor notation is used and the reference axes are indicated in
      FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] It is known that the strain and stress are described by
      second rank tensors S.sub.ij and T.sub.ij, respectively. The
      relationship between electric field, E.sub.j and the electric
      displacement D.sub.i is the permittivity .epsilon..sub.ij. The
      piezoelectric equations can be written as:<br>
      <br>
      D.sub.i=.epsilon..sub.ij.sup.TE.sub.i+D.sub.ij.sub.kT.sub.jk<br>
      <br>
      S.sub.ij=d.sub.ijkD.sub.k+s.sub.ij.sub.k.sup.ET.sub.jk<br>
      <br>
      where d.sub.ijk is piezoelectric constant. Superscripts T and E
      denote the condition of constant stress and constant electric
      field, respectively. A conventional method to describe the crystal
      symmetry and the choice of reference axes (FIG. 8) is to define
      the poling direction as the 3-axis, the shear planes are indicated
      by the subscripts 4, 5 and 6 and are perpendicular to directions
      1, 2, and 3, respectively. For example, a 3-subscripte tensor
      notation (i, j, k=1, 2, 3) can be reduced to a 2-subscripte matrix
      (i=1, 2, 3 and j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and a 2-subscripte tensor
      notation (i, j=1, 2, 3) is simplified to a 1-subscripte notation
      (i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Besides, the first subscript of the
      piezoelectric constant represents the dielectric displacement and
      the second gives the component of mechanical deformation or
      stress. For example, d.sub.33 indicates an electric field parallel
      to the poling 3-axis with axial stress along the 1-axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] It is also known that a piezoelectric ceramic material has
      only one type of piezoelectric matrix regardless of the symmetry
      of the constituent crystals. By applying the poling, the initially
      isotropic status of the ceramic can be destroyed leading to a
      transversely isotropic state, i.e., the dipoles become oriented in
      a direction perpendicular to the poling direction. The symmetry
      elements are now in an infinite order of rotation with the axis of
      poling direction and an infinite set of planes parallel to the
      polar axis, which can be described as .infin. m m. The elastic,
      dielectric and piezoelectric matrices for cylindrical symmetry of
      poled PZT are shown in the equation below:<br>
      <br>

      By having piezoelectric equations and the matrices above, the

      [0074] When considering the electromechanical effects of a
      piezoelectric material, the parameters that of interest are 1)
      piezoelectric charge coefficient (d.sub.31 and d.sub.33), 2)
      piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g.sub.31 and g.sub.33) the
      piezoelectric coupling factors (k.sub.31, k.sub.33, k.sub.p, and
      k.sub.t). The d-coefficient is defined as the constant between
      electric displacement and stress, or strain and electric field.
      The piezoelectric charge and voltage coefficient are related to
      each other by:<br>
      <br>
      d.sub.mi=.epsilon..sub.nm.sup.Tg.sub.ni<br>
      <br>
      where m, n=1, 2, 3 and i=1, 2, . . . 6. High d-value materials are
      used for actuators, and high g-value materials are applied in
      sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A common method to measure the piezoelectric properties is
      known as the "direct method", in which a defined input (i.e.
      electric field or force) is applied to the sample, and the
      corresponding output is measured (i.e. deformation or charge).
      Displacement measurements are used to determine the magnitude and
      sign of the relationship between applied electric field and the
      strain developed (converse effect). Based on the equations above,
      when the sample is free to expand (or stress T.sub.k=0), the
      strain will be only a function of the applied field D.sub.i and
      the piezoelectric constant d.sub.ij can be found:<br>
      <br>
      S.sub.j=d.sub.ijE.sub.i<br>
      <br>
      This equation means that by having a strain versus electric filed
      diagram, the slope of the plot yields an average value of
      d.sub.ij.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Furthermore, concerning the direct method, an alternative
      way to measure the piezoelectric constants is based on the direct
      piezoelectric effect. In this method, a known load is either
      applied on or released from a sample at rest. The resulting charge
      is then recorded as a voltage across a capacitor (in parallel with
      the sample). Since the electric filed E.sub.i is 0, the
      relationship can be simplified as:<br>
      <br>
      D.sub.i=d.sub.ijT.sub.j<br>
      <br>
      such that, by knowing the applied stress and measuring the
      electric displacement, the piezoelectric constant can be
      determined.<br>

      [0090] The amount of hydrogen gas (H.sub.2) produced from
      water-splitting experiment was monitored using AMETEC Trace
      Analytical Gas Analyzer, model ta3000, equipped with and Gas
      Chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14A with Flame Ionization Detector FID)
      as well as a Reduction Gas Detector (RGD) sensor for hydrogen
      detection. Nitrogen gas (N2) of 99.98% purity at a flow rate of 20

      <br>
      [0092] To monitor the amount of oxygen gas (O.sub.2) being
      produced from the system, the oxygen concentration in solution was
      monitored as function of time by using Isolated Dissolved Oxygen
      Meter ISO.sub.2 equipped with an OXELP probe (World Precisions
      Instruments).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0093] Experimental Set-Up</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0094] The experiments of water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen
      were carried out using sealed glass tube and samples in water
      under a standard condition. Glass tubes a half-inch diameter and
      one-foot in length were used for the experiment. The reaction cell
      (glass tube) was filled with nitrogen gas after adding samples of
      the piezoelectric material being tested. To monitor the hydrogen
      and oxygen concentration variation, the gas inside the cell was
      extracted by syringe and inject into the external hydrogen
      analyzer. Hydrogen and oxygen production kinetics were obtained by
      calculating the evolved hydrogen concentration as a function time.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The results of strained induced reaction are shown in FIG.
      9, in which the evolution of H.sub.2 from pure water containing
      suspension of ball-milled quartz powders under a condition with
      and without UV irradiation. It is found the quartz powders were
      active when there was photon energy provided. The initial rate of
      H.sub.2 evolution was about 76.7 ppmh.sup.-1. The reaction reached
      to its maximum after 2 hours due to the glass tube volume
      limitation. Note that the rapid decrement of the production rate
      along with the large error bar might caused by instrument
      saturation (identified in FIG. 9 by the question mark (?)). After
      evacuating the reaction system and re-running the experiment
      (identified by the dashed line in FIG. 9), the hydrogen evolution
      rate was then found at 51.3 ppmh.sup.-1, and again the reaction
      reached the plateau after about 2 hours. After another gas
      evacuation at 9.sup.th hour and re-running the experiment, the
      hydrogen evolution rate of 8.45 ppmh.sup.-1 was obtained.
      Amazingly, on the other hand, when the UV light was removed, we
      still detected hydrogen gas from the system, indicating that the
      reaction remained active without UV irradiation. For example,
      almost the identical initial H.sub.2 evolution rate at 74.9
      ppmh.sup.-1 was observed for the quartz samples under dark
      condition. Similar gas production rates were achieved for both UV
      and dark condition in the second as well as the third run,
      suggesting that the catalytic activity was triggered by a factor
      other than photo energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Factors that influenced the gas evolution of quartz in
      water were further investigated using quartz with different
      treatments, the results of which are illustrated in FIG. 10. As a
      comparison, the hydrogen production performance of
      HCl-washed-quartz powders was also measured using the same method.
      The purpose of using HCl was to remove possible impurities and Fe
      on the quartz surface. The initial gas production rate was found
      at 74.5 ppmh.sup.-1 (76.7 ppmh.sup.-1 for no HCl treatment), which
      has no significant different from that of quartz without any
      treatments. After evacuation and re-running the measurement
      (illustrated by the dashed line in FIG. 10), the hydrogen
      production rate of acid washed quartz was found at 12.9
      ppmh.sup.-1(15.3 ppmh.sup.-1 for no HCl treatment). A small
      decrease in the gas production rate of acid washed quartz under
      dark condition comparing to that of no treatment quartz can be
      explained by the quartz surface damages caused by HCl. However,
      the results are in good agreement with the observation of hydrogen
      production performance by ball-milled quartz under UV and dark
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In contrast, a system that contained no quartz was utilized
      for a control experiment. Predictably, this system produced no
      hydrogen because absence of the catalyst in the system as the
      production of hydrogen is the result of a non-spontaneous
      reaction. The photoactivity of synthetic TiO.sub.2 (produced by
      the sol-gel method) is also included in the plot for comparison.
      Note that the TiO.sub.2 here contains a single phase of anatase
      (FIG. 11), which is generally believed has the best photoactivity
      for direct-water-splitting. Compared with quartz, however, anatase
      TiO.sub.2 had a hydrogen production rate at 3 ppmh.sup.-1, which
      was much lower than that of ball-milled quartz. Furthermore,
      TiO.sub.2 became inactive in water for catalyzing the redox
      reaction once the UV light was removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Interestingly, no hydrogen production, or only a very small
      amount of hydrogen was detected for the case of twinned quartz
      suspension in water (FIG. 10). To investigate the reduction in the
      activity of twinned quartz, the structure of the twinned quartz
      was analyzed in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The structure of a-quartz (or low quartz) can be treated as
      a distortion of high-temperature .beta.-quartz (or high-quartz).
      In .beta.-quartz, paired helical chains of SiO.sub.2 tetrahedral
      spiral in the same sense around 64 or 62 screw axes parallel to c
      (FIG. 12). Twofold rotation symmetry within the sixfold screw is
      found between the two helical chins. The intertwined chains
      produce open channels parallel to c that appear hexagonal in
      projection. The space group of .beta.-quartz is either P6.sub.422
      or P6.sub.222 depending on the handeness of the tetrahedral
      helices. When .beta.-quartz is cooled below its transition
      temperature at 1 bar, the expanded .beta.-quartz framework
      collapses to the denser .alpha.-quartz configuration, and the
      Si--O--Si bond angle decreased from 150.90 at 590.degree. C. to
      143.60 at room temperature. The contraction of the tetrahedral can
      be described as the rotation of rigid tetrahedral about
      &lt;100&gt; axes through an angle .theta.. Note that .theta. is
      zero in .beta.-quartz and .theta. is 16.30 in a-quartz at room
      temperature. Based on FIG. 13, this rotation violates the twofold
      symmetry contained within the sixfold screw axes, and the space
      group symmetry decreases from P6.sub.422 to its subgroup
      P3.sub.121 (or from P6.sub.222 to P3.sub.221).<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The .alpha.-.beta. quartz transformation yields two
      distinct left and right twin orientation because the tetrahedral
      rotation may occur in one of two senses. These two orientations
      are related to each other by the twofold symmetry lost during the
      transformation. These two equivalent twin-related orientational
      variants, which related each other by 180.degree., are named
      Dauphine twinning. FIG. 14 shows structure of a single twin
      boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In Dauphine twinning, the quartz now becomes ditrigonal
      with a threefold symmetry (FIG. 14), and the electrically
      polarized diad axes normal to the c-axis in the two Dauphine twin
      orientations are rotated 180.degree. relative to each other. As a
      result, the piezoelectric charges induced in one set of twins by
      compression normal to c will cancel the electric charges built up
      in the other. This piezoelectricity cancellation by Dauphine
      twinning in quartz explains why a large amount of hydrogen
      production for the twinned quartz was not observed similar to that
      for the ball-milled quartz. The Dauphine twin boundary is
      consisted of a gradual change in the tetrahedral tilt angle
      .theta. from +16.3.degree. to -16.3.degree..<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Based on the preparation method, the heating history of the
      twinned quartz was first at room temperature, and then heated at
      700.degree. C. for 5 hours followed by cooling in air till room
      temperature again. Accordingly, the phase of quartz varied from
      a-phase at room temperature to .beta.-phase at 700.degree. C.,
      then back to .alpha.-phase when cooling. From the discussions
      above, when phase transformation of .beta..fwdarw..alpha. occurred
      on cooling, two twin-related .alpha.-phases are formed, leading to
      the Dauphine twinning effect in which the piezoelectric properties
      of .alpha.-quartz is now disappeared. In particular, when the
      twinned quartz is placed in contact with water, based on the above
      observations, only a very small amount or no hydrogen gas is
      produced; compared to the ball-milled quartz, which also contained
      also .alpha.-phase only, but maintained a piezoelectric property,
      resulting in hydrogen production of 76.7 ppmh.sup.-1. These
      observations are applicable in both UV-illuminated and dark
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In this set of experiments, the observation of large
      quantities of hydrogen production in both acid- and non-acid
      treated ball-milled quartz was confirmed. A much lower hydrogen
      production rate was obtained for the quartz sample without
      piezoelectric property.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In order to obtain more insights about the morphology and
      the factors that lead to the H.sub.2 evolution, XRD and TEM
      analysis was performed. X-ray diffraction pattern of the
      ball-milled quartz sample are shown in FIG. 15. The diffraction
      peaks are indexed according to the values reported in JCPDS card
      No. 25-1353. Form the pattern, it can be seen that the quartz is
      phase pure containing no impurities. Note that both ball-milled
      and none-ball-milled .alpha.-quartz exhibited identical
      diffraction peaks, thus the XRD pattern of ball-milled quartz fits
      perfectly to the XRD pattern of the .alpha.-phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIGS. 16A-16B show the TEM images of the ball-milled
      quartz. After high energy ball milling, the creation of defects on
      the quartz grains can be clearly observed as the small dots in
      these figures. These defects deformed the quartz grains, and thus
      the defects can be treated similarly to or as locally applied
      external forces on the quartz grains. Furthermore, as explained
      previously, due to the lack of a symmetry center in quartz, any
      applied mechanical force on quartz, such as the defects, will
      cause a build up of charge on the surface and generate an electric
      potential (piezoelectric effect). In this case, the ball-milling
      defect induces a charge build up and potential difference on the
      quartz crystal surface in manner similar to that created when an
      external mechanical force is applied to the quartz. As a result,
      when water is positioned in contact with a quartz surface, the
      induced potential acts as a chemical driving force for the
      reduction reaction of water, resulting in the generation of
      hydrogen gases, which forms a new mechanism for direct water
      splitting in which the mechanical force (deformation) transformed
      directly into chemical force (splitting of water). This phenomenon
      explains the observations of large amount of hydrogen evolution of
      quartz suspension in water, which is independent of photo energy
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] As illustrated in FIG. 10, twin-phase quartz powders did
      not have any activity for hydrogen generation. This is has been
      determined to be because the piezoelectric property of the quartz
      material was canceling out due to the twining effect, in which the
      overall quartz particles became charge neutral. Because of that,
      twin-phase quartz can no longer build up charges on the surface.
      As a result, when twin-phase quartz powders were suspended in
      water, they do not have sufficient driving force to reduce water
      in to hydrogen gas. This leads to the observations of small or no
      hydrogen production for the trials. For the HCl-washed trials, the
      acid only removes the impurities or Fe on the surface, but does
      not change any piezoelectric properties of quartz. Therefore, we
      were still able to detect large amount of the hydrogen from the
      trials of HCl-treated quartz suspensions in water. More
      importantly, in our system the illumination of light no longer
      plays a dominant role for reduction of water, which not only
      successfully overcomes the limitation of light-harvesting problem
      under UV and visible light, but also results in a system that is
      able to catalyze the reaction without any light energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] As additional support for these findings, the hydrogen
      production reaction of ZnO suspension in water was also tested,
      the results of which are illustrated in FIG. 17. ZnO is a well
      known piezoelectric material and has been reported as being
      successfully used in as a nano-generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] For the verification experiments, ball-milled ZnO powders
      were prepared similarly to the quartz powders tested above, with
      hand-ground ZnO powder samples used as a control experiment. From
      the data in FIG. 1, it was found that, under dark conditions, the
      hydrogen production rate of ball-milled ZnO is almost 12.5 times
      greater than that of hand-ground ZnO, at 2.39 ppmh.sup.-1 and 0.19
      ppmh.sup.-1, respectively. Thus, these results confirm that,
      because the ball-milled ZnO grains contain many defects resulting
      from the method of their production, these defects allowed the
      build up of electric potentials on the surface of the grains. The
      induced electric potential on the surface was then transformed
      into a chemical driving force for the hydrogen production once the
      water was in contact with the ZnO powders. In contrast, the
      hand-ground ZnO powders has much lower production rate is because
      the grains did not contain as many defects as the ball-milled ZnO,
      resulting in a smaller amount of mechanical energy being
      transformed into chemical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] FIG. 18 shows the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the
      quartz with various treatments including ball-milled quartz
      (.alpha.-phase), hand-ground quartz (.alpha.-phase), twinned
      quartz, and HCl-treated ball-milled quartz. All the quartz samples
      after treatment were white in color, had high reflectance to
      visible light, and had absorption of UV light at wavelengths at
      around 250 nm. The hand-ground quartz powders had high reflectance
      of wavelengths longer than 350 nm. Conversely, all the samples
      that were ball-milled (including acid treatment) revealed
      absorption at and around 360 nm. The absorption at around 360 nm
      is believed to be caused by local linear defects in the crystal
      that were created by high energy ball-milling.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Furthermore, concerning twinned quartz, an additional
      absorption shoulder at 550 nm was found. Integration of the twin
      boundary and variations of the defect density in the crystal are
      believed to be the factor that influenced the absorption at 550
      nm. However, the illumination of light here does not play a
      critical role in a piezocatalytic reaction, because the
      transformation of the mechanical energy into the chemical driving
      force is the focus, such that only the piezoelectric properties of
      the catalyst determine if the reaction can be catalyzed by the
      material or not. For example, although twin-phase quartz has
      additional absorption at wavelength of 560 nm (FIG. 18), without
      the piezocatalytic effect, the hydrogen production outcome is
      still negligible (FIG. 10).<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Theory of Piezoelectrochemical Effect Concerning the form
      and ability of piezoelectric materials, such as quartz, ZnO and
      BaTiO.sub.3, to produce or catalyze the hydrogen production
      reaction in an aqueous environment, because the charge that
      initiates the reaction is localized on the exterior surface of the
      material, it is desirable to maximize the surface area of these
      materials to consequently maximize the area available for charge
      build up and reaction initiation. Further, while the cause for the
      charge build up in these piezoelectric materials has been
      determined to be the result of the defects formed in the
      materials, because the defects are considered to function
      identically to mechanical forces acting on the piezoelectric
      materials, the surface charge on these materials can also be
      created through the direct application of suitable mechanical
      force to the material within the aqueous environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] To maximize the available surface area of the material,
      there are methods currently available for synthesizing nano-fibers
      of the various piezoelectric materials. The advantage is that the
      piezoelectric material nano-fibers have extremely high flexibility
      and large surface area, leading to great amount of chemical
      potential for splitting of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The physics and chemistry of generating hydrogen and oxygen
      gases from pure water arises from the combination of the
      piezoelectric properties of certain piezoelectric materials, such
      as SiO.sub.2, ZnO and BaTiO.sub.3, and the redox reaction of
      water. The piezoelectricity of each material arises from the lack
      of inversion symmetry in their crystal structures. Any deformation
      or strain acting on the material, such as the deformation of the
      Si--O structure (FIGS. 19A-19B), Zn--O tetrahedra (FIG. 19C), or
      the relative Ti--O positions of BaTiO.sub.3 (FIG. 19D), will cause
      a non-zero dipole moment in the crystal lattice. Consequently,
      strain-induced electrons migrate through the bulk material and a
      charge potential is produced on the surface of the material.
      Specific morphological aspects of SiO.sub.2, ZnO and BaTiO.sub.3
      such as fibers and dendrites will acquire electric potentials on
      their surfaces if an external mechanical energy is applied that
      results in a bending (deformation) of the fiber or dendrite. The
      strain-induced electric potential formed on the fiber or dendritic
      surface in wet conditions (i.e. in pure water) is available for
      the reduction and oxidation reaction via charge transfer to
      species such as water molecules adsorbed on the surface (FIG. 1
      9E). Note that the developed potential must be greater than the
      standard redox potential of water (1.23 eV) to make electrons
      available to initiate the redox reaction in this experiment (FIGS.
      20-21). Residual charges or potentials lower than 1.23 eV will not
      participate in reactions to form H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 from water
      (FIG. 19F).<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Alpha quartz with its unique piezoelectrochemical property
      is one potential material for direct-water-splitting for hydrogen
      production. The possible voltage that is generated by applying an
      external force on the quartz can be calculated as follows. First,
      assume a quartz sample has a beam-like geometry with a diameter T,
      and length, l, as shown in FIG. 19A. Considering the quartz fiber
      is under a two-end-fixed condition with proper alignment and
      applied force as in FIG. 19B, the maximum deflection (y) and the
      bending moment on the quartz fiber as a function of applied force
      can be calculated as:<br>
      <br>
      y = 2 W ( l - a ) 2 a 3 3 EI ( l + 2 a ) 2 ##EQU00003## at x = 2
      al ( l + 2 a ) 2 if a &gt; 1 / 2 ##EQU00003.2## Maximum possible
      value = Wl 3 192 El ##EQU00003.3## when x = a = l a ##EQU00003.4##
      Maximum Bending Moment = M max = Wl 8 ##EQU00003.5##<br>
      <br>
      where W=applied force; l=fiber length; a=reference point;
      E=modulus of elasticity of the fiber materials; I=moment of
      inertial.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Therefore, by having the maximum deflection and bending
      moment, the maximum local stress, radius of curvature, and output
      voltage from the piezoelectric effect of quartz can be found as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      .sigma. = Mz I ##EQU00004## R = EI M ##EQU00004.2## V .+-. = .+-.

      where .sigma.=stress, M=M.sub.Max (in Eq.4.4 ); z=fiber radius;
      T=fiber diameter; y.sub.m=maximum deflection from equation above;
      d=piezoelectric constant of quartz=(2.3 .mu.m/V).<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Table 5 below lists the values of induced possible maximum
      voltage by deflecting the quartz fiber with various radius and
      lengths when 1.times.10.sup.-5 N is applied.<br>

      force is applied<br>
      <br>
      [0117] From Table 5, it is found that when a quartz fiber is in
      mm-scale, the maximum induced potential with 1.times.10.sup.-5 N
      of force applied is only about 7.74.times.10.sup.-6 V, which is
      impossible for the required redox potential of water at 1.23 V
      (FIG. 22), thus no hydrogen production. However, by scaling down
      the quartz fiber to .mu.m-scale (aspect ratio remained unchanged),
      the maximum defection becomes much greater, leading to a possible
      potential of .about.7.74 V and driving the direct-water-splitting
      process. These calculations match our observations on the quartz
      suspension for generation of hydrogen, and describe the basic
      physics of the piezoelectrochemical effect (PZEC).<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Furthermore for example, considering a case of generating
      .+-.10.0 V is needed; the table blow (Table 6) shows the required

      [0119] Based on the above, it is believed that: (1) the nano-meter
      scale quartz fiber with greater amount of deflection and surface
      area will dramatically improve the hydrogen production rate from
      water; (2) a stoichiometric amount of oxygen will be produced in
      the piezoelectrochemcial reaction; (3) kinetics and other factors
      control the direct splitting of water via piezoelectrochemical
      effect; and (4) a quartz fiber with piezoelectrochemical
      properties will also be able to be applied to initiate a catalytic
      oxidation reaction, such as the oxidation of various organic
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The above results illustrating the increased effectiveness
      of the quartz in nano-scale fiber form over other forms also
      should hold true for nano-fibers formed from other suitable
      piezoelectric materials.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0123] In one exemplary method, the quartz fibers are prepared by
      using an ultra-microtome to cut a natural quartz crystal at a high
      cutting speed. In doing so, the quartz fibers can be prepared and
      align in different orientations by various cutting directions and
      speeds for improved surface area, mechanical properties, and
      piezoelectrochemical effect. FIG. 23 shows the quartz fibers
      prepared by ultra-microtome cutting in a fabric-like network. The
      quartz fibers are much more durable than normal quartz crystals in
      macroscopic scale because interlocked quartz nano-fibers are much
      less brittle due to its dimensions. This results a dramatic
      improvement on surface area and possible induced potential (thus
      piezoelectrochemical properties) for splitting the waters.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] All the quartz nano-fibers can be characterized using X-ray
      diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission
      Electron Microscopy (TEM) and associated techniques (like
      nano-diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy) to
      determine the structure and chemistry of the nano-fibers while the
      effective surface area can be characterized using BET and BJH
      methods.<br>

      <br>
      [0126] The BaTiO.sub.3 dendrite samples (FIGS. 24-26 and 29) of
      the PZEC catalyst were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. All
      the chemicals that were used as starting materials had a purity of
      99.99%. The precursor Ti(OH).sub.4 was prepared by adding 25 mL of
      Ti(OC.sub.2H.sub.5).sub.4 drop-wise into 1.0M of acetic acid. The
      solution was settled allowing the precipitate to form in 72 hours
      and followed by rinsing the product with DI water and drying at
      60.degree. C. The as-synthesized Ti(OH).sub.4 precursor and
      commercially available Ba(OH).sub.2 8H.sub.2O were then added
      (Ti:Ba=1:1 in molar ratio) into 0.25M NaOH. After that, the
      mixture in a Teflon cup with 60% capacity was stirred and sealed
      tightly in a stainless steel autoclave. The closed bomb
      (Parr-type) was maintained at 200.degree. C. for 68 hours for
      hydrothermal reaction. The bomb was then cooled naturally to room
      temperature. The resulting white precipitate was washed

      The closed bomb was heated at 95.degree. C. for 48 hr. After that

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0129] Hydrogen Production from
        Water Using Ultrasonic Vibrations and Fibers of Piezoelectric
        Material</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0130] In support of the above theory, testing was done utilizing
      zinc oxide (ZnO) micro-fibers synthesized using the bottom-up
      method (i.e. hydrothermal synthesis method). Nano-fibers of quartz
      and other materials can be fabricated using photolithography,
      dry-cutting and other methods, some of which were discussed
      previously.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] The micro-fibers were positioned in a pure water aqueous
      environment to which a suitable ultrasonic vibration generator was
      connected in order to direct ultrasonic vibrations at the fibers
      within the aqueous environment. An identical trial utilizing a
      similar aqueous environment without any ZnO micro-fibers was also
      conducted to provide a control for the experiment. Initially, the
      aqueous environments were left alone in order to measure any
      hydrogen production from the aqueous environments. This was done
      for an initial forty (40) minute time period with a suitable
      hydrogen gas detection device such as described previously used to
      detect any hydrogen produced by the micro-fiber containing and
      control aqueous systems. After the initial time period, the
      ultrasonic vibration generator was activated to direct vibrations
      through the aqueous environment at the micro-fibers to deflect and
      "mechanically strain" the micro-fibers. The ultrasonic vibration
      generator was left active for a second forty (40) minute time
      period, and the hydrogen production from the system during this
      period was measured in the same manner as during the initial time
      period.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The results of this experiment are shown in FIG. 23, in
      which the evolution of H.sub.2 from pure water under an
      application of ultrasonic waves. As seen in the graph, during the
      initial forty (40) minute period where the ultrasonic vibration
      generator inactive, no hydrogen was produced in either the
      micro-fiber containing or control aqueous environments. Regarding
      the control system, no hydrogen production was detected during the
      second time period as well. However, when the ultrasonic generator
      was activated during the second time period in the system
      including the ZnO micro-fibers, rapid hydrogen production was
      obtained at an initial rate of 12.9 ppmh.sup.-1. This hydrogen gas
      production upon mechanical vibration of the ZnO micro-fibers in
      the aqueous environment agrees with the previous experiments, in
      which the strained ZnO powders were also active to split water
      into hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] This is because, in a mechanism similar to that caused by
      the deformation of the structure of ZnO grains by ball milling,
      with regard to micro- and nano-scale fibers, ZnO fibers will build
      up electric potentials on the surface through deformation caused
      as a result in an aqueous environment, the mechanical or strain
      induced electric potential caused by the vibrations is transformed
      on the fibers into the chemical energy that is utilized to split
      water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The performance of direct water-splitting was further
      investigated showing the capabilities of ZnO fibers and
      BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites for scavenging vibrational waste energies
      from urban environments to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases from
      pure water. In order to first measure hydrogen gas production,
      ultrasonic wave vibrations at a frequency of 40 kHz using a
      Branson 5510-MT Ultrasonic Cleaner were applied to 5.0 mL of DI
      water in a Pyrex glass tube to determine the results of the
      piezoelectrochemical effect on as-synthesized ZnO fibers prepared
      on a Si (100) wafer of 1.times.1 cm.sup.2. The results for
      hydrogen gas production for the ZnO and the BaTiO.sub.3 are shown
      in FIGS. 30 and 32. A control experiment was also conducted with a
      cleaned Si wafer (1.times.1 cm.sup.2), without ZnO fibers in the
      system. In the first period when external vibration was used
      (0.about.40.sup.th minute), rapid hydrogen production was obtained
      at an initial rate of 3.4.times.10.sup.-3 ppm per second (ppm/s).
      The reaction cell was then evacuated at the 40.sup.th minute
      allowing a fresh run beginning at the 41.sup.st minute. Ultrasonic
      wave vibration was turned off at the beginning of the 41.sup.st
      minute, and the H.sub.2 production was measured again. It was
      found that hydrogen generation stopped when the ultrasonic wave
      vibration was turned off, leading to a negligible H.sub.2
      production rate (&lt;0.0001 ppm/s). This is similar to the control
      experiment (0.about.40.sup.th minute). A possible reason for the
      low gas concentration in the experiments without ultrasonic
      vibration or the control experiment could be due to contamination
      from air in the room.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The oxygen production performance of ZnO fibers via the
      piezoelectrochemical effect was also investigated. Oxygen
      concentration was measured in solution as a function of time as
      shown in FIG. 31. The response of the ZnO fibers to external
      vibrations was demonstrated by turning the ultrasonic wave in the
      system on and off. Consistent with the hydrogen production test,
      when ultrasonic waves were applied to ZnO fibers, oxygen
      concentration grew rapidly at an initial rate of
      1.7.times.10.sup.-3 (ppm/s).Oxygen production stopped in the
      41.sup.st to 80.sup.th minutes, corresponding to when the
      ultrasonic waves were turned off. ZnO fibers in DI water with
      applied ultrasonic vibrations evolved hydrogen and oxygen gases
      with a stoichiometric equivalent of H.sub.2O.sub.2=2:1. As with
      the previous experiments, no oxygen production was observed for
      the Si wafer control experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Thus, based on the hydrogen and oxygen production tests
      utilizing the fibers of piezoelectric materials (e.g., ZnO,
      quartz, BaTiO.sub.3) in an aqueous environment, there is a direct
      conversion of mechanical energy (ultrasonic vibration) into the
      chemical energy (water splitting) as a result of the mechanical
      strain placed in the fibers. This is believed as a very important
      step forward to recycling the waste energy into alternative fuel
      in the future.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The micro- or nano-scale fibers of these materials create
      high levels of hydrogen production in the aqueous environment
      conditions as utilized in the above experiments, because the
      piezoelectric materials are more chemically stable, and able to
      generate greater electrical potential on the surface for further
      chemical reactions. In addition, quartz and certain other
      piezoelectric materials are much cheaper to obtain than other
      piezoelectric materials, further reducing the barriers to
      effective use of the piezoelectrochemical effect to generate
      useful energy from waste energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Similarly, when the external mechanical input is turned
      off, electrical charges will no longer accumulate on the fiber
      surface. Thus no sufficient potential can be used to reduce or
      oxidize the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen,
      respectively. This is evidenced by the fact that we did not
      observe a rapid gas growth rate without vibration compared to the
      vibration mode. Our conclusions are that quartz, ZnO fibers and
      BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites show very good responses to the application
      of ultrasonic vibrations by generating H.sub.2 and O.sub.2
      directly from water. Based on the gas production tests above, we
      have confirmed the piezoelectrochemical (PZEC) effect by using the
      quartz, ZnO and BaTiO.sub.3 fibers in wet conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0139] PZEC Efficiency
        Calculation</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0140] The efficiency of the PZEC effect can be measured as a
      function of fiber aspect ratio. In this case, samples with
      different average fiber lengths were prepared by varying the
      synthetic time and precursor concentration during the hydrothermal
      process. Each sample was immersed into DI water along with
      ultrasonic wave vibration during the reaction. The hydrogen
      production performance was monitored. The efficiency of each
      sample was then calculated by the ratio of produced chemical
      potential output over the effective mechanical energy input. The
      value of the output chemical energy was calculated from the
      observed hydrogen production rate, in which the standard reduction
      potential of water, 1.23 eV was used. In addition, in order to
      eliminate other factors such as surface area or secondary
      branches, we use ZnO fibers to demonstrate the efficiency
      calculations below and assume each fiber as a 3D tetragonal
      prism-shaped fiber with uniform width and height (0.4 .mu.m) on
      the two ends, and therefore the aspect ratio is only varied by the
      fiber length. Looking now at Table 8, the initial generation rate
      of H.sub.2 evolution is 8.56.times.10.sup.4 ppms.sup.-1,
      1.30.times.10.sup.-3 ppms.sup.-1, 2.61.times.10.sup.-3
      ppms.sup.-1, and 4.25.times.10.sup.-3 ppms.sup.-1 for the ZnO
      fibers having aspect ratio of 14.3, 16.5, 18.3, and 19.5,
      respectively. The system without any ZnO fibers presented was
      examined by the same method as a control experiment. The H.sub.2
      production rate of the control experiment is negligible. It is
      noticed that the ZnO fiber samples with a greater aspect ratio
      shows a better production rate. The efficiency of converting the
      mechanical energy from the ultrasonic waves to chemical potential
      driving the water splitting by piezoelectrochemical effect can be
      calculated as the follows. The average output chemical potential
      by single ZnO fiber is<br>
      <br>

      energy of water decomposition=1.23 eV; N.sub.A=Avogadro's number;
      e=electron volt, N.sub.fiber=number of fibers. The input elastic
      deformation energy generated by ultrasonic wave can be found from
      the bending of the fibers by assuming that all the acoustic
      pressure is transformed into the force for fiber deformation.
      Accordingly, the acoustic pressure is:<br>
      <br>
      P A = 2 I .rho. c and P effective = P A 2 ##EQU00006##<br>
      <br>
      where I=acoustic intensity=0.63 Wcm.sup.-2; .rho.=density of
      water; c=speed of light in water. It is worth to note that the
      reflectivity (R) of the sample glass tube against the ultrasonic
      wave was considered and R is found to be 0.185 (see detail
      calculation in the following section). In addition, we assume the
      ultrasonic waves propagated across the system normal to the
      cross-section area of the reaction cell. As a result, the input
      mechanical energy created by ultrasonic wave vibrations acting on
      the fibers is<br>
      <br>
      E mech = 175 F 2 L 3 4608 YI ##EQU00007##<br>
      <br>
      where F=average force acting on one fiber; L=fiber length;
      Y=Young's modulus, and I is the inertia of the ZnO fiber. Assuming
      the energy did not lost in any other form, therefore, the
      efficiency of converting mechanical energy to chemical energy is:<br>

      Efficiency = E chem E mech * 100 % ##EQU00008##<br>

      [0161] FIG. 33 shows the H.sub.2 evolution from pure water by
      as-synthesized ZnO fibers with different average fiber length (L)
      under ultrasonic wave vibration. The PZEC efficiency due to
      different average fiber length is shown in FIG. 34. The observed
      chemical energy output by a single ZnO fiber with L=5.7 .mu.m in
      one vibration event is .about.1.6.times.10.sup.-16 J, and the
      effective mechanical energy input applied on the fiber was
      .about.2.3.times.10.sup.-15 J (see Supplementary Information for
      detailed calculations). The PZEC mechanical to chemical efficiency
      was found to be .about.6.9%. Increasing the ZnO fiber length to
      L=7.8 .mu.m increased reaction efficiency to .about.18%. An
      increase in the efficiency can be explained by the strain-induced
      voltage related to the curvature of the fiber. Fibers with greater
      lengths (L) exhibit a greater bending curvature than that of
      shorter fiber lengths when under the same applied force in a
      vibration event. Due to this property, in our ZnO fiber trials
      with equal mechanical vibration, longer fibers build up a higher
      number of voltages that exceed the water reduction potential.
      Therefore, the trials with a longer fiber length demonstrated an
      increased hydrogen production performance, providing higher
      efficiency for mechanical to chemical energy conversion. As a
      result of the above testing, though this will vary depending upon
      the particular piezoelectric material being utilized, the fibers
      of the suitable piezoelectric materials that can be utilized in
      generating the PZEC effect for driving redox reactions are at
      least 2 .mu.m in length, in order to provide sufficient length for
      the fibers to be deformed upon application of vibrations to the
      fibers. A more preferred range of lengths for the fibers is 2
      .mu.m to 1000 .mu.m. With longer fiber lengths, the efficiency is
      increased along with the amount of flexing of the individual
      fibers, as well as the potential for multiple bends in the fibers,
      resulting in multiple reaction or nucleation sites on a single
      fiber.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] The PZEC efficiency of BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites in water was
      also demonstrated through our experiments. Here, the H.sub.2
      production test obtained a production rate of 1.25.times.10.sup.-2
      ppm per second (ppm/s). In addition, based on SEM images, density
      (6.08 g/cm.sup.3) and the volume of a single BaTiO.sub.3 dendrite
      branch, the overall BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites mass
      (7.5.times.10.sup.-3 g), the estimated number of the dendrites in
      the system, and thus the mechanical-to-chemical conversion
      efficiency of the BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites with an average length of
      10 .mu.m was found to be 3.2 %. BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites
      intrinsically have a slightly greater electromechanical coupling
      coefficient value (k) ((k.sub.33, BaTiO.sub.3=0.49, k.sub.33,
      ZnO=0.408)) and, extrinsically, a larger aspect ratio than that of
      ZnO fibers. This indicates a higher efficiency from the
      BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites expected. However, BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites are
      composed of branch-like structures which may limit the degree of
      deflections of each individual BaTiO.sub.3 branch with applied
      vibrations. Unlike ZnO fibers, which spread freely through a given
      space, BaTiO.sub.3 dendrites are bundled together in groups. As a
      result, the dendrites are more likely to be in contact with each
      other when deformation occurs, leading to partial charge
      cancellations and a lower gas production rate from the reaction.
      Morphologically, we anticipate that performance will be greatly
      increased by selecting chemically stable fiber and dendrite
      materials with greater k values, larger aspect ratio and surface
      areas, and ensuring the fiber and dendrites are spaced out for
      more bending space to avoid charge cancellations.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Using fibrous ZnO and dendritic BaTiO.sub.3 catalysts with
      piezoelectric properties, we have demonstrated the PZEC effect for
      generating H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 from water which results in a
      direct conversion of mechanical energy to chemical energy. Finding
      an optimum fiber length and introducing the optimal, e.g.,
      resonant, frequency of ZnO and BaTiO.sub.3 for the direct
      water-splitting process, it may be possible to obtain a much
      greater H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 production rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Utilizing the piezoelectric fibrous samples, the phenomena
      demonstrated could usher in a new era in the field of recycling
      environmental waste energy into precious alternative chemical
      energy. This is because the origin of the mechanical energy for
      use in driving the PZEC effect could be supplied from a renewable
      energy source or a common waste energy source in a mechanical
      form, i.e. vibration, at frequencies ranging from those occurring
      in nature on the order of fractions of Hz, e.g., greater than 0
      Hz, to natural or man-made sound or mechanical vibrations on the
      order of multiple Hz, e.g., from about 1 Hz to about 20 kHz, to
      man-made ultrasonic vibrations on the order of greater than 20
      kHz. In brief, so long as the vibration is sufficient to
      mechanically stress or deflect the fibers to generate the
      electrical potential to drive the redox reaction, virtually any
      source of vibration can be utilized. Vibrational waste energy
      generated in the environment from noise, wind power, or water wave
      action can be scavenged or harvested as a driving force for direct
      water-splitting, thereby forming H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 by means of
      PZEC fiber arrays implanted on a suitable substrate, such as a
      flexible film of ZnO and Barium titanates. The piezoelectric
      material fibers can be positioned on the material in arrays that
      provide the necessary spacing between fibers to prevent any
      cancelation of the vibration of adjacent fibers by direct
      interaction of the fibers with one another. In a preferred
      embodiment for this application of the fibers for producing the
      PZEC effect to drive a redox reaction, e.g., water-splitting, the
      spacing is approximately from 50 nm to 20 microns. The orientation
      of the fibers on the substrate is less important, as the
      deformation of the fibers occurs as a result of the vibrations
      striking the fibers regardless of whether the fibers are secured
      to the substrate at one end, at both ends, are disposed in a
      co-planar configuration with regard to the substrate, or are
      utilized without a substrate entirety, i.e., the fibers are free
      floating within the reaction environment.<br>

        Other Organic Redox Reactions</span><br style="font-weight:

      <br>
      [0166] Due to the ability of the piezoelectric materials to
      produce the necessary potential to initiate a water-splitting
      reaction, the same potential can be utilized as a driver for other
      redox reactions as well. Table 7 below lists some of the possible
      redox indictors that can be used to study the
      piezoelectrochemistry in redox reactions that could potentially be
      driven by the PZEC effect provided by suitable piezoelectric
      materials, including, but not limited to, quartz, ZnO, and
      BaTiO.sub.3. Reaction kinetics can be determined by evaluating the
      changes of organic concentrations of the components o the reaction

      [0167] For example, the piezoelectric property of piezoelectric
      materials can potentially be utilized as a catalyst or the
      oxidation of organic pollutants, such as volatile organic
      compounds (VOC). In this situation, the positive charges on the
      piezoelectric materials surface can trigger the oxidation
      reactions for the VOC and covert the toxic chemicals into less
      harmful or non-toxic forms, i.e. CO.sub.2. The advantage is that,
      similarly to the reduction of water, the piezoelectric material
      itself is environmentally friendly, and can be used for VOC
      decomposition and waste cleanup at a very low cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] This discovery and research can potentially have highly
      significant impact on energy and environmental applications based
      on the following: [0169] 1) a piezoelectric material suspension in
      water without any external energy yielded a significantly greater
      amount of hydrogen than commercial and current existing products
      or processes; because of the simplicity and robustness of the
      process, this novel mechanism may be ideal driving redox
      reactions, such as for large scale of hydrogen production and
      decontamination of volatile compounds in gas and liquid phase,
      among other suitable redox reactions; [0170] 2) the abundance of
      certain piezoelectric materials that can be used in the method
      greatly lowers the cost of utilization of this application; and
      [0171] 3) unlike many other methods that use or involve toxic
      chemicals, such as metal-organics, all of the materials in our
      system are environmentally friendly, in which a truly "clean
      energy" production can be achieved.<br>

      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to photocatalysts, and more
      particularly to photocatalysts capable of use in heterogeneous
      photocatalysis to activate the photocatalyst using light energy to
      drive redox reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Hydrogen is widely considered to be one of the fuels of the
      future. It is non-polluting, renewable, and very flexible in
      conversion to other forms of energy. Hydrogen is viewed as a very
      attractive alternative to fossils fuels as a source of energy
      because the deposits of fossil fuels are limited and fossils fuels
      are widely believed to be responsible for the global warming and
      long-term climate change. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly
      fuel the combustion of which results in the generation of water,
      which is neither an air pollutant nor a green house gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] As of today, hydrogen is produced primarily through steam
      reforming of methane. This technique, however, results in the
      emission of carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2), which is a greenhouse gas.
      Hydrogen produced through water electrolysis also cannot be
      considered environmentally friendly as the electricity used is
      obtained from combustion of fossil fuels. The growing interest in
      hydrogen has resulted in the increasing need to develop hydrogen
      production technologies based on the utilization of renewable
      sources of energy, particularly solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There is also a need or an improved method or manner to
      deal with the growing environmental and health problems created by
      hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are generated in
      a multitude of industrial and commercial processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] While many different potential solutions have been
      developed for attempting to address these problems, the prior art
      attempts have fallen short of being able to completely remove
      these problems. For potentially addressing both of these issues,
      one option that has undergone significant development is the
      process of photocatalysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In particular, heterogeneous photocatalysis is a process in
      which light energy is used to activate a catalyst to drive a
      reaction. Photocatalysts are generally semiconductors which have a
      fully occupied valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB)
      in their electronic structure. The valence band and the conduction
      band are separated by an energy gap (E.sub.g). Upon absorption of
      light having energy equal to or greater than the band gap, the
      valence electrons can become excited, causing them to overcome the
      energy gap and jump from the valence band into the conduction
      band. The resulting electron deficiencies in the valence band are
      called `holes` and the electron-hole pairs are referred to as the
      charge carriers. FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the electronic
      band structure of a semiconductor in ground state and that of a
      photoexcited semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The photo-generated charge carriers are energy rich and
      this energy can be used electrically (solar cells), or chemically
      (photocatalytic redox reactions), or to change the catalyst
      surface itself (superhydrophilicity). When a semiconductor absorbs
      light to produce electron-hole pairs, the following processes
      occur: [0009] (i) the electron-hole pairs are separated within the
      semiconductor particle and diffuse to the surface where they can
      take part in redox reactions or convert to other forms of energy;
      [0010] (ii) the electron-hole pairs can recombine in the
      semiconductor resulting in the loss of energy in the form of a
      radiative or non-radiative transition, which is highly undesirable
      for catalysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In general, photocatalyzed reactions can be represented by
      the general reaction:<br>
      <br>
      (O.sub.X1).sub.ads+(Red.sub.2).sub.ads.fwdarw.(TiO.sub.2+h.nu.).fwdarw.(Re-







      d.sub.1)+(O.sub.X2)<br>
      <br>
      where the subscript ads represents the adsorbed species on the
      surface of the photocatalyst. If the sign of the change in Gibbs
      free energy (.DELTA.G.sub.o) of this reaction is negative, it is
      defined as a photocatalytic reaction (spontaneous or "downhill").
      If .DELTA.G.sub.o is positive for the reaction, it is defined as a
      photosynthetic reaction where there is a net increase in the free
      energy of the system ("uphill"). Photo-oxidation of organic
      compounds like acetate, acetaldehyde etc on TiO.sub.2 surfaces are
      examples of photocatalytic reactions while production of H.sub.2
      from H.sub.2O, CH.sub.3OH from CO.sub.2, NH.sub.3 from N.sub.2 are
      examples of photosynthetic reactions which are not spontaneous and
      need an extra input of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Hydrogen Production Via Water
        Splitting</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0012] With regards to the mechanism of the reaction, the
      principle of photo-catalytic water decomposition makes use of a
      single semiconductor electrode unlike the two electrodes in
      photo-electrochemical decomposition. In photo-catalytic water
      decomposition, both the oxidation and the reduction processes take
      place on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst, which
      acts as both the anode and the cathode. Also, a mixture of
      hydrogen and oxygen evolves from the same location on the surface
      of the semiconductor material in contact with an electrolyte
      (water).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] For photodecomposition of water to occur on a semiconductor
      material, thermodynamic considerations require that: [0014]
      Conduction Band minimum (E.sub.CB) should be higher (more negative
      on electrochemical scale) than H.sub.2/H.sub.2O level (reduction
      of H.sub.2O to H.sub.2). [0015] Valence Band maximum (E.sub.VB)
      should be lower (more positive on electrochemical scale) than
      H.sub.2O/O.sub.2 level (Oxidation of H.sub.2O to O.sub.2).FIG. 2
      schematically represents the positions of the conduction band and
      the valence band compared to the water redox potentials on the
      electrochemical scale vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) and on
      an Eh-pH diagram at pH=0. The difference .DELTA.E.sub.1 between
      the CB minimum and the H.sub.2/H.sub.2O redox potential is called
      the driving potential for the reduction reaction and the
      corresponding difference .DELTA.E.sub.2 between the VB maximum and
      the H.sub.2O/O.sub.2 redox potential is called the driving
      potential for the oxidation reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The mechanism for the photogeneration of hydrogen can be
      illustrated by considering the energetics of an n-type
      semiconductor/electrolyte junction. FIG. 3 shows a schematic
      energy diagram of the system prior to immersing the semiconductor
      in the electrolyte. The vertical axis represents the potential,
      with the top of the axis at the vacuum level and the horizontal
      axis represents the different components spatially. The
      relationship between the potential on the vacuum scale and the
      potential on the redox scale (SHE) is given by:<br>
      <br>
      E.sub.vac=E.degree..sub.SHE+4.5 eV<br>
      <br>
      For this n-type semiconductor, before contact with the
      electrolyte, the free electrons in the semiconductor are at a
      higher potential E.sub.F than those in the electrolyte
      E.sub.F,redox. When the semiconductor is brought into contact with
      the electrolyte, electrons of higher energy from the semiconductor
      are transferred into the electrolyte until the Fermi levels of the
      semiconductor and the electrolyte, E.sub.F and E.sub.F,redox
      equalize. This leads to the development of a positively charged
      region near the surface of the semiconductor, depleted of
      electrons, known as the depletion layer and is similar to the
      layer formed at a semiconductor/metal junction known as a Schottky
      barrier. As a consequence, the conduction and valence bands are
      bent near the surface of the semiconductor to establish a
      potential barrier preventing further transfer of electrons to the
      electrolyte. The depletion layer is also called the space charge
      (SC) layer, best shown in FIG. 4. An electric field exists in the
      space charge layer at the surface of the semiconductor to a depth
      of 5 to 200 nm. For an n-type semiconductor, the direction of the
      field is from the bulk of the semiconductor towards the interface.
      Thus, if an electron-hole pair forms in the space charge region,
      the electron moves towards the bulk of the semiconductor, and the
      hole moves towards the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Thus, the electric field that forms spontaneously at the
      interface accomplishes electron-hole separation. A thin (a few
      angstroms) layer of charged ions also forms, adsorbed to the
      electrolyte side of the interface known as the Helmholtz layer.
      The ions have the opposite sign to the charge induced in the
      depletion layer of the solid. The corresponding change in
      potential across the layer, V.sub.H, effectively increases the
      magnitude of the band bending in the semiconductor. The band
      bending is thus given by:<br>
      <br>
      V.sub.B=E.sub.F-E.sub.flat band<br>
      <br>
      where E.sub.flat band is the chemical potential of the electrons
      in the semiconductor in contact with an electrolyte at which the
      conduction and the valence bands are flat. When the semiconductor
      material is irradiated, electron-hole pairs are generated inside
      the semiconductor which generates a photovoltage, V.sub.photo.
      When the charge carriers diffuse to the space charge region, due
      to the electric field present in the space charge region, they are
      separated and the electrons migrate into the bulk of the
      semiconductor whereas the holes migrate onto the surface of the
      semiconductor. This fills the depleted layer with extra positive
      charge which serves to shield the negative charge which was
      transferred to the electrolyte in the dark equilibrium situation.
      The band bending at the interface is reduced and E.sub.F is moved
      towards the flat band potential. As a result the change in
      potential between the surface and the bulk is reduced, until the
      rate of charge carrier generation by light is balanced by the rate
      of recombination. This is shown in FIG. 5 where the
      semiconductor/electrolyte junction is illuminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] For photosplitting of water, the redox species in the
      electrolyte (water) are the H.sub.+/H.sub.2 and the
      O.sub.2/H.sub.2O systems. For electron transfer to occur from the
      semiconductor to the redox species, the chemical potential
      (E.sub.F) of the electrons in the semiconductor should be greater
      (higher) than the chemical potential of the electrons in the redox
      species (E.sub.F,redox).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] If this condition is satisfied, electrons can migrate from
      the bulk of the semiconductor onto the surface where they can
      reduce the H.sub.+ ions to hydrogen gas. Similarly holes can
      migrate onto the surface where they can oxidize the H.sub.2O
      molecule into oxygen gas. Frequently, a sacrificial reducing agent
      like acetate or ascorbic acid is used as a donor of electrons to
      the semiconductor and the organic molecule itself is oxidized by
      the photo-generated holes.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] For the reasons stated previously, the properties of
      interest for a semiconductor material used for water decomposition
      are its bandgap, flat band potential, Schottky barrier, electrical
      resistance, Helmholtz potential, microstructure and corrosion
      resistance. The performance characteristics of the semiconductor
      material should also include high efficiency, durability, low cost
      of manufacturing, low cost and ease of maintenance. In other
      words, for effective use in splitting water for the formation of
      hydrogen, a good photocatalyst material must have: [0021] a) an
      energy band gap which is optimum for water splitting
      (approximately 2 eV with conduction and valence band edges
      optimally placed with respect to the water redox potentials);
      [0022] b) strong optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet
      spectral regions; [0023] c) good stability in strong electrolytes;
      and [0024] d) efficient charge transfer properties between the
      semiconductor and the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] There are numerous materials with small bandgaps such as
      CdS, CdSe, PbS, MoS.sub.2 and Cu.sub.2O which absorb light in the
      visible region. Unfortunately these materials exhibit photoanodic
      corrosion in the electrolyte and are also toxic.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Many other different types of materials have been
      identified as being suitable for photosplitting of water and the
      effect of the material structure on their performance, for
      example, using titania nanotubes, nickel doped indium-tantalum
      oxide, chemically modified titania, and mixed oxide semiconductor
      photocatalysts. Additionally, materials with relatively wide band
      gaps such as TiO.sub.2, ZnO, SrTiO.sub.3 and ZnS have good
      photostability but limited light absorption and hence low
      efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Due to oxygen vacancies, TiO.sub.2 is an n-type
      semiconductor. These vacancies are formed according to the
      reaction:<br>
      <br>
O.sub.o.sup.n.fwdarw.(TiO.sub.2).fwdarw.V.sub.o.sup.nn+2e-+1/2O.sub.2<br>
      <br>
      where the Kroger-Vink defect notation is used to explain that
      inside TiO.sub.2, a positively (+2) charged oxide ion vacancy
      (V.sub.o) is formed upon the release of two electrons and
      molecular oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Titanium dioxide is a preferred semiconductor material to
      be used for this purpose that is processed primarily from ilmenite
      or rutile beach sand. These ores are the principal raw materials
      used in the manufacture of commercial-grade TiO.sub.2. TiO.sub.2
      is widely used in paints, foods, and paper manufacturing as a
      white pigment due to its exceptionally high index of refraction.
      It is also used in health and beauty products as a protectant
      against ultraviolet (UV) light. However, TiO.sub.2 is also one of
      the most widely used photocatalysts because it is non-toxic,
      inexpensive and is stable to photo-corrosion over a wide range of
      pH and solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The three important polymorphs of titania are brookite
      (orthorhombic), rutile (tetragonal) and anatase (tetragonal). In
      bulk phase, rutile is the thermodynamically most stable form. The
      structures of these three polymorphs can be discussed in terms of
      (TiO.sub.26-) octahedrals. The three crystal structures differ by
      the distortion of each octahedral and by the assembly patterns of
      the octahedral chains. Anatase can be regarded to be built up from
      octahedrals that are connected by their vertices, and in rutile
      and brookite, both the edges and the corners are connected. The
      brookite structure is not used often for experimental
      investigations. The crystal structures of rutile and anatase forms
      of titania are shown in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Anatase having a band gap of 3.2 eV is the most
      photo-active crystal phase of TiO.sub.2. Rutile TiO.sub.2 having a
      band gap of 3.0 eV and a more compact crystal is less photo-active
      than rutile. It has been suggested that this increased
      photoreactivity is due to anatase's slightly higher Fermi level,
      lower capacity to adsorb oxygen and higher degree of hydroxylation
      (i.e., number of hydroxy groups on the surface). Reactions in
      which both crystalline phases have the same photoreactivity or
      rutile a higher one are also reported. The disagreement of the
      results may lie in the intervening effect of various coexisting
      factors, such as specific surface area, pore size distribution,
      crystal size, crystal shape and preparation methods, or in the way
      the activity is expressed. Also the effective mass of an electron
      in rutile (20 m.sub.e) is twenty times more than that of an
      electron in anatase (.about.m.sub.e). Due to this, the mobility of
      an electron in the conduction band of anatase is greater than that
      of an electron in the conduction band of rutile, and so can
      diffuse to the surface and take part in the photochemical
      reactions much more effectively than in rutile.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Oxidation of VOCs</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0031] In addition to the use of TiO.sub.2 in photosplitting of
      water, heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO.sub.2 has been
      extensively investigated as a method to oxidize organic pollutants
      in water and air, including phenols, chlorinated hydrocarbons and
      other hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] There have been various reports on the complete
      mineralization (photocatalytic oxidation) of organic compounds to
      CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2O by heterogeneous photocatalysis. The
      application of semiconductor photocatalysis for the remediation
      has been used successfully for a wide variety of compounds such as
      alkanes, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic
      acids, aldehydes, alkenes, phenols and some other simple aromatic
      compounds. A variety of metal oxide semiconductors have been
      tested as photocatalysts which include TiO.sub.2 (E.sub.g=3.2 eV),
      WO.sub.3 (E.sub.g=2.8 eV), SrTiO.sub.3 (E.sub.g=3.2 eV) and ZnO
      (E.sub.g=3.2 eV). However, TiO.sub.2 has proven to be the most
      suitable for widespread environmental applications, because it is
      biologically and chemically inert, resistant to photocorrosion and
      chemical corrosion and inexpensive. The conduction and valence
      bands of anatase TiO.sub.2 occur at -0.1 and +3.0 V respectively
      vs. SHE; i.e the holes generated by light excitation are very
      powerful oxidants.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The basic processes occurring in semiconductor
      photocatalysis for mineralization of organic compounds is shown in
      FIG. 7 where A denotes an acceptor and D denotes a donor of
      electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A typical example is the oxidation of acetic acid according
      to the reaction:<br>
      <br>
CH.sub.3COOH+2O.sub.2.fwdarw.(TiO.sub.2+h.nu.).fwdarw.2CO.sub.2+2H.sub.2O<br>
      <br>
      A variety of intermediates have been observed in the reaction such
      as HCO.sub.2-, CHOCO.sub.2-, HCHO, CH.sub.3OOH, CH.sub.3COOOH and
      H.sub.2O.sub.2. This is a downhill reaction which is catalyzed by
      TiO.sub.2 in presence of light. The holes produced by the
      photo-excitation are used for the oxidation of acetic acid whereas
      the electrons are transferred to O.sub.2. Both the reactions,
      reduction of the electron acceptor and oxidation of the pollutant
      molecule occur simultaneously on the surface of the photocatalyst.
      The slowest process determines the overall reaction rate. The
      radical ions formed after the interfacial charge transfer
      reactions can participate in several pathways in the degradation
      process: [0035] They may react chemically with themselves or with
      surface-adsorbed compounds. [0036] They may recombine by back
      electron transfer reactions, especially when they are trapped near
      the surface. [0037] They may diffuse from the semiconductor
      surface and participate in chemical reactions in the bulk
      solution.However, the detailed mechanism of photocatalytic process
      on TiO.sub.2 surface is still not completely understood.
      Nevertheless, two critical processes determine the overall quantum
      efficiency of interfacial charge transfer: [0038] the competition
      between charge-carrier recombination and trapping (picoseconds to
      nanoseconds). [0039] the competition between trapped carrier
      recombination and interfacial charge transfer (microseconds to
      milliseconds).An increase in either charge-carrier lifetime or the
      interfacial electron-transfer rate is expected to lead to higher
      quantum efficiency for steady state photo-catalysis. A point of
      contention in the oxidation mechanism is whether the valence band
      holes can react directly with organic compounds before they are
      trapped, or whether oxidation occurs indirectly via surface bound
      hydroxyl radicals (i.e., a trapped hole at the surface).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] However, even with the ability of titanium dioxide to
      adequately function as a photocatalyst for the processes of both
      water splitting and VOC oxidation, there are some significant
      shortcomings concerning the performance of TiO.sub.2 in each
      process. More particularly, the two challenging issues in the use
      of titania photocatalysis for photosplitting water to produce
      hydrogen and for oxidizing volatile organic compounds are (i) the
      relatively low quantum efficiencies of the catalysts and (ii) the
      requirement of near UV light for photo-activation.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] First, the quantum efficiency, i.e., the efficiency with
      which light is utilized to drive redox reactions, is inherently
      low in TiO.sub.2 because the processes of electron-hole generation
      and the recombination are much faster than the rates at which the
      electrons and holes are trapped and participate in redox reactions
      on the surface of the TiO.sub.2 particles. In addition, upon
      absorption of light of relatively high intensity, the number of
      photo-generated charge carriers is much greater than the number of
      electron or hole traps or surface defects in the TiO.sub.2
      particles or the number of adsorbed molecules. Therefore, as the
      light intensity increases, the fraction of the photogenerated
      charge carriers taking part in the redox reactions decreases.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The second challenging issue in titania photocatalysis is
      the requirement of UV light for the activation of the
      photocatalyst. FIG. 8 shows the solar emission spectrum measured
      at the sea level. It can be seen from the diagram that currently,
      only a small fraction (less than 2.5%) of the solar radiation can
      be used to activate titania.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] There have been numerous attempts to modify the band gap of
      titania to absorb the visible light present abundantly in the
      solar radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in
      lowering the photo-threshold energy for TiO.sub.2 photoexcitation
      through doping with impurity atoms including N, C, S or transition
      metals. However, the effect of transition metal doping of titania
      has been somewhat controversial in literature. While certain
      nitrogen doped TiO.sub.2 films (TiO.sub.2-xN.sub.x) have been
      demonstrated to show enhanced photocatalytic activity in the
      visible region through photodecomposition of organic compounds
      methylene blue and acetaldehyde, the addition of dopants to
      TiO.sub.2 alters the surface characteristics, creating defects at
      the surface of TiO.sub.2 particles. Such sites can affect both
      electron-hole recombination dynamics and absorption
      characteristics of the TiO.sub.2 particles, greatly reducing the
      quantum efficiency and, therefore, the usefulness of the
      photocatalyst, regardless of the benefits realized in lower the
      photo-activation threshold for the photocatalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Therefore, it is desirable to develop a photocatalyst
      material that can be used in performing various redox reactions,
      e.g., water splitting and VOC oxidation processes, but that also
      significantly improves the quantum efficiency of the
      photocatalyst. The photocatalyst should be formed in a manner that
      allows it to be used in these processes in the same manner as
      prior art photocatalysts, without any special considerations or
      requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0045] According to one aspect of the present invention, a
      photocatalyst is provided that is formed as a combination of a
      conventional photo-active semiconductor material and a mineral,
      such as a silicate material, which is not a perovskite-based
      ferroelectric material. The silicate material has an inherent
      electrical polarity that functions on the semiconductor material
      to enhance the separation of the electron hole pairs generated in
      the semiconductor, and thus increases the quantum efficiency of
      the semiconductor, when light is directed at the semiconductor.
      The silicate crystals of tourmaline and quartz are chemically
      stable and physically durable in both air and aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The efficiency of a heterogeneous photocatalytic process
      can be increased by (i) increasing the range and intensity
      absorbed by the photocatalyst i.e. the photon efficiency and (ii)
      increasing the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole
      pairs in the photocatalyst i.e. the quantum efficiency. In the
      scope of the present invention, the results show an increase in
      the quantum efficiency in titania photocatalysts for
      photocatalytic (oxidation of acetaldehyde) and photosynthetic
      (photosplitting of water) reactions. This increase in the quantum
      efficiency is accomplished in one manner by integrating the
      titania photocatalyst with a polar mineral, like tourmaline or
      quartz, having surface electrical fields due to pyroelectric
      effect (tourmaline) and piezoelectric effect (quartz). These
      surface electric fields can increase the photogenerated
      electron-hole separation in a semiconductor photo catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] When titania integrated with a polar mineral is used as the
      photocatalyst in photosplitting of water, there is a marked
      increase in performance compared to using the titania
      photocatalyst alone. To illustrate this, photosplitting of water
      is conducted with these photocatalysts in solutions of various
      pHs. The amount of hydrogen produced from photosplitting of water
      increased considerably with a polar mineral-integrated titania
      photocatalyst compared to pure titania alone. In particular, the
      maximum amount of hydrogen evolved with polar mineral-integrated
      titania in a system using pure water as the solution is about 3
      times the amount evolved when using titania alone. This
      enhancement in the production of hydrogen is also evident systems
      containing solutions of different pH values. The enhancement in
      the performance can be attributed to a reduction in the Schottky
      barrier for electrons to migrate to the surface of the
      semiconductor. The electric field developed in the space charge
      layer of a semiconductor prevents the migration of photogenerated
      electrons to the surface. The surface electric fields present on
      the polar mineral crystals can counteract this field to reduce the
      barrier for electron migration to the surface to take part in
      redox reactions. This lowering of the barrier is caused by the
      reduction of the band bending in the space charge layer and an
      increase in the chemical potential (E.sub.F) of the electrons in
      titania. The polar mineral crystal has oppositely charged ends
      which can cause the photogenerated electrons and holes to diffuse
      in opposite directions in a semiconductor, thus enhancing the
      electron-hole separation. Both the flat band potential (E.sub.fb)
      of titania and the hydrogen reduction reaction follow a Nernstian
      behavior when pH is varied. The increase in the amount of hydrogen
      produced at a lower pH is explained by the decrease in the
      overpotential of the h.e.r. at lower pH values.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] According to another aspect of the present invention, the
      semiconductor material used in forming the photocatalyst can be
      formed in a manner that enhances the ability of the semiconductor
      material to generate the desired electron-hole pair orientation at
      the reactive surfaces of the photocatalyst. The process for
      creation of the semiconductor material enables the structure of
      the material to be dominated by crystal faces that have higher
      photocatalytic activities for reduction, oxidation or both, than
      prior art semiconductor materials formed in a standardized manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] According to still another aspect of the present invention,
      the semiconductor materials formed to optimize the operation of
      the reactive surfaces on the semiconductor can be incorporated
      with the polar mineral to increase the quantum efficiency of the
      photocatalyst utilizing both mechanisms.<br>
      <br>

      present invention will be made apparent from the following

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0076] With reference now to the drawing figures in which like
      reference numerals designate like parts throughout the disclosure,
      a photocatalyst material formed according to the present invention
      is indicated generally at 100 in FIG. 9. In a first preferred
      embodiment of the photocatalyst material 100, the material 100 is
      formed of a conventional semiconductor material 102 and a mineral
      material 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The semiconductor material 102 can be selected from any
      materials having known photocatalytic properties, such as
      semiconductors, and in particular titanium dioxide. This
      semiconductor material 102 is combined with the mineral material
      104 to form the structure of the photocatalyst 100 using any
      method or process for integrating the semiconductor material 102
      and the mineral material 104 with one another. Suitable processes
      include, but are not limited to, simply mixing the two materials
      102, 104 with one another, or by a sol-gel synthesis to produce a
      photocatalyst 100 having a core/shell structure where the core
      contains the particles of the mineral material 104 which are
      coated on the exterior by the semiconductor 102 particles or
      nanoparticles to form the shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The mineral material 104 used in the formation of the
      photocatalyst 100 is selected from those groups of minerals that
      have inherent electrical properties, e.g., piezoelectric or
      pryoelectric properties, that operate to enhance the separation of
      the electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor material 102 when
      light is directed onto the semiconductor material 102. Examples of
      materials of this type that are applicable for use as the mineral
      material 104 include, but are not limited to, silicates, such as
      quartz and tourmaline. Preferably, the mineral material 104 is not
      a ferroelectric material.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Tourmaline belongs to the group of silicate minerals called
      cyclosilicates. The general chemical formula of the tourmaline
      group, as a whole, can be expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      XY.sub.3Z.sub.6(T.sub.6O.sub.18)(BO.sub.3).sub.3V.sub.3W, where:
      [0080] X=Na.sub.+, Ca.sub.2+, K.sub.+ or vacancy [0081]
      Y=Li.sub.+, Fe.sub.2+, Mg.sub.2+, Fe.sub.3+, Al.sub.3+, Cr.sub.3+,
      V.sub.3+, (Ti.sub.4+) [0082] Z=Al.sub.3+, Fe.sub.3+, Mg.sub.2+,
      Cr.sub.3+, V.sub.3+, (Fe.sub.2+) [0083] T=Si.sub.4+, Al.sub.3+,
      (B.sub.3+) [0084] B=B.sub.3+ or vacancy [0085] V=[O(3)] =OH.sub.-,
      O.sub.2- [0086] W=[O(1)] =OH.sub.-, O.sub.2-, F.sub.- [0087] and (
      ) indicates minor or possible substitution.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Some of the important minerals belonging to the tourmaline
      group are listed below with their chemical formulae:<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The chemical formulae listed above represent the ideal composition
      for the corresponding species. But, in reality, there is a limited
      substitution of other cations in the X, Y, Z sites. The tourmaline
      used in this work is Elbaite containing Lithium and Aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Tourmaline belongs to the trigonal or rhombohedral lattice
      crystal structures with the space group R3m. The cell dimensions
      of the rhombohedral lattice vary depending on the composition for
      each of the individual minerals belonging to the tourmaline group.
      In general, the cell parameter c ranges from 6.86-7.47 A.sub.0 and
      a ranges from 15.676-16.2 A.sub.0. The range in the cell
      dimensions of the tourmalines reflects the variation in their
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Tourmaline is a hemimorphic rhombohedral borosilicate. It
      is a true cyclosilicate, consisting of six-membered rings that are
      not connected to one another by tetrahedra as they are in other
      cyclosilicates such as beryl. In the six-membered rings, each
      silicate tetrahedron shares two of its four oxygens with adjacent
      tetrahedra to form (Si.sub.6O.sub.18).sub.12- rings. The apical
      oxygen ions of the six-membered rings point toward the analogous
      pole (-c) of the crystal, giving tourmaline its hemimorphic nature
      and polar properties. The six-membered rings are linked to
      triangular (BO.sub.3).sub.3- groups that lie in the same plane as
      the tetrahedral rings. The borate groups are oriented a three-fold
      axis that runs parallel to the c-axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Tourmaline crystals have one three-fold rotation axis and
      three mirror planes all of which are parallel to the c-axis. This
      symmetry places tourmaline in the ditrigonal pyramidal symmetry
      class. In this symmetry class, all of the occurring forms are open
      and a complete crystal in this class is made up of at least two
      different crystal forms. Because tourmaline forms are open and
      because the crystals have no center of symmetry, no mirror plane
      or rotation axes perpendicular to the c-axis, the rotation of axis
      (in this case the c-axis) is polar. By definition, as shown in
      FIG. 10, the positive end of the c-axis is called the antilogous
      pole and the negative end (-c) is called the analogous pole. These
      limitations on the symmetry of tourmaline necessitate that the top
      and bottom of a tourmaline crystal always have different forms
      (hemimorphic).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Tourmaline, like other minerals that possess only a single
      polar axis of symmetry, exhibits both pyroelectric and
      piezoelectric properties. Pyroelectricity is the property by which
      the two terminations of a heated crystal, with a unique but polar
      rotation axis, are oppositely charged. Upon cooling, the effect
      reverses. During heating, the analogous end of a tourmaline
      crystal becomes charged positively while the antilogous end
      becomes charged negatively. During cooling, after the charges
      developed during heating have been removed, the analogous end
      becomes charged negatively while the antilogous end becomes
      charged positively. Furthermore, when an electric field is applied
      along the c-axis, heating occurs when the current is directed from
      the analogous end toward the antilogous end, and cooling occurs if
      the field is directed in the opposite direction. The intensity of
      electrical polarity is different for differently colored
      tourmalines which is the result of the differences in composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Both true (primary) and false (secondary) pyroelectricity
      have been described for crystalline materials. True
      pyroelectricity can only develop in tourmaline and other
      crystalline substances having a single polar axis, while false
      pyroelectricity can develop in any crystalline substance that
      lacks a center of symmetry, e.g., quartz. False pyroelectricity
      is, in essence, piezoelectricity developed in response to strains
      caused by heating and cooling. True and false pyroelectricity
      cannot be distinguished easily and so the existence of
      pyroelectric effect can be taken only to indicate the lack of a
      center of symmetry, not the presence of a polar axis. Also, some
      minerals that have polar axes do not readily exhibit pyroelectric
      effects (e.g. Schorl). A permanent electric dipole or spontaneous
      polarization is inherent along the c-axis of tourmaline. As
      temperature is varied, the charge distribution in the structure
      shifts to produce a voltage along this axis. This voltage
      dissipates as atmospheric molecules are adsorbed onto the surface,
      so the crystal soon reverts to electrical neutrality. The primary
      pyroelectric coefficient is a vector property, isolated when the
      external electric field, applied stress and applied strain on a
      crystal are constant or zero. However, thermal expansion in a
      crystal held under such conditions establishes a strain field.
      Thus, a component of the measured pyroelectric coefficient is
      caused by the piezoelectric effect. This component, known as
      secondary pyroelectricity, is important as it produces between 75
      and 90% of the observed pyroelectric effect in tourmaline. The
      experimentally measured pyroelectric coefficient is the sum of
      primary and secondary coefficients. Tourmaline pyroelectric
      coefficients are found to be ranging between 1.8-5.4
      .mu.C/(m.sub.2.K). Electric fields of the order of
      10.sub.6-10.sub.7 V/m exist on the surface of micron-sized
      tourmaline.<br>

        Material</span><br>
      <br>
      [0094] Degussa P25 is a commercially available highly dispersed
      titanium dioxide powder manufactured by Degussa. It consists of a
      mixture of anatase and rutile and is produced by the Chloride
      method. This method involves thermal decomposition (or combustion)
      of titanium tetrachloride vapor which is formed by reaction of
      titanium minerals and chlorine gas at 973-1273 K to yield
      TiO.sub.2. P25 TiO.sub.2 formed by this method possesses
      sufficient surface area and has fewer defects because of the
      higher production temperature and is widely used as a
      photocatalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In addition, well aligned, pure phase anatase and rutile
      nanosheets are synthesized through a hydrothermal process using a
      precursor template. The template used is the sheet structure of
      K.sub.xTi.sub.xLi.sub.4-x/2O.sub.8 (denoted KTLO hereafter) which
      has a layered structure composed of lepidocrocite-type corrugated
      host layers of edge-shared Ti(IV)O.sub.6 octahedra with Li.sub.+
      occupying the Ti(IV) octahedral sites in the host layers and
      interlayer K.sub.+ ions. The alkali metal ions in KTLO can be
      extracted by leaching it in an acid solution and the residual
      titanium sites serve as seeds for the nucleation and growth of
      titania in acidic medium under hydrothermal conditions. KTLO is
      synthesized by adding tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OR).sub.4) drop wise
      to a lithium hydroxide (LiOH) aqueous solution under magnetic
      stirring, followed by the addition of distilled water and a
      potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution which acts as the
      mineralizer. The final mixture is adjusted such that the
      concentration of KOH is 1 M, and the molar ratios of Li/Ti is 2:8
      while maintaining the total concentration [Li] +[Ti] =0.5 mol/L.
      This feedstock mixture is loaded into a Teflon lined digestion
      bomb and heated in an oven at 180.degree. C. for 24 hours. The as
      prepared KTLO product is filtered, washed with distilled water and
      dried in an oven. The resulting KTLO powder is characterized by
      X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using a Scintag Pad V diffractometer and
      Surface Area and Pore size Analysis using a Quantachrome
      Instruments NOVA4200e Surface Area &amp; Pore Size Analyzer. For
      hydrothermal synthesis of anatase, 0.3120 g of KTLO is loaded into
      the Teflon lined digestion bomb and 30 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid
      (HOAc) is added to it and the whole mixture is heated at
      180.degree. C. in an oven for varying amount of times. Rutile is
      synthesized using 30 mL of 0.5 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) as the
      solvent instead of the acetic acid and heated in an oven at
      180.degree. C. The obtained products of nanocrystalline anatase
      and rutile are filtered, washed with distilled water and dried in
      an oven at 60.degree. C.<br>

      [0096] Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of titania
      nanostructures is done using a Philips CM 200UT microscope with a
      spherical aberration coefficient (C.sub.s) of 0.5 mm and a
      point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm. The TEM is operated in the
      High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) and the
      Selected-Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) mode at an accelerating
      voltage of 200 kV.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] TEM images of anatase nanosheets are shown in FIG. 11A-F.
      The images show sheets of aligned anatase nanostructures. Based on
      the orientation of the lattice fringes in the HRTEM images, the
      orientation of the crystal axes and crystallographic planes can be
      determined. The measured lattice d-spacing values of the fringes
      are 1.89 .ANG., 3.52 .ANG., and 4.75 .ANG., corresponding to
      {200}, {101} and {002} lattice spacing. The viewing direction can
      determined to be [010]&nbsp; and the particle surface is a (010)
      plane. Thus the individual nanosheets of anatase can be thought to
      be grown epitaxially along the [001]&nbsp; direction and aligned
      or stacked parallelly along the [100]&nbsp; direction to form the
      anatase nanostructures with a sheet like morphology. The mechanism
      of formation of these anatase nanostructures can be explained by
      the plate-like or planar morphology of the KTLO precursor from
      which anatase nanosheets start to form during the hydrothermal
      synthesis. As can be seen from the images, the nanosheets are
      about 30 nm wide and 50 nm long.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] TEM images of aligned rutile nanorods are shown in FIG.
      12A-F. Based on the orientation of the lattice fringes in the
      aligned rutile nanorods, the orientation and the direction of
      growth of the nanorods are determined. The long axial orientation
      of the rutile nanorod is along the [001]&nbsp; direction. The
      lattice spacing of the fringes is measured to be 3.25+0.02 .ANG.
      which corresponds to the {110} lattice planes of rutile crystal.
      The strong (110) diffraction spots compared to other diffraction
      spots from the lattice fringes indicate that the nanostructures
      are dominated by {110} crystal planes. The nanorods are about
      100-150 nm in length and 30 nm in width and a couple of nanometers
      in thickness.<br>

      <br>
      [0099] Tourmaline powder is obtained by crushing and grinding a
      naturally available elbaite crystal. Very fine powder of
      tourmaline powder is obtained by the sedimentation technique. The
      ground tourmaline powder is dispersed in a beaker of water. The
      smaller (lighter) particles get suspended in the liquid while the
      heavier particles sink to the bottom of the beaker. The smaller
      particles are collected by filtration and the larger particles are
      again ground to obtain further finer powder and the process is
      repeated until very fine tourmaline powder with a narrow size
      distribution is obtained. From the SEM images, the tourmaline
      particles are found to have a size ranging from 1-5 microns.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">a.) Procedures</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0100] The photosplitting of water experiments are carried out in
      quartz tubes of dimensions 14.times.16 mm (I.D..times.O.D.) and of
      length of about one feet which can be fitted with a rubber stopper
      at the open end to create a closed system for gases. The quartz
      tubes are transparent to UV light. A certain amount of the
      photocatalyst (titania and titania plus tourmaline) is weighed
      carefully and loaded into the quartz tube and 5 ml of water is
      added to it. The quartz tube is then closed with a rubber stopper
      and capped using crimps. The tubes are then flushed with dry
      nitrogen gas to remove the oxygen present inside and create an
      inert atmosphere. The tubes are placed on a shaker moving at 100
      rpm and are exposed to UV light from a lamp. The source of UV
      light is a Spectroline ENF 280C equipped with one 8 W long
      wavelength (365 nm) tube with LONGLIFE filter assembly. The
      intensity of the light emitted is about 470 .mu.W/cm.sub.2 at a
      distance of 15 cm. Gas samples are collected periodically from the
      tubes using 1 mL syringes, for hydrogen analysis. For experiments
      using ascorbic acid as the electron donor, 5 mL of 200 mM of
      ascorbic acid solution is added to the photocatalyst in the tubes
      instead of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The amount of hydrogen gas from the photosplitting
      experiments is measured with an AMETEK Trace Analytical ta3000 Gas
      Chromatograph. The ta3000 Gas Analyzer is an isothermal gas
      chromatograph configured with a Reduction Gas Detector (RGD)
      sensor for detection of hydrogen. The operating principle of the
      RGD is based upon the strong absorption of UV light by mercury
      vapor. As a reducing species like hydrogen passes through a heated
      mercuric oxide bed in the detector, mercury vapor is released in
      direct proportion to its concentration in the sample gas. The
      amount of mercury vapor can be measured by its UV absorption by a
      photometric cell. The carrier gas used is nitrogen of 99.99999%
      purity at a flow rate of 20 cc/min. The detection limit of the
      instrument is 10 ppb hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">b.) Results</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0102] Photosplitting of water experiments were done with P25
      titania, P25 titania integrated with tourmaline, nanostructured
      anatase and rutile phases as the photocatalysts in a solution of
      pure water, water at different values of pH and ascorbic acid.
      FIG. 13 shows the hydrogen production in parts per billion (ppb)
      using 5 ml of pure water as the solution. 0.02 g of P25 titania
      (P) is used when the photocatalyst is used alone, and 0.02 g of
      P25 titania is combined with an equal amount of tourmaline powder
      for the second system (P+T). Hydrogen production from water
      increased considerably when P25 titania is combined with
      tourmaline powder compared to using P25 titania alone. The rate of
      hydrogen evolution follows a trend where the rate is very high
      initially and gradually declines after 2 hours. The increase in
      the amount of hydrogen produced is not monotonic. This is due to
      the back reaction of hydrogen and oxygen combining to form water
      again. Back reaction to form water is highly undesirable and is
      one of the biggest problems encountered in photochemical synthesis
      of hydrogen from water, since the reaction is energetically
      favorable.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] FIG. 14 shows the evolution of hydrogen using a solution of
      pH 4.8 with the photocatalysts. The solution pH is controlled
      through addition of 0.1 N HNO.sub.3. The increase in the amount of
      hydrogen produced in the (P+T) system compared to using P25 alone
      is much more enhanced at a low solution pH than in pure water. The
      amount of hydrogen produced is as high as 2 ppm in the (P+T)
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] FIG. 15 shows the hydrogen evolution in systems containing
      solutions of alkaline pHs of 8 and 9.5. The amount of hydrogen
      produced in the (P+T) systems is still higher than systems using
      P25 alone, but the total amounts of hydrogen produced are
      considerably lower to systems containing solutions of neutral or
      acidic pHs.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The reactions involved in photosplitting of water to
      produce hydrogen are:<br>
      <br>
      4h++2H2O(liq).fwdarw.O2(gas)+4H+(anodic)<br>
      <br>
      4H++4e-.fwdarw.2H2(gas)(cathodic)<br>
      <br>
      The overall reaction can be written as:<br>
      <br>
      2H2O(liq)+4e-.fwdarw.O2(gas)+2H2(gas)<br>
      <br>
      The above reaction proceeds when 4 charge carriers diffuse from
      the interior of the semiconductor particle onto the surface to
      reduce or oxidize the adsorbed species. The electromotive force
      (EMF) generated by this reaction as calculated from the value of
      standard free energy .DELTA.G.degree..sub.(H2O) is 1.23 eV. The
      redox potential of the cathodic (H.sub.2O/H.sub.2) and the anodic
      (O.sub.2/H.sub.2O) half cell reactions vary with the pH according
      to the Nernst equation as shown on the Eh-pH diagram in FIG. 2B.
      The cathodic reactions varies as:<br>
      <br>
      Eh=-0.0592 pH;<br>
      <br>
      and the anodic half cell reaction varies as:<br>
      <br>
      Eh=1.23-0.0592 pH.<br>
      <br>
      So the redox potentials shift to more negative values (higher on
      the electrochemical scale) as pH increases. As explained
      previously, for water reduction to occur at the
      semiconductor/liquid interface, the conduction band has to be more
      negative than the redox potential of H.sub.2O/H.sub.2. Only a few
      semiconducting materials such as TiO.sub.2, CdS and SrTiO.sub.3
      satisfy this condition. For an n-type semiconductor like
      TiO.sub.2, a space charge layer forms at the
      semiconductor/electrolyte and the electric field in this layer
      prevents the transfer of electrons from the interior of the
      semiconductor to the interface. When the interface is irradiated,
      the band bending at the interface is reduced and E.sub.F is moved
      towards the flat band potential. For electron transfer to occur
      from the semiconductor to the redox species, the chemical
      potential (E.sub.F) of the electrons in the semiconductor should
      be greater (higher) than the chemical potential of the electrons
      in the redox species (E.sub.F,redox). If this condition is
      satisfied, electrons can migrate from the bulk of the
      semiconductor onto the surface where they can reduce the H.sub.+
      ions to hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] For P25 titania, the conduction band edge is just above the
      redox potential for H.sub.2O/H.sub.2. As a result, the driving
      potential for the reduction reaction which is defined as the
      difference in potential between the conduction band minimum and
      the redox potential of H.sub.2O/H.sub.2, is very much less. Also
      because of the band bending inside the semiconductor, the chemical
      potential of the electrons generated in the interior of the
      semiconductor particle might actually be lower than the
      H.sub.2O/H.sub.2 redox potential, such that the electrons may not
      be able to thermodynamically reduce the H.sub.+ ions to produce
      hydrogen. These two factors can explain the observed low amounts
      of hydrogen produced using P25 titania alone as the photocatalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] When P25 titania is integrated with tourmaline particles
      and employed as the photocatalyst, the amount of hydrogen produced
      increased considerably, more than by a factor of 2. Tourmaline is
      a polar mineral and has surface polarization at ambient
      temperatures. Each crystal or particle has two poles or regions of
      opposite charge at the ends. These surface electric fields on
      tourmaline can replicate the Schottky effect on
      metal/semiconductor junctions where in the barrier potential for
      the migration of charge carriers to the surface semiconductor is
      reduced by an applied external electric field. This is
      qualitatively shown in FIG. 16 where in the presence of
      tourmaline, the band bending in titania semiconductor particles is
      reduced and the conduction band in the interior of the
      semiconductor moves upwards. The barrier potential in titania is
      reduced from E.sub.B to E.sub.B1 in presence of tourmaline. Thus
      the chemical potential of the electrons (E.sub.F) photogenerated
      inside the semiconductor is higher than the H.sub.2O/H.sub.2 redox
      potential, and the electrons can thermodynamically reduce the
      H.sub.+ ions adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor to
      produce hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In simplest terms, the effect of surface polarization of
      tourmaline on titania can be explained by the opposing charges
      present at the either ends of tourmaline particle. For the
      semiconductor particles attached to the positively charged end,
      the electrons generated inside the semiconductor migrate outwards
      towards this surface, while the photogenerated holes migrate
      outwards towards the opposite surface. Thus the electrons and
      holes are driven to different locations, and consequently
      oxidation and reduction reactions are spatially separated. The
      process occurs conversely in the semiconductor particles attached
      to the negatively charged end towards which the holes migrate
      while the electrons migrate outwards towards the opposite surface.
      Thus more charge carriers are available for the redox reactions
      and hence the amount of hydrogen produced is substantially higher
      than in systems containing just the semiconductor photocatalyst
      P25.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] From the figures above, it can be seen that the amount of
      hydrogen produced increases when the pH of the solution is 4.8 and
      the amount of hydrogen decreases when a more alkaline pH (8 and
      9.5) is used compared to the system using pure water. As given by
      the equations illustrated above, the redox potentials of
      H.sub.2O/H.sub.2 and O.sub.2/H.sub.2O change as pH is increased.
      The flat band potential of the semiconductor is also demonstrated
      to show Nernstian behavior as pH is varied:<br>
      <br>
      E.sub.CB=E.sub.CBO-0.0592 pH<br>
      <br>
      Thus the driving potential which is the difference between the CB
      minimum and the redox potential remains constant as pH is varied.
      This could lead to the conclusion that the amount of hydrogen
      produced should not change even as the pH of the solution is
      varied. But there are other factors which should be considered
      when the pH of the solution is changed. At lower pH values, the
      size of the titania agglomerates increases resulting in a
      reduction in the surface area which can lower the photocatalytic
      reactivity. But as pH is lowered, the concentration of H.sub.+ in
      the solution increases and the coverage of hydrogen increases.
      Also, the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (h.e.r)
      which is the kinetic barrier to the electrode potential, is lower
      at lower values of pH and is higher at higher values of pH. The
      overpotential of an electrode is defined as the difference between
      the operating potential and the equilibrium potential. When the
      overpotential is low, the reaction on the electrode can proceed at
      potentials closer to the equilibrium potentials and represents a
      kinetic barrier to the reaction. Hence when the overpotential of
      the h.e.r is low, the amount of hydrogen produced is higher than
      when the overpotential of h.e.r is high in solutions of alkaline
      pHs.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Also titania is an amphoteric oxide which upon addition to
      pure water decreases the pH slightly. However, this temporal
      variation in pH does not affect the hydrogen evolution much. At
      lower pH, the surface of the oxide is covered with hydroxyl ions
      which results in the observed decrease in the pH. Taking into
      effect all these factors, pH values between 4.5 and 7 are shown to
      be the optimal range for hydrogen evolution. This explains the
      increase in the amount of hydrogen produced when solutions of pH
      4.8 and pure water compared to the solutions with a higher pH
      values.<br>

      <br>
      [0111] The photocatalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde is carried out
      in quartz tubes of dimensions as described above which can be
      fitted with a rubber stopper at the open end to create a closed
      system for gases. The oxidation experiments are performed with
      films of titania as the photocatalyst. Titania films are made from
      an aqueous slurry containing 5 weight % photocatalyst. For
      experiments using titania integrated with fine-grained tourmaline
      or quartz as the photocatalyst, a 1:1 weight ratio of titania and
      tourmaline (or quartz) is used with the weight % of titania in the
      aqueous slurry being 5%. The photocatalyst films are made by
      coating one side of thin glass slides (dimensions
      280.times.10.times.2 mm) with 2 ml of the aqueous slurry and
      drying them in an oven at 60.degree. C. These glass slides are
      then placed inside the quartz tubes and sealed with a rubber
      stopper and capped using crimps. The quartz tubes are then flushed
      with oxygen gas for 10 minutes to create an oxidizing atmosphere
      inside.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Acetaldehyde is a volatile organic compound with a boiling
      point (21.degree. C.) below the room temperature. Acetaldehyde
      used for the experiments is obtained from Fisher Scientific and is
      stored in a refrigerator in liquid form in a bottle. A stock
      gaseous mixture of acetaldehyde is made separately in a 100 mL
      glass bottle. The glass bottle is sealed with a rubber stopper and
      flushed with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes to remove the oxygen
      present inside. The glass bottle is then placed in a tray
      containing ice to cool it to zero degrees temperature. A 1 mL
      syringe with needle is also placed in the tray to be cooled down
      to the zero degrees. The acetaldehyde bottle is taken out from the
      refrigerator and placed in the tray containing ice. 0.5 mL of
      acetaldehyde liquid is injected with the syringe into the stock
      bottle. The stock bottle is then taken out from the tray with the
      ice to allow it to warm upto room temperature. The acetaldehyde in
      the bottle vaporizes at room temperature and expands to fill the
      glass bottle. (0.5 mL of acetaldehyde liquid expands to about 216
      mL of gaseous acetaldehyde at 25.degree. C. assuming ideal gas
      behavior). Before the bottle is taken out of ice, the rubber
      stopper is pierced with a syringe needle fitted to one end of a
      long rubber tube and the other end of the rubber tube is immersed
      in a beaker containing water. As the bottle warms up to room
      temperature, acetaldehyde vaporizes and expands inside the bottle.
      The nitrogen inside the bottle is expelled through the syringe
      needle which is bubbled through the water in the beaker. Once the
      bubbling of the gas stops, the pressure inside the bottle reaches
      atmospheric pressure and the syringe needle is removed from the
      stock bottle containing pure acetaldehyde gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] For the oxidation experiments, 1 mL of acetaldehyde gas
      from the stock bottle is injected into the quartz tubes containing
      the photocatalyst films and filled with oxygen gas. The tubes are
      then exposed to the UV light of wavelength 365 nm. Gas samples are
      collected periodically from the tubes using a 100 .mu.L syringe
      and analyzed in a Gas Chromatograph (GC).<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy (EPR) or Electron
      Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy technique is used to detect
      paramagnetic species i.e. species with unpaired electrons,
      generally free radicals. The basic physics of this technique is
      similar to NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), but instead of the
      spins of the atom's nuclei, the electron spins are excited. An
      electron has a magnetic moment, which when placed in an external
      magnetic field of strength B.sub.0, aligns itself parallel (lower
      energy) or anti-parallel to the external field (higher energy).
      This is called Zeeman effect and the energy separation between
      these two states is given by:<br>
      <br>
      E=g.sub.e.mu..sub.BB.sub.0<br>
      <br>
      where g.sub.e is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (the ratio
      of its magnetic dipole moment to its angular moment) and
      .mu..sub.B is the Bohr magneton. An electron can resonate between
      these two states by absorption of electromagnetic radiation of
      energy .orgate.hE=.DELTA.. A free electron (on its own) has a g
      value of 2.002319304386 (which is g.sub.e, the electronic g
      factor). EPR signals can be generated by changing the magnetic
      field B.sub.0 at a constant frequency (.orgate.) radiation and
      measuring the energy absorption to obtain a series of sharp peaks
      and troughs corresponding to different values of g at different
      magnetic field strengths. EPR can be used for the identification
      and quantification of radicals, to identify the reaction pathways
      involving radicals in photocatalytic reactions. EPR measurements
      are performed using a Bruker ER 300 EPR Spectrometer operating at
      X-band with a TM.sub.110 cavity. The instrument settings used are:
      modulation amplitude 5-10 G, time constant 5 ms, modulation
      frequency 100 kHz, microwave power 1-2 mW, microwave frequency
      9.35 GHz and a center field of 3300 G. The samples were placed in
      a quartz EPR cell and immersed in liquid nitrogen in a quartz
      insert Dewar (77 K) and irradiated with an 8 W UV lamp through the
      irradiation slots of the EPR cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The amount of carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) gas from the
      photocatalytic oxidation experiments is measured with a Shimadzu
      GC-14A gas chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector
      (FID) with methanizer. In gas chromatography, a gas sample is
      swept by a carrier gas through a column packed with a material
      that the different gases in the sample have different affinities
      for and so elute out at different times. The carrier gas used is
      He with a mass flow controller and the fuel gas is a mixture of
      air and H.sub.2. When CO.sub.2 elutes from the column, it is mixed
      with H.sub.2 and passed over hot zinc in the methanizer where it
      is reduced to CH.sub.4. The CH.sub.4 is burnt to CO.sub.2 in the
      H.sub.2 flame and the current produced between the anode and the
      cathode of the FID can be measured to give the amount of CO.sub.2
      in the sample. The detection limit of the instrument with the
      above settings is 20 parts per thousand of CO.sub.2 gas.<br>

      [0116] EPR (ESR) spectroscopy has been widely used to examine
      paramagnetic species on TiO.sub.2 surfaces, particularly with the
      objective of identifying radicals formed under UV irradiation
      which are important in photocatalytic processes. In the process of
      photocatalysis, the electrons and holes generated in the
      irradiated particles are trapped at the surface, forming
      paramagnetic species. The photocatalytic reactions arise from the
      reaction of these radicals with some reactant molecule at the
      TiO.sub.2 surface. The photogenerated electrons may be trapped at
      several sites; titanium atoms on the surface or inside the
      particles, or oxygen molecules adsorbed on the surface. The
      photogenerated holes can be trapped at the oxygen atoms in the
      crystalline lattice near the particle surface or at the hydroxyl
      groups on the surface. FIG. 17 shows the ESR spectra obtained at
      77 K from P25 titania, P25 titania with tourmaline, nanostructured
      anatase and rutile synthesized by the hydrothermal method.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The ESR signals are labeled as signals A and B. They are
      characterized by the sets of g values g.sub.1=2.0058,
      g.sub.2=2.01025, g.sub.3=2.0215 from signal A and g.sub.1=1.9945,
      g.sub.2=1.9772 from signal B. Both P25 titania and P25 titania
      integrated with tourmaline have strong signal A and a weak signal
      B. Rutile nanoplates have a very high intensity from signal B, but
      have a very weak signal A. Nanostructured Anatase has high
      intensities of both signals A and B. A review of the literature
      suggests that signal A can be attributed to the holes trapped on
      or near the particle surface, and signal B can be attributed to
      electrons trapped at the particle surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In anatase, photoproduced holes are trapped at the lattice
      oxygen atoms located in the subsurface layer of the hydrated
      anatase. This radical has the structure
      Ti.sub.4+O.sub.-.Ti.sub.4+OH.sub.- and has the set of g values
      g.sub.1=2.004, g.sub.2=2.012, g.sub.3=2.016. Signal A corresponds
      well to this signal in the g values and the shape, and the surface
      of the samples are covered with hydroxyl groups. From this
      consideration, signal A can be assigned to the
      Ti.sub.4+O.sub.-.Ti.sub.4+OH.sub.- radical. This shows that the
      surface hydroxyl group plays an important role in photocatalytic
      oxidation reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Signal B originates from the electrons trapped at or inside
      the particle surface. It was reported that Ti.sub.3+ is formed on
      TiO.sub.2 powders by trapping the photogenerated electrons. The g
      values of Ti.sub.3+ were reported to be below 2. The g values of
      1.9945 and 1.9772 from signal B can be attributed to Ti.sub.3+.
      The difference between the g values of the surface Ti.sub.3+ and
      those of the inside Ti.sub.3+ are very small. Although it is
      difficult to predict the location of Ti.sub.3+ radicals only from
      the g values, it is generally assumed that Ti.sub.3+ formed inside
      the particles acts as a recombination center and reduces the
      activity of the photocatalyst whereas the Ti.sub.3+ formed on the
      surface of the particles increases the photoactivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] P25 titania is a mixture of anatase and rutile, dominated
      by the anatase component (84%). Both P25 titania and P25 titania
      integrated with tourmaline show a strong signal A which arises
      from the trapped holes and a weak signal B which arises from the
      trapped electrons. Thus it can be expected that both these samples
      show a higher activity for photocatalytic oxidation compared to
      photocatalytic reduction, because of the presence of excess
      trapped holes. Rutile nanoplates show a weak signal A, but a very
      strong signal B suggesting that the rutile particles have excess
      trapped electrons at the surface which can take part in the
      photocatalytic reduction reactions. Anatase nanostructures show
      strong signals of both A and B indicating that a large number of
      photogenerated holes and electrons are trapped near the particle
      surface which can undergo oxidation and reduction reactions. Thus
      the anatase sample is expected to show a high activity for both
      photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] From the ESR spectra in FIG. 15, it can be seen that
      nanostructured anatase sample shows very strong signals A and B
      whereas the rutile sample shows a very strong signal B, but a weak
      signal A. P25 titania and tourmaline integrated P25 titania
      photocatalysts show a strong signal A, but a very weak signal B.
      As explained previously, signal A arises from the trapped holes on
      the surface of the photocatalyst particle which take part in the
      oxidation reactions whereas signal B arises from the trapped
      electrons on the photocatalyst surface sites which take part in
      the reduction reactions. It can be inferred from the ESR spectra
      that nanostructured anatase will show a high activity for both
      oxidation ad reduction reactions since it has strong signals A and
      B, nanostructured rutile will show a high activity for reduction
      because of the presence of a strong signal B, but a moderate or
      weak activity for oxidation because of a very weak signal A. P25
      titania is expected to show a high activity for oxidation because
      of strong signal A, but a very low activity for reduction because
      of a very weak signal B. Photochemical reactivity of anatase and
      rutile depends on the surface orientation (hkl of the surface on
      which the redox reaction is taking place) of the photocatalyst
      particle or the film. Different surface energy levels of the
      conduction and valence bands are expected for different crystal
      faces of TiO2 because of the atomic arrangements characteristics
      of the faces. The difference in the energy levels drives the
      electrons and holes to different crystal faces, leading to
      separation of electrons and holes resulting in different
      photocatalytic activities for different crystal faces. It has been
      concluded that the oxidation and reduction sites on rutile
      particles are on the {011} and {110} faces respectively, and, on
      {001} and {011} face respectively for anatase particles. These
      surfaces are thought to be especially reactive because of the
      presence of four-coordinate and five-coordinate Ti atoms on faces
      due to surface termination, which can act as surface reaction
      sites. P25 titania is a mixture of predominantly anatase and
      rutile phases with the bulk particles having random surface
      orientations. Nanostructured anatase is dominated by the {101},
      {001} and {100} crystal faces whereas the rutile nanorods are
      dominated by the {110} and {001} crystal surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The conduction and valence bands of anatase TiO.sub.2 occur
      at -0.1 and +3.0 V respectively vs. SHE; i.e. the holes generated
      by light excitation are very powerful oxidants. Acetaldehyde is a
      common contaminant in indoor air and is also formed during PCO of
      ethanol. Acetaldehyde can be mineralized completely to produce
      CO.sub.2 as the final product by photocatalytic oxidation. FIG. 16
      shows the formation of CO.sub.2 from the oxidation of acetaldehyde
      on photocatalyst films made of P25 titania and P25 titania
      integrated with tourmaline. The levels of CO.sub.2 in the
      atmosphere are about 380 ppm, and in the laboratory, they are
      about 600-700 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The amount of CO.sub.2 formed is very similar in case of
      both the photocatalysts, with the P25 titania being slightly more
      active and producing more CO.sub.2 in the initial period. Both
      photocatalysts are very active initially and the rate of CO.sub.2
      formation gradually decreases. As discussed previously, the ESR
      signal A from trapped holes in photocatalysts P25 titania and P25
      titania with tourmaline is substantial indicating they can be very
      powerful catalysts for PCO. The trapped holes react with the
      surface hydroxyls to form the hydroxyl radicals. One of the
      proposed mechanism for PCO of acetaldehyde is direct decomposition
      to CO.sub.2 according to the following reactions:<br>
      <br>
      *OH.sub.-+h+.fwdarw.OH<br>
      <br>
      CH3OCHO+OH*.fwdarw.CH3C*O+H2O<br>

      <br>
      CH3C(O)O*.fwdarw.CH3*+CO2<br>
      <br>
      Another minor reaction mechanism involves through the formation of
      acetic acid:<br>
      <br>
      CH3CHO+OH*.fwdarw.[CH3CHOHO*] a*<br>
      <br>
      [CH3CHOHO*] a*.fwdarw.CH3CHOHOa*<br>

      CH3CHOHOa*+O2.fwdarw.CH3COOH+HOO*<br>
      <br>
      The water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts
      causes band bending in the semiconductor as explained previously.
      This band bending pushes the valence band lower or more positive
      on the electrochemical scale increasing greatly the oxidation
      potential of the photogenerated holes. But in presence of
      tourmaline, the surface electric fields present on tourmaline
      crystals reduce the band bending in the semiconductor slightly. So
      the oxidation potential of the photogenerated holes is slightly
      reduced. This explains the amount of CO.sub.2 formed, being a
      little lower in the initial period of PCO when using P25 titania
      with tourmaline as the photocatalyst compared to using P25 titania
      alone. But the decrease in the band bending of the semiconductor
      due to polarity of the tourmaline grains is very small compared to
      the overall oxidation potential (.about.3 eV) of the holes that
      this effect is very little. Eventually, the amount of CO.sub.2
      formed is comparable to that formed using P25 titania alone as the
      photocatalyst. Acetaldehyde can be completely mineralized to
      CO.sub.2. The acetaldehyde decomposition reaction is<br>
      <br>
      CH3OCHO+5/2O2.fwdarw.2CO2+2H2O<br>
      <br>
      The amount of acetaldehyde is added is 1 mL (.about.25 parts per
      thousand). The amount of CO.sub.2 formed is very little after the
      initial rapid rate of formation. This is due to the decomposition
      of all the acetaldehyde and there is no more acetaldehyde
      available for consumption. Photocatalysts can be deactivated after
      a certain time resulting in no formation of any more CO.sub.2.
      This deactivation of catalysts is due to the poisoning of the
      catalyst. This poisoning of the catalyst is thought to be due to
      the decomposition of acetaldehyde to form stable surface species
      on titania or the due to the formation of trimeric condensation
      products, higher molecular weight compounds and coke by the
      reaction of the methyl radical with acetaldehyde.<br>

      [0124] FIG. 19 shows the evolution of hydrogen from pure water
      when nanostructured anatase and rutile are used as the
      photocatalysts. For reference, the amount of hydrogen evolved with
      P25 titania is also included. The amount of hydrogen evolved and
      the rate of hydrogen evolution are similar for anatase and rutile
      though rutile is marginally more active than anatase. The amount
      of hydrogen evolved is also higher than with tourmaline integrated
      P25 titania photocatalyst and a lot higher than with the P25
      titania photocatalyst. In fact, the maximum amount of hydrogen
      evolved with nanostructured anatase and rutile (2000 ppb) is about
      4 times higher than the maximum amount of hydrogen (500 ppb)
      evolved with the P25 titania photocatalyst. The rate of hydrogen
      evolution is high initially and gradually decreases with time.<br>

      [0125]&nbsp; FIG. 20 shows the formation of CO.sub.2 during PCO of
      acetaldehyde by nanostructured anatase and rutile phases. For
      reference, PCO of acetaldehyde using the P25 titania is also
      included. The anatase nanosheets show a very high activity for
      oxidation of acetaldehyde and a high initial rate of formation of
      CO.sub.2. In contrast, the rutile phase shows only a moderate
      activity for the oxidation to CO.sub.2 and the rate of formation
      of CO.sub.2 is very less compared to the anatase phase. The rate
      decreases gradually with time for both the anatase and rutile. In
      case of anatase, the formation of CO.sub.2 decreases because of
      the complete mineralization of acetaldehyde while in case of
      rutile, the formation of CO.sub.2 decreases even when there is
      acetaldehyde present in the tube. This is probably due to the
      deactivation of the rutile photocatalyst in the manner described
      in the previous section.<br>
      <br>
      [0126]&nbsp; The results of oxidation and reduction experiments
      presented above agree well with the conclusions for nanostructured
      anatase and rutile photocatalysts based on the EPR data obtained
      on these photocatalysts. The morphology of anatase particles is
      dominated by {001} and {100} crystal faces and thus shows a strong
      photocatalytic activity for both oxidation and reduction reactions
      as evidenced by the strong signals A and B in the ESR spectrum and
      the results in the photosplitting of water and PCO of
      acetaldehyde. Thermodynamically stable anatase crystals are
      dominated by {101} faces that are symmetry identical and less
      reactive. The morphology of rutile phase is dominated by {110} and
      {001} crystal faces which show a high activity only for reduction
      reactions as evidenced by a strong signal B and a weak signal A in
      the ESR spectrum and the results in the photosplitting of water
      and PCO of acetaldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      [0127]&nbsp; Thus, the quantum efficiency of a photocatalyst can
      also be increased by the production of the
      semiconductor/photocatalyst material in a manner that provides a
      nanostructure having crystal faces with the desired activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0128]&nbsp; The results from quartz-titania composites also
      indicate coated quartz crystals can enhance both hydrogen
      production from water (FIG. 21) and photocatalytic oxidation of
      VOCs (FIG. 22). Coating either quartz micro-crystals or tourmaline
      micro-crystals will enhance the photocatalytic reaction, and
      reduce amount of photocatalysts.<br>
      <br>
      [0129]&nbsp; Other applications of the present invention involve
      the use of sol-gel synthesis to produce photocatalysts having a
      core/shell structure where the core contains the quartz or
      tourmaline particles which are coated on the outside (shell) with
      the titania nanoparticles, photocatalysts coated on micro-crystals
      of quartz and tourmaline, and composites of photocatalysts with
      micro-crystals with electrical polarity. This way, the effect of
      the electrical polarity of tourmaline or quartz particles can be
      spread across as many titania nanoparticles as possible. Or
      increased performance of the photocatalysts in photoreduction and
      photooxidation processes. Another area of application of the
      present invention is in the field of photo-voltaic (PV) solar
      cells where the effect of these polar minerals on the efficiency
      of the cell will improve the performance of the solar cell. Solar
      cells use solar energy to produce electricity by spatial
      separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the
      semiconductor material. The electrical polarity of tourmaline and
      quartz can enhance the electron-hole separation and increase the
      efficiency of the cell considerably.<br>
      <br>
      [0130]&nbsp; Still other applications of the present invention
      involve increasing the photon-efficiency in titania in addition to
      the increase in quantum efficiency accomplished in the present
      invention. Titania is a wide band gap semiconductor and can absorb
      only a small portion of the solar spectrum. Photon efficiency can
      be increased by reducing the band gap by doping or increasing the
      absorption of light of longer wavelengths. The effect of doping
      transition metals like Ni, Cu, Nb, N etc into titania (anatase and
      rutile) or titania nanotubes to produce an additional absorption
      peak in the visible light wavelength range can be incorporated
      into the photocatalysts of the present invention using the polar
      mineral materials and the nanostructured anatase and rutile
      titania components.<br>
      <br>

      invention are contemplated as being within the scope of the
      following claims, particularly pointing out and distinctly
      claiming the subject matter regarded as the invention.<br>
