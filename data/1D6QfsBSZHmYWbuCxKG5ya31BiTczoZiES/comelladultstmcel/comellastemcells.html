      <br>
      There have been nearly 12,000 adult stem cell therapies performed
      in the United States with an over 90 percent success healing rate
      for mostly joint and spinal conditions.<br>
      <br>
      It involves using the patient's own stem cells, so no patent-able
      drugs are involved.<br>
      <br>
      They are targeting the most influential stem cell scientist in the
      U.S., Dr. Kristin Comella in Florida. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Differentiating the Types of Stem Cell Therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many consider stem cell therapy 'the future of medicine'...<br>
      <br>
      A stem cell can rebuild or create new cells in tissues, even in
      organ tissues other than those from which they had originally
      existed.<br>
      <br>
      They could be considered seeds for growing body tissues. They are
      mostly able to function for cellular repair and growth no matter
      what organ is in need of repair or healing from chronic
      inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      There is a considerable controversy surrounding stem cell therapy
      research, a branch of regenerative medicine. Much of the
      controversy has to do with not differentiating between adult stem
      cell therapy and embryonic stem cell therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Embryonic stem cell therapy is the controversial one. It cultures
      or creates stem cells from terminated or aborted fetuses.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, the FDA is harassing stem cell clinics that do not
      derive their stem cell solutions from aborted fetus tissue. They
      extract the stem cells from the patient's own adipose tissue and
      inject them into areas where that same patient needs repair.<br>
      <br>
      It's an autologous process called adult stem cell therapy.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Stem Cell based out of South Florida is one of the clinics
      being targeted by the FDA, and the clinic's Chief Scientist is Dr.
      Kristin Comella, PhD.<br>
      <br>
      Many other nations have been using adult stem cell therapy
      successfully over the past 15 years, leaving the USA dead last in
      this field. The FDA is trying to make sure it stays that way and
      allows costly pharmaceutical versions to prevail.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Kristin Comella and her clinic have been under attack from the
      FDA.<br>
      <br>
      This short 3-minute video was produced interviewing Dr. Comella
      and some of her patients:<br>

      <b>Examining and Comparing the Different Types of Stem Cell
        Therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) therapy has received most of the
      media's attention and government support.<br>
      <br>
      But it is the most controversial because it involves extracting
      tissues from terminated human embryos, aka aborted fetuses.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to moral and ethical issues, human embryonic stem cell
      (hESC) solutions create cells so rapidly where they're injected
      they lead to cancerous tumors.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid that, researchers have to use immuno-suppressant drugs to
      curb the embryonic stem cells' tendency toward cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Using pharmaceutical drugs to curb hESC cancer side effect issues,
      leads to other unexplored and unexpected side effects from those
      patented stem cell solutions.<br>
      <br>
      But the profit motive for embryonic stem cell therapies was strong
      and a lot of government funds had been put into its research.
      Pharmaceutical companies were motivated because they could patent
      stem cells created from embryonic tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Bone marrow stem cell therapy was among the first to depart from
      flawed hESC (human embryonic stem cell) therapies developed over
      the past two decades. Bone marrow stem cell therapy was the segue
      into the adult stem cell therapy movement.<br>
      <br>
      Bone marrow extractions are painful, requiring general anesthesia.
      It's relatively difficult and expensive compared to adipose (fat)
      tissue stem cell harvesting.<br>
      <br>
      Bone marrow's high white blood cell count also encourages
      inflammation, making it counter-productive for patients already
      suffering from chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Most importantly, adipose (fat) tissue yields up to 500 times more
      mesenchymal stem cells than bone marrow sources, according to Dr.
      Comella.<br>
      <br>
      These are potent stem cells that can differentiate into a wide
      variety of other cell types. Furthermore, the adipose white blood
      cell count is lower than bone marrow matter.<br>
      <br>
      Overactive, confused immune responses attack organs continually
      and create chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The lower white blood cell count automatically lowers the risk of
      further inflammation among patients already suffering from chronic
      inflammation and autoimmune diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The outpatient treatment involves creating a very small and
      shallow incision that won't require stitches on an area of skin
      covering adipose tissue (fat).<br>
      <br>
      From there, liposuction can withdraw a portion of the fat. This
      part of the procedure requires only a local anesthetic.<br>
      <br>
      Then what is extracted is spun at high speed in a special
      centrifuge to isolate the stem cells which are then purified for
      IV drip delivery or injection into the same patient from whom it
      was extracted.<br>
      <br>
      Total costs range from five to ten thousand dollars or more in
      some cases.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Comella and her colleagues' mission is to get adult stem cell
      therapy available for everyone. Private and government health
      insurance providers cover medical treatments that are much more
      expensive.<br>
      <br>
      Why not cover one that would save money with its lower expense and
      fewer side effects?<br>
      <br>
      Over the years, there have been nearly 12,000 adult stem cell
      therapies performed in the United States with an over 90 percent
      success healing rate for mostly joint and spinal conditions as
      well as heart and lung issues.<br>
      <br>
      But the three known adverse side effect cases continually get all
      the media attention.<br>
      <br>
      The Panama College of Cell Science, which helped launch Kristin
      Comella's research and development, had this to say about her:<br>
      <br>
      "Perhaps the most influential clinician on the subject of adult
      stem cell therapy, Dr. Comella has been able to quietly develop
      patient treatment protocols and treat patients via collaborating
      physicians and health care providers using legal patient-specific
      FDA guidelines, including studies permitted by Institutional
      Review Boards, patient-specific stem cell clinical trials, and
      direct treatments using the patients own stem cells that are
      harvested and re-injected for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      "Through Dr. Comella's leadership, she and her team have trained
      and certified more than 700 physicians worldwide in adult stem
      cell therapy."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Big Pharma is Using the FDA to Eliminate "Unregulated" Adult
        Stem Cell Competition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the late 1990s, adult stem cells used therapeutically were
      not under the control of the FDA and the adult stem cell movement
      took off.<br>
      <br>
      There were complaints from some MDs that the adult stem cell
      practice should be regulated by the FDA.<br>
      <br>
      The Panama College of Cell Science responded to those outcries
      with this statement:<br>
      <br>
      "The motive in opposing adult stem cell therapy is money.<br>
      <br>
      "The big institutions want to keep federal funding of embryonic
      stem cell research at a high level with the promise that cures are
      "just around the corner" despite the fact that embryonic stem
      cells will never be useful in any way for patient treatment
      because they immediately cause tumors when transplanted."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adult stem cell therapy is an autologous treatment method.</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      The stem cells are not lab-created. They are only isolated and
      purified after extracting them from the patient being treated.
      Injecting them back into that patient powers up the body's own
      healing mechanism to overcome chronic ailments.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA didn't and shouldn't have anything to do with regulating
      stem cells from one's own body. That situation has recently been
      arbitrarily and suddenly changed.<br>
      <br>
      Around 2014, the FDA started tweaking their guidance rules for
      stem cell therapy with the purpose of getting new rules made into
      laws through Congress that could be interpreted according to FDA
      whims and enforced arbitrarily.<br>
      <br>
      Their agenda is to consider adult stem cells as FDA-regulated
      drugs.<br>
      <br>
      During our phone conversation, Dr. Comella explained how the FDA
      ignored testimonies from adult stem cell practitioners during
      their 2015 public hearings regarding new guideline proposals.<br>
      <br>
      Then they arranged to create new rules behind closed door meetings
      that included pharmaceutical industry allies and insiders.<br>
      <br>
      The result was that by 2017, the FDA's hands-off policy with adult
      stem cell therapy came to a sudden halt after years of highly
      successful stem cell practice.<br>
      <br>
      By 2018, the FDA got nastier with "the most influential clinician
      on the subject of adult stem cell therapy" as its target.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA started doing inspections of Dr. Comella's South Florida
      clinic that are designed for labs that manufacture drugs.<br>
      <br>
      The standards for hospitals and clinics are not as strict as drug
      manufacturers. Those inspections were inappropriate for a clinic.
      But those inspections made it easier to create damaging reports.<br>
      <br>
      When the inspectors came by, they demanded to go into rooms while
      treatments were taking place with semi-nude or nude patients,
      which Dr. Comella prohibited.<br>
      <br>
      The inspectors also demanded to view patient medical records. She
      allowed that after redacting their names on the copies she gave
      them.<br>
      <br>
      For her actions to protect patients' privacy, inspectors allegedly
      cited Dr. Comella for resisting and obstructing FDA inspections.<br>
      <br>
      Soon after the inspections, the FDA served Dr. Comella with a
      lawsuit for practicing medicine with unapproved drugs. The "drugs"
      were only those stem cell solutions drawn from patients to be used
      on them.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA has allegedly offered to drop the lawsuit if Dr. Comella
      signed an agreement to stop doing adult stem cell therapy and no
      longer promote it.<br>
      <br>
      She refused. She said she has witnessed people leave their
      wheelchairs for good from this therapy. The trial is set for a
      Federal Court hearing beginning June 2019, in Miami, Florida.<br>
      <br>
      If Dr. Comella loses this court case, adult stem cell therapy in
      the USA may be forced out of the country and only be available to
      those who can afford medical tourism...<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Dr. Kristin Comella, PhD</b><b><br>
      </b>This month we are highlighting the achievements of one of our
      graduates, Kristin Comella, Ph.D.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Comella is a world-renowned expert on regenerative medicine
      with a focus on adipose (fat) derived stem cells.&nbsp; Terrapin,
      the organizer of the Annual World Stem Cells &amp; Regenerative
      Medicine Congress, commissioned a global survey of the
      international stem cell community to create a who’s-who of those
      significantly influencing the progress of the global stem cell
      industry.&nbsp; She was named number 24 on Terrapin’s list of the
      Top 50 Global Stem Cell Influencers. Dr. Comella was also voted
      number 1 on the Academy of Regenerative Practices list of Top 10
      Stem Cell Innovators. Most recently, Dr. Comella made the list of
      Top 50 Functional and Integrative Medical Doctors/Scientists in
      the country by DrAxe.com, one of the most visited natural health
      websites in the world. She has more than a dozen peer-reviewed
      publications indexed on Pubmed in the field of regenerative
      medicine.<br>
      <br>

        ]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Perhaps the most influential clinician on the subject of adult
      stem cell therapy, Dr. Comella has been able to quietly develop
      patient treatment protocols and treat patients via collaborating
      physicians and health care providers using legal patient-specific
      FDA guidelines, including studies permitted by Institutional
      Review Boards, patient-specific stem cell clinical trials, and
      direct treatments using the patients own stem cells that are
      harvested and re-injected for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Through Dr. Comella’s leadership, she and her team have trained
      and certified more than 700 physicians worldwide in adult stem
      cell therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Patient therapy using the patient’s own stem cells (adult stem
      cell therapy) is not favored in America and powerful forces in the
      US government, namely the FDA, as well as in America’s big and
      famous institutions and medical centers have opposed adult stem
      cell therapy for 20 years. This includes certain of the media, the
      scientific journals, Big Pharma, our country’s leaders (FDA
      Directors always come from Big Pharma or aligned medical
      institutions like Stanford, Harvard, UCLA, USC) and the like even
      including the National Institutes of Health. <br>
      <br>
      Which is why the US is last in the world.<br>
      <br>
      The motive in opposing adult stem cell therapy seems to be that
      the big institutions want to keep federal funding of embryonic
      stem cell research at a high level with the promise that cures are
      “just around the corner” despite the fact that embryonic stem
      cells will never be useful in any way for patient treatment
      because they immediately cause tumors when transplanted. But many
      many big buildings have been built with government money to
      research “stem cells”, yet seeming to study only their lab created
      embryonic stem cell lines in the fervent hope that someday
      Something will be patentable to the great benefit of these same
      institutions. Use the government to fund everything for free, then
      keep all the profits for themselves.&nbsp; Big Pharma, the major
      pharmaceutical houses, do not seemingly want to see advances in
      adult stem cell therapy either because that means a reduction in
      their sales as patients use their own repair stem cells to control
      many diseases rather than pills. Plus, adult stem cells in your
      own body cannot be patented like an embryonic stem cell can be.
      The idea of patient-specific adult stem cell therapy using the
      patient’s own stem cells is abhorrent to many people in power. The
      pharmaceutical houses just haven’t caught on to the fact of the
      potential of megaprofits available to them in supporting adult
      stem cell therapy- the need for sterile kits, solutions, sterile
      growth media, centrifugation equipment, counting and labelling
      kits, not to mention what they could be marketing in the way of
      stem cell activating factors, growth factors, individual expansion
      units for physicians– it is a BIG market.<br>
      <br>
      If the motive mentioned above cannot be proven in fact, it
      certainly can be demonstrated by the result. There is no stem cell
      therapy being generally used today in the United States despite
      the fact that robust stem cell therapies are being widely applied
      internationally to cure and control our most debilitating
      diseases. There are fine centers in Europe&nbsp; (Emcell,
      https://www.emcell.com/en/publications.htm), China (Beijing Puhua
      International Hospital (BPIH),
      http://puhuahospital.com/stem-cell-center/stem-cell-center ),
      Thailand&nbsp; (Regeneration Center of Thailand,
      https://stemcellthailand.org/treatments/ ), and Mexico where many
      US physicians treat their patients. The finest stem cell treatment
      center in the world is in Panama at the Stem Cell Institute-Panama
      (https://www.cellmedicine.com/ ).<br>
      <br>
      Why is the “finest center” not in the United States?<br>
      <br>
      We are not unmindful of,&nbsp; and certainly, applaud the few tiny
      steps being taken in the US by a handful of orthopedic physicians
      using stem cell fractions in conjunction with some orthopedic
      surgeries to enhance recovery and healing.<br>
      <br>
      So it is understandable that against this backdrop, America’s most
      gifted adult stem cell clinician, Kristin Comella, should be
      singled out for attack, criticism, and personal smearing in an
      effort to chill and silence her activities, if not outright ban
      them. A federal lawsuit was even filed against her to stop her
      treatment of patients and to slow the progress of adult stem cell
      therapy. This lawsuit followed closely on the heels of her
      blockbuster scientific report detailing the safety of adult stem
      cell therapy in 676 patients…the FIRST paper of its kind in the
      US. On peer review, this paper was not only passed without
      objection but was earmarked for immediate fast track publication
      in one of America’s most prestigious journals, the Journal of
      Clinical Medical Research.<br>

      Stem Cell Therapy in a Variety of Degenerative Diseases and

      The Panama College of Cell Science is a foreign institution, a
      division of Blue Marble University, registered in the Commonwealth
      of Dominica. The College continues to offer the ONLY doctoral
      program in stem cell biology in the world that can be taken
      online. The College is directed by Walter P. Drake, a published
      scientist with over 30 publications in bio-medical peer-reviewed
      journals. While not accredited in the US, where accreditation is
      not required whatsoever, the doctoral degrees issued by the Panama
      College of Cell Science are nonetheless equivalent to any doctoral
      degree issued by a regionally accredited US college or university.<br>
      <br>
      What does “equivalent” mean? It means that our program is the SAME
      as any other program in terms of credits, and educational
      requirements. This is determined not by us, but rather by various
      foreign education evaluators. Every one of our graduates who has
      sought a certificate of equivalency to use our PhD for employment
      in the US or anywhere else has obtained such upon graduation.<br>
      <br>
      Our program has even been pre-approved by the California
      University Foreign Credential Evaluation Service (CUFCE ) and the
      Certificate of Equivalency is shown below. When we sought review
      by CUFCE in 2011,&nbsp; the organization was on an approved list
      of foreign credential evaluators published by the United States
      Department of Education. The Department no longer maintains such a
      list, but now refers students to seek out a “professional foreign
      education evaluator” for such reviews. Nearly every foreign
      education credential evaluation service will find the same
      equivalency in our program.<br>

      Dr. Comella’s previous additional education includes a completed
      doctoral program in Chemical Engineering at Ohio State University
      where she passed her Comprehensive Examination for a Ph.D. degree
      but left to pursue her own research prior to completing her
      thesis. To better put her training into perspective: Her graduate
      studies and course work at Ohio State University provided her the
      opportunity to work with Dr. Jeffery Chalmers to focus on the use
      of nano-particles magnets to isolate/separate cells. She then
      delved more deeply into stem cell research at Osiris Therapeutics
      — a small start-up in Maryland — and was mentored within a company
      founded by the ‘father of Mesenchymal Stem Cells,’ Dr. Arnie
      Caplan. Following her work at Osiris, Dr. Comella was offered the
      opportunity to work with Dr. Darwin Prockop, the Grandfather of
      cellular therapy research on mesenchymal progenitors, at Tulane
      University.<br>

      We see an analogy in the similar attacks on Suzanne Somers. An
      actress with no scientific training, she exposed the criminal
      fraud perpetrated by Big Pharma and unknowing traditional doctors
      in treating women with hormone replacement therapy using synthetic
      drugs (that they called hormones) that exist nowhere in nature.
      She pioneered bio-identical hormone therapy for women. It took
      almost 15-20 years, but now, no woman will use other than cheap
      bio-identical hormones available either over the counter or
      through naturopathic physicians. She was vilified, smeared,
      laughed at, etc., but in the end, most women now recognize the
      fraud that the medical practitioners engaged in. She even changed
      the name for hormone replacement therapy, which used to be HRT,
      and now is Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy …BHRT.<br>
      <br>
      Which is to say, you don’t need any degrees to do good science.<br>
      <br>
      As summarized by Mike Tomas, President and CEO of U.S. Stem Cell
      Inc.,<br>
      <br>
      ”We are living in a historic time where we are witnessing the
      emergence of stem cell therapy as a rapidly growing modality that
      will soon become standard of care in modern medicine”.<br>
      <br>
      We hope that&nbsp; this “modern medicine” will not only be offered
      overseas!<br>
