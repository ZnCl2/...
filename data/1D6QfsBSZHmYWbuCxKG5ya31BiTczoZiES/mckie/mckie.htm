      <p><b><br>
          Scott McKie</b>, engineer, inventor, entrepreneur and would-be
        violator of physical laws, lives in Ballard, the center of
        sensible citizenship. He drives a four-year-old Ford, wears polo
        shirts and deck shoes and his coffee table is covered with
        issues of Sunset and Modern Maturity magazines. </p>
      <p>He is far from the image of the wild-haired, bug-eyed mad
        scientist but what he wants to do -- is on the very verge of
        doing, he says -- is bug-eyed science, indeed: </p>
      <p>Manufacture a power generator that will perpetually produce
        more energy than is fed into it; manufacture, in other words,
        perpetual-motion machines that will replace the world's electric
        power grid by the turn of the century and internal-combustion
        engines somewhat thereafter. </p>
      <p>This raises at least one obvious question. Is McKie nuts? </p>
      <p>Asked to evaluate someone who has spent the better part of a
        dozen years single-mindedly pursuing an idea most people find
        ludicrous, Blake Andersen, a local psychologist, said that
        generically speaking, lots of people do lots of weird things. We
        live on a continuum of odd behavior. </p>
      <p>"You can't place a value judgment on whether it's functional or
        dysfunctional. It's results-oriented," Andersen said. "The
        degree of dysfunctionality depends on the environment and the
        results." Andersen then began to explain some symptoms of
        obsessive behavior but, in midsentence, interrupted himself to
        ask: "Does it work?" </p>
      <p>Engineers by their nature are not off-the-wall people and,
        although McKie admits going through several jobs and bank
        accounts in service of his idea, he is in other ways a very
        practical man. </p>
      <p>Witness the collection of financiers, planners, engineers and
        marketing people he has collected around himself. If he is a mad
        scientist, he's one with a business plan and a $10 million line
        of credit. </p>
      <p>But he is also a devotee of Nikola Tesla, a turn-of-the-century
        Serbian-American inventor, who, by all accounts, was a mad
        scientist with countless phobias and odd personal habits. His
        psyche, wrote Margaret Cheney, a biographer, was a "festival of
        neuroses." He swore, for example, he could hear a fly land on a
        table. He threw kisses to pigeons. He held lightning in his
        hands. He had an obsessive fear of germs and required precisely
        18 linen napkins be set on his dining table so he could clean
        and polish his silverware every night before eating. </p>
      <p>He felt compelled to walk around the entire block where his
        Manhattan laboratory was located three times before entering its
        door. </p>
      <p>At the height of his celebrity, he hobnobbed with Mark Twain,
        J. Pierpont Morgan and the Vanderbilts and was regarded as one
        of the greatest and most important scientists in the world, an
        arch-rival of Thomas Edison. </p>
      <p>Edison took the competition so seriously he waged a fierce
        disinformation campaign against alternating current, which Tesla
        promoted as the best means of generating electricity in large
        amounts. Edison favored direct current, the status quo. Edison
        derided alternating current as dangerous. He hired a man to go
        around the country electrocuting small animals with alternating
        current just to prove its dangers. </p>
      <p>He also promoted the first execution of a criminal by
        electrocution for the same reason. (The pitch was
        straightforward: If alternating current can kill criminals, do
        you really want it in your kitchen?) </p>
      <p>Tesla ultimately won out and virtually all the electric power
        used in the world today is generated and transmitted via
        descendants of Tesla's systems. </p>
      <p>In addition to the alternating-current motor, Tesla also
        invented wireless communication -- that is, radio -- although
        the Italian Guglielmo Marconi was falsely credited and most
        general reference books still reflect this. </p>
      <p>Partly this was caused by Tesla's compulsive secretiveness and
        his habit of conceiving an invention in his head, then going on
        to his next project without bothering to actually build or even
        make a written record of the thing. Without such physical
        evidence or even clear explanations, it is hard to know exactly
        what Tesla was talking about much of the time. Scientists still
        puzzle over how he achieved some of the things he did. </p>
      <p>This has helped obscure Tesla's place in history. Now, although
        references to him litter diverse segments of the scientific
        literature, his accomplishments are largely forgotten except
        among a group of equally diverse adherents who have a zealous
        devotion to his ideas. </p>
      <p>Resurrecting 'resonance' theory McKie is a promoter of one
        particular idea of Tesla's, the notion that the power in an
        electric circuit can be amplified by a phenomenon known as
        resonance. Broadly stated, in a resonant circuit a small flow of
        electrons can cause a larger amount of electrons to move. This
        phenomenon was first discovered by Tesla and by now is well
        understood. </p>
      <p>"Boilerplate stuff," McKie calls it. </p>
      <p>"The knowledge is very old and had gotten lost," he said. "I've
        just gone back and brought it up to '93 specs." </p>
      <p>The "'93 specs" consist of a device designed with two resonant
        tank circuits -- so called because they are able to store an
        electrical charge -- operating alternately. The first circuit
        can be made to simultaneously charge the second and send
        electric current out for other uses. The circuits can then be
        switched so the second recharges the first while also sending
        current out for other uses. </p>
      <p>McKie thinks that if properly devised, the two circuits will
        produce more power than the total amount of power it took to set
        them in motion. Going "over unity," this is called. He thinks,
        in fact, the power can be amplified many thousands of times and
        the device can be disconnected from the power source that
        started it and continue running. McKie thinks such a system
        could operate indefinitely. </p>
      <p>"In the field of electronics that sends them ballistic," he
        said. </p>
      <p>Next step: POD Mods in Ephrata When you talk to McKie about the
        apparent impossibility of what he is trying to do, he invariably
        thinks you're talking about marketing the end products, never
        for a moment questioning whether any such products will ever
        exist. McKie has so little doubt his invention will work he is
        already making plans to manufacture boxcar-sized versions of it
        -- power on demand modules, or POD Mods, he calls them -- in
        Ephrata, Grant County. He has signed an agreement with a
        California investor for $10 million in start-up financing. </p>
      <p>He's already planning an electric hydroplane to advertise his
        company. His single-mindedness is so complete he hardly even
        notices that his house is in foreclosure. He says things like,
        "If investors don't come forward here in the Northwest, I'll be
        forced to take the project overseas and, if it's funded there,
        they'll get to use it first." </p>
      <p>McKie first achieved the over-unity effect accidentally in 1982
        when he was working on a wind-turbine design for Bonneville
        Power. Trying to figure out what happened, and why, has shaped
        most of his life since. He duplicated the effect with a
        different electrical generator in 1984 and has, in some sense,
        been trying to do it again ever since. </p>
      <p>He received a U.S. patent for the idea last year, constructed a
        working model, took that model apart and is now trying to
        convert the whole thing to solid-state electronics. The device
        he is now building, on a workbench the size of an espresso cart
        in his garage, is about as unprepossessing as you can get. It is
        a cardboard box sparely furnished with circuit boards and
        voltage meters. The whole thing is approximately a foot square,
        about the size of a bread box. </p>
      <p>It uses no fuel. There are no moving parts. </p>
      <p>Inside the box are a pair of tank circuits, electric circuits
        that include both a capacitor -- basically, an electrical
        storage unit--and am inductor -- basically, a coil. It is the
        interaction of the capacitor and the inductor that McKie
        supposes creates resonance. </p>
      <p>'He's out on the edge of science' </p>
      <p>Ira Myers, a physicist at the National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration's Lewis Research Center inOhio, has worked with
        McKie on the design of the individual components of his
        apparatus. He is cheering for McKie. </p>
      <p>"It's possible but it hasn't worked yet," Myers said. "He's out
        on the edge of science rather than on the center line. But it's
        important to have people out on the edge. "I personally like a
        good fanatic every now and then." </p>
      <p>Nick Butler, an electrical engineer at BPA in Portland, has
        supported McKie's work; his employer has not. "Whenever
        something new appears, it is often ignored," Butler said, citing
        a conventional analysis of change. </p>
      <p>"Once it can't be ignored any longer, people attempt to
        suppress it. When they can't suppress it, they rush to embrace
        it." </p>
      <p>Butler said he remains skeptical but thinks McKie might have as
        much as a 50-50 chance of being right. Others reject the notion
        that there actually is some sort of "extra" energy almost as a
        matter of faith. </p>
      <p>"Theoretically it might be possible. Practically it can't be,"
        said one electrical engineer who has reviewed McKie's data and
        asked that his name not be used. "You can't get energy from
        nothing. The thing as I saw it was nothing but measurement error
        that gave the impression of more output than input." </p>
      <p>Even supporters like Butler do not necessarily buy McKie's
        explanation that the power comes from resonance. Where else
        might it come from? "I haven't the faintest idea," Butler said.
        . </p>
      <p>What happens if he's right? </p>
      <p>Gravity Bar, the local juice emporium, has a
        pineapple-lemon-ginger drink named for Nikola Tesla. There is
        also a Christian heavy metal band from Guam ("Rock for God")
        named Tesla, as is an alien character in a recent science
        fiction novella who comes to Earth and bedevils patrons at an
        S&amp;M bar. </p>
      <p>The idiosyncratic David Lynch has expressed interest in doing a
        movie of Tesla's life. A local painter was inspired by Tesla to
        do a series of paintings of lightning in an airplane hangar, and
        Seattle City Light once commissioned a ceramic sculpture of
        Tesla's head that doubled as a planter. </p>
      <p>This is pretty strange company to be kept in memory of the man
        who invented something as fundamentally practical as an electric
        motor, but a kind of shroud of the bizarre has settled around
        the traces of Tesla's genius. </p>
      <p>Among some people that casts doubts on McKies efforts. Among
        others it lends credence. The debate about McKie's proposal is
        not irresolveable. At heart he is not a theorist but an
        engineer. He intends to begin selling his machines next year.
        What if he does? What if McKie's right? </p>
      <p>Each production unit, McKie says, will be completely portable,
        will run off a 12-volt battery and will produce 10 megawatts of
        power a year (100 such units would power Seattle). In one
        brochure, McKie matter-of-factly ticks off some of the
        advantages. For starters, use of the devices would eliminate
        high-voltage transmission lines, eliminate conventional power
        plants and, oh, by the way, replace all other sources of power
        generation. </p>
      <p>Then the environmental crisis will recede. Growth and
        prosperity will blanket the globe. An age of plenty will wrap
        humankind in its embrace and McKie and everybody who was ever
        nice to him will become rich beyond belief. </p>
      <p>Somewhere along the line, McKie might even get his house out of
        hock. <br>

      <p>Richard (<b>Scott) McKie</b> (1991) has designed and tested a
        small model of a PODMOD device: a Power On Demand MODule. </p>
      <p>The circuitry invokes Tesla's theories of electron flow,
        resonance, and magnetism, combined with modern theories on high
        frequency electronics and radio antennas to generate power
        directly, without the inefficient conversion of energy from
        other sources. A US patent has been filed and granted. </p>
      <p>Scott claimes to be able to generate output power as much as
        4,000 times the input power. Prototypes have been built and
        tested, including independent tests by accredited specialists. </p>
      <p>Plans are currently underway to build full-scale commercial
        PODMOD units, to be housed in standard 40 foot shipping
        containers, each having a continuous base-load generating

      <p><b><u>From Energy Reverberation to Big Bang</u></b> </p>
      <p>This iterative additional energy interception and collection
        (divergence) from the huge, usually nondivergent Poynting energy
        flow that Lorentz mistakenly had everyone discard, is a very
        important <i>re</i>discovery -- certainly Heaviside knew it. We
        are just now beginning to see the full ramifications. </p>
      <p>I have constructed a chart of some anomalous and powerful
        energies (such as from overunity EM systems to anomalous gamma
        ray bursters) and am awed that the new work-energy theorem (for
        multipass, multicollection) seems to be the missing principle
        that is involved in all of them. At the top of the chart (a
        series of curves), there stands a new kind of Big Bang. </p>
      <p>In other words, for extremely rapid initiation, the energy
        density (asymmetrical self-regauging) of the system can rise so
        rapidly that it is sufficient to rupture 4-space at that region.
        So the rapidly increasing energy density just "blows out a hole"
        from 4-space into n-space, where n&gt; 4. </p>
      <p>Beyond the 4-space hole, in n-space there thus is formed (by
        the blowout) a new 4-space universe. So it seems that this is
        indeed a new kind of Big Bang, and a fundamental new change,
        striking at the very heart of astrophysics. </p>
      <p>With the new theorem and the multipass, multicollection
        explanation, I was able then to propose an alternative
        explanation of how the Lawandy lasing without population
        inversion works (how the excess energy is extracted from the
        vacuum) and also the Patterson power unit, which has been
        replicated and independently tested (one version produced COP =
        1200). </p>
      <p>It is possible, in fact, to utilize energy flow reverberation,
        multi-pass collection, and asymmetrical self-regauging in a
        device which surges the energy to and fro along a "single wire
        circuit" between two collectors, with a load in the middle. Such
        a device can be permissibly achieve COP&gt;1.0 without violating
        the laws of nature, physics, or thermodynamics. </p>
      <p><b><u>Scott McKie's New Energy Device</u></b> </p>
      <p>Inventor and researcher <b>Scott McKie</b> has filed a patent
        application on an energy system using just such an energy
        reverberation and iterative energy interception and collection.
        In addition, it uses the novel fact that<i> by potential alone
          one can alter (rotate) the inertial frame of a component</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Before the reader pops his eyeglasses, he should read "Quantum
        Aspects of the Equivalence Principle" by Aharonov and Carmi. We
        quote from p. 494: </p>
      <dir>
        <dir><i>"Not only can 'inertial forces' arising upon transition
            to a noninertial system of reference be cancelled by the
            introduction of 'real forces' (and vice versa), but the
            'inertial potentials' belonging to such forces (even in
            'force-free' regions) can similarly be cancelled. Both facts
            together afford a 'geometric interpretation' (i.e., as
            inertial effects produced by a change of reference frames)
            to <u>both</u> fields of forces <u>and</u> their
            potentials."</i></dir>
      </dir>
      In short, force fields and potentials can be interpreted as a
      change of reference frames, hence inducing rotation of the frame
      without concomitant propagation velocity of the object in
      question. This can in fact be accomplished in a capacitor, as
      McKie apparently has succeeded in doing.
      <p>So Scott apparently charges a capacitor in a rotated frame
        (without having to move the capacitor), where its capacitance
        appears much less in the lab frame (only the <i>projection</i>
        of the rotated capacitance into the lab frame). Then he sharply
        snatches the charged capacitor out of its rotated frame back
        into the lab frame, again without using capacitor motion. In so
        doing, its apparent capacitance as seen by the lab observer
        increases and so does its charge and energy (it is regauged from
        the vacuum itself). The interesting thing is that this seems
        also to be a process for impressing extra energy onto the Dirac
        Sea electrons, and lifting excess electrons out of the Dirac
        Sea, because the charge in the capacitor (as seen by the lab
        observer) seems to increase simply due to the charged
        capacitor's rotation back into the lab frame. </p>
      <p>So Scott can apparently discharge more energy from the
        capacitor in the lab frame, than he was required to furnish to
        charge it in its rotated frame state. He has in fact utilized a
        very novel new way of extracting energy from the vacuum. Here
        again we caution that, due to its frame rotation, the capacitor
        actually receives excess energy (and charge) from a special kind
        of "external environment" other than the lab inertial frame. So
        again it is an open system, not in local equilibrium but
        switched in and out of equilibrium. Hence in theory it is
        permitted to produce COP1.0, if other things are sufficient. </p>
      <p>Here we inject some additional information. It is not commonly
        known that, in general relativity, the energy is up for grabs
        anyway, and in fact it can be shown that there really are no
        ordinary energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation
        laws in the accepted sense. In other words, the "normal"
        conservation of energy we are so used to, can be violated
        anyway. Even the great Hilbert knew this in 1917. Quoting: </p>
      <dir>
        <dir><i>"I assert... that for the general theory of relativity,
            i.e., in the case of general invariance of the Hamiltonian
            function, energy equations... corresponding to the energy
            equations in orthogonally invariant theories do not exist at
            all. I could even take this circumstance as the
            characteristic feature of the general theory of relativity."</i></dir>
      </dir>
      Russian physicists have long known this most interesting fact.
      E.g., quoting Logunov and Loskutov, writing about Hilbert's
      assessment:
      <dir>
        <dir><i>Unfortunately, this remark of Hilbert was evidently not
            understood by his contemporaries, since neither Einstein
            himself nor other physicists recognized the fact that in
            general relativity conservation laws for energy, momentum,
            and angular momentum are in principle impossible.</i></dir>
      </dir>
      So while startling, McKie's use of frame rotation as a means of
      apparently violating the "normal" energy and charge law actually
      has a solid basis in general relativity, but one that is still
      unknown (or fiercely resisted) by most Western relativists. In our
      own view, again we prefer to think of this rotation and violation
      of charge and energy conservation in the local lab frame system as
      simply opening the system to an energy exchange with a different
      kind of external active environment (the change of energy and
      charge occurring when the frame is rotated.) We note that the
      capacitance decreases with the capacitor in the rotated frame, as
      seen by the lab observer, then increases when the capacitor is
      snapped back into the lab frame again. Also, although we normally
      do not consider it, a capacitor (or any other component) actually
      must "exist" in all possible frames at once, since all those
      frames are real. Observation is in one sense a means of "selecting
      the frame from which the observation is made". Once we understand
      that the frame can be rotated without spatial propagation of the
      capacitor itself, then the notion of it "sitting there still, but
      being in a rotated frame" does not appear quite so bizarre after
      all.
      <p>The novel part of this "frame rotation as a means of
        asymmetrical regauging" effect is that, without violating the
        laws of physics, Scott produces asymmetry both of the charge in
        the charged capacitor and stored energy in the charged
        capacitor. If we assume that the charge he inputs to the
        capacitor "exists" as a different amount of charge in the
        rotated frame, then to an observer in the capacitor's rotated
        frame he is charging the capacitor with the normal amount of
        charge and the capacitor has the normal amount of capacitance.
        To the lab observer, of course, he is using less charge (in the
        lab frame) to fill the capacitor in the rotated frame, and the
        capacitor thus has "less capacitance". The asymmetry of yanking
        the capacitor back into the lab frame then produces observable
        effects (extra charge and extra energy available for dissipation
        as work in the load), as is to be expected, given the asymmetry
        occurs. </p>
      <p>However, Scott has reported great difficulty with switching,
        capacitors, etc. but in theory the design should be able to
        work, at least from the standpoint of relativity, if he can
        overcome these problems. </p>
      <p><b><u>When an Overunity Device is Considered <i>Achieved</i></u></b>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, scientifically one is confirmed as actually
        achieving an overunity device only after it has been tested and
        certified overunity by an <i>independent</i> and well-qualified
        test group or agency. That is the normal requirement upon
        scientific researchers in any field; their results must be <i>independently</i>
        tested and certified. Scott intends to have precisely such
        independent certification testing accomplished when he can fully
        overcome his present component problems. We are certainly
        encouraging him and rooting for him on this project. </p>
      <p>Our little group (CTEC, Inc.) does not qualify as a proper
        independent testing group for the McKie device, since I have
        been and am involved in the project, having come up with the
        reverberation and frame rotation explanation of the technical
        mechanism by which it theoretically works. In fact, I wrote the
        draft of the Provisional Patent Application which was filed
        about a year before the formal Patent Application. Scott's
        invention also uses techniques from both his own former patent
        and from CTEC's patent pending approaches. So (quite properly) I
        disqualify myself (and in fact all my CTEC colleagues as well)
        from being any proper <i>independent</i> test group for the
        device, because we are <i>not</i> independent. </p>
      <p>In the future, perhaps we will (1) have additional information
        as to certified test results of the McKie device when the
        component difficulties are overcome and such tests are
        accomplished, and (2) be able to post them on the net. </p>
      <p>Again we caution the reader that all this is theory until
        independent certified tests verify it. </p>
      <p><b><u>Collected Energy Is Recyclable To and From Multiple
            Collectors</u></b> </p>
      <p>We have all been misled by our professors in the area of
        "energy conservation." There is only a single master law of
        energy conservation, and it is this: <i>Energy can neither be
          created nor destroyed</i>. However, <i>Energy <u>collection</u>
          upon a collector can be created and destroyed.</i> Further, I
        personally add the following corollary: <i>Energy always exists
          in dynamic flowing form. Collection of energy upon an
          interceptor/collector can be in an equilibrium condition and
          appear static, just as does a fixed whirlpool in a river. But
          the "water" -- the energy itself -- is always flowing in and
          out of that collected divergence volume of the whirlpool. And
          the energy is always flowing in and out of that collection of
          energy upon any collector, be it static or dynamic.</i>
        Actually the notion that a "static" field or potential contains
        dynamic energy should not be too surprising. In 1903, Whittaker
        showed that any scalar potential is not a scalar entity at all,
        but instead is a harmonic bundle of longitudinal EM phase
        conjugate wavepairs. (Unknown to Whittaker, each such
        longitudinal EM phase conjugate wavepair comprises a new <i>net</i>
        wave that is a time-polarized EM wave.). At any rate, the
        "static" potential is a whole set of bidirectional longitudinal
        EM energy flows. </p>
      <p>Then in 1904, Whittaker showed that any EM field pattern (or
        wave, e.g.) can be decomposed into two scalar potential
        functions. Since these two scalar potential functions are based
        on two scalar potentials, then the "static" EM field decomposes
        into two sets of functions of harmonic sets of bidirectional EM
        longitudinal EM wavepairs. </p>
      <p>So a static EM field or potential is actually a <i>multivectorial







          entity</i>, filled with energy flows in both directions. It
        therefore should not be surprising that any static potential or
        field thus contains angular momentum, and indeed that is
        well-known in more advanced electrodynamics. For example, in
        1980 Graham and Lahoz reported measuring the free
        electromagnetic angular momentum created by quasistatic and
        independent fields E and B in the vacuum gap of a cylindrical
        capacitor. Others have done so since then. </p>
      <p>Much of the confusion in the energy dynamics field is due to
        the confusion and failure to differentiate between energy flow,
        energy transport flow, divergent energy flow component,
        nondivergent energy flow component, energy collection, energy
        form, energy collection form, change of energy form, change of
        energy collection form, etc. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a power supply for supplying
        electrical power to a load. The power supply includes first and
        second tank circuits having a common resonant frequency, and
        functions repetitively in two "major periods." In the first
        major period, the first tank is disconnected from powering the
        load and the second tank supplies power to the load while
        charging the first tank. In the second major period, the second
        tank is disconnected from powering the load, and the first tank
        supplies power to the load while charging the second tank. The
        tank circuits are arranged with constant current controllers and
        switches to function so that the major periods each include
        first and second minor "intervals." The first minor interval of
        the first major period defines a time during which the second
        tank's capacitor is providing power to the load and is charging
        the first tank circuit; the second minor interval of the first
        major period defines a time during which the second tank's
        inductor is charging the first tank circuit and providing power
        to the load. During the second major period's two minor
        intervals, the tank circuits perform functions identical to
        those performed in the first two minor intervals. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to power supplies for supplying
        electrical power to a load. More specifically, the invention
        relates to a high-efficiency power supply including plural tank
        circuits whose function and interaction are controlled by a set
        of specially controlled switches and constant current
        controllers. </p>
      <p>2. Related Art </p>
      <p>Power supplies including charge storage eIements (or, more
        broadly, energy storage elements), are known in the art. </p>
      <p>For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,628,284 (Bruning) discloses a
        high-frequency, high-voltage supply involving switching of
        transistors for, for example, magnetrons of microwave ovens. A
        "dead time" is provided between the intervals when one or the
        other of the transistors is off. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,319,315 (Keeney, Jr. et al) discloses a
        DC-to-DC convertor with oppositely conducting transistor pairs.
      </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,886,429 (Maillard et al) discloses a
        symmetrical power pack for adapting to different sources. The
        power pack provides for alternate blocking and saturation of
        pairs of switching transistors. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,748,311 (Thomas et al) discloses a chopper
        circuit having a push-pull frequency f.sub.O and parallel tuned
        circuit at 2xf.sub.O. A goal of the Thomas et al circuit is to
        reduce power loss in their switching means. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,542,440 (Chetty et al) discloses a current
        sensor involving two power switches and two associated snubber
        circuits which operate 180.degree. with respect to each other. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,226 (Josephson) discloses a ballast
        inverter circuit which comprises two tank circuits. The two tank
        circuits operate at a common resonant frequency. A pair of
        transistors are switched in opposition so as to operate in a
        push-pull manner. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,709,323 (Lien) discloses a parallel resonant
        converter in which resonant circuitry recovers energy which
        would otherwise be lost in the circuit's switching operation. </p>
      <p>Efficiency of power supplies has been measured in terms of the
        amount of energy which is consumed internally, within the power
        supply itself. Of course, it is desirable to minimize the amount
        of energy which is consumed internally, as energy which is
        consumed internally cannot be delivered to the load. </p>
      <p>There is always a need to provide power supplies having greater
        efficiency. The present invention fulfills this need. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention is a power supply for supplying
        electrical power to a load. The power supply includes first and
        second tank circuits having a common resonant frequency, and
        functioning repetitively in two "major periods". In the first
        major period, the first tank is disconnected from powering the
        load and the second tank supplies power to the load while
        charging the first tank. In the second major period, the second
        tank is disconnected from powering the load, and the first tank
        supplies power to the load while charging the second tank. </p>
      <p>In a particular embodiment, the inventive power supply may
        include a plurality of constant current controllers, which may
        be metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs),
        for connecting the tank circuits to the load. The inventive
        power supply may also include a set of switches for selectively
        interconnecting the tank circuits, constant current controllers
        and load. </p>
      <p>The tank circuits, constant current controllers and switches
        are arranged to function in the first and second "major
        periods", each of which includes first and second "minor
        intervals". The first tank circuit comprises a first capacitor
        and inductor, whereas the second tank circuit comprises a second
        capacitor and inductor. The first minor interval of the first
        major period defines a time during which the second capacitor is
        simultaneously providing current flow through the second
        inductor, providing power to the load, and charging the first
        tank circuit; the second minor interval of the first major
        period defines a time during which the second inductor is
        simultaneously charging the first tank circuit and providing
        power to the load. The first minor interval of the second major
        period defines a time during which the first capacitor
        simultaneously provides current flow through the first inductor,
        charges the second tank, and provides power to the load; and the
        second minor interval of the second major period defines a time
        during which the first inductor charges the second tank and
        provides power to the load. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>In describing preferred embodiments of the present invention
        illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed to
        describe preferred elements and circuits for the sake of
        clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to
        the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood
        that each specific element and circuit includes all technical
        equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a
        similar purpose. It is further understood that "gate signal
        generator and tank charger," "gate signal amplifier," "feedback
        controller," and "constant current controller," are used in the
        Detailed Description to include all associated circuitry, but
        that the scope of the invention and the interpretation of claims
        elements should not be so limited. Also, "node", "path",
        "pathway" are understood to be any suitable means to conduct
        electrical current from one circuit element or circuit to
        another and/or serve as a point where two or more such
        conductors are connected together. The terms "path" and
        "pathway" to be broadly interpreted, and may include circuit
        elements other than conductive nodes. According to convention,
        positive current flow is described; however, it is understood by
        those skilled in the art that positive current flow, involving
        flow of negatively charged electrons in the opposite direction,
        is but a convention to which operation of the invention is not
        limited. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of a preferred embodiment
        of the power supply according to the present invention. The
        power supply is designed to provide power to a load 100. FIG. 2
        illustrates the power supply embodiment in more detail. </p>
      <p>The power supply itself includes first and second tank circuits
        101, 102, respectively. The tank circuits 101, 102 are connected
        to a negative terminal of the load 100 via respective constant
        current controller circuits 103, 104 and isolating switch 13
        (FIG. 2). </p>
      <p>A common node 105 connects, via isolating switch 14 (FIG. 2),
        the positive terminal of the load to both tank circuits 101,
        102. Tank circuits 101, 102 are connected via a common node 106
        and dedicated paths 107, 108, respectively, to gate signal
        generator &amp; tank charger 114. The two terminals of the load
        are connected via respective pathways 220 and 222 to a feedback
        controller 110 Feedback controller 110 is connected via
        respective pathways 226, 224 to gate signal generator &amp; tank
        charger 114. Power is provided to the gate signal generator and
        tank charger 114 by either a feedback controller 110 (which may
        be a MOSFET gate drive circuit) or a battery 118. Gate signal
        generator and tank charger 114 oversees, via gate signal
        amplifier 116, the functioning of the constant current
        controller circuits 103, 104, as well as various switches which
        are not specifically illustrated in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>Various switches and constant current controller elements
        (which may be MOSFETs), as well as current direction controllers
        (preferably Schottky diodes), have been purposely omitted from
        FIG. 1 for the sake of clarity. Referring now to FIG. 2, the
        power supply of FIG. 1 is illustrated in greater detail. </p>
      <p>First tank circuit 101 is shown to comprise a variety of
        elements extending between two nodes 202, 204. An inductor L1 is
        connected in series with a node 424, a switch 1 and a diode 38
        between nodes 202, 204. Similarly, a diode 206 is connected in
        series with a node 428, capacitor Cl and node 426 between nodes
        202, 204. A diode 37 and a switch 2 are connected in series
        between node 424 (between inductor L1 and switch 1) and node 426
        (between capacitor Cl and node 204). </p>
      <p>Second tank circuit 102 is structured in a manner similar to
        tank circuit 101. Specifically, nodes 212, 214 correspond to
        nodes 202, 204. Similarly, second inductor L2 and second
        capacitor C2 respectively correspond to first inductor L1 and
        first capacitor Cl. Finally, switches 7 and 8, and diodes 42,
        41, and 216 respectively correspond to switches 1 and 2, and
        diodes 38, 37, and 206. </p>
      <p>Diodes 206, 216 are oriented so as to allow current to flow
        from node 202, through respective nodes 428, 414, to respective
        capacitors Cl, C2. The positive terminals of capacitors Cl and
        C2 are connected, respectively, through nodes 428, 414, to
        diodes 206 and 216; the capacitors' negative terminals are
        connected, respectively, through nodes 426, 418 to nodes 204,
        214. </p>
      <p>The polarity of inductors L1 and L2 varies with the interval of
        operation of the circuit. During the first and third minor
        intervals (described in greater detail below), associated,
        respectively, with the discharging of tanks 102, 101 through
        their capacitors and inductors to load 100, the terminal of the
        inductor which is connected to node 212 (first minor interval
        301) or 202 (third minor interval 303) is the positive terminal;
        during the second and fourth minor intervals (described in
        greater detail below), this polarity is reversed. </p>
      <p>As briefly introduced in the discussion related to FIG. 1, the
        negative terminal of load 100 is connected through isolating
        switch 13 to respective tank circuits 101, 102 via respective
        constant current controller circuits 103, 104. FIG. 2
        illustrates the connection in more detail than FIG. 1.
        Specifically, the negative terminal of load 100 is connected via
        node 402 to a diode 33 which in turn is connected to the input
        node 404 of constant current controller circuit 103. An output
        node 406 of constant current controller circuit 103 is connected
        to node 202 (within tank circuit 101). Diode 33 is oriented to
        allow current to flow from the negative terminal of load 100
        through isolation switch 13 and node 402 to the constant current
        controller circuit 103. Constant current controller circuit 103
        includes two parallel-connected constant current controller
        elements 5 and 6 which may be MOSFETs. Regulation of the current
        passing through constant current controller elements 5 and 6 is
        separately controlled by the gate signal generator in 114,
        described below. </p>
      <p>In a manner similar to the connection of isolation switch 13,
        node 402, diode 33, node 404, constant current controller
        elements 5 and 6, node 406, and node 202, the negative terminal
        of load 100 is connected to the second tank circuit 102 via
        isolation switch 13, node 402, a diode 34, node 410, two
        parallel-connected constant current controller elements 11, 12
        which may be MOSFETs, node 412, and node 212. </p>
      <p>The positive terminal of load 100 is connected to two points
        within each of tank circuits 101, 102. Specifically, the
        positive terminal of load 100 is connected via isolation switch
        14, nodes 105, a switch 3, and a diode 35 to node 428 between
        diode 206 and capacitor Cl. Also, the positive terminal of load
        100 is connected via a switch 14, node 105, a switch 4, and a
        diode 36 to node 424 between first inductor L1 and switch 1. </p>
      <p>In an analogous manner, the positive terminal of load -00 is
        connected via isolating switch 14, node 105, a switch 9, and a
        diode 39 to node 414 between diode 216 and capacitor C2.
        Finally, the positive terminal of load 100 is connected via
        isolating switch 14, node 105, a switch 10, and a diode 40 to
        node 416 between second inductor L2 and switch 7. </p>
      <p>Node 106, which was shown schematically in FIG. 1 as commonly
        connected to tank circuits 101, 102, is more specifically
        illustrated in FIG. 2 to be connected to diodes 31 and 32.
        Diodes 31, 32 are connected through respective switches 15, 16
        to allow current to flow from node 106 to respective nodes 202,
        212 within respective tank circuits 101, 102 only when those
        tanks are being charged. Node 204 (within tank circuit 101) and
        node 214 (within tank circuit 102) are connected to respective
        switches 21, 22 on respective pathways 107, 108. The opposite
        terminals of switches 21, 22 and node 106 are presented to gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114. Switches 21 and 22
        operate in conjunction such that they are not both
        simultaneously connected to their respective tank circuits 101,
        102. </p>
      <p>The negative and positive terminals of load 100 are connected
        via respective paths 220, 222 and switch 242, to feedback
        controller 110. Feedback controller 110 is connected via paths
        224, 226 to the gate signal generator and tank charger 114. Path
        224 is considered ground whereas path 226 is a DC voltage,
        typically +18 volts. </p>
      <p>Gate signal generator and tank charger 114 receives its power
        from either feedback controller 110 or a battery 118 (or other
        equivalent power source). Typically, the positive DC voltage
        input 232 of the gate signal generator and tank charger 114 is
        connected to the positive terminal 240 of battery 118.
        Similarly, ground input 230 of gate signal generator and tank
        charger 114 is typically connected to the negative terminal 238
        of battery 118. Switch 244 connects respective battery terminal
        238, 240 to gate signal generator and tank charger 114 inputs
        230, 232. </p>
      <p>In operation, gate signal amplifier 116 performs the function
        of amplifying the gate signals generated by gate signal
        generator in 114 and passed to it on paths indicated as 246.
        Gate signal amplifier 116 distributes the amplified signals to
        the gates of respective switches and constant current
        controllers which control the function of the inventive power
        supply. </p>
      <p>Switches 1-4, 7-10 and 21-22 may advantageously be implemented
        using metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
        (MOSFETs). As illustrated in FIG. 2, switches 3, 4, 9, 10, 21,
        and 22, may be implemented so that the source of the MOSFET is
        oriented toward the bottom of FIG. 2, and the drain of the
        MOSFET oriented toward the top of FIG. 2. For switches 1, 2, 7,
        and 8, the source of the MOSFET is oriented toward the top o
        right of FIG. 2 and the drain of the MOSFET is oriented toward
        the bottom or left. For MOSFET switches 5, 6, 11, and 12, the
        source is oriented toward the left and the drain is oriented
        toward the right of FIG. 2. The source of MOSFET 16 is oriented
        to the left, and the source of MOSFET 15 is oriented to the
        right. </p>
      <p>The gates of the MOSFETs are the controlling elements of the
        switches, and are provided, via the gate signal amplifier 116,
        with appropriate voltage signals from gate signal generator in
        114. Isolation switches 13, 14 may be advantageously implemented
        using mechanical, vacuum, or solid state devices suitable for
        connecting load 100 to, and disconnecting it from, the power
        supply. </p>
      <p>Constant current controller circuits 5, 6, 11, and 12 may also
        be implemented as MOSFETs. However, these MOSFETs are not
        operated as binary switches. Rather, as indicated by the generic
        term "constant current controller," these MOSFETs may
        advantageously be operated in their linear regions, serving as
        current controllers. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the source of
        each constant current controller MOSFET may be connected, via
        respective nodes 406, 412, to the top node 202, 212 of the tank
        circuits 101, -02. The drain of each MOSFET may be connected,
        via respective nodes 404, 410 to the diodes 33, 34. The gate of
        each MOSFET is connected to the gate signal generator &amp; tank
        charger 114 via gate signal amplifier 116. </p>
      <p>Regenerative feedback controller 110 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is
        preferably implemented as a Vicor VI L53 Cy DC-to-DC converter,
        having 120 volts DC on the tank output (load) side, and a +18
        volt DC output between paths 226 and 224. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 is a waveshape and timing diagram illustrating signals
        produced by gate signal generator and tank charger 114 which
        controls the switches and constant current controller elements
        1-12 and 21-22. </p>
      <p>As described above, the power supply includes first and second
        tank circuits. The tank circuits having a common resonant
        frequency, and function repetitively in two "major periods" 312
        and 334 (FIG. 3). In the first major period 312, the first tank
        101 is disconnected from powering load 100 and the second tank
        102 supplies power to load 100 while charging first tank 101. In
        the second major period 334, second tank 102 is disconnected
        from powering load 100, and first tank 101 supplies power to
        load 100 while charging second tank 102. </p>
      <p>The major periods each include first and second "minor
        intervals." The first minor interval 301 of first major period
        312 defines a time during which the second capacitor C2 is
        simultaneously providing power to load 100, is maintaining
        current flow through inductor L2, and is charging first tank
        circuit 101; the second minor interval 302 of the first major
        period 312 defines a time during which the second inductor L2 is
        charging first tank circuit 101 and providing power to load 100.
        The first minor interval 303 of the second major period 334
        defines a time during which the first capacitor Cl
        simultaneously charges second tank 102, maintains current flow
        through inductor L1, and provides power to load 100; and the
        second minor interval 304 of the second major period 334 defines
        a time during which the first inductor L1 charges second tank
        102 and provides power to load 100. The timing of the minor
        intervals and major periods is controlled by the switches in the
        following manner. </p>
      <p>The first and second minor intervals of the first major period
        are followed immediately by the first and second minor intervals
        of the second major period. Consequently, they may be referred
        to as first, second, third, and fourth consecutive minor
        intervals. The first through fourth minor intervals are
        illustrated in FIG. 3 as elements 301, 302, 303, and 304,
        respectively. It is understood that the waveforms shown in FIG.
        3 are repetitive, extending before and after the illustrated
        time segments. By convention, a high-level signal indicates that
        a binary switch is "on" (conducting), with a "low" level
        indicating the binary switch is "off" (non-conducting). The gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114 generates these waveforms
        in the illustrated synchrony. </p>
      <p>For tank 101, waveform A is input to switches 1, 15, and 21
        (FIG. 2) and 17 (FIG. 5C). Waveform B is input to switches 2 and
        3. Waveform C is input to switch 4. Waveform D is input to
        constant current controller element 5. Waveform E is input to
        constant current controller element 6. </p>
      <p>Similarly, for tank 102, waveform F is input to switches 7, 16,
        22 (FIG. 2) and 18 (FIG. 5C). Waveform G is input to switches 8
        and 9. Waveform H is input to switch 10. Waveform I is input to
        constant current controller element 11. Finally, waveform J is
        input to constant current controller element 12. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, waveforms A and F are
        consecutively timed, positive-going square waves having a 50/50
        duty cycle and a nominal frequency of 20 kHz. Waveforms B, C, G,
        and H are positive-going square waves having a 25/75 (25%) duty
        cycle at 20 kHz. Waveforms D, E, I, and J, are positive-going
        exponential waves having a 25/75 (25%) duty cycle at 20 kHz. The
        illustrated waveshapes are used with a positive voltage power
        supply. Not shown are the complementary negative waveshapes
        which could be used with a complementary negative power supply
        applying the same principles as the illustrated power supply. </p>
      <p>Only one of waveforms B, C, G, and H are active in a minor
        interval. Waveform G is active during the first minor interval;
        waveform H, during the second minor interval; waveform B, during
        the third minor interval; and finally, waveform c is active
        during the fourth minor interval. Waveforms I, J, D, and E are
        activated during the first, second, third, and fourth minor
        intervals, respectively. These waveforms are
        carefully-controlled analog waveforms, preferably exponential in
        shape, which regulate the amount of current supplied by
        respective constant current controller elements 11, 12, 5, and
        6, so as to control the current ultimately fed to the load 100
        by respective tank circuits -02 and 101. The exponential
        waveforms may be generated in any suitable fashion, such as
        using analog networks or digitally implemented waveform
        generators in a manner known to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>The flow of current in the circuit of FIG. 2 for start-up
        operation during the first through fourth minor intervals is now
        described. The function of the various circuit components is the
        same as during steady-state operation, described more fully
        below. </p>
      <p>During start-up, switches 13 and 14 are opened, isolating load
        100 from the power supply. Switch 244 is closed, providing power
        from battery 118 (or an equivalent power supply) to the gate
        signal generator and tank charger -14. Switch 242 is also
        closed, thus connecting feedback controller 110 to the output of
        the tanks, which, under steady-state operation, serves load 100
        as well as feedback controller 110. The gate signal generator
        and tank charger 114 is turned on and, simultaneously, switches
        1, 8, 9, 11, 15, and 21 are turned on and switches 4, 6, 7, 16,
        and 22 are turned off. Thus begins the charging of tank 101
        during major period 312, minor interval 301 (FIG. 3). </p>
      <p>Tank 102 has no charge at this time, consequently, it cannot
        perform its steady state operation which is to provide power to
        load 100 and charge tank 101. The switches of tank 102 are,
        however, connected during startup in the same sequence as they
        would be during steady-state operation. </p>
      <p>Since only tank 101 needs to be charged initially during
        startup, power only needs to be routed from battery 118 (or
        equivalent power supply) through gate signal generator and tank
        charger 114, tank 101, and feedback controller 110, finally
        returning to the gate signal generator and tank charger 114. </p>
      <p>At the end of minor interval 301/beginning of minor interval
        302, switches 8, 9, and 11 are turned off and, simultaneously,
        switches 10 and 12 are turned on. At the end of minor interval
        302, major period 312/beginning of minor interval 303, major
        period 334, switches 1, 10, 12, 15, and 21 are turned off, and,
        simultaneously, switches 2, 3, 5, 7, 16, and 22 are turned on,
        during which tank 101 discharges through feedback controller 110
        and gate signal generator &amp; tank charger 114 to begin
        charging tank 102. Finally, at the end of minor interval
        303/beginning of minor interval 304, switches 2, 3, and 5 are
        turned off and, simultaneously, switches 4 and 6 are turned on.
        At the end of major period 334, both tanks continue in their
        respective charge/discharge sequence, as indicated in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>During both major periods and all four minor intervals, gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114, through gate signal
        amplifier 116, provides the necessary voltage signals to the
        switches in order to allow them to control the charging and
        discharging of tanks 101, 102 according to the timing sequence
        presented in FIG. 3. At the end of major period 312, isolation
        switches 13 and 14 can be closed, providing power to load 100. </p>
      <p>Operation during steady-state conditions will now be described.
        Special reference is made to FIGS. 2A-2D which respectively
        illustrate current flow during the four consecutive minor
        intervals. </p>
      <p>During the first minor interval 301, capacitor C2
        simultaneously maintains current flow through inductor L2,
        charges tank circuit 101, and provides power to the load 100.
        Current passes from the positive terminal of C2 through node
        414, diode 39, switch 9, node 105 and switch 14 to the positive
        terminal of load 100. From the negative terminal of load 100,
        current passes through node 402, diode 34, node 410, MOSFET 11,
        and node 412 to re-enter tank circuit 102. Current then passes
        through inductor L2, node 416, diode 41, MOSFET 8, and node 418
        to return to the negative terminal of capacitor C2. </p>
      <p>It is understood that, within tank circuit 101, an internal
        tank current is flowing in a clockwise direction (as viewed in
        FIG. 2A). </p>
      <p>At the same time, tank circuit 101 is being charged. Current
        flows from gate signal generator and tank charger 114 through
        node 106, diode 31, switch 15, node 202, diode 206, and node 428
        to capacitor Cl. Current continues to flow from the opposite
        (negative) terminal of C- through node 426, switch 21, along
        path 107 before returning to the gate signal generator &amp;
        tank charger 114. </p>
      <p>Feedback controller 110 receives some of the current from node
        432 through switch 242, along path 222, with current passing
        along path 226 to gate signal generator &amp; tank charger 114.
        Current also passes from gate signal generator &amp; tank
        charger 114 along path 224, through feedback controller 110,
        along path 220, through switch 242, node 402 and switch 13 to
        the negative terminal of load 100. </p>
      <p>In the second minor interval 302, inductor L2 provides power to
        load 100 while charging tank circuit 101. Specifically, current
        passes from conductor L2 through node 416, diode 40, switch 10,
        node 105 (432), and isolation switch 14 to the positive terminal
        of load 100. Current then passes from the negative terminal of
        load 100 through isolation switch 13, node 402, diode 34, node
        410, constant current controller MOSFET 12, and node 412 before
        returning to inductor L2. The description of currents during
        this second minor interval 302 is otherwise identical to the
        description of those in the first minor interval 301. </p>
      <p>During the third minor interval 303, a process occurs which is
        a repeat of that in the first minor interval 301, with tank 101
        supplying power to load 100, tank 102, and associated circuitry.
        Capacitor Cl within the first tank circuit 101 now provides
        power to the load and charges the second tank circuit 102.
        Specifically, current flows from the positive terminal of
        capacitor Cl through node 428, diode 35, switch 3, node 105
        (432), and isolation switch 14 to the positive terminal of load
        100. Current then flows from the negative terminal of load 100
        through isolation switch 13, node 402, diode 33, node 404,
        constant current controller MOSFET 5, nodes 406, 202, inductor
        L1, node 424, diode 37, switch 2, and node 426 before returning
        to the negative terminal of capacitor Cl. </p>
      <p>Inside tank circuit 102, an internal resonant current flows in
        a clockwise direction, as viewed in FIG. 2C. Current flows from
        gate signal generator and tank charger 114 through node 106
        (408), diode 32, switch 16, node 212, diode 216, and node 414 to
        the positive terminal of capacitor C2. Current also flows from
        the negative terminal of capacitor C2 through node 418, switch
        22, along path 108 before returning to gate signal generator and
        tank charger 114. </p>
      <p>Current flows from node 432 and switch 242 along path 222 to
        feedback controller 110, and then along path 226 to the gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114. Current returns along
        path 224 through the feedback controller 110 through switch 242
        along path 220 to node 402. </p>
      <p>During the fourth minor interval 304, inductor L1 provides
        power to the load and charges the second tank circuit 102.
        Specifically, current flows from the positive terminal of
        inductor L1 through node 424, diode 36, switch 4, node 105
        (432), and isolation switch -4 to the positive terminal of load
        100. Then, current flows through isolation switch 13, node 402,
        diode 33, node 404, constant current controller MOSFET 6, and
        nodes 406, 202 to return to the negative terminal of inductor
        L1. Other current flow in the circuit during the fourth minor
        interval 304 is identical to that described above, with respect
        to the third minor interval 303. </p>
      <p>Appropriate gate control signals are sent from the gate signal

      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 4, 4A, and 4B, the gate signal amplifier
        116 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is illustrated in more detail. In
        particular, gate signal amplifier 116 is shown to be an array of
        a plurality of drivers and pre-drivers. Various signals which
        pass along paths 246 from gate signal generator 114 to the gate
        signal amplifier 116 (FIGS. 1 and 2) are input to respective
        drivers/pre-drivers. The details of the generation of the
        various signals which travel along path 246 are described below,
        with reference to FIG. 5A. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 4, the signals which pass on paths 246 to the
        gate signal amplifier 116 are shown diverging to respective
        drivers and pre-drivers. The signals entering from the left of
        FIG. 4 ar those signals A-J which are illustrated in FIG. 3.
        Each of the FIG. 3 signals generated in FIG. 5A is input to one
        of two circuits, the two circuits being respectively illustrated
        in FIGS. 4A and 4B. The circuits shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B are
        shown in block form in FIG. 4, for purposes of clarity. Each of
        the blocks shown in FIG. 4 drives a respective gate of a MOSFET
        switch or constant current controller shown in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>Signals D, E, I, and J drive constant current controllers 5, 6,
        11, and 12, and are analog signals. The circuit shown in FIG. 4A
        is used for these analog signals. Most of the signals shown
        exiting to the right of FIG. 4 are binary signals, the binary
        signals being input to MOSFETs which function as on-off
        switches. The circuit shown in FIG. 4B is used for these binary
        signals. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 4A, four series-connected elements 401, 402,
        403, 404 are illustrated. The first element 401 is a constant
        current controller MOSFET gate input signal driver which is
        preferably implemented as an International Rectifier IR2129. The
        gain and drive characteristics of the driver 401 are determined
        by fixed and adjustable resistors which are connected and
        adjusted in accordance with manufacturer's specifications
        provided in published data sheets. </p>
      <p>Driver 401 drives the input of a MOSFET opto-isolator
        pre-driver comprising elements 402, 403, and 404. Element 402 is
        preferably a CD40107BEX, and element 403 is preferably an
        HCPL-2231. Elements 402, 403 effectively provide electrical
        isolation through use of optical isolation technology. A final
        MOSFET gate driver 404 is indicated, although it is optional in
        many embodiments. </p>
      <p>It is understood that each of elements 401-404 are provided
        with regulated power (+12 volts DC and -12 volts DC from FIG.
        5B). </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 4B, series-connected elements 412, 413,
        and 414 are illustrated. These elements correspond respectively
        to elements 402, 403, and 404 (FIG. 4A). Because the circuit in
        FIG. 4B does not drive a constant current controller MOSFET
        gate, no element corresponding to FIG. 4A element 401 is
        required. Otherwise, the function of FIG. 4B is substantially
        the same as that of FIG. 4A. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5A, the gate signal generator (part of
        element 114 in FIGS. 1 and 2) is illustrated. A square wave
        generator 527 produces a 200 kHz square wave output, nominally 1
        volt in magnitude and having a 50/50 duty cycle. The square wave
        generator 527 may be implemented using a Texas Instruments
        SN74LS624N voltage controlled oscillator. </p>
      <p>The output of square wave generator 527 is received by a
        frequency divider 533, a divide-by-10 element, which produces a
        20 kHz square wave. The implementation of divide-by-10 element
        533 is preferably a Motorola MC74HC4017 synchronous counter. </p>
      <p>The 20 kHz square wave output by divider 533 is input to the
        clock input of a first D flip-flop 534A. The non-inverting
        output of flip-flop 534A is input to the clock input of a second
        D-flip-flop 534B. The inverted outputs of flip-flops 534A, 534B
        are fed back to their respective D inputs. In this
        configuration, on the rising edge of each clock input, the
        respective outputs are toggled to the respective opposite
        states, as determined by the state of the inverted output during
        the previous cycle of the clock input. In this manner, each of
        the flip-flops 534A, 534B functions as a divide-by-2 frequency
        divider. Thus, the output of flip-flop 534A is a 10 kHz square
        wave, whereas the output of flip-flop 534B is a 5 kHz square
        wave. </p>
      <p>The non-inverted output of flip-flop 534A is input to the CLK
        AB input of a counter 538, as well as to the less significant
        address input bit A0 of a demultiplexer 537. The QAB output of
        counter 538 is input to the more significant address bit Al of
        demultiplexer 537. Also, the most significant counter bit QDB of
        counter 538 is fed back to the CLK A input of the counter. </p>
      <p>Flip-flops 534A, 534B may be implemented as an RCA 249CD4013AE
        Dual D flip-flop chip. Demultiplexer 537 may be implemented as a
        Motorola 832100 M74LS139T 1-of-4 Decoder/Demultiplexer chip.
        Finally, counter 538 may be implemented as a Motorola Dual
        4-Stage Binary Ripple Counter, with a clock AB input being pin
        15, the clock A input being pin 1, and the QAB and QDB outputs
        being pins 13 and 9, respectively. </p>
      <p>Demultiplexer 537 has four outputs. Only one of the four
        outputs is active at the same time. The signals input to address
        inputs A0 and Al ensure that, at a suitable frequency to
        synchronize with the outputs of flip-flop 534B, the
        demultiplexer signal which is active scans progressively from
        one output of the demultiplexer to the next. The labels 1, 2, 3,
        and 4 at the output of demultiplexer 537 indicate the minor
        interval (as defined with reference to FIG. 3) in which the
        corresponding output is active. The presence of counter 538
        ensures that no "lock-up" occurs and that the scanning of the
        active pulse is continuous and repetitive. </p>
      <p>The outputs of flip-flop 534B as well as the outputs of
        demultiplexer 537 determine the timing for all of MOSFETs 1-12,
        15-16, and 21-22 (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2). These signals are
        labelled A-J at the right of FIG. 5A, and correspond to
        similarly labelled signals in FIG. 3. Also, the minor interval
        (1, 2, 3, or 4) during which each signal is active is also
        labelled, near the right of FIG. 5A. </p>
      <p>The manner in which the outputs of flip-flop 534B and
        demultiplexer 537 determine these control signals is no
        described. The four outputs of demultiplexer 537 are input to
        respective logical inverters 539A, 539B, 539C, and 539D, which
        may be implemented as part of a Motorola MC74HC04N Hex inverter
        chip. Modified (exponentially shaped) outputs of inverters 539A,
        539B, 539C, 539D provide signals D, E, I, J, respectively, which
        control the gates of constant current controller MOSFETs 5, 6,
        11, 12, respectively. </p>
      <p>It is understood from previous discussion that the signals D,
        E, I, and J are not binary signals, but are preferably
        exponential signals. To provide this exponential wave shaping, a
        wave shaping element 536, which may be conceptualized as
        essentially an R-C wave shaper, is employed. In a preferred
        embodiment, wave shaper 536 may be an RCA CA324E, connected to
        the outputs of inverters 539A-539D in a manner readily
        implemented by those skilled in the art using published data
        sheets for the CA324E. </p>
      <p>To provide additional current boosting for the signals D, E, I,
        and J, the respective outputs of the demultiplexer 537 are input
        to the gates of four MOSFETs 540A, 540B, 540C, and 540D. The
        drain-source pathways of these MOSFETs are connected between
        respective wave shaped outputs of the inverters and ground.
        MOSFETs 540A, 540B, 540C, 540D are preferably implemented using
        Siliconix VN10KM N-Channel MOSFETs, rated at 60 volts and 1 amp
        (pulsed). Thus, the proper shape and power gate signals D, E, I,
        and J are provided via gate signal amplifier 116 (FIG. 4) to
        constant current controller MOSFETs 5, 6, 11, and 12. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the binary MOSFET gate signals A, F, B, C, G, and H
        are produced by Darlington drivers 535E, 535F, 535A, 535B, 535C,
        and 535D, respectively. These Darlington drivers, preferably
        implemented as a Motorola ULN2003A Darlington Transistor Array,
        receive respective outputs from the non-inverted and inverted
        outputs of flip-flop 534B, and the respective outputs of
        inverters 539A, 539B, 539C, and 539D. </p>
      <p>All the signals exiting the right of FIG. 5A are sent to the
        gate signal amplifier 116 offered in detail in FIGS. 4, 4A, and
        4B, before controlling the timing and operation of the MOSFETs
        which are in the tank circuit shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. </p>
      <p>It is understood that the circuit elements illustrated in FIG.
        5A are provided with proper power in the form of regulated
        voltage signals. The regulated voltage signals are generated on
        FIG. 5B. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5B, voltage regulators and the tank
        charger considered a part of element 114 (FIGS. 1 and 2) are
        illustrated. The bottom of FIG. 5B illustrates the connection
        between battery 118 (at the left of FIG. 5B) and feedback
        controller 110 (at the right of FIG. 5B). The difference between
        the unregulated 18 volts received from feedback controller 110
        (FIGS. 1 and 2) and the unregulated 12 volts from the battery
        118 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is provided by a Zener diode 571, preferably
        a 5.1 volt Zener used as a voltage shifter. Similarly, a second
        Zener diode 572 is provided between the positive and ground
        lines 226, 224, the Zener diode 572 preferably implemented as a
        12.1 voltage Zener used as a voltage regulator. Finally, a third
        diode allows passage of current from battery 118 on path 230 to
        path 224 to feedback controller 110. The third diode 573 is
        preferably implemented as a IN914 functioning as a reverse
        polarity protector. </p>
      <p>Regenerative feedback controller 110 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is
        preferably implemented as a Vicor DC-to-DC converter, having 120
        volts DC on the tank output (load) side, and a +18 volt DC
        output between paths 226 and 224. The Zener diode 572 ensures a
        12 volt DC potential matches that from battery 118. </p>
      <p>Regulated power is provided as follows. Referring again to FIG.
        5B, a first regulator 524 is connected to ground and to the
        unregulated 12 volt input from battery 118 on path 232, through
        a voltage regulator 581. Voltage regulator 581 is preferably
        implemented as a 7805. Regulator 524, preferably implemented as
        a Maxim MAX743 Dual Output Switch Mode Regulator operating with
        two Maxim LM78L12 Linear Regulators, produces regulated +12 volt
        DC and -12 volt DC outputs. The +12 volt DC output is input to a
        second regulator 533, which is preferably implemented as a 7805
        UC8621 5 volt regulator. Regulators 524 and 533 provide the
        regulated +12 volt DC, +5 volt DC, and -12 volt DC levels to
        circuits in FIG. 5A, 5C, 4A, and 4B, in a manner readily
        appreciated by those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>The tank charger portion of element 114 (FIGS. 1 and 2) may be
        implemented as follows. In FIG. 5B, the tank charger circuitry
        which controls paths 106, 107, 108 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is shown to
        comprise a series-connected step down element 525, and a step up
        element 526. Step down element 525 receives the 12 volt DC
        regulated power and steps it down through a series of 12
        series-connected diodes and an adjustable resistor to provide an
        output of +5.14 volts DC. Then, step up element 526, preferably
        implemented as an E1212-1.5150 ERG Inc. DC-to-DC voltage
        converter, produces a regulated 120 volt DC output. The output
        of step u element 526 provides power through node 106 (also
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 2) to both tank elements 101, 102. The
        ground lines leading to the respective tanks via switches 21 and
        22 (FIG. 2) are shown as pathways 107, 108 (FIGS. 1, 2, 5B). </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5C, circuitry which provides timing for
        an AC load 100A is illustrated. This circuit is in contrast to
        that providing power to a DC load 100 (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2).
        The circuit illustrated in FIG. 5C provides a 60 Hz, 120 volt
        RMS signal to the AC load 100A. </p>
      <p>More specifically, a 60 Hz sinusoidal oscillator 528 produces a
        1.0 volt 0-to-peak sinusoidal signal. Preferably, the sinusoidal
        oscillator is implemented as a Micro Linear ML2036 Programmable
        Sine Wave Generator, programmed to produce the above-mentioned
        signal applying information in published data sheets
        accompanying the Micro Linear product. The sinusoidal output of
        oscillator 528 is input to a dual half-wave rectifier 529.
        Half-wave rectifier 529 includes two diodes 529A, 529B. The
        positive portion of the sine wave is passed along a top path to
        both a square wave generator 531 and a first pre-driver 542A.
        Conversely, the negative portion of the sine wave is inverted by
        a unity-gain invertor before being input to a second square wave
        generator 532 and a fourth pre-driver 542D. Square wave
        generators 531, 532 are similarly constructed square wave
        generators which produce +12 volt square waves synchronous with
        their respective sinusoidal inputs. The outputs of square wave
        generators 531, 532 are input to second and third pre-drivers
        542B, 542C. Pre-drivers 542B, 542C produce +12 volt square waves
        substantially synchronous with their respective inputs. </p>
      <p>The unity-gain invertor is preferably implemented as an LM 318
        configured for unity gain but opposite polarity. Square wave
        generators 531, 532 are readily implemented by those skilled in
        the art. Finally, pre-drivers 542A, 542B, 542C, and 542D are
        constructed in accordance with FIG. 4B. </p>
      <p>The outputs of pre-drivers 542A and 542D drive gates of
        respective MOSFETs 23, 24. MOSFETs 23, 24 comprise the elements
        of a DC to 60 Hz half-wave convertor 549. The node between
        MOSFETs 23 and 24 is the same as node 402 (FIGS. 1 and 2) which
        is at the negative side of DC load 100 (illustrated in phantom
        in FIG. 5C). </p>
      <p>MOSFETs 17 and 18, with diodes 17A, 17B, 18A, and 18B
        collectively comprise a half-wave to full wave converter. </p>
      <p>The outputs of pre-drivers 542B and 542C drive gates of
        respective MOSFETs 17 and 18. The source of MOSFET 17 is
        connected to the source of MOSFET 24 via series-connected diodes
        17A and 18B. The node between diodes 17A and 18B is connected to
        a first terminal of the AC load 100A. Similarly, the source of
        MOSFET 18 is connected to the drain of MOSFET 23 via
        series-connected diodes 18A and 17B. The node between diodes 18A
        and 17B is connected to a second terminal of the AC load 100A. </p>
      <p>The drain of MOSFET 17 is connected to the drain of MOSFET 18,
        their common connection being the node 105 (432) which is the
        node at the positive terminal of the DC load 100 (shown in
        phantom in FIG. 5C). </p>
      <p>MOSFETs 17, 18, 23 and 24 are preferably implemented as
        IRF350's. Finally, Diodes 17A, 17B, 18A, and 18B are preferably
        implemented as 200-volt, 30A diodes functioning as reverse
        polarity protectors. </p>
      <p>In operation, the half-wave sinusoidal signals entering the
        gates of MOSFETs 23 and 24 are 180.degree. out of phase with
        each other, thus allowing power passing from nodes 402 and 105
        to pass through the AC load 100A in oppositely phased time
        frames. The 85 volt peak voltage half-wave sinusoids provided by
        each of the MOSFETs 23, 24 arranged in opposite polarities thus
        provides a 60 Hz full wave 120 volt RMS output to the AC load
        100A. </p>
      <p>The structure and operation of the preferred embodiment of the
        present invention has been described. For a more conceptual
        understanding, the following description is provided. </p>
      <p>As described above, the preferred embodiment includes two tank
        circuits that are resonant at the same frequency. In the
        illustrated embodiment whose components are listed above, the
        resonant frequency is 20 kHz. The tank circuits have identical
        associated drive systems, master-time-controlled by signals A
        and F (FIG. 3) from gate signal generator and tank charger 114,
        operating at 20 kHz. Signals A and F are identical but
        oppositely phased positive-going, 50/50 duty cycle square waves.
        Each signal controls the time frame by which all other
        operations take place by controlling the grounding sequence
        between the tank circuits and their respective current source
        through respective grounding MOSFETs 21 and 22. Thus,
        alternation of functioning of the tank circuits is achieved. </p>
      <p>Regarding operation of tank 101, at the beginning of the first
        major period 312, at the beginning of the first minor interval
        301; at the instant that MOSFET 21 receives a positive going (0
        to +12 volts) 50/50 duty cycle square wave gate voltage signal A
        , MOSFET 22 is receiving a neutral going (+12 volts to 0 volts)
        50/50 duty cycle square wave gate voltage signal F. Tank 101 is
        thus connected to the gate signal generator and tank charger 114
        and capacitor Cl is allowed to charge (under resonant
        conditions) where the inductive reactance equals the capacitive
        reactance to V+voltage, which in the preferred embodiment is 120
        volts. Page 4-134, Electricity One-Seven, (Harry Mileaf, the
        totality of which is incorporated herein by reference) includes
        an explanation of parallel resonant tank circuit charging as
        generally understood by those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>At the same time that MOSFET 21 receives its positive going
        square wave gate signal A, MOSFET 1 of tank 101 receives the
        same gate signal. This opens a current flow path within tank 101
        including only resistances associated with the inductor, MOSFET
        switch, diodes, capacitor and conductors connecting these
        components in series. The series resistance includes: the
        resistance of multi-strand wire, which may be #12 copper wire
        with having 0.00102 ohms resistance/foot used as conductors
        connecting the various components in series; the 0.15 Ohm
        internal drain-to-source resistance of MOSFET 1; the internal
        resistances of diodes 206 and 38; negligible capacitor
        resistance; and 12-14 inches of copper wire, which may be #12
        single strand wire which makes up the coil of tank 101's
        inductor L1. </p>
      <p>The magnetic core of the inductor is preferably a ferrite
        toroid with associated magnetic quadrature tuning circuitry.
        This circuitry between the positive and negative terminals of Cl
        makes up the complete current charging path within tank 101,
        which is only about 12-18 inches in length. The extremely low
        value of the total internal tank circuit resistance allows the
        tank to be operated at a high "Q" or "quality." Adjustment of
        the "Q" in the preferred embodiment is accomplished by varying
        the inductive reactance of the inductor L1. This is preferably
        accomplished by increasing or decreasing a DC current through
        the windings around a "C" cored electro-magnet physically placed
        at 90 degrees (at quadrature) to the axis of the toroid inductor
        L1. The induced magnetic field within the "C" cored
        electro-magnet controller changes, or "modulates" the inductive
        reactance of the inductor L1. Other possible means of manual or
        automatic physical or electronic adjustment of the tank's
        inductance lie within the ability of those skilled in the art
        for tuning the inventive power supply, and need not be further
        described. </p>
      <p>Tank 102's internal charging path circuitry, associated
        controlling circuitry and associated current paths are
        functionally, and as close as possible, physically, exact
        duplicates of those of tank 101. </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the first major period, tank 102, having
        just completed its resonant charging sequence, is at the same
        instant decoupled from the exterior current source as
        "grounding" MOSFET 22 receives neutral going (+12 to 0 volt)
        square wave gate signal F so that it is turned off to a
        non-conducting state. Also at this same instant, a current flow
        path is established between the negatively charged terminal of
        C2, the load 100, and the positive terminal of C2, because of
        the 0 to +12 volt, 25/75 duty cycle signal G (applied to the
        gates of MOSFETs 8 and 9), and signal I (applied to the gate of
        MOSFET 11). MOSFETs 8 and 9 receive the 0 to +12 volt, 25/75
        duty cycle gate G signal which turns them on. </p>
      <p>MOSFET 11 receives a 0 to +12 volt, 25/75 duty cycle
        "exponential" gate signal that is specifically designed to
        utilize the full 25% time period of minor interval 301 in
        reaching its maximum +12 volt level. It is sequenced to start at
        the same instant as the gate signal going to MOSFET 8. In the
        illustrated embodiment, all trailing, or neutral going +12 to 0
        volt edges of the exponential signals are vertical; they do not
        ramp downward nor do they extend below the zero line. </p>
      <p>At the end of this first minor interval, the voltages at the
        gates of MOSFETs 8, 9, and 11 are forced instantaneously to zero
        volts. This minor interval comprises only half the overall 50
        percent duty cycle as determined by the gate signal generator
        and tank charger 114's 20 kHz rate (signals A and F). </p>
      <p>At the instant that MOSFETs 8, 9 and 11 are turned off, MOSFETs
        10 and 12 are turned on by receiving 0 to +12 volt 25/75 duty
        cycle gate voltage signals H and J respectively. MOSFET 10
        receives a 0 to +12 volt, 25/75 duty cycle gate voltage like
        that sent to the gates of MOSFETs 8 and 9. MOSFET 12 receives a
        0 to +12 volt, 25/75 duty cycle "exponential" gate voltage
        signal identical to that sent earlier to the gate of MOSFET 11.
      </p>
      <p>This second set of MOSFET controls the discharging path during
        the second minor interval 302 (and therefore, the timing of th
        collapse of the magnetic field of L2) which was created by the
        discharge of capacitor C2. This second minor interval 302
        (occupying the second 50 percent of the first major period time
        frame) takes up the remaining portion of the discharge time
        frame. This discharge time frame is the first major period
        allotted to tank 102 by the 20 kHz signals A and F from the gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114. </p>
      <p>This is the preferred configuration of MOSFETs 8-12 in the
        discharge current path of tank 102, and the preferred
        configuration of MOSFETs 21 and 1 in the current capacitor
        charge path of tank 101. As stated above, MOSFETs 1-4, 7-10, and
        21-22 act as "on/off" switches, thus changing the various
        current flow paths, while other MOSFETs (5, 6, 11, and 12) act
        as constant current controllers. MOSFET 11 controls the current
        discharge flow rate of tank 102's capacitor C2, while MOSFET 12
        controls the current flow rate created by the controlled
        collapse of the magnetic field of tank 102's inductor L2. By
        design, the tank capacitors are not in the current flow
        discharge path of the tank inductors. When a tank inductor
        discharges within in the second minor interval, it does not
        change polarity as in standard tank circuits. Nor do the tank
        capacitors change in polarity as in standard tank circuits; they
        charge in one direction only. This action is totally different
        than that of standard tank circuit. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the present invention are many, but include:
      </p>
      <p>1) Each resonant tank is directed to charge its capacitor
        independent of any exterior load being connected to it, thereby
        realizing the resonance charging conditions to the fullest. </p>
      <p>2) Each tank element is discharged through the load in a
        uniform manner with a common and unchanging polarity to the load
        (for DC operation). </p>
      <p>A discussion is presented here to amplify the advantages
        summarized in the previous paragraphs; for it is here that the
        present invention demonstrates some of its advances in the art.
      </p>
      <p>By first controlling the current flow discharge rate of the
        resonant tank capacitor, and then controlling the discharge rate
        of the resonant tank inductor, the following occurs. First, a
        non-resonant RC circuit, and then a non-resonant LR circuit,
        powers the load. Powering a load using non-resonant circuits is
        standard practice today in some power supplies, but any powering
        circuits are used independently of each other. In contrast, the
        present embodiment sequentially uses a non-resonant RC circuit
        and a non-resonant LR circuit. Also, and more important, by
        discharging the elements of both resonant tank circuits in
        exactly half the time that was allotted for resonant charging of
        the individual tank capacitors, twice the available current (and
        thus, correspondingly increased power) is made available to the
        load in comparison to the situation in which each capacitor is
        discharged at its resonant charging rate. In fact, discharging
        each capacitor at its resonant charging rate would bring about
        very disastrous conditions for most loads. This is because
        series resonant conditions would come into play with its
        associated condition of reactive voltage increases which would
        be impressed across the load. </p>
      <p>By utilizing the MOSFETs 5, 6, 11, and 12 as variable resistors
        (functioning as constant current controllers) and decreasing
        their resistance exponentially from maximum to minimum during
        the "on" portion of the appropriate minor interval, the
        following is accomplished: By decreasing the internal resistance
        to current flow within each tank capacitor's discharge circuit
        over the full minor interval in a manner that exactly
        counteracts and yet controls the decreasing voltage of the
        discharging tank capacitor, the load is presented with
        controlled, even current. Thus, the load can react evenly, as if
        fed by a constant voltage, constant current source. Similarly,
        by decreasing the internal resistance within each tank
        inductor's discharge circuit over the entire minor interval in a
        manner that exactly counteracts and yet controls the decreasing
        voltage associated with the collapsing magnetic field, the load
        is again presented with controlled current. </p>
      <p>This advantage is accomplished by exactly matching the previous
        negative polarity to positive polarity supplied by the tank
        capacitor (only now from the tank inductor) during the entire
        time frame in which inductor magnetic field collapse is
        experienced. The different voltage potentials (+120V and
        neutral, or ground) required by the load to operate properly is
        first supplied by the tank 102 capacitor C2 during minor
        interval 301, then by tank 102 inductor L2 during minor interval
        302, then by tank 101 capacitor Cl during minor interval 303,
        and finally by tank 101 inductor L1 during minor interval 304;
        at which time minor interval 301 begins again and the entire
        sequence repeats. Again, it is as if a non-changing, constant
        voltage source is being applied to the load. </p>
      <p>Each of the discharge time "minor intervals" is exactly
        one-half the full tank charge time "major periods". This
        fulfills the requirement of balancing the charge/discharge ratio
        to obtain equilibrium within the circuit As described above, as
        the tank 102 components C2 and L2 are discharging through the
        load in a non-resonant manner, tank 101 is charging the
        capacitor Cl (which is not connected to the load) under parallel
        resonant conditions. The individual series-connected discharge
        time rates are one-half the charge time rate, so that the
        discharge current flow rate is twice as fast, thus affording the
        load twice the available current compared with a set of
        operating conditions where each discharge time rate is equal in
        time to each charge time rate. After the elements of tank 102
        have discharged through the load, encountering only series
        resistive losses due to the conductive paths, the inductor coil,
        tank diodes, and the load, they are disconnected from the load
        by MOSFETs 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they receive neutral going
        +12 to 0 volt signals G, G, H, I, and J, respectively at their
        gates. At the same instant, the proper positive going gate
        voltages are applied to the appropriate tank 101 MOSFETs (tank
        101 having just completed resonant charging of its capacitor
        Cl), and the cycle of powering the load during the second major
        period 334 during minor intervals 303, 304, (from the elements
        of tank 101) can begin. </p>
      <p>In summary, the described embodiment has the following
        features: </p>
      <p>The ability to use reactive power to completely power a load
        through the process of controlled current flow from alternately
        employed series non-resonant LR and RC circuits of which the L
        and C components, during the charging cycle, form a parallel
        resonant tank circuit. </p>
      <p>The ability to utilize the natural magnification
        characteristics of a resonant tank circuit to bring about the
        full charge condition of a capacitor through a circuit path
        other than only through the current's voltage source (as in a
        series resonant circuit). </p>
      <p>The ability to double the effective available current to a
        load. This is accomplished by halving the available discharge
        time per element, from the capacitor and then from the inductor
        of each tank. </p>
      <p>The ability to continuously power a pseudo-series-connected
        load by using two identical resonant tank circuits. One tank
        circuit's capacitor under resonant conditions is charged from an
        external voltage source while being isolated from the load. The
        other previously charged tank circuit's elements discharge
        (under controlled series circuit conditions as described above)
        through the load while being isolated from the external voltage
        source. </p>
      <p>The ability to continuously power a load with an electronic
        power supply that cannot suffer from the problem of voltage drop
        (a dropping or decreasing voltage potential experienced by known
        generators). </p>
      <p>The ability to continuously power a load with an electrical
        power source. The external voltage/current source (battery 118)
        supplies the necessary voltage and current to fulfill the power
        requirements to charge up Cl in tank 101 during the first major
        period. After the resonant charging of one of the two resonant
        tanks, the charged tank elements start to discharge through the
        load. </p>
      <p>As can be seen from the above description of circuit
        operations, the circuitry operates in both "best mode" cases of
        resonance. First, regarding series resonance, the illustrated
        embodiment has the ability to deliver maximum available power to
        a load. Second, regarding parallel resonance, the illustrated
        embodiment has the ability to charge a capacitor to act as a
        voltage potential source utilizing the absolute minimum amount
        of current from an external current source. </p>
      <p>Additional circuitry may be added to the illustrated embodiment
        to utilize the ability of a DC "power" source to be
        non-discriminatory in its own power requirements under the
        condition known as DC superposition. In this scenario, the
        resonant tank circuitry takes its required current and voltage
        from whatever source such as battery 118 and/or feedback
        controller 110, or a combination of both, as long as each has
        the correct voltage polarity and minimum required current. The
        system may be specifically designed to utilize feedback
        controller 110 for the primary (internal) DC voltage and current
        source, and may use battery 118 as an external DC voltage and
        current source for the secondary DC source. </p>
      <p>The system exhibits maximum impedance to current flow from the
        point of view of looking out from the resonant tank circuit
        toward its voltage and current source, as any resonant tank
        circuit should. At the same time, it powers the load as a series
        circuit would, with impedance to current flow coming only from
        line resistance (determined by the size and other properties of
        the wire used in the discharge path). The system is not under
        series resonant conditions in the discharge mode because the
        discharge frequency is twice that of the charge frequency: 40
        kHz versus the 20 kHz resonant frequency of the system. </p>
      <p>The dual, yet independent series LR and RC discharge circuits
        making up tanks 101 and 102 have the ability to fulfill all
        electrical power requirements: each can supply the necessary
        voltage and current to each other as the internal system "power
        source", (feedback controller 110, gate signal generator and
        tank charger 114, gate signal amplifier 116, and associated
        circuitry) that is charging the other tank circuit (which is
        charging under resonant conditions at 20 kHz) as a load in
        parallel to load 100. The reason for this condition is that the
        particular section of the system being charged under resonant
        conditions is connected (from a load-power-requirements point of
        view) to the other part of the power supply that is powering
        load 100 at that instant. Only those resonant tank circuit
        components that had been previously charged up under resonant
        conditions, and were previously disconnected from the "internal"
        power source (the other tank circuit but not feedback controller
        110) during this time frame is powering the total parallel load.
        In this usage of the term "load", the "internal" tank circuit
        control circuitry and the other charging tank circuit are a part
        of the total "load", not just load 100. </p>
      <p>Under conditions of resonance, "tunnel diodes", or "Esaki
        diodes", can be used in the resonant tank circuit, and all
        necessary outside current directly fed to the tank circuit
        itself can be eliminated. The reason is that a tunnel diode
        creates a condition known as "negative resistance". The effect
        it can have upon the tank circuit in which it is placed is to
        reduce the effective pure resistance to an absolute minimum.
        Therefore, with an effective internal pure resistance at an
        absolute minimum within the tank itself as described above, an
        absolute minimum "line current" running through node 106 is
        necessary. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, two circuits are operating at the same
        time. In the first minor interval 301 (FIG. 3), tank 101 is
        being charged, and is disconnected from load 100 and feedback
        controller 110 as MOSFETs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not conducting.
        Tank 101 is connected to the internal power source (feedback
        controller 110; gate signal generator and tank charger 114; and
        gate signal amplifier 116) through its diode on the positive
        120V node 202 through node 106. MOSFET 21 provides the
        connection to the ground side. </p>
      <p>Tank 102's capacitor and then its inductor discharge through
        the "load" (which, for these purposes, is considered to include
        tank 101, the internal power source (feedback controller 110,
        gate signal generator and tank charger 114, gate signal
        amplifier 116, and parallel load 100)). At this time, tank 102
        is disconnected from the internal power supply (feedback
        controller 110, gate signal generator and tank charger 114, gate
        signal amplifier 116) because diode 216 at the positive terminal
        of capacitor C2 does not allow the capacitor to discharge
        directly to it. MOSFET 22, positioned between tank 102 and the
        internal power source ground, has also been turned off, thus
        isolating tank 102 discharge circuitry from the internal and
        external power source grounds. </p>
      <p>In this manner, each discharging tank circuit component forms
        both its own ground source and current source to load 100 and
        its parallel load made up of feedback controller 110, gate
        signal generator and tank charger 114, gate signal amplifier
        116, and the other tank circuit. MOSFETs 11 and 12, each
        receiving a exponential gate signal, control the amount of
        current allowed to be delivered to the loads as described
        earlier for the following reason. </p>
      <p>Current should be delivered in a steady, even manner to obtain
        the desired effect of powering the load evenly. An evenly
        applied amount of current supplied to a steady and unchanging
        load will allow the proper, even, designed voltage drop to be
        developed across the load. The availability of current flow (up
        to a predetermined maximum amount as determined by the dual tank
        circuit components and discharge circuitry) applied to a
        changing load; either resistive, inductive, capacitive, or a
        combination thereof, can power that load as supplied by the
        system. Because "current flow" (and not voltage) is the "common
        denominator" in all four load conditions listed above, the
        various different voltage drops; and their individual phase
        relationships at the individual loads can be developed by the
        various loads as required. The present system utilizes the
        ability of a power MOSFET to be used as a variable resistor in
        controlling the current flow rate. The present system controls
        the current flow rate supplied to the load by decreasing its
        resistance to current flow in a manner that is an exact
        correlation to the dropping source voltage being supplied first
        by tank capacitors and then tank inductors. This arrangement
        delivers the correct flow of current needed to pass through and
        as required by the load. As the voltage of, first, the tank
        capacitor and then the tank inductor, drops, the controlling
        MOSFETs' internal resistance also must drop. </p>
      <p>During the first minor interval 301 (FIG. 3) the discharging of
        the tank 102 capacitor C2 supplies the necessary difference of
        potential between its terminals to cause current flow through
        the parallel loads, as controlled by MOSFET 11. </p>
      <p>During the second minor interval 302 (FIG. 3) the collapsing
        magnetic field of the tank 102 inductor L2 supplies the
        necessary difference in potential between its poles to cause
        current flow through the load, as controlled by MOSFET 12. </p>
      <p>During minor intervals 303 and 304 (FIG. 3), the above
        described current flow occurs again. Tank 101 powers the "load"
        (which now includes both tank 102 and the internal power source
        as described previously). Tank 101 capacitor Cl is disconnected
        from gate signal generator and tank charger 114 through node 106
        by diode 206 at C1's positive terminal, thus not allowing Cl to
        discharge back into itself, MOSFET 15 being turned off, and by
        the non-conducting ground controlling MOSFET 21 being turned
        off. MOSFET controls the discharge time of capacitor Cl, in the
        same manner as MOSFET 11 controls the discharge time of
        capacitor C2. MOSFET 6 controls the decay time of the magnetic
        field of inductor Ll, in the same manner as MOSFET 12 controls
        the decay time of the magnetic field of inductor L2. MOSFETs 8,
        9, and 10 are turned off to allow tank 102 to charge capacitor
        C2 to the applied 120 volts supplied from the gate signal
        generator and tank charger 114. </p>
      <p>Modifications and variations of the above-described embodiments
        of the present invention are possible, as appreciated by those
        skilled in the art in light of the above descriptions. It is
        therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the
        appended claims and their equivalents, the invention may be
        practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </p>
