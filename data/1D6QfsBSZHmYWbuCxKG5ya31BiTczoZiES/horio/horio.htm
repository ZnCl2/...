        <p><b><font size="+1">New Biomass Heater: a “New Era” of
              Efficiency and Sustainability</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Newswise</i> — Millions of homes in rural areas of Far
        Eastern countries are heated by charcoal burned on small,
        hibachi-style portable grills. Scientists in Japan are now
        reporting development of an improved “biomass charcoal
        combustion heater” that they say could open a new era in
        sustainable and ultra-high efficiency home heating. Their study
        was published in ACS’ Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry
        Research, a bi-weekly journal. </p>
      <p>In the study, Amit Suri, Masayuki Horio and colleagues note
        that about 67 percent of Japan is covered with forests, with
        that biomass the nation’s most abundant renewable energy source.
        Wider use of biomass could tap that sustainable source of fuel
        and by their calculations cut annual carbon dioxide emissions by
        4.46 million tons. </p>
      <p>Using waste biomass charcoal, their heater recorded a thermal
        efficiency of 60-81 percent compared to an efficiency of 46-54
        percent of current biomass stoves in Turkey and the U.S. “The
        charcoal combustion heater developed in the present work, with
        its fast startup, high efficiency, and possible automated
        control, would open a new era of massive but small-scale biomass
        utilization for a sustainable society,” the authors say. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a
        combustion device which can be used for a heating device and the
        like capable of using powder and granular fuel including powder
        and granular coal of which diameter is approximately 75 [mu]m to
        1 mm and powder and granular biomass and the like as fuel. ;
        SOLUTION: An opening part of a duplex tube 12, consisting of a
        powder and granular fuel/air supply tube P1 for supplying mixed
        fluid of the powder and granular coal and air as an inner tube
        and a secondary air supply tube P2 as an outer tube which are
        wound by a heater H1, is connected through center of a bottom
        part of a rotation combustion device 10. The rotation combustion
        device 10 of which inside is divided by baffle is rotated. The
        powder and granular coal fuel for accompanying air in the powder
        and granular fuel/air supply tube P1 heated by the heater H1 is
        heated hotter than an ignition point and jetted/flowed in the
        combustion device in an ignited state.; At the same time, large
        amount of air is forcibly ventilated through the secondary air
        supply tube P2 and ignited powder and granular fuel is moved in
        its location step by step in the combustion device to achieve
        complete combustion by securing sufficient residence time and
        combustion is continued within a fixed temperature range. </p>

      <p>In the present work a prototype powdered biomass charcoal fired
        heater with a heat output of 6 kW is designed and developed so
        that a new powdered charcoal market can be initiated to enhance
        greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction through massive biomass
        utilization. The combustion heater was designed based on the
        concept of charcoal combustion in a thin bed cross-flow (TBCF)
        mode, where a very thin uniform bed of charcoal is fixed by air
        flow on the wall of a cylindrical chamber with an air-penetrable
        wall. The distinct advantage of using such a thin bed cross-flow
        is low fuel inventory and good airâˆ’fuel contact, resulting in
        fast startup/shutdown and low CO emissions in the exhaust gases.
        Fundamental data for realizing such a combustion heater are
        presented, and the performance characterization of the thus
        manufactured heater is investigated. The combustion heater was
        characterized for charcoal prepared from Japanese oak (<i>Quercus



          serrata</i>) and from several waste biomass sources, such as a
        pruned apple branch and charcoal formed from spent coffee waste
        and soybean fiber. For wood charcoal the heater's thermal
        efficiency was about 65-86%, and for waste biomass charcoal
        species it was found to be in the range of 60-81%. When the
        combustion heater was operated at the stable combustion mode,
        the CO concentration in the exhaust after the flue gas passed
        through catalyst was less than 5 ppm. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">1 Introduction</font></b> </p>
      <p>The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental
        Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been successful in attracting
        the world's attention to global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG)
        emissions, bringing into focus the importance of the Kyoto
        Protocol, which addresses key issues in reduction of GHG
        emissions, and the post Kyoto Protocol framework design. To
        suppress the global temperature rise within 2 C to avoid extreme
        climate disasters, it is said to be necessary to reduce the GHG
        emission to half of its year 1990 value.(1) With a simple
        calculation (cf. Appendix A) as shown in Table 1, for the case
        where equal right to spend fossil fuels but equal duty to
        utilize low GHG emission technologies, as reasonable as and as
        low as Japan's year 2000 conditions per capita basis, are
        assumed as developing countries request, we obtain the result
        that the global GHG emission reaches 2.66 times as big as those
        of the 1990s for the year 2000. If global GHG emissions are to
        be reduced based on this Japan's per capita equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions for year 2000, to obtain half of the world's 1990 CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions to avoid extreme climate disaster (rise of 2°C) a
        substantial reduction is necessary for almost all countries. The
        required reduction for the year 2000 was in the range of 73-91%
        for industrialized nations (cf. Table 1, right-most column).
        However, developing countries, such as China, have less duties,
        23% (cf. Table 1), but substantial reduction is still requested
        based on year 2000 emission results. Since the reduction duty of
        GHG emissions is quite high, the industrialized nations
        (participating Annex I countries in the Kyoto Protocol) have to
        take the initiative to introduce a fair rule to change the
        modern petroleum-dependent lifestyle by putting effort into the
        development of renewable energy sources not just on an
        industrial scale, but also on a small/household scale. </p>

      <p>a&nbsp; --Oil equivalent energy consumption. <br>
        b -- Carbon equivalent emissions. </p>
      <p>However, to use renewable energy sources, the energy source
        should be abundantly available, well distributed, and in a
        perennial supply. In the case of Japan, about 67% of Japan's
        land area is covered with forests(2) and biomass is the single
        most abundantly available renewable energy source that can be
        used on demand. </p>
      <p>Wood biomass combustion/gasification can thus play a
        significant role in the domestic electricity supply by following
        load changes. Moreover, small-scale to mid-scale biomass thermal
        power stations can be installed which can help reduce
        distribution losses and also serve as district heating and for
        regional hot water supply lines, thus reducing double conversion
        as in the case of using electricity for heating. In Japan, about
        28% of the total energy consumed is utilized for domestic usage,
        of which about 50% is used in hot water supply and space
        heating.(3) By replacing only 5% of this heating energy, we can
        obtain a CO<sub>2</sub> reduction effect of about 4.46 million
        tons of CO<sub>2</sub>/year. Direct biomass combustion boilers
        and heaters for individual buildings were used in Japan only
        until the 1960s, and reintroducing firewood and charcoal
        distribution system should be still not too much unrealistic, if
        biomass utilization style can be made a little more convenient.
        <br>
        Improved biomass stoves used in Turkey and U.S. residential
        space heating offer the advantage of biomass utilization, but
        are not preferred due to their low thermal efficiency, in the
        range of 46-54%.(4, 5) This is due to the smoke emission and the
        inefficient nature of conventional chimneys, which may not be
        easily improved due to tar and soot deposition problems.
        Previous researchers(5) have characterized these "improved
        biomass stoves" for flue gas emissions and thermal efficiencies
        for combustion of different biomass species. Biomass in its raw
        form with its low calorific value (15 MJ/kg) is very ineffective
        in its storage, transportation, and combustion and cannot
        compete with kerosene or gas combustion. More recently, becoming
        popular are wood pellet combustion heaters, having higher
        thermal efficiency and automatic feed control.(6) Even
        air-conditioning systems fueled by wood pellets have been
        designed and operated in Kagoshima prefecture in Japan.(7) The
        point of it is a higher heating value (18 MJ/kg) and the
        convenience of easy handling and automatic control.
        Nevertheless, the improvement by making wood chips or sawdust
        into pellets is small due to additional energy requirements for
        drying, milling, and extrusion and due to the basic degrading
        nature of pellets in the long term. Contrary to the good
        intention of pellet stove supporters to reintroduce wood biomass
        into domestic heating demand, the pellet stove system has not
        yet solved the issue of biomass utilization successfully. <br>
        However, once carbonized, wood biomass becomes a stable, clean,
        and high-caloric fuel, i.e., charcoal (25-30 MJ/kg). Although
        charcoal produced in traditional ways is inefficient in terms of
        yield and high GHG emissions,(8) a near theoretical charcoal
        yield can be achieved under elevated pressure.(9-13) These
        high-yield processes can be integrated with district heating or
        other heat utilization facilities for coproduction of charcoal
        and thermal energy by directly utilizing the volatiles produced
        during carbonization for combustion. Furthermore, if charcoal is
        crushed, the mechanical strength of charcoal is very much less
        and it can be easily crushed to powder.(14) For the case of
        coffee bean waste after dripping, the crushing energy of its
        char prepared at different temperatures (maximum 800°C) was
        measured experimentally and was found to be less than 48% of
        that of raw coffee bean waste.(15) If powdered charcoal is
        packaged in cartridge containers, the fuel quality of charcoal
        can be preserved for long-term storage with the convenience of
        easy transportation.(16) These charcoal cartridges can then be
        used in conjunction with some combustion equipment that has a
        special flow-controlling device and a completely automatic
        combustion control system; this can provide a promising viable
        alternative for heat energy requirements for small-scale
        utilization. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">2 Design Concept for a Solid Fuel Combustion
            Heater</font></b> </p>
      <p>The combustion system aimed at in the present work for biomass
        charcoal particle combustion is the one that can be operated in
        continuous mode, with low fuel inventory, and with good contact
        between fuel and air for fast startup and extinction and
        complete oxidation for low CO in flue gas. The low fuel
        inventory is essential because, as shown in Figure 1, if the
        particle bed is thick, or if the bed support wall is
        impenetrable to air, the combustion of particles will only take
        place at the top surface of the bed. However, if the bed is made
        very thin and if the air penetrates into the bed and then out
        from the bed support wall, the contact between fuel and air is
        made good, resulting in a quick ignition/quick extinction. We
        name this the "thin bed cross-flow" (TBCF) mode of solids
        combustion. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1. Types of air-fuel contact in a bed of solid fuel
          particles illustrated for constant-pressure cases.</b> </p>
      <p>The TBCF mode of combustion has advantages in terms of good
        air-fuel contact and low bed inventory. Comparing TBCF
        combustion with fluidized bed combustors, both offer good
        airâfuel contact, resulting in almost complete oxidation of CO.
        However, in the case of fluidized bed combustors, the bed cannot
        consist of solid fuel only. If a bed contains only solid fuel,
        oxygen is consumed only in the grid zone, lowering the contact
        efficiency and forming local hot spots and agglomerates of ash.
        Hence, a fluidized bed combustor needs to be diluted by
        incombustible bed material and the solid fuel particles are
        floated in the bed. This requires a large solid inventory and as
        a result a very long time for startup and complete extinction. </p>
      <p>If TBCF combustion is compared with a packed bed combustor and
        a rotary kiln, although they all offer an advantage of operation
        with no bed diluents material, the airâˆ’fuel contact in packed
        beds and rotary kilns is nonuniform, and combustion takes place
        only in a zone or on the bed surface. Hence, if one wants to
        take advantage of low bed inventory and good air-fuel contact,
        for quick ignition/extinction, TBCF combustion should be
        preferred. </p>
      <p>However, to form a uniform thin bed of charcoal particles on
        the wall of the combustion chamber for TBCF combustion,
        particles are needed to be uniformly fixed on the wall. Fixing a
        thin fuel layer all over the circular chamber wall can be done
        either by rotating the chamber or by attaching a rotating feeder
        or a solid flow conditioner, so that the particle flow is
        directed radially to the wall of the chamber. However, in the
        present design, the chamber was supposed to rotate since by this
        rotation the fuel distribution over the wall can be done more
        easily. The front end of the rotating chamber was covered by a
        nonrotating high-temperature glass plate. If the combustion
        chamber rotates and is sealed by a nonrotating glass plate, the
        combustion chamber needs to be housed in a stationary cylinder
        of little larger dimensions. Hence, an air seal for the gap
        between the combustion chamber and its surrounding needs a
        design delicate, but robust, enough for possible combustion
        chamber deformation during high-temperature operation. An
        induced negative draft was applied to keep the temperature of
        the glass plate relatively low and to avoid any spillover of
        burning char in case of glass breakage. </p>
      <p>To fix fuel particles on the wall, even on its top wall, it is
        necessary to counter the gravitational force for the particles
        to form an upside-down fixed bed on the penetrable wall of the
        combustion chamber.(17) </p>
      <p>In the following section the design procedure is discussed
        based on design principles and data are determined
        experimentally for the particle fixing and ignition condition
        with an air heater. </p>

      <p>A heat output of 6 kW was adopted as a design basis, which is
        of the same capacity as the commercially sold heaters for
        household utilization in Japan. Charcoal prepared from Japanese
        oak (<i>Quercus serrata</i>) at 700 Â°C, still popular in Japan
        as one of the major classical fuels at home, was crushed and
        sieved into 150âˆ’250 Î¼m size range. Table 2 summarizes the
        physical and chemical properties of the char particles used in
        the design of a charcoal combustion heater. The stoichiometric
        air ratio was assumed to be 2. </p>

      <p>The combustion heater was designed based on the steady-state
        heat balance at 850 °C. The cross section of the front glass
        window was determined so that about 45% of the thermal heat
        capacity is transferred for space heating through radiation from
        the front window as shown in the heat balance in Figure 2. The
        combustion air flow rate can be calculated from stoichiometry
        (including excess air). The length of the combustion chamber was
        determined from the air flow rate and the air velocity necessary
        to fix particles on the circular side wall as discussed in the
        next section. The heat exchangers in the downstream section of
        the combustion chamber were designed to recover as much as
        possible of the remaining 55% of the thermal heat capacity of
        the heater. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2. Heat balance for charcoal combustion heater:</b> </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3.2&nbsp; TBCF Combustion Chamber Design</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>The penetrable wall of the combustion chamber was developed by
        covering the inner circular wall of the combustion chamber by a
        ceramic fiber mesh (Rubylon CS-40, Nichias Corp., Japan) on a
        punched SUS304 cylindrical plate. To achieve a TBCF mode of
        charcoal particle combustion, the length of the combustion
        chamber should satisfy hydrodynamic and reaction kinetics
        conditions, i.e., to fix the charcoal particles bed on the wall
        of the combustion chamber vertically upward and to check if the
        bed thus formed on the wall of the combustion chamber is thin,
        respectively. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3.2.1&nbsp; Hydrodynamic Condition</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>To fix charcoal particles on the penetrable wall of the
        combustion chamber, the drag force exerted by the combustion air
        should be higher than the gravitational force acting on the
        particles. The minimum velocity, <i>U</i><sub>udp</sub>, to fix
        the fuel particles in an inverted packed bed mode, i.e.,
        vertically upward onto the wall of the chamber, is determined
        experimentally. The length of the combustion chamber is then
        calculated from the lateral surface area obtained by dividing
        the air flow rate by <i>U</i><sub>udp</sub>. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3.2.2&nbsp; Experimental determination of <i>U</i><sub>udp</sub></font></b>
      </p>
      <p>The experimental apparatus consisted of a distributor, prepared
        by the same ceramic fiber mesh as used in the combustion chamber
        and connecting it to a cylindrical tube of 215 mm length and 26
        mm i.d.; the base of the tube was fitted with a plug and
        connected to Teflon tubing through a flow meter to a vacuum
        pump. The top of this tube was connected coaxially to another
        tube of 315 mm length and 32 mm i.d. to form the arrangement
        shown in Figure 3a. A known weight of charcoal particles
        (150âˆ’250 Î¼m) was placed on the distributor and the vacuum
        pump was started. The apparatus was then inverted slowly until
        it was completely upside down, and the mass of charcoal that did
        not form the inverted packed bed was measured. The experiment
        was repeated for varying air velocities, to form an inverted
        packed bed with 100% of charcoal weight placed on the ceramic
        fiber mesh. Figure 3b shows the percentage weight of charcoal
        sticking to the mesh on varying air velocities. The air velocity
        in the combustion chamber should be greater than <i>U</i><sub>udp</sub>
        to form TBCF in the chamber. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The condition of the thin bed of charcoal particles is then
        checked by calculating the thickness of the bed for the obtained
        length and diameter of the combustion chamber. The thickness of
        the charcoal bed is calculated from the inventory of charcoal
        particles in the combustion chamber, which is obtained by
        determining the time for TBCF combustion with multilayers based
        on the shrinking core model without ash layer diffusion (cf.
        Appendix B). If the thickness of the bed calculated by this
        procedure is too large, the burnout time of charcoal particles
        and also the pressure drop across the bed increase. In such a
        case, the length of the chamber has to be recalculated by
        readjusting the air ratio and the heat balance. <br>
        Based on this design procedure, the dimensions of the TBCF
        combustion chamber were determined to be of 200 mm i.d. and 100
        mm length. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3.3 Ring Duct Air Distributor Design</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>To prevent charcoal particles from colliding with the front
        glass, the combustion air was injected into the combustion
        chamber from the front side (around the front glass) through a
        ring duct air distributor. The ring duct air distributor acts as
        a flange mounted on the stationary part of the combustion
        chamber to seal the chamber from the front. Since the ring duct
        was fixed to the stationary part, there existed a gap between
        the rotating combustion chamber and the stationary cylinder of
        0.6 mm (constrained by mechanical design). Thus, the ring duct
        has a role to provide seal and lubrication air to this gap,
        reducing the friction between the flanges of the fixed and
        rotating chambers and preventing the leakage of both flue gas
        and charcoal particles from the gap. Another role of this front
        side aeration is to keep the temperature of the front side
        including both the ring duct and the front glass sufficiently
        low to minimize thermal expansion to reduce the chances of glass
        breakage to as rare as possible. However, even in the case of
        glass breakage, due to induced draft and a negative pressure in
        the combustion chamber, the burning charcoal particles would not
        flow out of the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>For a smooth flow of combustion air from the front glass to the
        wall of the combustion chamber, the ring duct air distributor
        was designed by calculating the permissible pressure drop in the
        ring duct air distributor and by assuming the total air flow
        rate as well as the number of orifices and orifice diameter. The
        ring duct air distributor was designed so that the air velocity
        through each orifice was same for all orifices. </p>
      <p>To prevent the combustion air from completely bypassing the
        rotating combustion chamber to the annulus between the rotating
        and the stationary part of the combustion chamber, the rotating
        combustion chamber had a circular flange of length 15 mm on the
        front side facing the ring duct air distributor with 5 mm inside
        the rotating part and 10 mm outside in the annulus region. The
        flange on the rotating combustion chamber acted as a barrier and
        a jet of sealing air was introduced through the orifices of
        smaller diameter to the outer flange of the rotating combustion
        chamber. The sealing air flows through the 0.6 mm gap partly
        inward into the combustion chamber and partly outward through
        the annulus region between the flange of the rotating combustion
        chamber and the stationary part of the outer chamber, thus
        preventing the combustion air from bypassing the rotating
        combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>The sealing air orifice density per distributor area was
        adjusted so that the air velocity from the gap mentioned above
        was greater than the terminal velocity of charcoal particles
        only for the orifices in the bottom half of the combustion
        chamber to avoid the charcoal particles falling down/out of the
        combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>The ring duct air distributor thus designed had 100 orifices of
        1.6 mm diameter for sealing air and 16, 7.4 mm Ã— 5 mm slits for
        combustion air injection. To prevent vortex formation due to the
        sudden change in air velocity from the orifices as air entered
        the combustion chamber, a part of the combustion air was
        injected through 36, 4.7 mm diameter orifices, placed at the
        bottom and inclined at a 45Â° angle as shown in Figure 4. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4. Optical photograph of circular combustion air
          inlet distributor.</b> </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3.4&nbsp; Automatic Charcoal Ignition System
            Design</font></b> </p>
      <p>The distance between the outlet nozzle of electrically heated
        air and the bed surface should be close enough to ignite the
        charcoal particles effectively and at the same time should be
        far enough not to blow off the charcoal bed. The temperature and
        velocity of the heated air from the nozzle were about 470 Â°C
        and 0.66 m/s, respectively. The minimum distance to not blow off
        the charcoal particles for this condition was experimentally
        obtained as 20 mm for fast ignition of charcoal particles. </p>
      <p>For test runs of ignition system, 6 g of charcoal was fed into
        the combustion chamber and then ignited by preheated air flowing
        through a 350 W air heater as shown in Figure 5a.The ignition
        time of charcoal particles in the bed was determined by placing
        a K-type thermocouple in the charcoal bed and measuring the
        temperature at a frequency of 1 Hz. A steep rise in d<i>T</i>/d<i>t</i>
        of the charcoal bed temperature indicated the time of ignition.
        Figure 5b shows the ignition times of charcoal in the bed for
        varying ignition air flow and the distance between the air
        heater nozzle and the bed. From the plot it can be seen that, as
        the ignition air velocity was increased, the time for ignition
        of charcoal reduced. However, the rate of increase of air
        velocity was possible only to a limiting value, beyond which the
        charcoal bed dispersed, which inhibited fast charcoal ignition.
        From these tests an optimum value of ignition air flow rate and
        the distance between the ignition air heater nozzle and the
        charcoal bed were determined. </p>

      <p>A prototype 6 kW charcoal combustion heater of 560 mm width,
        360 mm breadth, and 800 mm height was manufactured (Figure 6)
        based on the design concepts and parameters established above. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 6. Process flow schematic of charcoal combustion
          heater.</b> </p>
      <p>The charcoal combustion heater consisted of a TBCF combustion
        chamber, which was fabricated from a punched 1 mm thick SUS304
        plate to form a horizontal cylinder of 200 mm i.d. and 100 mm
        length and had an outer circular flange on the front side of 15
        mm length. The combustion chamber was coupled to a gear assembly
        and rotated by a 15 W single phase induction motor. The inner
        curved surface of the TBCF combustion chamber was covered with
        the ceramic fiber mesh to form the penetrable wall. </p>
      <p>The TBCF combustion chamber was housed in a stationary cylinder
        fabricated from 1 mm thick SUS304 plate of 270 mm i.d. and 110
        mm length. The front portion of this stationary cylinder was
        sealed by a Tempax glass plate of 196 mm diameter and 3 mm
        thickness. The glass plate was housed in the ring duct air
        distributor acting as a flange for connecting the glass plate to
        the stationary cylinder. The combustion air was injected in the
        combustion chamber through the ring duct air distributor by an
        induced draft with the aid of a 50 W radial fan type air blower
        of 250 L/min design capacity. </p>
      <p>The gases from the combustion chamber flowed through the
        annular gap between the rotating and the stationary parts of the
        cylindrical combustion chamber to a 40 mm i.d. outlet pipe which
        was connected radially to the stationary cylinder. From the
        outlet pipe the exhaust gases passed through a plate type heat
        exchanger placed on top of the combustion heater, which could be
        used as a hot plate for heating a water kettle or a small pan. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gases after leaving the plate type heat exchanger
        flowed through an alumina-based CO oxidation catalyst (Almite).
        The catalyst was prepared by spray coating of the catalyst
        material on a ribbon heating element (35 W) for quick response
        to the demand. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gases then flowed through another plate type heat
        exchanger for space heating and then into the second-stage CO
        oxidation catalyst (0 W) to oxidize any residual CO in the
        combustion heater exhaust. A double pipe heat exchanger was
        connected in the combustion heater exhaust to preheat the inlet
        combustion air to recover flue gas losses. </p>
      <p>At the center of the rotating chamber were placed an L-shaped&#65533;
        ignition air pipe of 16 mm i.d. connected to a 350 W electrical
        air heater and a charcoal powder feeder nozzle connected to the
        cartridge type powder fuel storage. The powder fuel cartridge
        feeder developed by the author's group(18) was equipped with a
        set of couplers for easy mounting and removal and utilized
        subliminal fluidization of powder fuel using two 4.5 W aquarium
        air pumps for constant metric feeding of charcoal particles. For
        an automated operation of the charcoal combustion heater, the
        charcoal feeding, ignition air heater, catalyst electrification,
        and other sequences of operations were controlled by a
        microprocessor. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">4.2 Heater Performance Monitoring</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>The feeding rate of charcoal particles was measured by
        replacing the fuel cartridge at different time intervals during
        the test run and measuring the change in weight. The combustion
        air flow rate was determined by direct measurement of the air
        volume for a time duration.(19) </p>
      <p>The temperatures at various locations in the combustion heater
        were measured using K-type thermocouples as shown in Figure 6.
        The exhaust gas compositions were measured at two locations: (1)
        before the first-stage CO oxidation catalyst with a flue gas
        analyzer (Testo 350-S); (2) at the combustion heater exhaust
        outlet with a portable gas analyzer (Horiba PG-250). The
        temperature and emission data were recorded in a computer at a
        frequency of 1 Hz with the aid of a data logger. </p>

        chamber after switching on (<i>t</i><sub>o</sub>), for 30 s
        until 6 g of charcoal particles was built up in the combustion
        chamber. </p>
      <p>2. The charcoal particles thus fed were then ignited in about
        300 s by flowing 8 L/min ignition air through the ignition air
        heater. </p>
      <p>3. The combustion air blower was started at 300 s (<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>)
        to attain a TBCF mode of combustion after igniting the charcoal
        particles. </p>
      <p>4. To cover the penetrable wall of the TBCF combustion chamber
        with charcoal particles, a pulse sequence was applied; i.e., the
        charcoal was fed into the combustion chamber for 5 s/min and,
        during the feeding, the combustion chamber was rotated by an
        angle of 22.5Â°. </p>
      <p>5. The combustion chamber completed one complete rotation in
        905 s (<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, 15.08 min) to cover its whole
        curved surface with charcoal particles. </p>
      <p>6. The charcoal feeding rate and the combustion chamber
        rotation (0.75 rpm) were changed from pulse to constant, to
        allow the combustion and the inventory in the combustion chamber
        to stabilize. </p>
      <p>7. The ignition air heater was switched off at 1500 s (<i>t</i><sub>3</sub>,
        25 min). </p>
      <p>8. After 3600 s (<i>t</i><sub>4</sub>) from switching on, the
        combustion heater was switched off and the charcoal feeding was
        stopped. The charcoal inventory in the combustion chamber was
        then burnt out with the aid of combustion air. </p>
      <p>9. The combustion air blower and the combustion chamber
        rotation motor were switched off at 2400 s after switching off
        of the combustion heater (<i>t</i><sub>5</sub>). </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">5.1 Characterization of Charcoal Combustion
            Heater for Wood Charcoal Combustion</font></b> </p>
      <p>The powdered charcoal combustion heater manufactured in the
        present work was operated trouble-free for a continuous period
        of 4 h during demonstrations. However, for characterization
        tests of the charcoal combustion heater, the heater was tested
        experimentally by applying the procedure described in the
        previous section. The characterization of the combustion heater
        was done by identifying the different phases of operation, viz.,
        the ignition phase, the transition phase, the steady-state
        phase, and the extinction phase from times <i>t</i><sub>A</sub>âˆ’<i>t</i><sub>G</sub>,
        from the sequential actions made at times <i>t</i><sub>o</sub>âˆ’<i>t</i><sub>5</sub>
        for the characteristic temperature of the combustion chamber <i>T</i><sub>CC</sub>
        shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7 other thermocouple responses as
        well as gas concentration responses are also presented. All raw
        data sampled at 1 Hz were averaged for every 80 s time period
        because they oscillated with a period of 80 s due to the
        rotation of the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 7. Transient temperature and concentration response
          on varying wood charcoal feeding rate.</b> </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">5.1.1 Transient Temperature Profile of the
            Combustion Heater</font></b> </p>
      <p>The ignition phase begins with the combustion heater switch-on
        at time <i>t</i><sub>o</sub> when the charcoal feeding and the
        blowing of high-temperature ignition air on the charcoal bed are
        started. However, the combustion chamber rotation is not yet
        started at time <i>t</i><sub>o</sub>. The ignition of charcoal
        particles was achieved at time <i>t</i><sub>A</sub>, which was
        identified by the change in rate of increase of T<sub>CC</sub>.
        To ensure ignition of charcoal particles, the ignition air was
        continued until time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, when the combustion
        air was introduced into the combustion chamber to satisfy the
        hydrodynamic condition for the TBCF mode of operation. </p>
      <p>The transition phase begins at time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> with
        the "turn-on" of combustion air and pulse rotation of the
        combustion chamber and pulse feeding of charcoal particles. As
        can be seen in Figure 7 at time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, T<sub>CC</sub>
        initially dropped due to the introduction of cool combustion
        air. The penetrable wall of the combustion chamber was
        eventually covered by charcoal particles through the pulse
        sequence until time <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, when the first full
        revolution of the chamber was completed. From time <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>
        onward, the charcoal particle feeding and the combustion chamber
        rotation were changed from pulse to continuous. The changeover
        of combustion mode from partial to full area in the chamber can
        be identified at time <i>t</i><sub>B</sub> from the change in
        rate of increase of T<sub>CC</sub>. The balance between the
        rates of charcoal feeding and combustion was achieved at time <i>t</i><sub>C</sub>.
        Point C was identified by the intersection of lines drawn for
        constant rate of increase of T<sub>CC</sub> from time <i>t</i><sub>B</sub>
        with the line of a steady T<sub>CC</sub>. </p>
      <p>Slight changes in the temperature of T<sub>CC</sub> after <i>t</i><sub>C</sub>
        in the steady-state phase should be due to some fluctuations in
        the charcoal feeding rate and the change in permeability of
        penetrable ceramic fiber mesh on the wall of the combustion
        chamber. Figure 8 shows the mean steady-state temperature of T<sub>CC</sub>
        averaged over <i>t</i><sub>C</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>D</sub>
        against the charcoal feeding rate, which indicates a possibility
        of automatic temperature control by varying the charcoal feed
        rate. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8. Averaged steady-state temperature in TBCF
          combustion chamber vs wood charcoal feeding rate.</b> </p>
      <p>At time <i>t</i><sub>4</sub> the feeding of charcoal was
        stopped. The effect of this change was reflected from time <i>t</i><sub>D</sub>,
        when T<sub>CC</sub> started reducing rapidly, until time <i>t</i><sub>E</sub>,
        when the rate of decrease of T<sub>CC</sub> ceased for a while.
        From video observation it was clear that, at around time <i>t</i><sub>E</sub>,
        the fraction of charcoal inventory which was not fixed well on
        the penetrable wall of the combustion chamber and rotated freely
        in the combustion chamber was burnt out. Then depending on the
        thickness of the thin bed the charcoal particles burnt out in
        the TBCF mode of combustion, resulting in a pseudosteady-state
        period. Obviously, when the feed rate was higher, the
        pseudosteady state after time <i>t</i><sub>E</sub> was longer.
        At time <i>t</i><sub>F</sub> the inventory of charcoal
        particles in the combustion chamber burnt out, as can be seen by
        the rapid decrease of T<sub>CC</sub>. With no more combustion,
        cooling off takes place rapidly by the air blowing until ambient
        temperature was reached at time <i>t</i><sub>G</sub>. The phase
        of operation from time <i>t</i><sub>D</sub> to time <i>t</i><sub>G</sub>
        was identified as the extinction phase of the combustion heater.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">5.1.2 Transient CO Emissions from the
            Charcoal Combustion Heater</font></b> </p>
      <p>The changes in the combustion rate during the different phases
        of operation can be analyzed by monitoring the CO and CO<sub>2</sub>
        concentrations in the exhaust. With the catalyst presence, the
        heater exhaust CO concentrations do not reflect the actual
        changes in the rate of combustion of charcoal particles.
        However, by following the transient CO concentration response in
        the combustion chamber exhaust gas (cf. CO<sub>CE</sub> in
        Figure 7), the changes in combustion rate can be clearly
        identified for different phases of operation. </p>
      <p>From the point of ignition of charcoal particles at time <i>t</i><sub>A</sub>,
        the CO concentration in the combustion chamber exhaust started
        to increase. However, at around <i>t</i><sub>A</sub> the
        combustion rate was not high due to the low temperature in the
        combustion chamber and the small surface area of the charcoal
        bed for the combustion to take place. </p>
      <p>In the transition phase, CO<sub>CE</sub> increased with the
        increase in total combustion rate. At around time <i>t</i><sub>C</sub>,
        CO<sub>CE</sub> reached a maximum, even higher than the
        steady-state value because of the combustion chamber overheating
        with ignition air which was also turned off at around <i>t</i><sub>C</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>The constant charcoal inventory in the combustion chamber
        caused a steady-state TBCF mode of combustion of charcoal
        particles from time <i>t</i><sub>C</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>D</sub>.
        The CO concentration of the combustion chamber exhaust gas
        during the steady-state phase of operation was less than 1 mol
        %, indicating CO<sub>2</sub> as the primary product of
        combustion. </p>
      <p>In the beginning CO<sub>Exhaust</sub> followed CO<sub>CE</sub>,
        and at around time <i>t</i><sub>C</sub> it also reached a
        maximum and then quickly reduced to almost zero until complete
        extinction. The first increase of CO<sub>Exhaust</sub> was due
        to the insufficient catalyst preheating; this increase can be
        avoided by electrically heating the catalyst to a much higher
        temperature during the ignition phase. However, installing a
        higher heat capacity catalyst would increase the electrical load
        of the combustion heater and correspondingly reduce its energy
        efficiency. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">5.1.3.1 Thermal Efficiency</font></b> </p>
      <p>The thermal efficiency of the charcoal combustion heater was
        obtained by calculating the total heat out from the charcoal
        combustion heater by adding the heat transferred by radiation
        through the front glass of the combustion chamber and the heat
        recovered from the exhaust gas by the heat exchangers provided
        in the downstream of the TBCF combustion chamber. The total
        energy input was calculated by adding the individual electrical
        component's power (i.e., the ignition and the catalyst heaters,
        the blower, the feed pump, and the rotation motor), which
        amounts to roughly 4% of the heat input for the design
        condition, to the heat generated by combustion of charcoal
        during the time of operation. The heat of combustion of charcoal
        was calculated from the elemental composition of charcoal, i.e.,
        mass % C, H, and N (cf. Tables 2 and 3) corresponding to mass
        percent of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively, by
        substituting these values in the ordinary-least-squares (OLS)
        equation of Frieldl et al.(20) given by ** </p>

      <p>Figure 9 shows the thermal efficiency of the charcoal
        combustion heater for different feeding rates of charcoal for
        the overall operation time. From the plot it can be seen that
        the thermal efficiency is highest, 86%, when the charcoal
        combustion heater is operated near the design conditions. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9. Thermal efficiency of charcoal combustion heater
          vs wood charcoal feed rate.</b> </p>
      <p>In these test runs, the air flow rate was not changed while
        changing the charcoal feeding rate. Hence, for a low feeding
        rate of charcoal the thermal efficiency was low, because of the
        high airâˆ’fuel ratio in the combustion chamber. The excess air
        reduced the temperature in the TBCF combustion chamber, thus
        reducing the radiation heat and the efficiency of the combustion
        heater. However, in the case of a charcoal feeding rate greater
        than the design value, the thermal efficiency reduced because of
        a thicker charcoal bed in the combustion chamber, reducing the
        permeability of the penetrable wall, thus reducing the air flow.
        The lower air flow caused poor airâˆ’fuel contact with a higher
        amount of unburnt charcoal, thus reducing the thermal
        efficiency. <br>
        The ash deposited on the ceramic fiber mesh is collected at the
        bottom of the outer chamber after passing through the ceramic
        fiber mesh. However, for a long operating stability, an ash
        cleaning device should be introduced inside the combustion
        chamber so that the permeability of the ceramic fiber mesh can
        be maintained high for a long period, avoiding possible reaction
        with ash at high temperature. </p>

            Heater with Waste Biomass Charcoal</font></b> </p>
      <p>To test the performance of this prototype charcoal combustion
        heater with different kinds of fuels or fuel blends, charcoal
        prepared from different biomass wastes, coffee residue, soybean
        fiber, and pruned apple branches were tested to obtain the
        overall operable efficiency range of the prototype charcoal
        combustion heater. Charcoal prepared from the present biomass
        wastes had low fixed carbon and high volatile content (cf. Table
        3), making the charcoal easier to ignite, but caused flaming
        during the combustion operation. </p>
      <p>The different phases of operation were identified from the
        transient temperature response of the temperature in the
        combustion chamber for the charcoal from biomass wastes in a way
        similar to what was done for wood charcoal. Figure 11 shows the
        overall thermal efficiencies of different charcoal species at
        varying feed rate of charcoal. The thermal efficiency of the
        combustion heater for waste biomass charcoal combustion was
        found to be in the range of 60âˆ’81%, which was slightly lower
        than that for the wood charcoal due to high ash content. The
        thermal efficiency of spent coffee and a blend of spent coffee
        char and soybean fiber char was lower than that of the pruned
        apple branch char mainly because of the low particle density of
        spent coffee char (671.9 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) causing fluctuations
        in the feeding rate of charcoal, which changed the inventory of
        charcoal in the combustion chamber, thus reducing the efficiency
        of the combustion heater. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">6 Conclusions</font></b> </p>
      <p>To develop a solid fuel combustion heater using a sustainable
        source of energy, a novel charcoal combustion heater was
        designed and developed. The combustion of charcoal was conducted
        by feeding powdered charcoal automatically with a cartridge type
        powder feeder into a specially designed TBCF (thin bed
        cross-flow) combustion chamber forming a thin uniform charcoal
        bed to achieve good air and charcoal contact. Charcoal ignition
        in less than 5 min and the shift to a steady state in about
        20âˆ’25 min were achieved by the low charcoal inventory in the
        combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>The TBCF mode of combustion for Japanese oak (<i>Quercus
          serrata</i>) charcoal, with high fixed carbon and low
        volatiles, and the charcoal derived from different waste biomass
        sources, i.e., pruned apple tree branches, spent coffee, and
        soybean fiber, with low fixed carbon content and high volatiles,
        resulted in carbon combustion efficiency as high as 88% in the
        combustion chamber. The high radiation heat transfer using a
        front glass resulted in a thermal efficiency in the range of
        65âˆ’86% for a wood charcoal feed rate of 7âˆ’14.4 g/min. The
        charcoals derived from biomass wastes were tested for the
        charcoal feed rate of 8.5âˆ’12.8 g/min, resulting in a slightly
        lower thermal efficiency in the range of 60âˆ’81% because of
        high ash content. </p>
      <p>The charcoal combustion heater developed in the present work,
        with its fast startup, high efficiency, and possible automated
        control, would open a new era of massive but small-scale biomass
        utilization for a sustainable society. </p>

      <p>In the present calculations for Table 1, we chose Japan as the
        reference country. It should be noted here that the above

      <p><b><font size="+1">Appendix B: Charcoal Particle Combustion in
            a TBCF Mode of Combustion</font></b> </p>
      <p><i>Assumptions:</i> </p>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Charcoal particles are spherical and of median
        particle diameter, which is assumed to be representative for all
        the particles in a particular size range. </p>
      <p>2. Combustion of charcoal particles takes place on the surface,
        without ash layer diffusion (shrinking-core model without ash
        layer diffusion). <br>
        The number of charcoal particles fed into the combustion chamber
        is given by ** where <i>W</i><sub>ch</sub> is the design feed
        rate of charcoal particles in the combustion chamber. The
        combustion of a single particle of charcoal is given by ** where
        ** is the overall rate constant, <i>A</i> is the surface area
        of reacting char, and <i>C</i><sub>O2</sub> is the effective
        concentration of O<sub>2</sub> near the charcoal particle
        surface. ** where ** where <i>Sh</i> is the Sherwood number and
        <i>D</i><sub>O2</sub> is the diffusivity of oxygen in air, <i>k</i><sub>f</sub>
        is the mass transfer rate constant, and <i>k</i><sub>s</sub> is
        the reaction rate constant(21) given by ** <br>
        Substituting eq B1 for a single particle in eq B2 and
        integrating from the outer surface of the particle, i.e., from <i>r</i><sub>ch</sub>
        to the center of the particle, i.e., <i>r</i><sub>ch</sub> = 0,
        which in terms of diameter gives the limits as <i>d</i><sub>ch</sub>
        to <i>d</i><sub>ch</sub>/2, we obtain an expression for burnout
        time of a single charcoal particle, <i>t</i><sub>c</sub>.
        Hence, the number of charcoal particles accumulated in the
        combustion chamber is given by&nbsp; **. The number of charcoal
        particles in a single layer on the wall of the combustion
        chamber is given by&nbsp; ** Hence, the number of layers of
        charcoal particles in the combustion chamber is ** <br>
        <i>n</i><sub>layers</sub> was found to be 4 based on the length
        of the combustion chamber obtained by the hydrodynamic
        condition. Based on <i>n</i><sub>layers</sub>, the effective
        burnout time of charcoal in the bed was determined using the
        concept shown in Figure B1a. By solving for oxygen concentration
        in series for charcoal particles in each layer, the burnout
        times for different layers for a median charcoal particle
        diameter, 180 Î¼m, are plotted in Figure B1b. Since the
        effective burnout time of particles increases with the number of
        layers, it is desirable to keep the bed thin for lower burnout
        times of charcoal particles. </p>
