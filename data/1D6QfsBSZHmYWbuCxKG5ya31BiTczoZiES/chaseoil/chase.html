            microwave method converts used motor oil into fuel</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      That dirty motor oil that comes out of your car or truck engine
      during oil changes could end up in your fuel tank, according to a
      report presented here today at the 241st National Meeting &amp;
      Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). It described
      development of a new process for recycling waste crankcase oil
      into gasoline-like fuel — the first, they said, that uses
      microwaves and has “excellent potential” for going into commercial
      use.<br>
      <br>
      “Transforming used motor oil into gasoline can help solve two
      problems at once,” said study leader Howard Chase, Professor of
      Biochemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge in the
      United Kingdom. “It provides a new use for a waste material that’s
      too-often disposed of improperly, with harm to the environment. In
      addition, it provides a supplemental fuel source for an
      energy-hungry world.”<br>
      <br>
      Estimates suggest that changing the oil in cars and trucks
      produces about 8 billion gallons of used motor oil each year
      around the world. In the United States and some other countries,
      some of that dirty oil is collected and re-refined into new
      lubricating oil or processed and burned in special furnaces to
      heat buildings. Chase noted, however, that such uses are far from
      ideal because of concerns over environmental pollution from
      re-refining oil and burning waste oil. And in many other
      countries, used automotive waste oil is discarded or burned in
      ways that can pollute the environment.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists thus are looking for new uses for that Niagara of waste
      oil, growing in volume as millions of people in China, India, and
      other developing countries acquire cars. Among the most promising
      recycling techniques is pyrolysis, a process that involves heating
      oil at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis
      breaks down the waste oil into a mix of gases, liquids, and a
      small amount of solids. The gases and liquids can then be
      chemically converted into gasoline or diesel fuel. However, the
      current processes heat the oil unevenly, producing gases and
      liquids not easily converted into fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Chase and his research team say the new method overcomes this
      problem and uses their new pyrolysis technology. In lab studies,
      his doctoral students, Su Shiung Lam and Alan Russell, mixed
      samples of waste oil with a highly microwave-absorbent material
      and then heated the mixture with microwaves. The pyrolysis process
      appears to be highly efficient, converting nearly 90 percent of a
      waste oil sample into fuel. So far, the scientists have used the
      process to produce a mixture of conventional gasoline and diesel.<br>
      <br>
      “Our results indicate that a microwave-heated process shows
      exceptional promise as a means for recycling problematic waste oil
      for use as fuel,” Chase and Lam said. “The recovery of valuable
      oils using this process shows advantage over traditional processes
      for oil recycling and suggests excellent potential for scaling the
      process to the commercial level.”<br>

      A continuous method is provided for recycling a metal/organic
      laminate comprising metal, such as aluminium, laminated with an
      organic material, the method comprising: providing a reactor (1)
      comprising a first chamber (2) having a first rotary stirrer (4)
      and a second chamber (3) having a second rotary stirrer (5), each
      chamber (2, 3) containing a bed of particulate microwave absorbing
      material; introducing laminate and additional particulate
      microwave absorbing material into the first chamber (2) via an
      inlet (6); under a reducing or inert atmosphere stirring the
      mixture of particulate microwave absorbing material and laminate
      in the first chamber (2) using the first rotary stirrer (3) and
      applying microwave energy in the first chamber (2) to heat the
      particulate microwave absorbing material to a temperature
      sufficient to pyrolyse organic material in the laminate;
      transferring a portion of the mixture in the first chamber (2) to
      the second chamber (3); stirring the mixture in the second chamber
      (3) using the second rotary stirrer (5) and applying microwave
      energy in the second chamber (3) to heat the particulate microwave
      absorbing material to a temperature sufficient to pyrolyse organic
      material remaining in the laminate, whereby laminate or
      delaminated metal migrates towards and floats on the upper surface
      of the mixture in the second chamber (3), said second rotary
      stirrer (5) rotating in a horizontal plane and being so configured
      as to fluidise the mixture such that the upper surface of the
      fluidised mixture has a radial profile that biases laminate or
      delaminated metal floating on the fluidised mixture to migrate
      radially outwards; transferring a portion of the mixture in the
      second chamber (3) to an exit (7) from the reactor (1); and
      recovering metal from the exit (7). Also provided is a reactor (1)
      for recycling a metal/organic laminate comprising metal, such as
      aluminium, laminated with an organic material.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a reactor and method for recycling
      laminates of metal and organic material, by pyrolysis of the
      organic material in a continuous process.<br>
      <br>
      Aluminum/polymer laminates, formed of one or more layers of
      aluminium foil and one or more layers of organic material, e.g.
      plastic or paper, are commonly used as packaging or container
      materials, for example as cartons, cans or tubes for beverages,
      foodstuffs and other products such as toothpaste, or as blister
      packaging for medicines. Despite certain efforts to recycle
      laminates of this type, most usually end up as waste in landfill
      sites, and there remains a need for a more practical and
      cost-effective large scale method for recycling these types of
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      Bench scale trials reported by the present inventors suggest that
      microwave-induced pyrolysis has potential as an approach to
      recycling of aluminium/polymer laminates. According to this
      approach, a bed of carbon as microwave absorbing material is
      heated using microwave energy in a reactor chamber, and the
      reactor is purged with nitrogen gas. At a temperature of typically
      500 to 600° C., laminate is dropped into and mixed with the carbon
      bed. With continued microwave irradiation of the carbon bed, the
      organic content of the laminate is heated by conduction and
      pyrolyses to gaseous fraction that can be recovered by
      condensation to form an oily or waxy hydrocarbon product, together
      with a non-condensable gaseous fraction. The aluminium liberated
      from the laminate can be separated from the carbon bed by coarse
      sieving, and thus recovered as a solid.<br>
      <br>
      However, there remains a need for an economically viable method
      and reactor for continuously recycling aluminium/polymer and other
      metal/polymer laminates that is operable on a commercial scale.
      The present invention addresses the need for a method and reactor
      that meets these requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a
      continuous method of recycling a metal/organic laminate comprising
      a metal laminated with an organic material, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      providing a reactor comprising a first chamber containing a first
      bed of particulate microwave absorbing material and a first rotary
      stirrer, and a second chamber containing a second bed of
      particulate microwave absorbing material and a second rotary
      stirrer, the second chamber having an exit from the reactor;<br>
      <br>
      introducing laminate and additional particulate microwave
      absorbing material into the first chamber containing the first bed
      of particulate microwave absorbing material;<br>
      <br>
      stirring the particulate microwave absorbing material and laminate
      in the first chamber using the first rotary stirrer and applying
      microwave energy to the mixture of particulate microwave absorbing
      material and laminate in the first chamber to heat the particulate
      microwave absorbing material in the mixture to a temperature
      sufficient to pyrolyse organic material in the laminate;<br>
      <br>
      transferring a portion of the mixture in the first chamber to the
      second chamber containing the second bed of particulate microwave
      absorbing material;<br>
      <br>
      stirring the mixture in the second chamber using the second rotary
      stirrer and applying microwave energy to the mixture in the second
      chamber to heat the particulate microwave absorbing material in
      the mixture to a temperature sufficient to pyrolyse organic
      material remaining in the laminate, whereby laminate or
      delaminated metal migrates towards and floats on the upper surface
      of the mixture in the second chamber, said second rotary stirrer
      rotating in a horizontal plane and being so configured as to
      fluidise the mixture such that the upper surface of the fluidised
      mixture has a radial profile that biases laminate or delaminated
      metal floating on the fluidised mixture to migrate radially
      outwards;<br>
      <br>
      transferring a portion of the mixture in the second chamber to the
      exit from the reactor; and<br>
      <br>
      recovering metal from the exit from the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      In a second aspect, the invention provides a reactor for recycling
      a metal/organic laminate comprising metal laminated with an
      organic material, comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a first chamber containing a first bed of particulate microwave
      absorbing material and a first rotary stirrer;<br>
      <br>
      a second chamber containing a second bed of particulate microwave
      absorbing material and a second rotary stirrer, the second chamber
      having an exit from the reactor; means for introducing laminate
      and additional particulate microwave absorbing material into the
      first chamber containing the first bed of particulate microwave
      absorbing material;<br>
      <br>
      means for transferring a portion of the mixture in the first
      chamber to the second chamber containing the second bed of
      particulate microwave absorbing material; means for applying
      microwave energy to the mixture of particulate microwave absorbing
      material and laminate in the first and second chambers to heat the
      particulate microwave absorbing material in the mixture to a
      temperature sufficient to pyrolyse organic material in the
      laminate;<br>
      <br>
      means for transferring a portion of the mixture in the second
      chamber to the exit from the reactor; and<br>
      <br>
      means for recovering metal from the exit from the reactor,<br>
      <br>
      wherein said second rotary stirrer rotates in a horizontal plane
      and is so configured as to fluidise the mixture such that the
      upper surface of the fluidised mixture has a radial profile that
      biases laminate or delaminated metal floating on the fluidised
      mixture to migrate radially outwards.<br>
      <br>
      By the term ‘metal/organic laminate’ as referred to herein is
      meant any laminates that comprise a layer or film of metal
      laminated wholly or partially to an organic material. The metal
      may be any metal that has a melting or boiling point higher than
      the pyrolysis temperature used in the reactor, for example
      aluminium or iron, preferably aluminium. The organic material may
      be any polymeric material that is pyrolysable under the
      temperatures used in the reactor, for example synthetic polymer
      materials (such as thermosetting or plastics materials), paper or
      cardboard, or other hydrocarbon-based polymeric material. The
      laminate may additionally include components that are not metal or
      pyrolysable organic material, such as glass fibres or inert
      fillers, for example the laminate may comprises glass fibre
      reinforced materials such as fibreglass. Thus, the term
      ‘metal/organic laminate’ is used herein to include such laminates
      as are commonly used as packaging for food, drinks and medicines,
      e.g. for Tetrapak® containers, beverage cans, food tins or
      pharmaceutical blister packages, or for other consumer products
      such as toothpaste.<br>
      <br>
      The reactor preferably has only two reaction chambers, which are
      interconnected so that a portion of the mixture in the first
      chamber is transferred directly to the second chamber through the
      action of the rotary stirrers in the first and second chambers.
      However, if desired, one or more additional, interconnected
      chambers can be included in the reactor, intermediate the first
      and second chambers. In the case that one or more additional
      reactor chambers are included, each additional chamber contains a
      bed of particulate microwave absorbing material independently
      stirred by a rotary stirrer. Thus, a portion of the mixture in the
      first chamber would be transferred to the adjoining additional
      chamber, and a portion of the mixture in that additional chamber
      would be transferred to the next additional chamber or, if the
      next chamber is the second chamber, would be transferred to the
      second chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The reactor chambers are preferably cylindrical, and co-axial with
      their respective rotary stirrers rotating about a vertical axis of
      rotation. If made from a square or rectangular reactor
      construction, the corners of each chamber are preferably provided
      with pieces of microwave-transparent material shaped to assist the
      stirring movement of the bed in order to avoid dead zones.<br>
      <br>
      An inlet feed for the introduction of laminate into the first
      reactor chamber and an exit from the second reactor chamber are
      provided for the reactor. Gas inlet and exit pipes for the
      introduction and removal of gas providing an inert or reducing
      atmosphere, and of gases generated through pyrolysis of the
      laminate are also provided for the reactor. The feed and exit
      pipes preferably can be isolated from the internal reactor
      conditions by suitable shut-off or valve means, for example using
      lock-hopper systems or double-flap valves.<br>
      <br>
      The beds in the chambers are formed of particulate microwave
      absorbing material, i.e. a material that can absorb microwave
      energy and thus become heated to a temperature that is sufficient
      to pyrolyse the organic material present in the laminate when the
      laminate is mixed with the bed of material. The heat of the
      particulate microwave absorbing material is thus conducted to the
      laminate through intimate contact with the particles or powder of
      the microwave absorbing material. Suitable microwave absorbing
      materials include carbon black, activated carbon, certain metal
      oxides such as some iron oxide, and certain other compounds such
      as silicon carbide. Preferred as microwave absorbing materials are
      carbon black powder and activated carbon powder.<br>
      <br>
      In order to irradiate the beds of microwave absorbing material in
      the reactor chambers, the reactor has one or more microwave guides
      disposed around the respective chambers. The microwave guides are
      preferably isolated from the reactor conditions, for example by a
      quartz window in the reactor wall, in known manner. Any suitable
      microwave source and guide arrangement can be used. The
      application of microwaves to the beds should be controlled so as
      to ensure that the beds attain and maintain a temperature at which
      the organic material is pyrolysed. Preferably, microwaves are
      applied such that the particulate microwave absorbing material in
      the beds is heated to a temperature in the range from 250 to 700°
      C., more preferably in the range from 500 to 600° C. If desired,
      the temperature can be varied over time within these ranges. Each
      bed within the first, second and any additional chambers can be
      heated to the same or different temperatures within these ranges.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, auxiliary heating means can be used to preheat the
      beds of particulate microwave absorbing material, before or after
      the laminate is introduced into the reactor, for example by
      combusting fuel inside the reactor, or by electric heating means
      in the reactor walls. Preferably, microwaves are the sole heating
      means for the beds.<br>
      <br>
      Before the beds are heated to the pyrolysing temperature, the
      reactor is purged with an inert or reducing gas, and thereafter
      the process is carried out under pyrolysing conditions under an
      inert or reducing atmosphere, in order to prevent or minimise
      combustion of the organic compounds present in the laminate.
      Suitable inert or reducing gases include nitrogen, argon, helium,
      steam or hydrogen. Preferably, the gas used to purge the reactor
      and maintain an inert or reducing atmosphere is nitrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate is fed into the first chamber by appropriate feed
      means through an inlet into the first chamber, and is stirred into
      and mixed with the bed of microwave absorbing material through the
      action of a rotary stirrer in the first chamber. Intimate contact
      between the particles of microwave absorbing material and the
      laminate ensures efficient transfer of heat to the organic
      material over all surfaces. If desired or necessary, the laminate
      is cut or shredded to an appropriate size according to the size of
      the equipment, for example to provide laminate pieces having an
      area in the range from 0.25 to 25 cm&lt;2&gt;, before entering the
      reactor. The feed rate of laminate into the reactor is preferably
      controlled, for example to provide a microwave absorbing material
      to laminate weight ratio within each chamber in the range from 1:1
      to 50:1, preferably in the range from 5:1 to 10:1.<br>
      <br>
      In the continuous process of the invention, additional particulate
      microwave absorbing material is preferably introduced into the
      first reactor chamber in order to provide a relative excess of
      microwave absorbing material in the first chamber compared with
      the next adjoining chamber, which excess will replenish a
      corresponding amount of microwave absorbing material exiting the
      reactor from the second chamber. Thus, after a period of stirring,
      a portion of the mixture of laminate and microwave absorbing
      material in the first chamber will flow into and be transferred to
      the next adjoining chamber. The laminate is preferably introduced
      together with the additional particulate microwave absorbing
      material. More preferably, the additional particulate microwave
      absorbing material is mixed with the laminate before entering the
      reactor. The additional particulate material introduced into the
      first reactor chamber preferably has been recycled from the exit
      from the reactor, after being separated from the metal exiting the
      reactor. The additional particulate microwave absorbing material
      or the laminate, or both, can be preheated before entering the
      reactor, for example using hot air or other suitable heating
      means.<br>
      <br>
      When the laminate reaches the process temperature, through heat
      conduction from the particles of microwave absorbing material,
      pyrolytic reactions occur, whereby polymers and other organic
      compounds present in the laminate degrade to gaseous compounds.
      The gaseous compounds, which may include condensable and
      non-condensable gases, exit the reactor through one or more gas
      exit pipes, and any condensable oases may be condensed to an oily
      or waxy condensate for recycling, or may be combusted, with any
      non-condensable gases present, to generate heat or mechanical
      work.<br>
      <br>
      Through the action of the rotary stirrers, the beds are fluidised,
      and the laminate or delaminated metal migrates towards the top
      surface of the beds due to its relative lower density compared
      with that of the fluidised bed material. The reactor chambers are
      interconnected so that the paths of the rotary stirrers overlap to
      some degree. The overlapping flows of the fluidised beds in
      adjoining chambers, created by the actions of the respective
      rotary stirrers through their overlapping paths, causes a portion
      of the bed in one chamber to be transferred to the bed in the next
      chamber, for example from the first chamber to the second chamber
      in a two-chamber reactor. Thus, over time, the laminate introduced
      into the first chamber is transferred through the first and
      second, and any intermediate, chambers to the exit from the
      reactor. At the same time, in at least the second (i.e. final)
      chamber the laminate and delaminated metal migrates towards the
      top surface of the bed, and may float on top of the bed. The
      delaminated metal is thus concentrated at the top of the bed in
      the second chamber, and can be recovered from the reactor in
      relatively high concentration with respect to the particulate
      microwave absorbing material. After exiting the reactor, the
      delaminated metal, preferably aluminium, is separated from the
      particulate microwave absorbing material that exits with it, and
      is thus recoverable in substantially pure form as metal pieces or
      foil. The metal can be separated from the exited particulate
      microwave absorbing material using suitable separation techniques,
      preferably by sieving. The particulate microwave absorbing
      material separated from the metal is preferably recycled to the
      first reactor chamber, optionally after subjecting to preheating
      or mixing with unprocessed laminate, or both.<br>
      <br>
      Since the delaminated metal in the second chamber is concentrated
      at the top of the bed, preferably the exit from the reactor is
      through a sidewall of the second chamber, and the exit has a
      bottom surface disposed at a height at or close to the level of
      the top of the bed in said chamber, such that the metal, and
      optionally a portion of the particulate microwave absorbing
      material, exits when its level exceeds the height of said bottom
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      The rotary stirrers in the reactor chambers preferably rotate in
      the same rotation direction, and at the same rotary frequency.
      Preferably, the stirrers rotate at a rate in the range from 2 to
      60 revolutions per minute (rpm), for example 5 to 20 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      The rotary stirrers in each respective chamber may have mutually
      different configurations. For example, the stirrer in the first
      chamber is preferably configured to thoroughly mix the introduced
      laminate with the particles of the first bed. The stirrer of the
      second chamber is preferably configured to fluidize the second bed
      in such a way that the delaminated metal tends to migrate upwards
      towards the top of the bed.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the rotary stirrer in the first chamber is configured
      as a horizontally extending blade rotating about a vertical axis,
      in which the upper edge or upper surface of the blade is
      horizontal so that the peripheral part of the blade is at the same
      level as the axial part. The blade may be single arm (i.e. with
      the axial part at one extremity of the blade and the peripheral
      part at the other extremity of the blade) or may be double arm
      (i.e. with the axial part at the midpoint of the blade and
      peripheral parts at the extremities of the blade), and is
      preferably double arm.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the rotary stirrer in the second chamber is configured
      as a horizontally extending blade rotating about a vertical axis,
      the upper edge or upper surface of the blade sloping down from the
      axial part of the blade, which is preferably at the midpoint of
      the blade, towards the peripheral part of the blade, so that the
      upper edge or surface of the peripheral part of the blade is at a
      lower level than the axial part. The blade may be single arm or
      may be double arm, and preferably is double arm. For example, the
      rotary stirrer in the second chamber may be configured as a
      trapezoidal or triangular blade, preferably a trapezoidal blade,
      rotating about its midpoint.<br>
      <br>
      Since the rotary stirrers of adjacent reactor chambers describe
      overlapping pathways, particulate microwave absorbing material and
      laminate swept by the blade of the rotary stirrer of the first
      chamber into the overlapping path of the rotary stirrer of the
      second (or intermediate) chamber will be swept out of the portion
      of overlap by the next sweep of the blade of the rotary stirrer of
      the second (or intermediate) chamber. It will be appreciated that
      the respective blades of adjacent reactor chambers must not be
      aligned, so as to prevent collision. Preferably, the blades of the
      rotary stirrers of adjacent chambers are misaligned by an angle of
      90 degrees.<br>

      The invention will be further illustrated by the drawings and
      their description, in which:<br>

      In FIGS. 1 to 3, reactor 1 has a first cylindrical chamber 2
      containing a first bed of carbon black powder and a second
      cylindrical chamber 3 containing a second bed of carbon black
      powder. Chambers 2 and 3 are adjoining and interconnected, and
      contain rotary stirrers 4 and 5, respectively. Stirrers 4 and 5
      rotate though overlapping paths. A nitrogen purge is passed
      through the reactor 1 and maintained as reducing atmosphere
      (nitrogen inlet and outlet pipes not shown). Microwave energy is
      introduced into chambers 2 and 3 (guides not shown) to heat first
      and second beds to pyrolysing temperature. Gaseous pyrolysis
      products exit the reactor (pipes not shown) Laminate and
      additional carbon black powder is introduced by inlet 6 into
      chamber 2 and mixed into the first bed through the action of
      stirrer 4. A portion of the mixture passes into the second bed in
      chamber 3. Delaminated aluminium exits reactor 1 through exit 7
      from chamber 3 together with some carbon black powder, and is
      separated from the exited carbon black powder. The separated
      carbon black powder is recycled to inlet 6.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may be further illustrated by reference to the
      following non-limiting example:<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL METHOD</b><br>
      <br>
      A reactor, for example a two-chamber reactor as shout in FIGS. 1
      to 3, is operated continuously as follows:<br>
      <br>
      In the reactor, all of the chambers present (preferably two) are
      filled with particulate microwave absorbent material (preferably
      carbon) up to the level of the exit in the last chamber Once the
      chambers have been filled with the microwave absorbent, the motor
      or motors that drive the rotary stirrers in all the chambers are
      switched on.<br>
      <br>
      The system is checked to ensure that all the connections are in
      place and that the equipment is sealed. At this stage, a small
      flow of nitrogen or other inert gas is allowed to flow through the
      reactor in order to purge out the oxygen from within the reaction
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      The microwave sources (magnetrons) are switched on. The microwave
      absorbent material starts to heat up due to the action of the
      microwaves. The temperature of the microwave absorbent is
      continuously monitored, and preferably input to a computer running
      a control program, connected to the magnetrons so as to control
      the heating rate and the temperature of the microwave absorbent
      inside the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Once a desired reaction temperature has been reached, the laminate
      is fed to the first reaction chamber through the feed pipe.
      Alternatively, some laminate materials could have been fed to the
      reactor before the desired temperature had been achieved.
      Preferably) the laminate would have previously been cut into
      pieces of appropriate size according to the size of the equipment,
      for example so that the size of the pieces of laminate entering
      the reactor is 0.25-25 cm&lt;2&gt;. The laminate is fed using
      double gate valves, combinations of pistons and screw conveyors or
      any other similar means in order to maintain the interior of the
      reaction chambers free of oxygen. The microwave absorbent to
      laminate ratio within each chamber can vary between 1:1 and 50:1,
      preferably the ratio is 5:1 to 10:1, by weight.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate start to pyrolyse and gases exit from the reactor
      through pipes connected to the reactor. The gases can be condensed
      and/or collected for their subsequent use. Alternatively the gases
      could be burnt immediately to produce either heat or electricity
      by appropriate means. The laminate, or clean aluminum once
      pyrolysis has been achieved, migrates from the first to any
      subsequent chamber and finds its way to the exit. The clean
      aluminium leaves the reactor via a double gate valve, a
      combination of a pistons and screw conveyors or any other similar
      means that prevents oxygen from entering the reactor. As clean
      aluminum continuously exits from the final chamber, fresh laminate
      is added to the first chamber along with any additional microwave
      absorbent needed to “top-up” the reactor.<br>
