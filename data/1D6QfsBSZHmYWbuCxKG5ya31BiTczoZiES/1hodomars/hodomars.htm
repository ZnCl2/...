            Tesla was conducting experiments with his Magnifying
            Transmitter at Colorado Springs in 1899, he detected
            coherent signals which he determined had originated on Mars.
            Tesla was widely criticized for his astounding claims, yet
            no one could seriously dispute him, for he was a solo
            pioneer without peer. No one since then has reported
            constructing a Magnifying Transmitter or otherwise
            replicated his experiment, so the issue remains unresolved
            and the mystery unsolved. Tesla revealed no technical
            details in his pronouncements and publications of that
            period, other than the pertinent patents. His Colorado
            Springs notebooks were published in the 1980s, but they make

            I was improving my machines for the production of intense
            electrical actions, I was also perfecting the means for
            observing feeble effects. One of the most interesting
            results, and also one of great practical importance, was the
            development of certain contrivances for indicating at a

            in carrying on this work that for the first time I
            discovered those mysterious effects which have elicited such
            unusual interest. I had perfected the apparatus referred to
            so far that from my laboratory in the Colorado mountains I
            could feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting every

            never forget the first sensations I experienced when it
            dawned upon me that I had observed something possibly of
            incalculable consequences to mankind. I felt as though I
            were present at the birth of a new knowledge or the
            revelation of a great truth. My first observations
            positively terrified me, as there was present in them
            something mysterious, not to say supernatural, and I was
            alone in my laboratory at night; but at that time the idea
            of these disturbances being intelligently controlled signal
            did not yet present itself to me. The changes I noted were
            taking place periodically and with such a clear suggestion
            of number and order that they were not traceable to any
            cause known to me. I was familiar, of course, with such
            electrical disturbances as are produced by the sun, Aurora
            Borealis and earth currents, and I was as sure as I could be
            of any fact that these variations were due to none of these
            causes. The nature of my experiments precluded the
            possibility of the changes being produced by atmospheric
            disturbances, as has been rashly asserted by some. It was
            sometime afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind
            that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an
            intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their
            meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having
            been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing
            in me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one
            planet to another. A purpose was behind these electrical
            signals!"</font> </p>

            years later, Arthur Matthews claimed that Tesla had secretly
            developed the "Teslascope" for the purpose of communicating
            with Mars. Dr. Andrija Puharich met with Matthews and
            discussed the matter with him in an interview which was
            published in the <i>Pyramid Guide</i>:</font> </p>

            assistant to the noted physicist Lord Kelvin back in the
            1890s. Tesla came over to England to meet Kelvin to convince
            him that alternating current was more efficient than direct
            current. Kelvin at that time opposed the AC movement. In
            1902, the Matthews family left England and immigrated to
            Canada. When Matthew's was 16 his father arranged for him to
            apprentice under Tesla. He eventually worked for him and
            continued this alliance until Tesla's death in 1943.</font>

            Springs transmitters and the unfinished one on Long Island.

advantage













            of a possible gravitational technique for SETI over the
            radio technique is primarily one of time of 'propagation'
            for these signals. The radio waves travel at the speed of
            light, but the gravitational signals (per the writer's
            theories) are essentially instantaneous signals. Another
            advantage of the gravitational technique is the simplicity
            of the instrumentation required. As SARA members know, radio
            astronomy can be quite complicated. The gravitational wave
            detectors must rely largely on the Earth's mass as a
            'shadow' to enable the detection of gravitational radiation.
            Therefore, 'objects' or signals located in the observers'
            zenith are best detected. Yet, the other areas are still
            'detectable' especially with the aid of other 'shadows' such

            and Perseus of our Galaxy. These 'signals' have been 'heard'
            by the writer for several years now, and generally range
            between about 4 and 5 hours right ascension, with a peak
            intensity near 4.5 hours R.A. The signals appear to be

        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Since
about













            early August 1988, it was noticed that apparently
            'intelligent signals' existed in these modulations [of the
            microwave background radiation]. It can be said that the
            intelligence was in the form of digital-type communication,
            e.g., dots and dashes, or ones and zeros. This type of
            communication may have been chosen by this 'unknown
            communicator' as if it was conducive to the 'mass movement'
            form of longitudinal gravity signaling, as well as an easily
            recognizable universal system. This same method was proposed
            by the writer for a gravity system communication method.</font>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"These
'signals'













            were noticed to be similar to the simpler International
            Morse Code symbols, primarily because they are the simplest
            way to present information in the pulse form. Thus, the
            'letters' found in these transmissions are typically: E, I,
            T, M, A, N, R, K, S, and O, as well as the comma and the
            wait signal. However, the numbers are seen here as the
            simple series of pulses, e.g., 1 is one pulse, 2 is two
            pulses, 3 is three pulses, and so on.</font> </p>

August













            26, 1988, after the writer had sent the message <u>Greg
              Radio</u> during a local gravity signal transmission test,
            it was noticed that the letters G and D were apparently
            added to some of the received messages noted thereafter!</font>

writer's













            first hard evidence that the above test message may have
            been intercepted by this unknown communicator was seen that
            on August 28, 1988, a strong and repeated message of the <u>Greg













              Radio</u> was received with the message finally terminated
            with the series SE (or 31)!</font> </p>

evidence













            that these may be actually communication attempts is seen in
            that on October 11, 1988, a very different approach was
            seen: A series of <u>Greg Radio</u>'s was sent at about the
            normal code speed of about 5 words per minute, followed by
            KKTT, and then the series was repeated at a slower speed and

confirmation













            that these may be 'messages' appeared on October 12, 1988…
            Here, a series of A's and R's (with <u>Greg Radio</u>
            occasionally inserted) was then followed by <u>Greg Radio</u>
            sent as a series of <u>five repetitions of each letter</u>,

'messages'













            have now been received to indicate that perhaps a serious
            attempt to contact this writer was being made by some
            'unknown communicator'. While this communicator may yet be
            some terrestrial experimenter, the possibility still exists
            that the communicator may be 'extraterrestrial' for the
            following reasons:</font> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"a.
The













            messages are in simple code (e.g., dits and dahs) type of
            pulses which would be expected to be used if one intelligent
            civilization were to try to contact another civilization in
            terms of pulses. That some of the simplest pulse signals are
            similar to simple Morse Code signals is more than
            coincidence --- they are both based on the same premises!</font>

            simple sequence, using short pulses or dits.</font> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"c.
The













            'communicator' has recognized the coherent nature of <u>Greg












              Radio</u> and is possibly using that sequence of codes in
            various fashions to indicate that a 'contact' has been made.</font>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"d.
The













            communicator thus far has not responded to 'word' messages
            or the amateur Q-code signals. Thus it is believed that
            while some apparently Morse Code signals are being used, the
            communicator is not really familiar with such usage, other
            than recognizing the coherent nature of the signals.</font>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"e.
Since













            these messages at present appear largely near the noon hour,
            they may be coming from a definite source in space. At
            present, it is believed to be from the general direction of
            the constellation, Andromeda, but not necessarily the Galaxy
            there</font> </p>

is













            also some possibility that this communicator may be
            'extraterrestrial', perhaps yet in our Solar System (Mars?),
            but no further than our own Galaxy or Local Group of
            Galaxies. Some communicator may have been trying to reach
            here ever since the turn of the century when Nikola Tesla

            recently suspected by the writer due to the apparently very
            close tracking of my position on Earth by ET. ET, of course,
            always knew that I was on Earth(as seen by his tracking),
            but now he has most emphatically confirmed that he is on the

            advanced than we are here on Earth, and he may have even

            hostile now that ET must have developed a very sophisticated
            underground civilization which is not conducive to EM

            but ET came back with <u>ten</u> planets, calling the 10th
            planet OOTTAEERR! When questioned on this, ET kept on
            confirming the existence of a 10th planet! He now knows the
            other nine planets by their Earth names! He also confirmed

              color="#000000">Sometime later, Greg Hodowanec announced
              that he had been fooled by a disincarnate entity (Michael
              Faraday). I do not believe that. Greg Hodowanec was a very
              careful experimenter, and well aware of the psychic
              aspects of his GW Detector circuits (as mentioned
              elsewhere in his writings). Even if that were so, then the
              Hodowanec G-Wave Detectors open a new door to the "astral
              plane" or "parallel worlds". Some "alien" entities are
              known to utilize such interdimensional methods for
              communication and travel. In any case, here is the
              information I have. Now it is up to you…</font></font> <br>
