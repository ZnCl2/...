        <p><b><font size="+1">Electric Pulses for Destroying Cancer
              Cells</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A team of biomedical engineers at Virginia Tech and the
        University of California at Berkeley has developed a new
        minimally invasive method of treating cancer, and they
        anticipate clinical trials on individuals with prostate cancer
        will begin soon. </p>
      <p>The process, called irreversible electroporation (IRE), was
        invented by two engineers, Rafael V. Davalos, a faculty member
        of the Virginia Tech--Wake Forest University School of
        Biomedical Engineering and Science (SBES), and Boris Rubinsky, a
        bioengineering professor at the University of California,
        Berkeley, Eurekalert said. </p>
      <p>Electroporation is a phenomenon known for decades that
        increases the permeability of a cell from none to a reversible
        opening to an irreversible opening. With the latter, the cell
        will die. What Davalos and Rubinsky did was apply this
        irreversible concept to the targeting of cancer cells. </p>
      <p>“IRE removes tumors by irreversibly opening tumor cells through
        a series of short intense electric pulses from small electrodes
        placed in or around the body,“ said Davalos, who is the 2006
        recipient of the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Award
        for Most Promising Engineer or Scientist. “This application
        creates permanent openings in the pores in the cells of the
        undesirable tissue. The openings eventually lead to the death of
        the cells without the use of potentially harmful
        chemotherapeutic drugs.“ </p>
      <p>The researchers successfully ablated tissue using the IRE
        pulses in the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats. “We did not
        use any drugs, the cells were destroyed, and the vessel
        architecture was preserved,“ Davalos said. This work was
        completed with three additional colleagues, Lluis Mir, director
        of the Laboratory of Vectorology and Gene Transfer Research of
        the Institut Gustave Roussy, the leading cancer research center
        in Europe, and of the Centre National de la Recherche
        Scientifique (CNRS); Liana Horowitz, a visiting scientist at
        UC-Berkeley; and Jon F. Edd, a doctoral candidate at
        UC-Berkeley. They reported the in vivo experiments in the June
        2006 IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. </p>
      <p>Oncologists already use a variety of methods to destroy tumors
        using heat or freezing processes, but these current techniques
        can damage healthy tissue or leave malignant cells. The
        difference with IRE is Davalos and Rubinsky were able to adjust
        the electrical current and reliably kill the targeted cells.
        “The reliable killing of a targeted area with cellular scale
        resolution without affecting surrounding tissue or nearby blood
        vessels is key,“ Davalos said. </p>
      <p>At Virginia Tech, Davalos directs the interdisciplinary
        Bioelectromechanical Systems Laboratory, part of the
        university’s Institute for Critical Technology and Applied
        Science (ICTAS), of which SBES is a core member. </p>

        <p><b>By ED SUSMAN</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., July. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. researchers said
        Monday that focused electric pulses can puncture holes into
        cancer cells, killing those cells without using extremes of heat
        or cold that can damage other tissues. </p>
      <p>In laboratory experiments, a one-minute test utilizing
        irreversible electroporation destroyed 92 percent of tumors in
        mice, said Rafael Davalos, assistant professor of biomedical
        engineering at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. </p>
      <p>"The key to this is that it is relatively simple to perform in
        places such as community hospitals or in resource-limited
        setting," Davalos told United Press International. </p>
      <p>"We have already completed laboratory experiments in the test
        tube and in animals," he said. "We expect to begin human trials
        with this process within a year." </p>
      <p>In the treatment, small, needle-like electrodes are positioned
        around the tumors and electric micropulses are fired. The
        electric charges open holes in the cell membranes, some of which
        do not close and cannot be repaired by the cell. These holes are
        fatal to the cell. </p>
      <p>"We cannot distinguish individual cells," said Davalos, "so
        some healthy cells within the field of attack would also be
        killed." But because the system does not heat up cells or
        freeze, there is no "bystander effect" in which cells outside
        the field are killed, he said. "This application creates
        permanent openings in the pores in the cells of the undesirable
        tissue. The openings eventually lead to the death of the cells."
      </p>
      <p>"We were actually quite surprised to find the effectiveness of
        the system in our animal experiments," Davalos said. He said the
        efficiency in killing the cells was unexpected because in some
        cells the electric pulses do not cause enough damage to fatally
        injure the cancer cells -- especially the cells on the periphery
        of the target. </p>
      <p>The researchers successfully destroyed tissue using the
        electroporation pulses in the livers of male rats. "We did not
        use any drugs, the cells were destroyed, and the vessel
        architecture was preserved," Davalos said. He describes his work
        in the special August issue of Technology in Cancer Research and
        Treatment. </p>
      <p>The research by Davalos flows from previous attempts to use
        electroporation to temporarily open holes in cancer cells. The
        electric pulses would then be used to drive chemotherapy drugs
        into the cells to kill them. Davalos said that his system could
        also be combined with the drugs to kill more targeted cells. </p>
      <p>"This seems like an exciting new process to kill cancer cells,"
        said Dr. Douglas Scherr, clinical director of urologic oncology
        at the Weill Medical School of Cornell University, New York.
        "The key is imaging, especially in treating prostate cancer. The
        most difficult part of prostate cancer treatment is killing the
        microscopic cancers in the prostate without damaging healthy
        tissue or other anatomical structures." </p>
      <p>Scherr suggested that the irreversible electroporation would
        prove more effective in treating tumors such as breast cancer,
        kidney cancer or brain cancer where the malignancies can be more
        easily imaged. He said that work at Weill is under way in
        developing more accurate imaging so that only the tumors would
        be impacted. </p>
      <p>"The lack of a bystander effect with the electroporation could
        prove to be an advantage of that type of system," he told UPI. </p>
      <p>Davalos and colleagues are working with the National Institutes
        of Health to use the irreversible electroporation device in
        brain cancer patients. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A new method for the ablation of
        undesirable tissue such as cells of a cancerous or non-cancerous
        tumor is disclosed. It involves the placement of electrodes into
        or near the vicinity of the undesirable tissue through the
        application of electrical pulses causing irreversible
        electroporation of the cells throughout the entire area of the
        undesirable tissue. The electric pulses irreversibly permeate
        the cell membranes, thereby invoking cell death. The
        irreversibly permeabilized cells are left in situ and are
        removed by the body immune system. The amount of tissue ablation
        achievable through the use of irreversible electroporation
        without inducing thermal damage is considerable. </p>

      <p>[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
        Application No. 60/532,588, filed Dec. 24, 2003, which
        application is incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] This invention resides in the fields of electroporation
        of tissue and to treatments whereby tissue is destroyed by
        irreversible electroporation. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] In many medical procedures, such as the treatment of
        benign or malignant tumors, it is important to be able to ablate
        the undesirable tissue in a controlled and focused way without
        affecting the surrounding desirable tissue. Over the years, a
        large number of minimally invasive methods have been developed
        to selectively destroy specific areas of undesirable tissues as
        an alternative to resection surgery. There are a variety of
        techniques with specific advantages and disadvantages, which are
        indicated and contraindicated for various applications. For
        example, cryosurgery is a low temperature minimally invasive
        technique in which tissue is frozen on contact with a cryogen
        cooled probe inserted in the undesirable tissue (Rubinsky, B.,
        ed. Cryosurgery. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. Vol. 2. 2000.
        157-187.). The area affected by low temperature therapies, such
        as cryosurgery, can be easily controlled through imaging.
        However, the probes are large and difficult to use.
        Non-selective chemical ablation is a technique in which chemical
        agents such as ethanol are injected in the undesirable tissue to
        cause ablation (Shiina, S., et al., Percutaneous ethanol
        injection therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: results in
        146patients. AJR, 1993. 160: p. 1023-8). Non-selective chemical
        therapy is easy to apply. However, the affected area cannot be
        controlled because of the local blood flow and transport of the
        chemical species. Elevated temperatures are also used to ablate
        tissue. Focused ultrasound is a high temperature non-invasive
        technique in which the tissue is heated to coagulation using
        high-intensity ultrasound beams focused on the undesirable
        tissue (Lynn, J. G., et al., A new method for the generation of
        use of focused ultrasound in experimental biology. J. Gen
        Physiol., 1942. 26: p. 179-93; Foster, R. S., et al.,
        High-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of prostatic
        disease. Eur. Urol., 1993. 23: p. 44-7). Electrical currents are
        also commonly used to heat tissue. Radiofrequency ablation (RF)
        is a high temperature minimally invasive technique in which an
        active electrode is introduced in the undesirable tissue and a
        high frequency alternating current of up to 500 kHz is used to
        heat the tissue to coagulation (Organ, L. W.,
        Electrophysiological principles of radiofrequency lesion making.
        Appl. Neurophysiol., 1976. 39: p. 69-76). In addition to RF
        heating traditional Joule heating methods with electrodes
        inserted in tissue and dc or ac currents are also common, (Erez,
        A., Shitzer, A. (Controlled destruction and temperature
        distribution in biological tissue subjected to monoactive
        electrocoagulation) J Biomech. Eng. 1980:102(1):42-9).
        Interstitial laser coagulation is a high temperature thermal
        technique in which tumors are slowly heated to temperatures
        exceeding the threshold of protein denaturation using low power
        lasers delivered to the tumors by optical fibers (Bown, S. G.,
        Phototherapy of tumors. World. J. Surgery, 1983. 7: p. 700-9).
        High temperature thermal therapies have the advantage of ease of
        application. The disadvantage is the extent of the treated area
        is difficult to control because blood circulation has a strong
        local effect on the temperature field that develops in the
        tissue. The armamentarium of surgery is enhanced by the
        availability of the large number of minimally invasive surgical
        techniques in existence, each with their own advantages and
        disadvantages and particular applications. This document
        discloses another minimally invasive surgical technique for
        tissue ablation, irreversible electroporation. We will describe
        the technique, evaluate its feasibility through mathematical
        modeling and demonstrate the feasibility with in vivo
        experimental studies. </p>
      <p>[0004] Electroporation is defined as the phenomenon that makes
        cell membranes permeable by exposing them to certain electric
        pulses (Weaver, J. C. and Y. A. Chizmadzhev, Theory of
        electroporation: a review. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg., 1996. 41:
        p. 135-60). Electroporation pulses are defined as those
        electrical pulses that through a specific combination of
        amplitude, shape, time length and number of repeats produce no
        other substantial effect on biological cells than the
        permeabilization of the cell membrane. The range of electrical
        parameters that produce electroporation is bounded by: a)
        parameters that have no substantial effect on the cell and the
        cell membrane, b) parameters that cause substantial thermal
        effects (Joule heating) and c) parameters that affect the
        interior of the cell, e.g. the nucleus, without affecting the
        cell membrane. Joule heating, the thermal effect that electrical
        currents produce when applied to biological materials is known
        for centuries. It was noted in the previous paragraph that
        electrical thermal effects which elevate temperatures to values
        that damage cells are commonly used to ablate undesirable
        tissues. The pulse parameters that produce thermal effects are
        longer and/or have higher amplitudes than the electroporation
        pulses whose only substantial effect is to permeabilize the cell
        membrane. </p>
      <p>[0005] There are a variety of methods to electrically produce
        thermal effects that ablate tissue. These include RF, electrode
        heating, and induction heating. Electrical pulses that produce
        thermal effects are distinctly different from the pulses which
        produce electroporation. The distinction can be recognizing
        through their effect on cells and their utility. The effect of
        the thermal electrical pulses is primarily on the temperature of
        the biological material and their utility is in raising the
        temperature to induce tissue ablation through thermal effects. </p>
      <p>[0006] The effect of the electroporation parameters is
        primarily on the cell membrane and their utility is in
        permeabilizing the cell membrane for various applications.
        Electrical parameters that only affect the interior of the cell,
        without affecting the cell membrane were also identified
        recently. They are normally referred to as "nanosecond pulses".
        It has been shown that high amplitude, and short (substantially
        shorter than electroporation pulses--nanoseconds versus
        millisecond) length pulses can affect the interior of the cell
        and in particular the nucleus without affecting the membrane.
        Studies on nanosecond pulses show that they are "distinctly
        different than electroporation pulses" (Beebe SJ. Fox PM. Rec
        LJ. Somers K. Stark RH. Schoenbach KH. Nanosecond pulsed
        electric field (nsPEF) effects on cells and tissues: apoptosis
        induction and tumor growth inhibition. PPPS-2001 Pulsed Power
        Plasma Science 2001. 28th IEEE International Conference on
        Plasma Science and 13th IEEE International Pulsed Power
        Conference. Digest of Technical Papers (Cat. No. 01 CH37251).
        IEEE. Part vol. 1, 2001, pp. 211-15 vol. 1. Piscataway, N.J.,
        USA. Several applications have been identified for nano-second
        pulses. One of them is for tissue ablation through an effect on
        the nucleus (Schoenbach, K. H., Beebe, S. J., Buescher, K. S.
        Method and apparatus for intracellular electro-manipulation U.S.
        Patent Application Pub No. US 2002/0010491 A1, Jan. 24, 2002).
        Another is to regulate genes in the cell interior, (Gunderson,
        M. A. et al. Method for intracellular modification within living
        cells using pulsed electrical fields--regulate gene
        transcription and entering intracellular US Patent application
        2003/0170898 A1, Sep. 11, 2003). Electrical pulses that produce
        intracellular effects are distinctly different from the pulses
        which produce electroporation. The distinction can be
        recognizing through their effect on cells and their utility. The
        effect of the intracellular electrical pulses is primarily on
        the intracellular contents of the cell and their utility is in
        manipulating the intracellular contents for various
        uses--including ablation. The effect of the electroporation
        parameters is primarily on the cell membrane and their utility
        is in permeabilizing the cell membrane for various applications,
        which will be discussed in greater detail later. </p>
      <p>[0007] Electroporation is known for over half a century. It was
        found that as a function of the electrical parameters,
        electroporation pulses can have two different effects on the
        permeability of the cell membrane. The permeabilization of the
        membrane can be reversible or irreversible as a function of the
        electrical parameters used. In reversible electroporation the
        cell membrane reseals a certain time after the pulses cease and
        the cell survives. In irreversible electroporation the cell
        membrane does not reseal and the cell lyses. A schematic diagram
        showing the effect of electrical parameters on the cell membrane
        permeabilization (electroporation) and the separation between:
        no effect, reversible electroporation and irreversible
        electroporation is shown in FIG. 1 (Dev, S. B., Rabussay, D. P.,
        Widera, G., Hofmann, G. A., Medical applications of
        electroporation, IEEE Transactions of Plasma Science, Vol28 No
        1, February 2000, pp 206-223) Dielectric breakdown of the cell
        membrane due to an induced electric field, irreversible
        electroporation, was first observed in the early 1970s (Neumann,
        E. and K. Rosenheck, Permeability changes induced by electric
        impulses in vesicular membranes. J. Membrane Biol., 1972. 10: p.
        279-290; Crowley, J. M., Electrical breakdown of biomolecular
        lipid membranes as an electromechanical instability. Biophysical
        Journal, 1973. 13: p. 711-724; Zimmermann, U., J. Vienken, and
        G. Pilwat, Dielectric breakdown of cell membranes, Biophysical
        Journal, 1974. 14(11): p. 881-899). The ability of the membrane
        to reseal, reversible electroporation, was discovered separately
        during the late 1970s (Kinosita Jr, K. and T. Y. Tsong,
        Hemolysis of human erythrocytes by a transient electric field.
        Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1977. 74(5): p. 1923-1927; Baker, P.
        F. and D. E. Knight, Calcium-dependent exocytosis in bovine
        adrenal medullary cells with leaky plasma membranes. Nature,
        1978. 276: p. 620-622; Gauger, B. and F. W. Bentrup, A Study of
        Dielectric Membrane Breakdown in the Fucus Egg, J. Membrane
        Biol., 1979. 48(3): p. 249-264). </p>
      <p>[0008] The mechanism of electroporation is not yet fully
        understood. It is thought that the electrical field changes the
        electrochemical potential around a cell membrane and induces
        instabilities in the polarized cell membrane lipid bilayer. The
        unstable membrane then alters its shape forming aqueous pathways
        that possibly are nano-scale pores through the membrane, hence
        the term "electroporation" (Chang, D. C., et al., Guide to
        Electroporation and Electrofusion. 1992, San Diego, Calif.:
        Academic Press, Inc.). Mass transfer can now occur through these
        channels under electrochemical control. Whatever the mechanism
        through which the cell membrane becomes permeabilized,
        electroporation has become an important method for enhanced mass
        transfer across the cell membrane. </p>
      <p>[0009] The first important application of the cell membrane
        permeabilizing properties of electroporation is due to Neumann
        (Neumann, E., et al., Gene transfer into mouse lyoma cells by
        electroporation in high electric fields. J. EMBO, 1982. 1: p.
        841-5). He has shown that by applying reversible electroporation
        to cells it is possible to sufficiently permeabilize the cell
        membrane so that genes, which are macromolecules that normally
        are too large to enter cells, can after electroporation enter
        the cell. Using reversible electroporation electrical parameters
        is crucial to the success of the procedure, since the goal of
        the procedure is to have a viable cell that incorporates the
        gene. </p>
      <p>[0010] Following this discovery electroporation became commonly
        used to reversible permeabilize the cell membrane for various
        applications in medicine and biotechnology to introduce into
        cells or to extract from cells chemical species that normally do
        not pass, or have difficulty passing across the cell membrane,
        from small molecules such as fluorescent dyes, drugs and
        radioactive tracers to high molecular weight molecules such as
        antibodies, enzymes, nucleic acids, HMW dextrans and DNA. It is
        important to emphasize that in all these applications
        electroporation needs to be reversible since the outcome of the
        mass transport requires for the cells to be alive after the
        electroporation. </p>
      <p>[0011] Following work on cells outside the body, reversible
        electroporation began to be used for permeabilization of cells
        in tissue. Heller, R., R. Gilbert, and M. J. Jaroszeski,
        Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy. Advanced drug
        delivery reviews, 1999. 35: p. 119-129. Tissue electroporation
        is now becoming an increasingly popular minimally invasive
        surgical technique for introducing small drugs and
        macromolecules into cells in specific areas of the body. This
        technique is accomplished by injecting drugs or macromolecules
        into the affected area and placing electrodes into or around the
        targeted tissue to generate reversible permeabilizing electric
        field in the tissue, thereby introducing the drugs or
        macromolecules into the cells of the affected area (Mir, L. M.,
        Therapeutic perspectives of in vivo cell
        electropermeabilization. Bioelectrochemistry, 2001. 53: p.
        1-10). </p>
      <p>[0012] The use of electroporation to ablate undesirable tissue
        was introduced by Okino and Mohri in 1987 and Mir et al. in
        1991. They have recognized that there are drugs for treatment of
        cancer, such as bleomycin and cys-platinum, which are very
        effective in ablation of cancer cells but have difficulties
        penetrating the cell membrane. Furthermore, some of these drugs,
        such as bleomycin, have the ability to selectively affect
        cancerous cells which reproduce without affecting normal cells
        that do not reproduce. Okino and Mori and Mir et al. separately
        discovered that combining the electric pulses with an impermeant
        anticancer drug greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the
        treatment with that drug (Okino, M. and H. Mohri, Effects of a
        high-voltage electrical impulse and an anticancer drug on in
        vivo growing tumors. Japanese Journal of Cancer Research, 1987.
        78(12): p. 1319-21; Mir, L. M., et al., Electrochemotherapy
        potentiation of antitumour effect of bleomycin by local electric
        pulses. European Journal of Cancer, 1991. 27: p. 68-72). Mir et
        al. soon followed with clinical trials that have shown promising
        results and coined the treatment electrochemotherapy (Mir, L.
        M., et al., Electrochemotherapy, a novel antitumor treatment:
        first clinical trial. C. R. Acad. Sci., 1991. Ser. III
        313(613-8)). </p>
      <p>[0013] Currently, the primary therapeutic in vivo applications
        of electroporation are antitumor electrochemotherapy (ECT),
        which combines a cytotoxic nonpermeant drug with permeabilizing
        electric pulses and electrogenetherapy (EGT) as a form of
        non-viral gene therapy, and transdermal drug delivery (Mir, L.
        M., Therapeutic perspectives of in vivo cell
        electropermeabilization. Bioelectrochemistry, 2001. 53: p.
        1-10). The studies on electrochemotherapy and electrogenetherapy
        have been recently summarized in several publications
        (Jaroszeski, M. J., et al., In vivo gene delivery by
        electroporation. Advanced applications of electrochemistry,
        1999. 35: p. 131-137; Heller, R., R. Gilbert, and M. J.
        Jaroszeski, Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy.

        Medicine through electrical Impedance Tomography of
        Electroporation, in Mechanical Engineering. 2002, University of
        California at Berkeley: Berkeley. p. 237). A recent article
        summarized the results from clinical trials performed in five
        cancer research centers. Basal cell carcinoma (32), malignant
        melanoma (142), adenocarcinoma (30) and head and neck squamous
        cell carcinoma (87) were treated for a total of 291 tumors (Mir,
        L. M., et al., Effective treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous
        malignant tumours by electrochemotherapy. British Journal of
        Cancer, 1998. 77(12): p. 2336-2342). </p>
      <p>[0014] Electrochemotherapy is a promising minimally invasive
        surgical technique to locally ablate tissue and treat tumors
        regardless of their histological type with minimal adverse side
        effects and a high response rate (Dev, S. B., et al., Medical
        Applications of Electroporation. IEEE Transactions on Plasma
        Science, 2000. 28(1): p. 206-223; Heller, R., R. Gilbert, and M.
        J. Jaroszeski, Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy.
        Advanced drug delivery reviews, 1999. 35: p. 119-129).
        Electrochemotherapy, which is performed through the insertion of
        electrodes into the undesirable tissue, the injection of
        cytotoxic drugs in the tissue and the application of reversible
        electroporation parameters, benefits from the ease of
        application of both high temperature treatment therapies and
        non-selective chemical therapies and results in outcomes
        comparable of both high temperature therapies and non-selective
        chemical therapies. </p>
      <p>[0015] In addition, because the cell membrane permeabilization
        electrical field is not affected by the local blood flow, the
        control over the extent of the affected tissue by this mode of
        ablation does not depend on the blood flow as in thermal and
        non-selective chemical therapies. In designing electroporation
        protocols for ablation of tissue with drugs that are
        incorporated in the cell and function in the living cells it was
        important to employ reversible electroporation; because the
        drugs can only function in a living cell. Therefore, in
        designing protocols for electrochemotherapy the emphasis was on
        avoiding irreversible electroporation. The focus of the entire
        field of electroporation for ablation of tissue was on using
        reversible pulses, while avoiding irreversible electroporation
        pulses, that can cause the incorporation of selective drugs in
        undesirable tissue to selectively destroy malignant cells.
        Electrochemotherapy which employs reversible electroporation in
        combination with drugs, is beneficial due to its selectivity
        however, a disadvantage is that by its nature, it requires the
        combination of chemical agents with an electrical field and it
        depends on the successful incorporation of the chemical agent
        inside the cell. </p>
      <p>[0016] The present inventors have recognized that irreversible
        electroporation, whose ability to lyse various types of cells
        outside the body has been known for at least five decades, has
        never been used for tissue ablation in the body and in fact was
        considered detrimental to conventional electrochemotherapy.
        Although irreversible electroporation of tissue is not as
        selective as reversible electroporation with drug incorporation
        the present inventors have found it to be effective in ablating
        volumes of undesirable tissues in a way comparable to other
        non-discriminating bulk ablative methods such as cryosurgery,
        thermal methods or alcohol injection. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0017] The present invention comprises a method for the
        ablation of undesirable tissue, involving the placement of
        electrodes into or near the vicinity of the undesirable tissue
        with the application of electrical pulses causing irreversible
        electroporation of the cells throughout the entire undesirable
        region. The electric pulses irreversibly permeate the membranes,
        thereby invoking cell death. The length of time of the
        electrical pulses, the voltage applied and the resulting
        membrane permeability are all controlled within defined ranges.
        The irreversibly permeabilized cells may be left in situ and may
        be removed by natural processes such as the body's own immune
        system. The amount of tissue ablation achievable through the use
        of irreversible electroporation without inducing thermal damage
        is considerable, as disclosed and described here. </p>
      <p>[0018] This concept of irreversible electroporation in tissue
        to destroy undesirable tissues is different from other forms of
        electrical therapies and treatments. Irreversible
        electroporation is different from intracellular
        electro-manipulation which substantially only affects the
        interior of the cell and does not cause irreversible cell
        membrane damage. Irreversible electroporation is not
        electrically induced thermal coagulation--which induces cell
        damage through thermal effects but rather a more benign method
        to destroy only the cell membrane of cells in the targeted
        tissue. Irreversible electroporation which irreversible destroys
        the cell membrane is also different from electrochemotherapy in
        which reversible electroporation pulses are used to introduce
        drugs into the living cells and in which the drugs subsequently
        affect the living cell. </p>
      <p>[0019] An electrical pulse can either have no effect on the
        cell membrane, effect internal cell components, reversibly open
        the cell membrane after which cells can survive, or irreversibly
        open the cell membrane, after which the cells die. Of these
        effects, irreversible electroporation of tissue was (prior to
        present invention) generally considered undesirable due to the
        possibility of instantaneous necrosis of the entire tissue
        affected by the electrical field, regardless of its diseased or
        healthy state. Irreversible electroporation is detrimental in
        certain applications, such as gene therapy or
        electrochemotherapy, where the sole purpose of the electric
        pulses is to facilitate the introduction of the drug or gene
        into the cells of a tissue without killing the cell (Mir., L. M.
        and S. Orlowski, The basis of electrochemotherapy, in
        Electrochemotherapy, electrogenetherapy, and transdermal drug
        delivery: Electrically mediated delivery of molecules to cells,
        M. J. Jaroszeski, R. Heller, R. Gilbert, Editors, 2000, Humana
        Press, p. 99-118). </p>
      <p>[0020] In contrast, irreversible electroporation of the type
        described here, solely uses electrical pulses to serve as the
        active means for tissue destruction by a specific means, i.e. by
        fatally disrupting the cell membrane. Electrochemotherapy may be
        selective, but it does require the combination of chemical
        agents with the electrical field. Irreversible electroporation,
        although non-selective, may be used for the ablation of
        undesirable tissue (such as a tumor) as a minimally invasive
        surgical procedure without the use of adjuvant drugs. Its
        non-selective mode of tissue ablation is acceptable in the field
        of minimally invasive surgery and provides results which in some
        ways are comparable to cryosurgery, non-selective chemical
        ablation and high temperature thermal ablation. </p>
      <p>[0021] An aspect of the invention is a method whereby cells of
        tissue are irreversibly electroporated by applying pulses of
        very precisely determined length and voltage. This may be done
        while measuring and/or observing changes in electrical impedance
        in real time and noting decreases at the onset of
        electroporation and adjusting the current in real time to obtain
        irreversible cellular damage without thermal damage. In
        embodiments where voltage is applied, the monitoring of the
        impedance affords the user knowledge of the presence or absence
        of pores. This measurement shows the progress of the pore
        formation and indicates whether irreversible pore formation,
        leading to cell death, has occurred. </p>
      <p>[0022] An aspect of this invention is that the onset and extent
        of electroporation of cells in tissue can be correlated to
        changes in the electrical impedance (which term is used herein
        to mean the voltage over current) of the tissue. At a given
        point, the electroporation becomes irreversible. A decrease in
        the resistivity of a group of biological cells occurs when
        membranes of the cells become permeable due to pore formation.
        By monitoring the impedance of the biological cells in a tissue,
        one can detect the average point in time in which pore formation
        of the cells occurs, as well as the relative degree of cell
        membrane permeability due to the pore formation. By gradually
        increasing voltage and testing cells in a given tissue one can
        determine a point where irreversible electroporation occurs.
        This information can then be used to establish that, on average,
        the cells of the tissue have, in fact, undergone irreversible
        electroporation. This information can also be used to control
        the electroporation process by governing the selection of the
        voltage magnitude. </p>
      <p>[0023] The invention provides the simultaneous irreversible
        electroporation of multitudes of cells providing a direct
        indication of the actual occurrence of electroporation and an
        indication of the degree of electroporation averaged over the
        multitude. The discovery is likewise useful in the irreversible
        electroporation of biological tissue (masses of biological cells
        with contiguous membranes) for the same reasons. The benefits of
        this process include a high level of control over the beginning
        point of irreversible electroporation. </p>
      <p>[0024] A feature of the invention is that the magnitude of
        electrical current during electroporation of the tissue becomes
        dependent on the degree of electroporation so that current and
        pulse length are adjusted within a range predetermined to obtain
        irreversible electroporation of targeted cells of the tissue
        while minimizing cellular damage to surrounding cells and
        tissue. </p>
      <p>[0025] An aspect of the invention is that pulse length and
        current are precisely adjusted within ranges to provide more
        than mere intracellular electro-manipulation which results in
        cell death and less than that which would cause thermal damages
        to the surrounding tissues. </p>
      <p>[0026] Another aspect of the invention is that the
        electroporation is carried out without adding drugs, DNA, or
        other materials of any sort to be brought into the cells. </p>
      <p>[0027] Another feature of the invention is that measuring
        current (in real time) through a circuit gives a measurement of
        the average overall degree of electroporation obtained. </p>
      <p>[0028] Another aspect of the invention is that the precise
        electrical resistance of the tissue is calculated from
        cross-time voltage measurement with probe electrodes and
        cross-current measurement with the circuit attached to
        electroporation electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0029] Another aspect of the invention is that the precise
        electrical resistance of the tissue is calculated from
        cross-time voltage measurement with probe electrodes and
        cross-current measurement with the circuit attached to
        electroporation electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0030] Another aspect of the invention is that electrical
        measurements of the tissue can be used to map the
        electroporation distribution of the tissue. </p>
      <p>[0031] Unlike electrical impedance tomography for detection of
        reversible electroporation which needs to be done during or
        close to the time the reversible electroporation pulses are
        applied--because of the transient nature of the reversible
        electroporation; in irreversible electroporation it is possible
        and perhaps even preferential to perform the current or EIT
        measurements a substantial time (several minutes or more) after
        the electroporation to verify that it is indeed irreversible. </p>
      <p>[0032] These and further features, advantages and objects of
        the invention will be better understood from the description
        that follows. </p>

      <p><b>Definitions</b> </p>
      <p>[0052] The term "reversible electroporation" encompasses
        permeabilization of the cell membrane through the application of
        electrical pulses across the cell. In "reversible
        electroporation" the permeabilization of the cell membrane
        ceases after the application of the pulse and the cell membrane
        permeability reverts to normal. The cell survives "reversible
        electroporation." It is used as a means for introducing
        chemicals, DNA, or other materials into cells. </p>
      <p>[0053] The term "irreversible electroporation" also encompasses
        the permeabilization of the cell membrane through the
        application of electrical pulses across the cell. However, in
        "irreversible electroporation" the permeabilization of the cell
        membrane does not cease after the application of the pulse and
        the cell membrane permeability does not revert to normal. The
        cell does not survive "irreversible electroporation" and the
        cell death is caused by the disruption of the cell membrane and
        not merely by internal perturbation of cellular components.
        Openings in the cell membrane are created and/or expanded in
        size resulting in a fatal disruption in the normal controlled
        flow of material across the cell membrane. The cell membrane is
        highly specialized in its ability to regulate what leaves and
        enters the cell. Irreversible electroporation destroys that
        ability to regulate in a manner such that the cell can not
        compensate and as such the cell dies. </p>
      <p><b>Invention in General</b> </p>
      <p>[0054] The invention provides a method and a system for
        destruction (ablation) of undesirable tissue. It involves the
        insertion (bringing) electroporation electrodes to the vicinity
        of the undesirable tissue and in good electrical contact with
        the tissue and the application of electrical pulses that cause
        irreversible electroporation of the cells throughout the entire
        area of the undesirable tissue. The cells whose membrane was
        irreversible permeabilized may be left in situ (not removed) and
        as such may be gradually removed by the body's immune system.
        Cell death is produced by inducing the electrical parameters of
        irreversible electroporation in the undesirable area. </p>
      <p>[0055] Electroporation protocols involve the generation of
        electrical fields in tissue and are affected by the Joule
        heating of the electrical pulses. When designing tissue
        electroporation protocols it is important to determine the
        appropriate electrical parameters that will maximize tissue
        permeabilization without inducing deleterious thermal effects.
        It has been shown that substantial volumes of tissue can be
        electroporated with reversible electroporation without inducing
        damaging thermal effects to cells and has quantified these
        volumes (<b><i>Davalos,</i></b> R. V., B. Rubinsky, and L. M.
        Mir, Theoretical analysis of the thermal effects during in vivo
        tissue electroporation. Bioelectrochemistry, 2003. Vol. 61(1-2):
        p. 99-107). </p>
      <p>[0056] The electrical pulses required to induce irreversible
        electroporation in tissue are larger in magnitude and duration
        from the electrical pulses required for reversible
        electroporation. Further, the duration and strength of the
        pulses required for irreversible electroporation are different
        from other methodologies using electrical pulses such as for
        intracellular electro-manipulation or thermal ablation. The
        methods are very different even when the intracellular
        (nano-seconds) electro-manipulation is used to cause cell death,
        e.g. ablate the tissue of a tumor or when the thermal effects
        produce damage to cells causing cell death. </p>
      <p>[0057] Typical values for pulse length for irreversible
        electroporation are in a range of from about 5 microseconds to
        about 62,000 milliseconds or about 75 microseconds to about
        20,000 milliseconds or about 100 microseconds.+-.10
        microseconds. This is significantly longer than the pulse length
        generally used in intracellular (nano-seconds)
        electro-manipulation which is 1 microsecond or less--see
        published U.S. application 2002/0010491 published Jan. 24, 2002.
      </p>
      <p>[0058] The pulse is at voltage of about 100 V/cm to 7,000 V/cm
        or 200 V/cm to 2000 V/cn or 300V/cm to 1000 V/cm about 600 V/cm
        110% for irreversible electroporation. This is substantially
        lower than that used for intracellular electro-manipulation
        which is about 10,000 V/cm, see U.S. application 2002/0010491
        published Jan. 24, 2002. </p>
      <p>[0059] The voltage expressed above is the voltage gradient
        (voltage per centimeter). The electrodes may be different shapes
        and sizes and be positioned at different distances from each
        other. The shape may be circular, oval, square, rectangular or
        irregular etc. The distance of one electrode to another may be
        0.5 to 10 cm., 1 to 5 cm., or 2-3 cm. The electrode may have a
        surface area of 0.1-5 sq. cm. or 1-2 sq. cm. </p>
      <p>[0060] The size, shape and distances of the electrodes can vary
        and such can change the voltage and pulse duration used. Those
        skilled in the art will adjust the parameters in accordance with
        this disclosure to obtain the desired degree of electroporation
        and avoid thermal damage to surrounding cells. </p>
      <p>[0061] Thermal effects require electrical pulses that are
        substantially longer from those used in irreversible
        electroporation (<b><i>Davalos,</i></b> R. V., B. Rubinsky, and
        L. M. Mir, Theoretical analysis of the thermal effects during in
        vivo tissue electroporation. Bioelectrochemistry, 2003. Vol.
        61(1-2): p. 99-107). FIG. 1 is showing that irreversible
        electroporation pulses are longer and have higher amplitude than
        the reversible electroporation pulses. When using irreversible
        electroporation for tissue ablation, there may be concern that
        the irreversible electroporation pulses will be as large as to
        cause thermal damaging effects to the surrounding tissue and the
        extent of the tissue ablated by irreversible electroporation
        will not be significant relative to that ablated by thermal
        effects. Under such circumstances irreversible electroporation
        could not be considered as an effective tissue ablation modality
        as it will act in superposition with thermal ablation. </p>
      <p>[0062] The present invention evaluates, through mathematical
        models and experiment, the maximal extent of tissue ablation
        that could be accomplished by irreversible electroporation prior
        to the onset of thermal effects. The models focused on
        electroporation of liver tissue with two and four needle
        electrodes and on electroporation of liver tissue with two
        infinite parallel plates using available experimental data. The
        experiment (EXAMPLE 3) evaluates irreversible electroporation
        between two cylindrical electrodes, also in the liver. The liver
        was chosen because it is considered a potential candidate for
        irreversible electroporation ablation. The results show that the
        area that can be ablated by irreversible electroporation prior
        to the onset of thermal effects is comparable to that which can
        be ablated by electrochemotherapy, validating the use of
        irreversible electroporation as a potential minimally invasive
        surgical modality. </p>
      <p>[0063] Earlier studies have shown that the extent of
        electroporation can be imaged in real time with electrical
        impedance tomography (EIT) (<b><i>Davalos,</i></b> R. V., B.
        Rubinsky, and D. M. Otten, A feasibility study for electrical
        impedance tomography as a means to monitor tissue
        electroporation for molecular medicine. IEEE Transactions on
        Biomedical Engineering, 2002. 49(4): p. 400-403). In
        irreversible electroporation the electroporated area persists
        indefinitely after the electroporation pulse, showing that
        irreversible electroporation may be imaged leisurely with EIT.
        Irreversible electroporation, therefore, has the advantage of a
        tissue ablation technique that is as easy to apply as high
        temperature ablation, without the need for adjuvant chemicals as
        electrochemotherapy and with real-time control of the affected
        area with electrical impedance tomography. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>[0064] The following examples are put forth so as to provide
        those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure
        and description of how to make and use the present invention,
        and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors
        regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent
        that the experiments below are all or the only experiments
        performed. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with
        respect to numbers used (e.g. amounts, temperature, etc.) but
        some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for.
        Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular
        weight is weight average molecular weight, temperature is in

      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0065] The mathematical model provided here shows that
        irreversible tissue ablation can affect substantial volumes of
        tissue, without inducing damaging thermal effects. To this end,
        the present invention uses the Laplace equation to calculate the
        electrical potential distribution in tissue during typical
        electroporation pulses and a modified Pennes (bioheat), (Pennes,
        H. H., Analysis of tissue and arterial blood flow temperatures
        in the resting forearm. J of Appl. Physiology., 1948. 1: p.
        93-122), equation to calculate the resulting temperature
        distribution. It is important to note that there are several
        forms of the bioheat equation which have been reviewed (Carney,
        C. K., Mathematical models of bioheat transfer, in
        Bioengineering heat transfer, Y. I. Choi, Editor. 1992, Academic
        Press, Inc: Boston. p. 19-152; Eto, T. K. and B. Rubinsky,
        Bioheat transfer, in Introduction to bioengineering, S. A.
        Berger, W. Goldsmith, and E. R. Lewis, Editors. 1996, Oxford
        Press). While the Pennes equation is controversial, it is
        nevertheless commonly used because it can provide an estimate of
        the various biological heat transfer parameters, such as blood
        flow and metabolism. The modified Pennes equation in this study
        contains the Joule heating term in tissue as an additional heat
        source. </p>
      <p>[0066] The electrical potential associated with an
        electroporation pulse is determined by solving the Laplace
        equation for the potential distribution:
        .gradient.(.sigma..gradient..phi.)=0 (1) </p>
      <p>[0067] where .phi. is the electrical potential and .sigma. is
        the electrical conductivity. The electrical boundary condition
        of the tissue that is in contact with the leftmost electrode(s)
        on which the electroporation pulse is applied is: .phi.=V.sub.0
        (2) </p>
      <p>[0068] The electrical boundary condition at the interface of
        the rightmost electrode(s) is: .phi.=0 (3) </p>
      <p>[0069] The boundaries where the analyzed domain is not in
        contact with an electrode are treated as electrically insulative
        to provide an upper limit to the electrical field near the
        electroporation electrodes and an upper limit to the temperature
        distribution that results from electroporation: .differential.
        .PHI. .differential. n = 0 ( 4 ) </p>
      <p>[0070] Solving the Laplace equation enables one to calculate
        the associated Joule heating, the heat generation rate per unit
        volume from an electrical field (p):
        p=.sigma.|.gradient..phi.|.sup.2 (5) </p>
      <p>[0071] This term is added to the original Pennes equation,
        (Pennes, H. H., Analysis of tissue and arterial blood flow
        temperatures in the resting forearm. J of Appl. Physiology.,
        1948. 1: p. 93-122) to represent the heat generated from the
        electroporation procedure: .gradient. ( k .times. .gradient. T )
        + w b .times. c b .function. ( T a - T ) + q ''' + p = .rho.
        .times. .times. c p .times. .differential. T .differential. t (
        6 ) </p>
      <p>[0072] To solve equation (4) it is assumed that the entire
        tissue is initially at the physiological temperature of
        37.degree. C.: T(x,y, z,0)=37 (7) </p>
      <p>[0073] The outer surface of the analyzed domain and the
        surfaces of the electrodes are taken to be adiabatic, which
        should produce an upper limit to the calculated temperature
        distribution in the tissue: .differential. T .differential. n =
        0 .times. .times. on .times. .times. the .times. .times.

      <p>[0074] The analysis modeled conditions typical to tissue
        electroporation in the liver. The liver was chosen because it is
        the organ that most minimally invasive ablation techniques treat
        since cancer in the liver can be resolved by extirpation of the
        diseased area while surgical resection is not possible in many
        cases for this organ (Onik, G., B. Rubinsky, and et al.,
        Ultrasound-Guided Hepatic Cryosurgery in the Treatment of
        Metastatic Colon Carcinoma. Cancer, 1991. 67(4): p. 901-907).
        The electroporation parameters, i.e. pulse parameters for
        reversible and irreversible electroporation where obtained from
        rat liver data (Miklavcic, D., et al., A validated model of in
        vivo electric field distribution in tissues for
        electrochemotherapy and for DNA electrotransfer for gene
        therapy. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 2000. 1523(1): p. 73-83;

        436-440), but biological parameters corresponding to the human
        liver were used in the analysis. Tissue thermal properties are

        isotropic and macroscopically homogeneous. The intent of the
        analysis was to determine the extent of the region in which
        reversible or irreversible electroporation is induced in the
        liver for various electroporation voltages and durations while
        the maximal temperature in the tissue is below 50.degree. C.
        Thermal damage is a time-dependent process described by an
        Arhenius type equation (Henriques, F. C. and A. R. Moritz,

      <p>[0075] Where .OMEGA. is a measure of thermal damage, .xi. is
        the frequency factor, E.sub.a is the activation energy and R is
        the universal gas constant. A detailed description on the
        various degrees of thermal damage as described in Equation (9)
        above can be found in (Diller, K. R., Modeling of bioheat
        transfer processes at high and low temperatures, in
        Bioengineering heat transfer, Y. I. Choi, Editor. 1992, Academic
        Press, Inc: Boston. p. 157-357). </p>
      <p>[0076] A careful examination shows that the thermal damage is a
        complex function of time, temperature and all the parameters in
        Equation (9) above and that there are various degrees of thermal
        damage. In various applications or for various considerations it
        is possible to design irreversible electroporation protocols
        that induce some degree of thermal damage, either in part of the
        electroporated region or at a reduced level throughout the
        electroporated region. However, in this example we have chosen
        50.degree. C. as the target temperature for several reasons.
        Thermal damage begins at temperatures higher than 42.degree. C.,
        but only for prolonged exposures. Damage is relatively low until
        50.degree. C. to 60.degree. C. at which the rate of damage
        dramatically increases (Diller, K. R., Modeling of bioheat
        transfer processes at high and low temperatures, in
        Bioengineering heat transfer, Y. I. Choi, Editor. 1992, Academic
        Press, Inc: Boston. p. 157-357). Therefore 50 C will be a
        relatively low bound on the possible thermal effects during
        irreversible electroporation. It is anticipated that the
        electrical parameters chosen for irreversible electroporation
        without a thermal effect could be substantially longer and
        higher than those obtained from an evaluation for 50 C in this
        example. Furthermore, since the Laplace and bioheat equations
        are linear, the results provided here can be extrapolated and
        considered indicative of the overall thermal behavior. </p>
      <p>[0077] The analyzed configurations have two needles or four
        needle electrodes embedded in a square model of the liver.
        Needle electrodes are commonly used in tissue electroporation
        and will be most likely also used in the liver (Somiari, S., et
        al., Theory and in vivo application of electroporative gene
        delivery. Molecular Therapy, 2000. 2(3): p. 178-187). The square
        model of the liver was chosen large enough to avoid outer
        surface boundary effects and to produce an upper limit for the
        temperature, which develops during electroporation in the liver.
        For each configuration the surface of one electrode is assumed
        to have a prescribed voltage with the other electrode set to
        ground. The effect of the spacing between the electrodes was
        investigated by comparing distances of 5, 7.5 and 10 mm, which
        are typical. The electrodes were also modeled with typical
        dimensions of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 mm in diameter. The blood flow
        perfusion rate was taken to zero or 1.0 kg/m.sup.3 s (Deng, Z.
        S. and J. Liu, Blood perfusion-based model for characterizing
        the temperature fluctuations in living tissue. Phys A STAT Mech
        Appl, 2001. 300: p. 521-530). The metabolic heat was taken to be
        either zero or 33.8 kW/m.sup.3 (Deng, Z. S. and J. Liu, Blood
        perfusion-based model for characterizing the temperature
        fluctuations in living tissue. Phys A STAT Mech Appl, 2001. 300:
        p. 521-530). </p>
      <p>[0078] The calculations were made for an electroporation pulse
        of 800 .mu.s. This pulse duration was chosen because typically,
        reversible electroporation is done with eight separate 100 .mu.s
        pulses, (Miklavcic, D., et al., A validated model of in vivo
        electric field distribution in tissues for electrochemotherapy
        and for DNA electrotransfer for gene therapy. Biochimica et
        Biophysica Acta, 2000. 1523(1): p. 73-83) and therefore the
        value we chose is an upper limit of the thermal effect in a
        pulse time frame comparable to that of reversible
        electroporation. Consequently, the results obtained here are the
        lower limit in possible lesion size during irreversible
        electroporation. It should be emphasized that we believe
        irreversible electroporation tissue ablation can be done with
        shorter pulses than 800 .mu.s. To evaluate the thermal effect,
        we gradually increased in our mathematical model the applied
        pulse amplitude for the 800 .mu.s pulse length until our
        calculations indicated that the electroporation probe
        temperature reached 50.degree. C., which we considered to be the
        thermal damage limit. Then, we evaluated the electric field
        distribution throughout the liver. </p>
      <p>[0079] A transmembrane potential on the order of 1V is required
        to induce irreversible electroporation. This value is dependent
        on a variety of conditions such as tissue type, cell size and
        other external conditions and pulse parameters. The primary
        electrical parameter affecting the transmembrane potential for a
        specific tissue type is the amplitude of the electric field to
        which the tissue is exposed. The electric field thresholds used
        in estimating the extent of the region that was irreversibly
        electroporated were taken from the fundamental studies of
        Miklavcic, Mir and their colleagues performed with rabbit liver
        tissue (Miklavcic, D., et al., A validated model of in vivo
        electric field distribution in tissues for electrochemotherapy
        and for DNA electrotransfer for gene therapy: Biochimica et
        Biophysica Acta, 2000. 1523(1): p. 73-83). In this study, that
        correlated electroporation experiments with mathematical
        modeling, they have found that the electric field for reversible
        electroporation is 362+/-21 V/cm and is 637+/-43 V/cm for
        irreversible electroporation for rat liver tissue. Therefore, in
        the analysis an electric field of 360 V/cm is taken to represent
        the delineation between no electroporation and reversible
        electroporation and 680 V/cm to represent the delineation
        between reversible and irreversible electroporation. </p>
      <p>[0080] All calculations were performed using MATLAB's finite
        element solver, Femlab v2.2 (The MathWorks, Inc. Natick, Mass.).
        To ensure mesh quality and validity of solution, the mesh was
        refined until there was less than a 0.5% difference in solution
        between refinements. The baseline mesh with two 1 mm electrodes,
        10 mm spacing had 4035 nodes and 7856 triangles. The simulations
        were conducted on a Dell Optiplex GX240 with 512 MB of RAM
        operating on Microsoft Windows 2000. </p>
      <p><b>Results and Discussion</b> </p>
      <p>[0081] FIGS. 2 and 3 examine the effect of the electrode size
        and spacing on the ablated area in a two-needle electroporation
        configuration. In obtaining these figures, we ignored the effect
        of the blood flow and metabolism in the heat transfer equation,
        which should give an upper limit for the estimated ablation
        area. FIG. 2 compares the extent of the irreversible
        electroporated area for electroporation electrode sizes of 0.5,
        1 and 1.5 mm in diameter and a distance between electrodes of 10
        mm. The strong effect of the electrode size is evident. It is
        seen that for the smaller electrodes, the irreversibly
        electroporated area is not contiguous, while for a 1.5 mm
        electrode the area of potential tissue, ablation has an
        elliptical shape with dimensions of about 15 mm by 10 mm. In the
        brackets, we give the electroporation voltage for which the
        probe temperature reaches 50.degree. C. in these three
        configurations. It is seen that the range is from 857V for the
        0.5 mm probe to 1575V for the 1.5 mm probe. This is within the
        typical range of tissue electroporation pulses. FIG. 3 evaluates
        the effect of the spacing between the electrodes. It is observed
        that in the tested range, the small dimension of the contiguous
        elliptical shape of the ablated lesion remains the same, while
        the larger dimension seems to scale with the distance between
        the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0082] FIGS. 2 and 3 demonstrate that the extent of tissue
        ablation with irreversible electroporation is comparable to that
        of other typical minimally invasive methods for tissue ablation,
        such as cryosurgery (Onik, G. M., B. Rubinsky, and et. al.,
        Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery in the treatment of
        metastatic colon carcinoma. Cancer, 1991. 67(4): p. 901-907;
        Onik, G. M., et al., Transrectal ultrasound-guided percutaneous
        radical cryosurgical ablation of the prostate. Cancer, 1993.
        72(4): p. 1291-99). It also shows that varying electrode size
        and spacing can control lesion size and shape. The shape and
        size of the ablated lesion can be also controlled by varying the
        number of electrodes used. This is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, for a
        four-electrode configuration. These figures also compare the
        effect of probe size and spacing and the results were also
        obtained by ignoring the effect of blood flow and metabolism in
        the energy equation. Again, it is seen that larger electrodes
        have a substantial effect on the extent of the ablated region
        and that the extent of ablation scales with the spacing between
        the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0083] A comparison between reversible and irreversible
        electroporation protocols can be achieved from FIGS. 6 and 7. In
        FIG. 6, an 800 .mu.s, 1295 V pulse was applied between two 1.5
        mm diameter electrodes placed 10 mm apart. This produces a
        tissue temperature lower than 50.degree. C. The figure plots the
        margin of the irreversibly electroporated region, i.e. the 680
        V/cm voltage-to-distance gradients and that of the reversible
        electroporated region, the 360 V/cm gradients. FIG. 7 was
        obtained for two 1 mm electrodes placed 10 mm apart. In this
        figure, we produced an electroporated region that was only
        reversibly electroporated, i.e. with electric fields lower than
        360 V/cm. In comparing FIGS. 6 and 7, it is obvious that the
        extent of the ablated area possible through electrochemotherapy
        alone is substantially smaller than that through irreversible
        electroporation alone. </p>
      <p>[0084] The effect of blood flow and metabolism on the extent of
        irreversible electroporation is illustrated in FIG. 8. The
        figures compare a situation with metabolism and a relatively
        high blood flow rate to a situation without blood flow or
        metabolism. It is obvious that metabolism and blood perfusion
        have a negligible effect on the possible extent of irreversible
        tissue electroporation. This is because the effect of the Joule
        heating produced by the electroporation current is substantially
        larger than the effects of blood flow or metabolism. </p>
      <p>[0085] An even more conservative estimate for the thermal
        damage can be obtained by assuming that the tissue reaches
        50.degree. C. instantaneously, during the electroporation pulses
        such that the damage is defined as
        .OMEGA.=t.sub.p.xi.e.sup.-.DELTA.E/RT (10) </p>
      <p>[0086] Several values taken from the literature for activation
        energy and frequency factor were applied to equation (10) with
        the pulse lengths calculated in the examples above. Because the
        application of the pulse is so short, the damage would be near
        zero, many times less than the value (.OMEGA.=0.53) to induce a
        first degree burn (Diller, K. R., Modeling of bioheat transfer
        processes at high and low temperatures, in Bioengineering heat
        transfer, Y. I. Choi, Editor. 1992, Academic Press, Inc: Boston.
        p. 157-357) regardless of the values used for activation energy
        and frequency factor. </p>
      <p>[0087] Currently, tissue ablation by electroporation is
        produced through the use of cytotoxic drugs injected in tissue
        combined with reversible electroporation, a procedure known as
        electrochemotherapy. The present invention shows that
        irreversible electroporation by itself produces substantial
        tissue ablation for the destruction of undesirable tissues in
        the body. The concern was that higher voltages required for
        irreversible electroporation would cause Joule heating and would
        induce thermal tissue damage to a degree that would make
        irreversible electroporation a marginal effect in tissue
        ablation. Using a mathematical model for calculating the
        electrical potential and temperature field in tissue during
        electroporation, the present invention shows that the area
        ablated by irreversible tissue electroporation prior to the
        onset of thermal effects is substantial and comparable to that
        of other tissue ablation techniques such as cryosurgery. Our
        earlier studies have shown that the extent of electroporation
        can be imaged in real time with electrical impedance tomography
        (<b><i>Davalos,</i></b> R. V., B. Rubinsky, and D. M. Otten, A
        feasibility study for electrical impedance tomography as a means
        to monitor tissue electroporation for molecular medicine. IEEE
        Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2002. 49(4): p. 400-403;
        <b><i>Davalos,</i></b> R. V., et al., Electrical impedance
        tomography for imaging tissue electroporation. IEEE Transactions
        on Biomedical Engineering, 2004). Irreversible electroporation,
        therefore, has the advantage of being a tissue ablation
        technique, which is as easy to apply as high temperature
        ablation, without the need for adjuvant chemicals as required in
        electrochemical ablation and electrochemotherapy. In addition, a
        unique aspect of irreversible electroporation is that the
        affected area can be controlled in real time with electrical
        impedance tomography. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0088] This example was developed to produce a correlation
        between electroporation pulses and thermal effects. The system
        analyzed is an infinitesimally small control volume of tissue
        exposed to an electroporation voltage gradient of V (Volts/cm).
        The entire electrical energy is dissipated as heat and there is
        no conduction of heat from the system. The calculations produce
        the increase in temperature with time during the application of
        the pulse and the results are a safe lower limit for how long a
        certain electroporation pulse can be administered until a
        certain temperature is reached. To generate the correlation an
        energy balance is made on a control volume between the Joule
        heating produced from the dissipation of heat of the V (volt/cm)
        electrical potential gradient (local electrical field)
        dissipating through tissue with an electrical conductivity of
        .sigma. (ohm-cm) and the raise in temperature of the control
        volume made of tissue with a density .rho. (g/cc) and specific
        heat, c, (J/g K). The calculation produces the following
        equation for the raise in temperature (T) per unit time (t) as a
        function of the voltage gradients and the thermal and electrical
        properties of the liver. d T d t = V 2 .times. .sigma. .rho.

      <p>[0089] The table below was obtained for the liver with the

      <p>[0094] The second column of Table 1 gives the amount of time it
        takes for the temperature of the liver to raise 1 C, when the
        tissue experiences the electroporation pulse in column 1. The
        time for even a relatively high electroporation voltage of
        1500V/cm is of the order of 1.33 millisecond for 1 C rise and
        37.32 millisecond until a temperature of 65 C is reached. Using
        the equation (2-1) or Table 1 it is possible to evaluate the
        amount of time a certain pulse can be applied without inducing
        thermal effects. Considering the typical electroporation
        parameters reported so far there is no limitation in the
        electroporation length from thermal considerations. Column 3 of
        Table 1 shows the time required to reach 65 C, which is where
        thermal damage may begin. The calculations in this example give
        a lower limit for the extent of time in which a certain thermal
        effects will be induced by electroporation pulses. For more
        precise calculations it is possible to use the equation
        developed in this example with equation (9) or (10) from Example
        1. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0095] The goal of this experiment was to verify the ability of
        irreversible electroporation pulses to produce substantial
        tissue ablation in the non-thermal regime. To this end we have
        performed experiments on the liver of Spraque-Dawley male rats
        (250 g to 350 g) under an approved animal use and care protocol.
        After the animals were anesthetized by injection of Nembutal
        Sodium Solution (50 mg/ml Pentobarbital) the liver was exposed
        via a midline incisions and one lobed clamped between two
        cylindrical electrodes of Ag/AgCl, with a diameter of 10 mm (In
        Vivo Metric, Healdsburg, Calif.). The electrodes had their flat
        surface parallel; they were concentric and the liver between the
        electrodes was compressed so that the lobes were separated by 4
        mm. A schematic of the electrodes and the liver is shown in FIG.
        9. The liver was exposed to a single electroporation pulse of 40
        milliseconds. One electrode was set to 400 V and the other
        grounded. The rest of the liver was not in contact with any
        media and therefore is considered electrically insulated. After
        electroporation the rat was maintained under controlled
        anesthesia for three hours. Following exsanguination the liver
        was flushed with physiological saline under pressure and fixed
        by perfusion with formaldehyde. The liver was resected through
        the center of the electroporated region and analyzed by
        histology. FIGS. 10 and 11 show the appearance of the liver.
        Histology has determined that the dark area corresponds to the
        region of tissue necrosis. The electrical field in the
        electroporated liver and the temperature distribution were
        calculated using the equations in Example 1, subject to one
        electrode at a voltage of 400V and the other grounded, for 40
        milliseconds. The liver was modeled as an infinite slab of 4 mm
        thickness, with concentric cylindrical electrodes (see FIG. 9).
        The results are shown in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 shows lines of
        constant voltage gradients (V/cm) and lines of constant
        temperature. It is evident that in the majority of the
        electroporated tissue the temperature is about 42 C immediately
        after the pulse. The highest temperature occurs near the edge of
        the cylindrical electrodes, where it is about 50 C. FIG. 13 was
        obtained by bringing together FIGS. 11 and 12. Superimposing the
        calculated results on the histological measurements reveals that
        the dark (necrotic) area margin corresponds to electroporation
        parameters of about 300 V/cm. The results demonstrate that
        irreversible electroporation can induce substantial tissue
        necrosis without the need for chemical additives as in
        electrochemotherapy and without a thermal effect. </p>
      <p>[0096] The preceding merely illustrates the principles of the
        invention. It will be appreciated that those skilled in the art
        will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not
        explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of
        the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.
        Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited
        herein are principally intended to aid the reader in
        understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts
        contributed by the inventors to furthering the art, and are to
        be construed as being without limitation to such specifically
        recited examples and conditions. Moreover, all statements herein
        reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A system is provided for treating tumor
        tissue sites of a patient. At least first and second mono-polar
        electrodes are configured to be introduced at or near the tumor
        tissue site of the patient. A voltage pulse generator is coupled
        to the first and second mono-polar electrodes. The voltage pulse
        generator is configured to apply sufficient electrical pulses
        between the first and second mono-polar electrodes to induce
        electroporation of cells in the tumor tissue site, to create
        necrosis of cells of the tumor tissue site, but insufficient to
        create a thermal damaging effect to a majority of the tumor
        tissue site. <br>
