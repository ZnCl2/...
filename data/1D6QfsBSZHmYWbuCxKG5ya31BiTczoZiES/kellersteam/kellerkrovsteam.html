        <div align="left"><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>An eccentric rotor vane device that may be employed as
          pumps, blowers (or compressors), engines, or motors,
          characterized by an improved seal structure; in addition to
          conventional main chamber; first and second ports
          communicating with the main chamber; a plurality of annularly
          related radial vanes, independently pivotal and rotatable
          about a vane axis within the main chamber; a rotor that is
          eccentrically mounted with respect to the main chamber; a
          power delivery shaft connected with the rotor. The improved
          seal means, in specific embodiments, comprises a plurality of
          cylindrical rollers that serve as vane guides intermediate
          each pair of adjacent vanes. The cylindrical rollers adjacent
          each face of each respective vane engages its lateral face
          such that a satisfactory seal is made as the roller traverses
          radially inwardly and outwardly along the lateral face of the
          vane. Thus, the plurality of rollers serve as at least a part
          of a piston as well as an interdigitating means for effecting
          a change in volume of a subchamber defined intermediate the
          respective vanes, rollers, and interior wall in the main
          chamber. Also disclosed are improved vane structures for
          maintaining more nearly perfect seals for long service life.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This invention relates to an improvement in eccentric rotor,
          concentric vane devices that may be employed as pumps for
          pumping incompressible fluids, blowers for compressing and
          pumping compressible fluids, as engines powered by internal
          combustion of a fuel using either spark ignition cycle or the
          diesel cycle, or as motors powered by compressible or
          partially incompressible fluids.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Eccentric rotor, concentric vane devices have been known at
          least since the middle of the 19th century; U.S. Pat. Nos.
          43,744 and 83,186 being granted, respectively, in 1864 and
          1868 on rotary steam engines. Subsequently, there has been at
          least eighteen different United States patents issued on
          similar structures for one or more of the uses delineated
          hereinbefore. Yet, not a single one of the patented devices,
          insofar as I am aware, has achieved widespread commercial use.
          The failure to be widely useful is generally conceded to be
          due to lack of having a satisfactory seal between the vanes
          and the vane follower, or vane guide, portion of the rotor
          that interdigitates the vanes. The seal means attempted before
          my invention have either allowed too much leakage to be
          practical or have imposed too much frictional resistance to
          movement to allow the machines sufficient mechanical
          efficiency to be practical. The early attempts; the
          intermediate attempts, such as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No.
          2,129,431; and very recent attempts, such as delineated in
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,572,985, employed semi-cylindrical seal
          members slidably engaging each side of planar vanes as they
          slid radially inwardly and outwardly along the vanes. Other
          patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 2,022,209, described employing
          a seal having a knife-like edge that engaged planar vanes,
          attempting to seal as it moved radially inwardly and outwardly
          along the vanes. None effected the desired satisfactory seal.
          In my U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068, I delineated an improved seal
          structure that solved the problems of the prior art; including
          the art cited in that patent. With experience in different
          embodiments, alternative seal structures have been found to be
          equally efficacious and provide unobvious advantages over the
          prior art. For example, it has been found desirable to provide
          independent rolling friction intermediate respective rollers
          contiguous respective vane faces for effecting a low
          frictional drag and long life.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an
          eccentric rotor vane device that obviates the disadvantages of
          the prior art structure.<br>
          <br>
          Specifically, it is an object of this invention to provide an
          eccentric rotor vane device having an improved seal between
          the interdigitating portion of the rotor and adjacent vanes
          throughout the full 360 ( DEG) of rotation of the rotor such
          that the interdigitating portion can operate as a piston, as
          well as a vane guide and employ rolling friction intermediate
          a roller contiguous each adjacent face of each vane;
          regardless of whether the rotor vane device is being employed
          as a pump, blower, engine or motor.<br>
          <br>
          It is also an object of this invention to provide a rotor vane
          device having the same advantages as delineated in U.S. Pat.
          No. 3,748,068 and still provide the foregoing objects.<br>
          <br>
          These and other objects will become apparent from the
          descriptive matter hereinafter, particularly when taken in
          conjunction with the drawings.<br>

          <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated one embodiment of
          this invention in the form of a motor 11, or eccentric rotor,
          concentric vane motor device. The motor 11 comprises a stator
          13; a rotor, or rotor assembly, 15; and a vane assembly 17.
          The motor 11 is described in detail in my copending patent
          application entitled "Rotor Vane Motor Device", Ser. No.
          227,393, filed Feb. 18, 1972, now Pat. No. 3,797,975; and the
          descriptive matter contained therein is embodied by reference
          herein for complete description of the construction and
          operation of the motor. In that application, the motor
          described was a variable torque, vairable power motor
          employing the improved seals described in my aforementioned
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068; and having improved torque and power
          control means. The descriptive matter of U.S. Pat. No.
          3,748,068 is also incorporated herein by reference. In view of
          the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068 and the patent
          application Ser. No. 227,393, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975, the
          following abbreviated description is believed adequate and is
          afforded merely for the convenience of the reader to prevent
          having to refer to the delineated patent and patent
          application.<br>
          <br>
          The stator 13 includes a main body member 19 having a base or
          mounting bracket 21. The main body member 19 has peripherally
          disposed circular flanges (not shown) for affixing cap members
          at each side of the motor 11, or each end of a main chamber. A
          longitudinal cylindrical cavity 23 is formed in the inner face
          of the main body member 19 and includes a main chamber. An
          inlet port 25 is formed in the inner face of the main body
          member 19 and extends from the medial top, or 0 DEG, position
          thereof for about 50 DEG clockwise. The inlet port 25 has its
          leading and trailing edges 27 and 29 extending longitudinally
          for the full length of the main body member 19 for providing
          maximum flow area. The inlet port 25 communicates via
          passageway 31 in main body member 19 with a collar 33 to
          facilitate connecting an inlet of motor 11 with a high
          pressure source of working fluid, as described in detail in
          Ser. No. 227,393, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975. Similarly
          formed in the inner face of the main body member 19 is an
          exhaust, or discharge, port 35. The discharge port 35 has a
          leading edge 37 that extends longitudinally of the
          longitudinal cylindrical cavity 23 and main body member 19,
          and that is spaced about 25 DEG peripherally thereof from the
          trailing edge 29 of the inlet port 25. The discharge port 35
          also has a trailing edge 39 that extends longitudinally of the
          longitudinal cylindrical cavity 23 and trails the leading edge
          37 by approximately 90 DEG. The discharge port 35 communicates
          via passageway 41 in the main body member 19 with a collar 43
          to facilitate connection with a low pressure receiver, as
          described in the aforementioned Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat.
          No. 3,797,975.<br>
          <br>
          The pair of cap members at each side of the main body member
          19 and their attachments thereto is described in detail in
          Ser. No. 227,393, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975. Similarly
          described therein, are the mechanical accessories enabling
          rotation of the rotor and its shaft. The described accessories
          include; for example, the coaxial bearing sleeves that are
          integrally formed with the cap members; the thrust plate that
          is secured to the bearing sleeve by cap screws with a seal
          therebetween; the coaxial collar that is secured by cap screws
          to the outer end of the bearing sleeve and disposed about the
          rotor shaft extending therethrough; together with the
          respective shaft seals and bearings.<br>
          <br>
          As described in the above referenced Ser. No. 227,393, now
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975, the end caps also define exhaust or
          discharge chambers disposed longitudinally exteriorly of the
          openings in respective annular plates 49 disposed annularly
          about the rotor assembly 15, the latter being described in
          more detail hereinafter. The annularly disposed plates 49, as
          illustrated, have a plurality of discharge apertures 85 for
          discharging the fluid. The respective annularly disposed
          plates 49 may be rotated by suitable pinion gear or the like
          (not shown) to advance or retard the second set of discharge
          apertures 85 for further refinement in torque control,
          similarly as described in Ser. No. 227,393, now U.S. Pat. No.
          3,797,975.<br>
          <br>
          The rotor assembly 15 includes a pair of opposite and mating
          circular plates 45 at each end. The plates 45 engage, or
          proximate, the circular apertures 47 in the annularly disposed
          plates 49. If desired, bearing materials can be provided at
          the interface between the respective circular plates 45 and
          the inner walls of the apertures 47. The follower means, such
          as the vane guides 51, are retained intermediate the
          oppositely disposed faces of the circular plates 45 at each
          end of the rotor 15. The vane guides 51 serve as both pistons
          and means for interdigitating the vanes, thereby effecting a
          change in volume of subchambers 53 intermediate the respective
          adjacent vanes as the rotor assembly and the vanes are rotated
          within the main chamber. Each subchamber 53 is defined by a
          pair of confronting vane faces on its sides, a vane guide 51
          and an interior surface 55 of a torque control sleeve 57 at
          its radially inner and outer boundaries, and the annular
          plates 49 at its ends. Each subchamber 53 varies from a
          minimum volume at the outermost, or 0 DEG, position of the
          vane guide 51 to a maximum at the innermost, or 180 DEG,
          position of the vane guide 51. The vane guide 51 traverses
          inwardly and outwardly radially along the adjacent vanes to
          effect the improved seal that makes practical this invention,
          as described later hereinafter in more detail with respect to
          the vanes and the vane assembly.<br>
          <br>
          Each of the illustrated follower means comprises a vane guide
          51 that extends longitudinally along the rotor with vane
          engaging surface contiguous the lateral face of the vane. As
          illustrated, each vane guide comprises a plurality of
          cylindrical rollers 59 that are rotatably mounted on a shaft
          61. Rotation of each cylindrical roller 59 is facilitated by
          suitable bearing means, such as insert 63. As illustrated and
          described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068, each shaft 61 is fixed
          between shoulders (not shown) of the circular plates 45 by cap
          screws penetrating through apertures in the circular plates.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated hereinbefore and as described in U.S. Pat. No.
          3,748,068, a power shaft 65 is affixed to and extends
          coaxially from the circular plates 45 to the respective roller
          bearings in the bearing sleeves in the respective ends (all
          not shown). As indicated, the shaft 65 of motor 11 is
          journalled within coaxial collars and shaft seals and extends
          outwardly to deliver, as by way of suitable coupling means,
          power to using apparatus. If the device 11 is being employed
          as a pump or blower, the shaft delivers power to the rotor 15.<br>
          <br>
          The respective coupling means may be any of the conventional
          coupling means, including but not limited to linear in-line
          couplers, gear reducing couplers, or properly sized sheaves
          and endless member drives; such as belts or chains. As in
          conventional practice, one end of the coupling means will be
          connected with the shaft; as by key and slot combination, or
          splines (not shown).<br>
          <br>
          A second shaft also extends coaxially from the opposite
          circular plate 45 and is journalled for rotational movement in
          its roller bearings in bearing sleeves to provide additional
          support for the rotor assembly 15.<br>
          <br>
          As described in Ser. No. 227,393, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975,
          each of the shafts 65 has a male threaded portion that
          threadedly engages a tapped aperture in respective circular
          plates 45 when the shafts are threaded into tapped apertures,
          respective shoulders are pulled into tight engagement with the
          exterior of the respective circular plates 45 to form a strong
          connections therebetween. The threads are formed such that
          they are not loosened in normal rotation. Respective sets of
          roller thrust bearings are provided intermediate the exterior
          of the respective circular plates 45 and the adjacent end caps
          (not shown). If desired, thrust bearings may be counter sunk
          to keep the clearance intermediate the plates to a minimum.
          Preferably, aircraft type roller bearings are employed as
          thrust bearings, although other bearings may be employed as
          appropriate to the use of the device, or motor 11. Bearings
          provide improved structure and should not be omitted casually.<br>
          <br>
          The rotor assembly 15 is eccentrically disposed within the
          longitudinal cavity 23, and its power shaft 65 is eccentric
          with respect to the central axis of the longitudinal cavity
          23.<br>
          <br>
          The vane assembly 17 is located in a vane assembly cavity 67
          that is defined by the sleeve 57 concentrically within the
          longitudinal cavity 23. The vane assembly 17 includes a
          floating axle pin, or shaft, 69 that is substantially coaxial
          with the longitudinal cavity 23 and extends between the
          circular plates 45 of the rotor assembly 15. A plurality of
          vanes 71 extend radially outwardly from the axial pin 69 and
          are individually pivotal thereon. As illustrated, each vane is
          provided with a curved end plate 73 of substantially the same
          radius of curvature as the inner surface 55 of the sleeve 57.
          The curved end face 73 of each vane is in substantial sliding
          engagement with the sleeve 57 such that it forms a
          satisfactory seal for confining the fluid in the respective
          subchambers 53 on either side thereof. The seals intermediate
          the vanes 71 and the sleeve 57 have not been particularly
          critical because the differential pressure between adjacent
          subchambers 53 is not inordinately high and because the
          centrifugal force on the vanes 71 tends to retain sufficient
          sealing engagement between the respective vane ends 73 and
          sleeve 57. Any type of seal appropriate to the vane ends 73
          may be employed, as described in the aforementioned Ser. No.
          227,393 now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975 and U.S. Pat. No.
          3,748,068. The radially exterior end 73 of the respective
          vanes may be formed as desired to minimize the volume in the
          subchamber defined between the radially outermost ends of
          adjacent vanes. For example, the vanes 71 may have arcuate
          intruding shoulders to more closely fit the respective
          plurality of cylindrical rollers 59 of the rotor assembly 15
          to reduce the volume to near zero.<br>
          <br>
          As described in detail in Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No.
          3,797,975, each of the vanes 71 has integrally formed with the
          inner radial end thereof at least one annular knuckle 75 that
          conformingly engages the axle pin 69. The knucles 75 of
          respective vanes 71 are axially offset relative to each other
          along the axle pin 69 and are stacked on the axle pin with
          their confronting faces in sliding engagement to permit the
          relative interdigitating, or rocking, of the vanes 71 about
          the axle pin 69. It will be appreciated that; as specifically
          illustrated in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068; the
          vane central knuckle is twice as wide as ordinary and disposed
          intermediate the adjacent knuckles on either side. If desired,
          the vanes may have the respective knuckles disposed at
          one-half of the axle pin 69 plus the thickness of one knuckle
          and intermesh such that the use of the wide central knuckle is
          obviated. Any other method of supporting the vanes that will
          allow the interdigitating thereof may be employed. Since the
          vanes are accelerated and decelerated during rotation,
          however, symmetrical arrangement of the knuckles with respect
          to a transverse plane through the vane's center is preferable.<br>
          <br>
          The respective vanes 71 have lateral faces 77 that are
          concaved inwardly toward the central plane of the vane such
          that the respective followers, or vane guides, 51 are
          maintained in substantially uniform sealing engagement with
          the vane lateral faces 77 as the vane guides 51 traverse
          radially inwardly and outwardly therealong during rotation of
          the rotor assembly 15. By substantially uniform sealing
          engagement is meant an engagement such that a satisfactory
          seal is maintained intermediate the respective vane guides 51
          and the vanes 71 so that the vane guides 51 can serve as
          pistons as well as interdigitating means as they traverse
          radially inwardly and outwardly along the respective vanes 71.<br>
          <br>
          As is well recognized, what is satisfactory sealing engagement
          will vary depending upon the application, or use; which
          determines several pertinent factors. These factors include
          the size of the unit, the differential pressure across a vane
          guide 51 from the subchamber to the interior of the rotor
          assembly 15, the total pressure of the fluid being handled in
          the subchamber and the efficiency desired. To illustrate, I
          have found that as much as 0.010 inch clearance may be
          tolerated between the vane guides 51 and the vane lateral
          faces 77 with large motors such as may be employed with low
          pressure steam. For example, with low pressure steam that may
          be emitted from geothermal wells, the motor device may have
          dimensions as large as 30 inches in length by 36 inches in
          diameter; or larger, if used on individual steam wells. On the
          other hand, when employing the motor with a low entrophy fluid
          flowing therethrough, I have found it preferable that a
          clearance of less than 0.005 inch; for example, about
          0.001-0.003 inch; be employed between the surfaces of the vane
          guides 51 and the vane lateral faces 77. Lighter motors may be
          only about 4 inches in length and 6 inches in diameter, yet
          develope enough power to operate a small automobile.<br>
          <br>
          The improved seal means of this invention, as described
          hereinbelow, makes practical the eccentric rotor, concentric
          vane motor of this invention, that has all of the advantages
          of the invention of U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068 and the
          aforementioned Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975.
          This improved seal preferably employs a plurality that is an
          even number of cylindrical rollers 59 intermediate each pair
          of adjacent vanes 71. By this structure, each of the rollers
          59 engages respective lateral faces 77 of the vane contiguous
          therewith, as well as engage the surface of any adjacent
          cylindrical roller 59 with rolling friction. Thus, reduced
          friction is effected for more efficient operation. Moreover,
          there is substantially no wear and the wear is evenly
          apportioned, because of the rolling interconnection between
          contiguous surfaces, the rolling of contiguous surfaces being
          in the same direction, or compatible rather than opposite, for
          still less friction. Consequently, the improved seal means is
          durable and trouble-free, the cylindrical rollers rolling
          along the vane faces and in contact with each other.<br>
          <br>
          As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068 and Ser. No. 227,393 now
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975, I have attempted to delineate,
          through mathematical experts and computer computations, the
          exact definition of the concavity of the lateral faces 77 but
          have not been successful to date. The concavity can be
          delineated graphically, employing a scale that is larger than
          actual size. I have developed an empirical formula by
          trigonometry which is close also. In practice, I have found
          exact mathematical delineation to be unnecessary. Instead, I
          employ a grinding jig with grinding rollers to duplicate the
          physical relationships and dimensions employed in a particular
          motor device 11. Specifically, the grinding of the vane faces
          is effected by repeatedly moving the vanes and sized grinding
          rollers through 360 DEG as the vanes are moved by the rotor
          assembly 15, with increasing distances of eccentricity up to
          the eccentricity actually employed in the motor device 11. By
          increasing distances of eccentrically is meant the increasing
          moving apart, with successive revolutions, of the shaft of the
          vane axle pin 69 and the axis of the shaft of the grinder
          rollers that is equivalent to the axis of the shaft of the
          rotor assembly 15, as described in Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S.
          Pat. No. 3,797,975. In this way, I get exact initial
          engagement and do not have to worry about the clearance. Once
          a particular vane contour, or concavity, has been established
          for a particular motor, it may be reproduced by conventional
          methods of copying.<br>
          <br>
          In the above referenced Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No.
          3,797,975, there was described an integral adjusting flow
          through and torque control means for controlling torque output
          of the motor 11 so that it could be operated without requiring
          a throttle and the throttle-caused losses in efficiency. That
          does not comprise a part of this invention, per se, and need
          not be described in detail herein. It is sufficient to note
          that the flow through and torque control means comprises the
          torque control sleeve 57, delineated hereinbefore, that is
          conformingly disposed interiorly of the longitudinal
          cylindrical cavity 23. The torque sleeve 57 mates with and
          telescopes within the cavity 23 and rotatably and slidably
          engages the inside face of the cavity to permit angular
          adjustment of the torque control sleeve 57. The torque control
          sleeve has at least an inlet aperture in the form of a first
          set of longitudinally extending slots 79. The inlet slots 79
          communicate between the interior of the vane assembly cavity
          67 and the inlet port 25. It is sufficient to note in the
          abbreviated description herein that advancing of the torque
          control sleeve by suitable gear 81 will increase the effective
          flow area through the inlet apertures until the inlet aperture
          is at a maximum. On the other hand, the torque control sleeve
          57 may be retarded or rotated in a second direction opposite
          the first direction to decrease the effective flow area of the
          inlet aperture and inlet port. The degree of retardation may
          be sufficient to completely close off the inlet port or to
          effect a reduced flow of fluid through the motor. The
          respective means for controlling the gear 87 is described in
          detail in Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No. 3,797,975 and is
          not shown or described herein.<br>
          <br>
          Also, the use of discharge slots 83 to control the discharge
          independently for reducing losses from over expansion or under
          expansion of a working fluid flowing through the motor 11 was
          described in detail in Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No.
          3,797,975.<br>
          <br>
          In operation, a fluid will enter through the inlet passageway
          31 and inlet port 25, entering into the respective subchambers
          53 at their minimum volume position near the top. The point of
          entry may be controlled by the torque control sleeve 57. The
          fluid is preferably an expansible fluid that will do work as
          it expands to effect rotation of the respective vanes and act
          against the respective vane guides, or plurality rollers 59,
          serving as a piston. This forces rotation of the rotor
          assembly and the work output shaft as the fluid expands to the
          maximum position near the bottom. Shortly past the bottom, the
          fluid will be vented through a second set of discharge
          apertures 85 in the annularly disposed plates 49, or through
          the discharge slots 83 and discharge port 35, depending upon
          which are set earlier by the respective torque control means.
          Thus, as each subchamber is rotated, the fluid contained
          therein is allowed to do work and deliver power from the motor
          11 before the fluid is begun to be discharged in its fully
          expanded condition directly to the pressure existing in the
          discharge passageway 41, without any throttle control losses.
          The respective sealing surfaces on the respective plurality of
          rollers 59 remain contiguous and in sealing engagement with a
          rolling action to minimize friction and wear.<br>
          <br>
          Another embodiment of this invention is illustrated in FIG. 2.
          Therein, only a portion of the torque control sleeve 57 is
          illustrated since the environment is the same as described
          hereinbefore with respect to FIG. 1. As illustrated in FIG. 2,
          each respective vane guide 51 comprises two cylindrical
          rollers 59A and 59B that are affixed by their respective
          shafts 61 to the circular plates 45, similarly as described
          hereinbefore. As illustrated in FIG. 2, however, the
          respective plurality of rollers 59A and 59B are not contiguous
          each other, but are contiguous an intermediate member 87.
          Specifically, the respective cylindrical rollers 59A and 59B
          engage the respective seals 89 and 91 that are sealingly
          engaged in recesses in the coextensive and longitudinally
          extending intermediate member 87. Expressed otherwise, the
          intermediate member 87 extends coextensive with the respective
          rollers 59A and 59B longitudinally of the rotor assembly 15
          and is sealingly affixed to the circular plates 45, similarly
          as are the shafts 61 of the rollers.<br>
          <br>
          As illustrated, the respective vanes 71 have their vane
          lateral faces 77 contoured to maintain the desired sealing
          engagement with the surfaces of the respective rollers 59A and
          59B, as described hereinbefore with respect to the lateral
          faces 77 of the vanes 71. Otherwise, the structure of the
          vanes, with their axle pin 69; the vane assembly 17; the rotor
          assembly 15; the main body member 19 and the respective inlet
          and discharge ports 25 and 35 are the same and the operation
          is the same as described with respect to the embodiment of
          FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, it can be seen that in the embodiment of FIG. 2, the
          respective rollers 59A and 59B engage their respective
          contiguous vane lateral faces 77 with a rolling action as the
          vane guides 51 move radially inwardly and outwardly along the
          vanes 71. This rolling action attains the desired lowered
          friction and reduced wear, similarly as described hereinbefore
          with respect to the embodiment of FIG. 1. If desired, the
          intermediate memberr 87 may have a plurality of roller
          bearings for sealingly engaging the rolling surface of the
          respective cylindrical rollers 59A and 59B, instead of or in
          addition to the respective seals 89 and 91.<br>
          <br>
          Still another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in
          FIGS. 3 and 4. In FIG. 3, the same embodiment about the torque
          sleeve 57 is employed as described with respect to FIG. 1.
          Similarly, the same cylindrical rollers 59 are employed as the
          vane guides 51, as described with respect to FIG. 1. In the
          embodiments of FIGS. 3 and 4, however, each vane 71 comprises
          first and second members 93 and 95 that are biased toward
          their respective contiguous rollers 59 for maintaining the
          satisfactory sealing engagement therewith. Respective first
          and second members may comprise simply a bifurcated end of an
          integral vane in which the physical properties of the material
          of which the vane is made biases the first and second members
          toward their respective rollers 59. As illustrated, however,
          the second member 95 is pivotally mounted such that its
          radially outermost end is biased away from the radially
          outermost end of the first member 93. The pivotal mounting may
          comprise simply a quasi-cylindrical head 97 that is embedded
          in a suitable slot 99 in the main body of the vane, with or
          without an inherent bias being effected. On the other hand,
          one or both of the first and second members may be sealingly
          mounted on a fulcrum shaft if desired. Sealing of the
          quasi-cylindrical head in a conforming slot 99 is more easily
          effected. It is apparent, however, that the use of a vane 71
          having a bifurcated end forming the first and second members
          93 and 95 automatically effects sealing and overcomes the
          problem with sealing, although it is relatively expensive to
          form the slot intermediate the bifurcated members.<br>
          <br>
          In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the first and second members have
          a spring member 101 seated in respective recesses 103 and
          biasing the radially outermost ends of the respective vanes 71
          toward their respective contiguous rollers 59.<br>
          <br>
          In the embodiment of FIG. 4, the space intermediate the
          respective first and second members 93 and 95 is filled with a
          compressible material for effecting the biasing of the
          radially outermost ends of the vanes 71 toward their
          respective contiguous rollers 59. As illustrated, the
          compressible material is the compressible fluid that is being
          flowed through the motor 11, FIG. 1. If desired, the
          compressible material may be a resilient material such as the
          elastomeric materials like rubber. The elastomeric material
          should be resistant to the fluid being flowed through the
          motor. For example, the synthetic rubbers like Neoprene or
          Buna N, may be employed satisfactorily.<br>
          <br>
          The embodiments of FIGS. 3 and 4 operate similarly as
          described hereinbefore with respect to the embodiments of
          FIGS. 1 and 2. It is noteworthy, however, that good sealing
          contact is made because of the flexibility and the biasing of
          the bifurcated first and second members toward their
          respective contiguous rollers 59. The resulting compressive
          force exerted on the contiguous rollers 59 also assists in
          maintaining sealing contact between the respective surfaces of
          the rollers as wear develops between the respective shafts and
          inserts 61 and 63.<br>
          <br>
          The operation of the motor 11 as a pump or air compressor is
          described in the hereinbefore referenced U.S. Pat. No.
          3,748,068 and that descriptive matter need not be repeated
          herein.<br>
          <br>
          The materials of construction ordinarily employed in this art
          may be employed herein and no exotic new materials are
          necessary. The structural strength and the wearing properties
          of the materials that interface together will be chosen
          appropriate to the application. For example, in certain
          applications it may be possible to employ plastics to reduce
          the friction as they interface with adjacent metallic
          components. In general, we have been working with the most
          deleterious types of materials, such as steam, and have
          employed noncorrodable metals in those surfaces in contact
          with such materials, or fluids.<br>
          <br>
          It is noteworthy that when the device is employed as an air
          compressor, or blower, similarly as described in U.S. Pat. No.
          3,748,068, it has many advantages that are not found in the
          ordinary blowers. For example, in centrifugal blower
          embodiments, there is no problem of balancing; since the rotor
          assembly 15 may be run with up to several pounds
          out-of-balance mass in the larger sizes. This is in contrast
          to only a few ounces, or less of imbalance that is tolerable
          in conventional blowers. For example, I have designed a large
          diameter unit to serve as a centrifugal blower that will
          deliver up to five million standard cubic feet per minute of
          air for use in magneto hydrodynamics applications. There is no
          conventional blower that can presently supply this amount of
          air. The use of rolling friction with the improved plurality
          of cylindrical rollers enables employing large size units
          without intolerable friction.<br>
          <br>
          From the foregoing, it can be seen that a highly efficient
          positive displacement device is provided that finally achieves
          all of the advantages heretofore known but not practically
          achieveable because of the difficulty with seals intermediate
          the rotor assembly and the vanes. Specifically, this invention
          provides a rotor vane device that achieves the objects
          delineated hereinbefore and obviates the disadvantages of the
          prior art devices. Its size and weight are unbelieveably more
          compact and lighter than conventional air compressors. The use
          of roller vane guides, with the attendant rolling friction,
          effects a long-wearing, trouble-free seal that is an important
          advance in the technology to improve our ecology. The rotor
          vane device also makes practical an essentially nonpolluting
          engine that may be used as an expander in an external
          combustion Rankine cycle system.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,068, the large
          changes in volume of the subchambers allow unusually large
          variation in compression ratios when the rotor vane device is
          employed as an engine.<br>
          <br>
          Also, the numerous advantages of the motor 11 are described in
          the above reference Ser. No. 227,393 now U.S. Pat. No.
          3,797,975. These numerous and lengthy advantages are not
          repeated herein, although this invention also provides these
          same advantages over the art prior to the above described Ser.

          A wide variety of other embodiments employing the basic
          improved seal are feasible. Only a few of the different
          embodiments are implicit and explicit in the descriptive
          matter hereinbefore. It would be virtually impossible to
          catalogue all of the embodiments. Hence, although this
          invention has been described with a certain degree of
          particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure
          has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes
          in the details of construction and the combination and
          arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from
          the spirit and the scope of this invention.<br>
