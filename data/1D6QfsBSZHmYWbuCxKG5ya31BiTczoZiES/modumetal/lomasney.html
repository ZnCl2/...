      </b>An inexpensive new process can increase the strength of metals
      such as steel by as much as 10 times, and make them much more
      resistant to corrosion. If the modified metals pass field testing,
      the new process could go on to make bridges and other
      infrastructure last far longer; it could also make cars lighter
      and therefore more fuel-efficient.<br>
      <br>
      The Seattle-based startup that developed the process, Modumetal,
      is commercializing it in part with collaboration with the oil
      companies Chevron, Conoco-Philips, and Hess.<br>
      <br>
      Parts made using the technology are being tested in oil fields
      now. Some oil contains highly corrosive chemicals such as hydrogen
      sulfide that quickly damage production equipment. The new
      technology could make those parts last much longer and thus lower
      the cost of pursuing unconventional sources of oil. That could be
      just the first of a wide range of applications.<br>
      <br>
      The advance is based on the fact that controlling the structure of
      metals at the nanoscale can imbue those materials with new
      properties. This has been possible for some time, but it’s been
      difficult to do reliably and economically with large pieces of
      metal. Modumetal has developed a process that gives it precise
      control over the structure of metals, and which allows it to make
      parts that are meters long. CEO Christina Lomasney says the
      process costs the same as conventional metal treatments such as
      galvanization.<br>
      <br>
      Modumetal uses an advanced form of electroplating, a process
      already used to make the chrome plating you might see on the
      engine and exhaust pipes of a motorcycle. Electroplating involves
      immersing a metal part in a chemical bath containing various metal
      ions, and then applying an electrical current to cause those ions
      to form a metal coating.<br>
      <br>
      The company uses a bath that contains more than one kind of metal
      ion and controls how ions are deposited by varying the electrical
      current. By changing the current at precise moments, it can create
      a layered structure, with each layer being several nanometers
      thick and of different composition. The final coating can be up to
      a centimeter thick and can greatly change the properties of the
      original material.<br>
      <br>
      David Lashmore, a professor of materials science at the University
      of New Hampshire who has conducted work in the area, says
      nano-engineered layers can make a material stronger by stopping
      cracks from moving through it.<br>
      <br>
      Lashmore says making the process work at a large scale requires a
      detailed understanding of the physics and chemistry involved to
      produce exactly the right alloys. Modumetal’s work is “really
      impressive,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Modumetal is ramping up its production capacity at its factory in
      Snohomish County, Washington. The company’s cost claims have yet
      to be proved in large-scale production, and before the materials
      can be widely used, standards bodies will need to develop tests to
      ensure their performance.<br>

        <b>FUNCTIONALLY GRADED COATINGS AND CLADDINGS FOR CORROSION AND
          HIGH TEMPERATURE PROTECTION</b><br>
        <b>US2012234681</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The present disclosure describes functionally graded coatings and
      claddings for corrosion and high temperature protection<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
      Application No. 61/186,057, filed Jun. 11, 2009, tilted
      Functionally Graded Coatings and Claddings for Corrosion and High
      Temperature Protection, incorporates herein by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] A process for depositing functionally graded materials and
      structures is described for manufacturing materials that possess
      the high temperature and corrosion resistant performance of
      ceramics and glasses, while at the same time eliminating the
      common mismatches encountered when these are applied to structural
      metal or composite substrates. An example of the structure of a
      functionally graded coating is shown in FIG. 1. An example of the
      functionally graded coating structure applied to a pipe is shown
      in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Electrolytic deposition describes the deposition of metal
      coatings onto metal or other conductive substrates and can be used
      to deposit metal and ceramic materials via electrolytic and
      electrophoretic methods. Electrodeposition which is a low-cost
      method for forming a dense coating on any conductive substrate and
      which can be used to deposit organic primer (i.e. “E-coat”
      technology) and ceramic coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The embodiments described herein include methods and
      materials utilized in manufacturing functionally graded coatings
      or claddings for at least one of corrosion, tribological and high
      temperature protection of an underlying substrate. The technology
      described herein also is directed to articles which include a wear
      resistant, corrosion resistant and/or high temperature resistant
      coating including a functionally-graded matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] One embodiment provides a method which will allow for the
      controlled growth of a functionally-graded matrix of metal and
      polymer or metal and ceramic on the surface of a substrate, which
      can corrode, or otherwise degrade, such as a metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another embodiment provides a method which includes the
      electrophoretic deposition of controlled ratios of ceramic
      pre-polymer and atomic-scale expansion agents to form a ceramic
      (following pyrolysis). This form of electrophoretic deposition may
      then be coupled with electrolytic deposition to form a hybrid
      structure that is functionally graded and changes in concentration
      from metal (electrolytically deposited) to ceramic, polymer or
      glass (electrophoretically deposited).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Embodiments of the methods described here provide a
      high-density, corrosion and/or heat resistant material (e.g.,
      ceramic, glass, polymer) that is deposited onto the surface of a
      substrate to form a functionally-graded polymer:metal,
      ceramic:metal, or glass:metal coating. The result is a coating, of
      controlled density, composition, hardness, thermal conductivity,
      wear resistance and/or corrosion resistance, that has been grown
      directly onto a surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The functionally-graded coating made according to the
      methods disclosed hereinmay be resistant to spallation due to
      mismatch in any of: coefficient of thermal expansion, hardness,
      ductility, toughness, elasticity or other property (together
      “Interface Property”), between the substrate and the ceramic,
      polymer, pre-ceramic polymer (with or without fillers) or glass
      (together “Inert Phase”) as the coating incorporates a material at
      the substrate interface, which more closely matches the Interface
      Property of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In general, coatings made according to methods described
      herein are resistant to wear, corrosion and/or heat due to the
      hard, abrasion-resistant, non-reactive and/or heat-stable nature
      of the Inert Phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Polymer-derived ceramics that incorporate active fillers
      (e.g., TiN, Ti disilicide, and others) to improve density, have
      shown promise as a way to process a variety of Inert Phases, which
      are more dense than polymer-derived ceramics which do not
      incorporate these fillers. Polymer-derived ceramic composites have
      been demonstrated for applications, including-oxidation resistance
      and thermal barriers, due to their high density and low open-pore
      volume (e.g., the ceramic has less than 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or
      50 percent voids based on volume). See, J D Torrey and R K Bordia,
      Journal of European Ceramic Society 28 (2008) 253-257. These
      polymer-derived ceramics can be electrophoretically deposited.
      Electrophoretic deposition is a two-step process. In a first step,
      particles suspended in a liquid are forced to move towards one of
      the electrodes by applying an electric field to the suspension
      (electrophoresis). In a second step (deposition), the particles
      collect at one of the electrodes and form a coherent deposit on
      it. Since the local composition of the deposit is directly related
      to the concentration and composition of the suspension at the
      moment of deposition, the electrophoretic process allows
      continuous processing of functionally graded materials.
      Polymer-derived ceramics is the method used in commercial
      production of Nicalon® and Tyranno fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In embodiments, the technology of this disclosure includes
      the use of electrochemical deposition processes to produce
      composition-controlled functionally-graded coating through
      chemical and electrochemical control of the initial suspension.
      This deposition process is referred to as Layered Electrophoretic
      and Faradaic Depostion (LEAF). By controlling the composition and
      current evolution during the deposition process, LEAF affords the
      means to engineer step-graded and continuously graded
      compositions; see Figs. and reference graphs that show dependence
      of Ni and Si as a function of solution chemistry and current
      density. Control of current evolution and direction of the
      electric field also offers the possibility to orient anisotropic
      powders allowing intimate control of both the density AND the
      morphology of the Inert Phase (e.g., the content and organization
      of added ceramic, polymer or glass materials incorporated into an
      electrodeposited functionally-graded coating). For example, in one
      embodiment by controlling current evolution and the direction of
      the electric field in a solution including pre-ceramic polymer,
      the resulting density of ceramic can be varied through the
      coatings to produce a varying morphology of ceramic/metal
      composition.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0019] Polymer-derived ceramics have shown promise as a novel
      way to process low-dimensional ceramics, including matrices,
      fibers and coatings. Polymer-derived ceramic composites have been
      demonstrated for applications including oxidation barriers, due to
      their high density and low open-pore volume. See, Torrey and R K
      Bordia, Journal of European Ceramic Society 28 (2008) 253-257.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The Active Filler Controlled Pyrolysis (AFCoP),
      polymer-derived ceramics offer many benefits over tradition
      ceramic processing methods including:<br>
      <br>
      Liquid form with low crosslinking temperature<br>
      High purity reactants<br>
      Tailorable composition, microstructure, nanostructures and
      properties<br>
      Ability to produce crystalline and beta-SiC phases<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Pure polymer-derived ceramics suffer from certain
      performance limitations.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] One such limitation is the occurrence of volume
      shrinkage—up to 50%, upon sintering. To prevent this, and in order
      to increase the density of PDC matrices, the AFCoP process is
      employed, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] To produce fully-dense ceramic matrices, the active-filler
      additive can be occluded into the liquid polymer prior to casting
      and sintering. During sintering, this additive acts as an
      expansion agent, resulting in a fully dense part with near zero
      volume loss (e.g., there are no voids present). Active fillers
      include Si, Al, Ti and other metals, which on pyrolysis form SiC,
      Al2O3 or TiSi2, for example. One of the limitations of this
      process, as it is practiced currently, is the limited reactivity
      of the fillers. In many cases, due to kinetic limitations, even
      for the finest available powders, the filler conversion is
      incomplete. As will be shown in the processes described herein,
      the reactive “filler” and the polymer will mixed at molecular
      scale leading to highly efficient conversion of the filler to the
      product phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Polymer-derived ceramics and in particular, AFCoP ceramics,
      have shown promise as a novel way to process a variety of ceramics
      forms, including matrices, fibers and coatings. Polymer-derived
      ceramic composites have been demonstrated for applications,
      including-oxidation resistance and thermal barriers, due to their
      high density and low open-pore volume. See, J D Torrey and R K
      Bordia, Journal of European Ceramic Society 28 (2008) 253-257. In
      the some embodiments of this disclosure the AFCoP concept and the
      LEAF deposition process are combined to enable a manufacturing
      capability which can produce tailorable, low-cost,
      ultra-high-performance SiCf/SiC composites and parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The Layered Electrophoretic And Faradaic (LEAF) production
      process employed herein enables the low-cost production of
      tailored ceramic matrices. A schematic of one embodiment of that
      process described in Scheme A.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="092746074-emi-c00001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Starting from SiC powders and fiber, a first portion of the
      LEAF process consists in depositing either direct SiC powders,
      pre-ceramic polymer emulsions (including active fillers) or a
      combination of these onto the SiC fiber. Electrophoretic
      deposition is a two-step process. In a first step, particles
      suspended in a liquid are forced to move towards one of the
      electrodes by applying an electric field to the suspension
      (electrophoresis). In a second step (deposition), the particles
      collect at one of the electrodes and form a coherent deposit on
      it. Since the local composition of the deposit is directly related
      to the concentration and composition of the suspension at the
      moment of deposition, the electrophoretic process allows
      continuous continuous processing of functionally graded materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A variety of substrates may be employed to prepare the
      compositions described herein. In one embodiment, the compositions
      are prepared by the LEAF electrophoretic deposition process
      outlined above on fiber mat as illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The LEAF process offers the ability to reliably produce
      composition-controlled “green” (not yet sintered) ceramic through
      chemical and electrochemical control of the initial suspension. By
      shaping the starting fiber, which serves as a mandrel, LEAF
      provides a means to manufacture free standing parts of complex

      [0033] By controlling the composition and current evolution during
      deposition process, LEAF affords the means to engineer step-graded
      and continuously graded compositions. Control of current evolution
      and direction of the electric field also offers the possibility to
      orient anisotropic powders allowing intimate control of both the
      density AND the morphology of the ceramic deposit.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Layer thickness can be controlled by, among other things,
      the application of current in the electrodeposition process. In
      some embodiments current density may be varied within the range
      between 0.5 and 2000 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;. Other ranges for current
      densities are also possible, for example, a current density may be
      varied within the range between: about 1 and 20 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;;
      about 5 and 50 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; about 30 and 70 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; 0.5
      and 500 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; 100 and 2000 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; greater than
      about 500 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; and about 15 and 40 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;base
      on the surface area of the substrate or mandrel to be coated. In
      some embodiments the frequency of the wave forms may be from about
      0.01 Hz to about 50 Hz. In other embodiments the frequency can be
      from: about 0.5 to about 10 Hz; 0.02 to about 1 Hz or from about 2
      to 20 Hz; or from about 1 to about 5 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In some embodiments the electrical potential employed to
      prepare the coatings is in the range of 5V and 5000 V. In other
      embodiments the electrical potential is within a range selected
      from 5 and 200 V; about 50 and 500 V; about 100 and 1000 V; 250
      and 2500 V; 500 and 3000 V; 1,000 and 4,000 V; and 2000 and 5000
      V.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In addition to direct electrophoretic deposition of SiC
      pre-polymers onto SiC fibers, studies have also demonstrated the
      co-deposition of densification additives. This is similar to the
      AFCoP process described above. These active-filler additives allow
      low-temperature densification without any detrimental effects on
      the fibers, as many densification additives can be sintered well
      below the re-crystallization temperature of the SiCf. See, A. R.
      Boccaccini et al., Journal of European Ceramic Society 17 (1997)
      1545-1550. By combining these additives into the LEAF process, it
      is possible to produce high density and density graded ceramic
      matrices.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Density gradation allows for the design and development of
      a highly optimized SiC-fiber:SiC-matrix interface. Density
      gradation provides a means for balancing the optimization of the
      interface strength, while still maintaining a high density, and in
      some embodiments gas impermeable and hermetically sealed matrix.
      Gas impermeability is especially important in corrosion protection
      where a high level of gas diffusion through the coating may result
      in substrate attack. The LEAF process enables control and
      gradation of density such that a high density region near the
      substrate may protect the substrate from attack while a low
      density region near the surface may reduce the thermal
      conductivity of the coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] It is believed to be possible to join non oxide ceramics
      using preceramic polymers with active fillers based on the work of
      Borida. See, J D Torrey and R K Bordia, Journal of European
      Ceramic Society 28 (2008) 253-257. In regard t the embodiments
      described herein, refinement of the microstructure of ceramics
      joined by the LEAF processes leads to higher bond strengths In one
      embodiment of the technology, a sample composition can be
      controlled by controlling the voltage. Specifically, by slowly
      transitioning from a low voltage electrolytic deposition regime to
      a high voltage electrophoretic deposition regime it may be
      possible to create a functionally-graded material that gradually
      changes from metal to ceramic or polymer. The same could be
      achieved by controlling the current to selectively deposit ionic
      (metal) species and/or charged particle (Inert Phase) species. To
      create a metal:ceramic functionally graded SiC composite material
      would significantly increase the corrosion-resistance,
      wear-resistance, toughness, durability and temperature stability
      of a ceramic-coated structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In another embodiment, the coating composition can be
      functionally-graded by modifying the metal concentration in the
      electrolyte solution during electrochemical deposition. This
      approach affords an additional means to control the composition of
      the functionally-graded coating, and allows for deposition to
      occur at relatively lower current densities and voltages, which
      produced a better quality in the deposited composites. The
      standard cathodic emulsion system, where the emulsion particles
      comprise polymer, pre-ceramic polymer, ceramic or a combination
      thereof, can be adjusted by adding increasing amounts of nickel to
      the solution. This embodiment is described in Example #3.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In other embodiments, this disclosure provides a corrosion
      resistant coating, which changes in composition throughout its
      depth, from a high metal concentration at the interface with the
      substrate to which it is applied to an Inert Phase at the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a
      heat resistant coating, which changes in composition throughout
      its depth, from a high metal concentration at the interface with
      the substrate to which it is applied to an Inert Phase at the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As used herein “Inert Phase” means any polymer, ceramic,
      pre-ceramic polymer (with or without fillers) or glass, which can
      be electrophoretically deposited. This Inert Phase may include
      Al2O3, SiO2, TiN, BN, Fe2O3, MgO, and TiO2, SiC, TiO, TiN, silane
      polymers, polyhydriromethylsilazane and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In some embodiments, ceramic particles may include of one
      or more metal oxides that can be selected from ZrxOx, YtOx, AlxOx,
      SiOx, FeOxOx, TiOx, MgO where x=1-4, and include mixed metal
      oxides with the structure MxY, where M is a metal and Y is ZrxOx,
      YtOx, AlxOx, SiOx, FexOx, TiOx, MgO. In another embodiment, M is
      selected from Li, Sr, La, W, Ta, Hf, Cr, Ca, Na, Al, Ti, Zr, Cs,
      Ru, and Pb.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As used herein, “metal” means any metal, metal alloy or
      other composite containing a metal. These metals may comprise one
      or more of Ni, Zn, Fe, Cu, Au, Ag, Pd, Sn, Mn, Co, Pb, Al, Ti, Mg
      and Cr. In embodiments where metals are deposited, the percentage
      of each metal may independently be selected. Individual metals may
      be present at about 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10,
      15, 20, 25, 30, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85,

      electrodeposited species/composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In other embodiments, the coating can have a coating
      thickness that varies according to properties of the material that
      is to be protected by the coating, or according to the environment
      that the coating is subjected to. In some embodiments, the coating
      can range from 0.2 and 250 millimeters, and in other embodiments
      the range can vary from 0.2 to 25 millimeters, 25 to 250
      millimeters, or be greater than about 25 millimeter and less than
      about 250 millimeters. In still other embodiments, the coating
      thickness can range from 0.5 to 5 millimeters, 1 to 10
      millimeters, 5 to 15 millimeters, 10 to 20 millimeters, and 15 to
      25 millimeters. In still other embodiments, the overall thickness
      of the functionally-graded coating can vary greatly as, for
      example, between 2 micron and 6.5 millimeters or more. In some
      embodiments the overall thickness of the functionally-graded
      coating can also be between 2 nanometers and 10,000 nanometers, 4
      nanometers and 400 nanometers, 50 nanometers and 500 nanometers,
      100 nanometers and 1,000 nanometers, 1 micron to 10 microns, 5
      microns to 50 microns, 20 microns to 200 microns, 200 microns to 2

      <br>
      [0046] The functionally graded coatings described herein are
      suitable for coating a variety of substrates that are susceptible
      to wear and corrosion. In one embodiment the substrates are
      particularly suited for coating substrates made of materials that
      can corrode and wear such as iron, steel, aluminum, nickel,
      cobalt, iron, manganese, copper, titanium, alloys thereof,
      reinforced composites and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The functionally graded coatings described herein may be
      employed to protect against numerous types of corrosion,
      including, but not limited to corrosion caused by oxidation,
      reduction, stress (stress corrosion), dissolution,
      dezincification, acid, base, sulfidation and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The functionally graded coatings described herein may be
      employed to protect against thermal degradation. In one
      embodiment, the coatings will have a lower thermal conductivity
      than the substrates (e.g., metal surfaces) to which they are
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The coatings described herein may be employed to protect
      against numerous types of corrosion, including, but not limited to
      corrosion caused by oxidation, reduction, stress (stress

      and the like. In one embodiment, the coatings are resistant to the
      action of strong mineral acid, such as sulfuric, nitric, and
      hydrochloric acids.<br>

      <b>Toughness Improvements Employing Leaf Processes to Incorporate
        a Low-Content of Metal Binder Into Composites</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0091] In order to improve toughness, the LEAF processes a
      low-content of a metal binder (e.g., nickel in this Example) may
      be incorporated into composites. As shown in FIG. 6, the
      concentration of nickel in deposits can be controlled by changing
      the current density employed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>A Functionally Graded Coating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0092] In order to create a functionally-graded coating, a
      standard nickel plating bath was added to the polymer emulsion in
      1% increments by volume up to 10%.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Samples were subsequently exposed to a DC current for a
      fixed period. The bath was stirred and agitated at the conclusion
      of each test in order to ensure proper solution mixing and
      suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The observations attained from the optical image of the
      samples were confirmed by the EDX compositional analysis. The Ni
      composition of the coating was increasing as the Ni concentration
      in solution increased. These results once again demonstrate the
      feasibility of creating a functionally graded ceramic:metal
      composite material by controlling the concentration of metal and
      Inert Phases in the electrolyte during the deposition process.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In addition, the data demonstrated that the silicon content
      in the deposit remain constant over time. This result is to be
      expected as a result of the voltage driven nature of
      electrophoretic deposition, and a constant current density and
      similar voltages were used for the samples. The nickel emulsion
      system can be optimized through concentration alteration and
      current and voltage modulation to create a structural material
      suitable for corrosion resistant, wear resistant, heat resistant
      and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Nickel, a siloxane-based pre-ceramic polymer particles and
      ceramic SiC particles are added to an organic electrolyte Note
      that in this case, the polymer is not deposited as an emulsion,
      but rather directly as a lacquer. A cathode and an anode were
      connected to a power supply. The substrate was connected to the
      cathode and inert anodes were connected to the anode. A potential
      was applied across the anodes and cathode, which potential ramped
      from a low voltage (around 5-100V) to a high voltage (about
      100-1000V). The high voltage was held for a period of time. In an
      SEM of the resulting structure, where gray masses are the SiC
      fibers the darker gray areas are a mixed matrix of SiOC and SiC.
      SiOC is present due to the heat treatment in an environment in
      which oxygen was present. The white areas are where the nickel was
      able to infiltrate into the cracks and reinforce the structure of
      the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The addition of the SiC filler particles into the
      pre-ceramic polymer led to the densification and, strengthening of
      the specimen by reducing shrinkage on formation. The sub-micron
      size of the filler particles facilitated the flow and migration of
      the matrix around the SiC fibers. The upper-right corner of the
      image contains a zoomed in view of the interface around a fiber.
      Any gaps present were filled and strengthened by the nickel metal
      deposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Fiber break analysis was performed on a selection of
      samples that contained the functionally graded metal:SiC structure
      to determine the toughness and fracture characteristics of various
      SiC bundles. The toughness of the fiber matrix can be determined
      through the visual inspection of fiber pull-out during fracture.
      This is observed in SEM images of the fracture surface of a dipped
      coated ceramic bundle cross-linked at 500° F. for 2 hours.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This disclosure relates to an improved material, process,
      and design for constructing storage tanks for flammable and
      combustible fluids. Storage tanks produced using the disclosed
      methods and materials will a) reduce the risks of flame spread and
      explosion in the event of both low- and high-strain-rate
      (ballistic) impacts, b) allow for the production of arbitrary,
      conformable tank geometries, and c) provide enhanced
      strength-to-weight ratios over existing storage tanks for
      combustible and flammable fluid storage. Additional advantages
      afforded by the claimed material include resistance to chemical
      attack and enhanced dissipation of both heat and static charge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Vehicles (automobiles, tanks, airplanes, boats, etc.)
      typically possess fuel tanks in which liquid fuel is free to move,
      or ‘slosh’, often resulting in a build up of static charge and an
      accompanying risk of ignition and subsequent explosion.
      Additionally, both liquid and gaseous fuel can escape unimpeded
      from conventional fuel tanks in the event of an accidental or
      intentional penetration of the tank. The risk of explosion and
      rapidly spreading flames resulting from either of these factors
      pose serious threats to the vehicle, vehicle occupants, and people
      or structures in the area.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In the case of liquid fuels, baffles comprising open
      cellular foams have been used extensively in the aircraft and
      racing industries to mitigate the effects of liquid fuel sloshing
      and leakage. One form of baffle, for example, comprises an open
      cellular plastic foam, such as SafeCrest® foam, available from
      Crest Foam Industries, Inc. Moonachie, N.J., USA. Such foams are
      generally applied inside of the fuel tank after construction via
      cut and placement, post placement expansion (see for example, U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,764,408) or spray foam application (see for example,
      www.crestfoam.com). The advantages of such foams include reduced
      fuel spillage and reduced atomization that results from fuel being
      trapped inside of the foam cells in case of a tank perforation. As
      a result, such fuel tank systems mitigate fireball occurrence.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The plastic foam baffles tend to chemically degrade over
      time, and the debris generated can plug fuel filter systems. The
      foam baffles also complicate fueling procedures as the fuel tends
      to foam on contact with the baffle system, thus limiting fueling
      rates. Debris may also build up and block the foam, thereby
      reducing fuel tank volume. Furthermore, while plastic foam baffle
      systems help mitigate spillage in the case of a tank penetration,
      these foams provide little to no structural reinforcement and
      therefore do not inhibit the penetration itself. Finally, they are
      neither thermally nor electrically conductive, and therefore
      cannot dissipate static charge or heat.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 4,844,974 describes electrically conductive,
      chemically resistant carbonaceous fibers which, when packed within
      a fluid storage vessel, prevent sloshing of the fluid and
      dissipate static electricity buildup. These fibers further serve
      to absorb liquid fuels, thereby reducing their mobility and
      slowing their combustion. While inhibiting flame spread and
      explosion, the materials of U.S. Pat. No. 4,844,974 provide
      minimal structural reinforcement, and therefore do not enhance
      resistance of the storage container to puncture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present disclosure applies to storage of pressurized
      gases, especially those used as vehicle fuel where tank volume,
      weight, shape, and strength all contribute to the overall energy
      density of the gaseous fuel. By employing composite materials, and
      in particular composite materials including a nanolaminated alloy,
      higher strength-to-weight and strength-to-volume ratios can be
      achieved compared with conventional pressurized gas storage tanks,
      resulting in higher energy densities and greater vehicle traveling
      distance. Compressed hydrogen storage is one example of such an
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a
      material for the construction of storage tanks for combustible and
      flammable fluids which incorporates the benefits of an open
      cellular baffle system with the advantageous material properties
      of a nanolaminated alloy in order to protect against tank
      penetration and reduce the risk of flame spread and explosion in
      case of a tank penetration.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another aspect of this disclosure is to provide a method
      for the production of said storage tanks which allows for control
      of the nanolaminate alloy composition such that, for example,
      highly corrosion and chemical resistant alloys can be incorporated
      into the design, specific structural and protective
      characteristics can be met, and/or specific tank geometries may be
      realized.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In yet another aspect, the present disclosure provides a
      design, employing said material, for a fuel tank which both
      resists penetration by ballistic impacts, prevents or lessens
      flame spread and explosion in the event of penetration, and
      prevents or lessens fuel foaming during fueling operations.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In a further aspect, embodiments described in the present
      disclosure are directed to a fuel tank. The fuel tank includes a
      porous metal baffle and a fluid impermeable vessel defining a fuel
      storage area. The porous metal baffle is disposed within the fuel
      storage area. Such embodiments can include one or more of the
      following features. The porous metal baffle can include a porous
      body defining an accessible, interior void structure. In some
      embodiments, a nanolaminate coating is disposed within the
      accessible, interior void structure. The nanolaminate coating can
      provide reinforcement to the porous body. In some embodiments, the
      nanolaminate coating is compositionally modulated. The
      nanolaminate coating can include a corrosion-resistant protective
      alloy, such as, for example, an alloy comprising about 70% Ni and
      about 30% Cu. In some embodiments, the fluid impermeable vessel
      comprises an exterior shell including a nanolaminated material.
      The nanolaminated material can include a corrosion-resistant
      protective alloy. The fuel tank can also include a force
      distributing layer and a ballistic penetration prevention layer
      disposed on the exterior shell of the vessel. In some embodiments,
      the porous metal baffle and the fluid impermeable vessel are
      integrally formed. In some embodiments, the porous metal baffle is
      formed from a consolidated preform, such as, for example, a foam,
      a fabric, or honeycomb structure. In other embodiments, the porous
      metal baffle is formed from an unconsolidated material, such as, a
      bed of particles or beads, or a fiber tow. In some embodiments,
      the fuel storage area of the fuel tank comprises at least about
      0.5% metal foam by volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect, embodiments described in the present
      disclosure are directed to a method of producing a fuel tank. The
      method includes laying a conductive porous preform in contact with
      an inside surface of a fuel tank vessel; filling the vessel with
      an electrolyte bath including one or more electrodepositable
      materials; creating a current pathway by attaching a first
      electrode to the porous preform and disposing a second electrode
      in the electrolyte bath; and applying power to the first and
      second electrodes to form a nanolaminate coating on the porous
      preform. The method can further include melting or etching the
      porous preform to form a nanolaminate structure. In some
      embodiments, the nanolaminate coating is a corrosion-resistant
      protective alloy.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another aspect, embodiments of the disclosure are
      directed to a method of producing a fuel tank. This method
      includes obtaining an electrolyte bath including one or more
      electrodepositable species; immersing a porous preform in the
      electrolyte bath; creating a current pathway by attaching a first
      electrode to the porous preform and a second electrode to the
      electrolyte bath; and applying power to the first and second
      electrodes to form a nanolaminate coating on the porous preform.
      In some embodiments, this method can further include applying one
      or more layers of conductive fabric on the nanolaminate coated
      porous preform; and depositing a second nanolaminate coating on
      the conductive fabric. In some embodiments, the method can also
      include melting or etching the porous preform to form a porous
      nanolaminate structure. The method can also feature a corrosion
      resistant nanolaminate coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In yet a further aspect, embodiments of the disclosure are
      directed to a method of manufacturing a functionally graded
      composite material. This method includes obtaining a first
      functionally graded porous preform; depositing a first
      nanolaminated material on the first functionally graded porous
      preform; positioning a second functionally graded porous preform
      in contact with the nanolaminated first functionally graded porous
      preform; and depositing a second nanolaminated material on the
      second functionally graded porous preform and the first
      functionally graded porous preform to fuse the first and second
      graded porous preforms. This method can further include, in some
      embodiments, positioning a third porous preform in contact with
      the nanolaminated second functionally graded porous preform and
      depositing a third nanolaminated material to fuse the third porous
      preform to the second functionally graded porous preform.
      Embodiments of this method can also feature functionally graded
      porous preforms that include a foam of radially graded pores per
      inch.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another aspect, embodiments of the disclosure are
      directed to a composite material for use in the construction of a
      liquid transport vessel. The composite material includes a porous
      metal reinforcing material and a metal liner. The porous metal
      reinforcing material and the metal liner form a single monolithic
      system (i.e., the porous metal reinforcing material and metal
      liner are integrally formed).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure can include
      one or more of the following features. The porous metal
      reinforcing material, in some embodiments, includes a substrate
      material defining an accessible interior void structure and an
      electrodeposited material at least partially disposed within the
      accessible interior void structure. The electrodeposited material
      can be compositionally modulated through its thickness to form an
      electrodeposit. The electrodeposit can have a modulation
      wavelength that is less than about 1 micron (e.g., 200 nanometers,
      150 nanometers, 80 nanometers, 25 nanometers, 20 nanometers, 10
      nanometers, 5 nanometers, 1 nanometer) within at least a portion
      of the electrodeposit. The electrodeposited material, in some
      embodiments, is a metal or metal alloy and can include at least
      one of nickel, iron, copper, cobalt, gold, silver, platinum, and
      combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the electrodeposited
      material includes a polymer. In some embodiments, the
      electrodeposit has a thickness that continuously increases through
      a portion of the preform.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In another aspect, embodiments of the disclosure are
      directed to a method for forming a fuel tank. The method includes
      providing a bladder in the form of a final fuel tank form; lining
      an interior of the bladder with a porous preform including an
      accessible interior void structure; connecting the porous preform
      to a first electrode; filling the bladder with a bath including at
      least two electrodepositable species; inserting a second electrode
      into the bath; and applying a voltage or current to the first
      electrode to electrodeposit a material within the accessible
      interior void structure of the porous preform.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure can include
      one or more of the following features. The porous preform, in some
      embodiments, possess a gradient in porosity. That is, the porosity
      varies through the porous preform. In some embodiments the porous
      preform includes a consolidated material, such as, for example, a
      foam, a felt, or a honeycomb. In other embodiments the porous
      preform includes an unconsolidated material, such as, for example,
      a bed of particles or beads. The method can further include
      electrodepositing a compositionally modulated layer on an exterior
      surface of the porous preform. In some embodiments, the voltage or
      current applied to the first electrode varies with time.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates one
      embodiment of the proposed baffle/liner fuel tank material. The
      fuel tank material comprises a fully dense (e.g., about 95% dense,
      96% dense, 97% dense, 98% dense, 99% dense, 100% dense),
      fluid-impermeable skin 1 and a porous metal baffle material 2,
      such as a foam or honeycomb. The skin 1 and metal baffle 2 may be
      combined via glue, weld or other metal adhesion process, or, in an
      embodiment, the skin 1 and baffle 2 may be a single monolithic
      system formed via electrodeposition or other suitable method. In
      one advantageous embodiment, and in contrast to the sharp
      transition between baffle 2 and skin 1 shown in FIG. 1, the open
      cellular structure of the baffle will transition gradually to a
      completely closed off, fully dense, fluid-impermeable skin at the
      face.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The tank material can include, in one embodiment, a
      reinforcing material 3, such as a nanolaminated metal material
      that can be produced by electrodeposition (electroplating) under
      controlled, time-varying conditions. These conditions include one
      or more of the following: applied current, applied voltage, rate
      of agitation, and concentration of one or more of the species
      within the electroplating bath (e.g., a bath including one or more
      of an electrodepositable species such as nickel, iron, copper,
      cobalt, gold, silver, zinc, or platinum). Nanolaminations are
      defined here as spatial modulations, in the growth direction of
      the electrodeposited reinforcing material, in structure (e.g.
      crystal size, orientation, type), composition (e.g. alloy
      composition), or both. Nanolaminates include a modulation
      wavelength that is less than 1 micron—i.e., the modulation
      wavelength is nanoscale. (See International Patent Publication No.
      WO2007021980 for a further description of nanolaminate materials
      and electrodeposition of nanolaminate materials.) Metal
      nanolaminates can be applied over a variety of porous preforms
      such as honeycombs, fiber cloth or batting (woven or nonwoven),
      and reticulated foams (see FIGS. 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, and 3C), most of
      which possess little structural integrity in their original form,
      and can therefore be easily shaped to the desired tank or
      component geometry prior to electrodeposition. In addition, metal
      nanolaminates can be deposited throughout a porous preform formed
      of an unconsolidated material (e.g., a bed of power or beads).
      Metal laminates can be deposited into the open, accessible
      interior void structure of a porous preform, as well as on an
      exterior surface of any preform. Furthermore, plating conditions
      can be controlled to effect both uniform nanolaminate growth
      throughout the preform, as well as preferential growth and
      densification near the external surface of the preform. That is,
      deposition of the nanolaminate material can be controlled such
      that the nanolaminates thickness increases throughout the preform
      (or at least a portion of the preform). In this fashion, both
      baffle and skin can be produced in a single production run,
      without removing the part from the plating tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a spherical fuel tank
      (fueling port not shown) with enhanced structural integrity and
      ballistic resistance. Note that the shape of the tank can be
      tailored for specific fit requirements. The shape of the fuel tank
      is shown in FIG. 4 as spherical for conceptual depiction only. An
      internal portion 4 of the fuel tank may be filled with an
      accessible porous reinforcing material such as foam or honeycomb,
      or may be left open. The interior portion 4 (shown in FIG. 4 as a
      metal foam) holds the fuel. In this embodiment, the interior
      portion 4 is made of at least 0.5% metal foam by volume. The
      porous interior portion 4 provides a wicking action which
      regulates fuel withdrawal, reduces spillage and explosion in case
      of breach. In addition the porous interior portion 4, provides
      structural support to the fuel tank. A fuel shell 5 formed of a
      fluid-impermeable material and located at the exterior surface of
      the interior portion 4 serves to prevent leakage of fuel from the
      interior portion as well as to provide secondary strike protection
      (e.g., puncture resistance). The exterior foam layer 6 absorbs and
      distributes force of an impact to protect the interior portion 4
      and the external shell 7 serves to provide principal strike
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The fuel tank material may be produced as shown in FIG. 5
      by adhering or laying a conductive porous preform 12 in contact
      with the inside surface of a conductive or non-conductive fuel
      tank bladder 13 to form a cathode 16. The bladder 13 is then
      filled with electrolyte bath 15 containing one or more
      electrodepositable materials. Next, a power supply 17 is connected
      to the porous preform 12 and another to an electrode (i.e., anode
      18) positioned within the composite shell 14 defined by the
      bladder 13 and reinforcing foam 12. Power is applied to these
      electrodes 16, 18 such that the nanolaminated metal (or other
      electrodepositable material) forms on the surface of the porous
      preform 12. After the desired metal thickness is achieved, the
      preform may be melted or etched away, or it may be left in place.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the material may also be
      produced by immersing a conductive porous preform 12 into an
      electrolyte bath 15 containing at least one electrodepositable
      material. The conductive porous perform 12 also serves as the
      cathode 16 in these electrochemical cells. Next, a power supply 17
      is connected to the preform 12 and another to one or more
      electrodes 18 immersed in the electrolyte bath 15. In the
      embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, the electrochemical cell
      includes an interior anode 18a and two auxiliary anodes 18b which
      conform to the exterior of the preform 12 to impart the desired
      electrodeposit onto the porous (in this embodiment, hollow)
      preform 12. Power is applied to these electrodes 16, 18 such that
      the metal (or other electrodepositable material) forms on the
      accessible surface of the preform. After the desired metal
      thickness is achieved, the preform 12 may be melted or etched
      away, or it may be left in place.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIGS. 8A-D depicts a layered manufacturing scheme, which
      allows functional gradation of the porous preform in three
      dimensions. In FIG. 8A, a metal laminate is deposited over the
      accessible surface (i.e., exterior and accessible interior void
      structure) of a single layer of a functionally graded porous
      preform. The functionally graded porous preform shown in FIG. 8A
      is a radially graded pores per inch (PPI) foam. In FIG. 8B, a
      second functionally graded porous preform layer is stacked on the
      metal laminate coated first layer and deposition of metal laminate
      continues over the entire preform to fuse the first and second
      radially graded layers together. In FIG. 8C a third functionally
      graded porous preform is added and a metal laminate is deposited
      to join the first, second and third graded porous preforms
      together. In FIG. 8D a fourth porous preform is added and a
      nanolaminate is deposited to fuse the first, second, third and
      forth preforms together. FIG. 8E illustrates an exploded view of
      the first, second, third, and forth preforms (i.e., layers) after
      deposition. Advantages of this technique include reduced preform
      waste, more thorough control of deposit uniformity through the
      bulk (since the bulk comprises several stacked, sequentially
      plated thin layers), and the ability to control the spatial
      distribution of porous preform material as well as nanolaminated
      metal reinforcing material.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] An advantageous embodiment of the present invention
      features a composite material with a corrosion-resistant
      protective alloy covering atop a nanolaminated reinforcement. The
      corrosion-resistant protective alloy can also be positioned at
      other locations (besides atop) throughout the nanolaminated
      reinforcement. One such protective alloy consists of 70% Ni and
      30% Cu. Other electrodepositable metals and/or polymers and/or
      particles could be used to achieve specific material properties as
      desired.<br>

      <b>Methods and Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] In some embodiments, the coatings (e.g., fuel shell and
      exterior shell) as well as the foam/porous layers of the fuel tank
      can be formed utilizing electrodeposition techniques. In addition,
      in some embodiments, both the coatings and/or the foam layers can
      include compositionally modulated electrodeposited materials, such
      as, for example, nanolaminate coatings. Some exemplary
      electrodeposition techniques and materials are provided within
      this section entitled “Methods and Materials.” These techniques
      and materials are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather are
      merely illustrative of possible embodiments of the technology
      disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The term “compositionally modulated” describes a material
      in which the chemical composition varies throughout at least one
      spatial coordinate, such as, for example, the material's depth.
      For example, in an electrochemical bath including a
      nickel-containing solution and an iron-containing solution, the
      resulting compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20
      includes alloys having a chemical make-up according to NixFe1-x,
      where x is a function of applied current or voltage and mass flow
      of the bath solution. Thus, by controlling or modulating at least
      one of the mass flow of the bath solution or the applied current
      or voltage to electrodes, the chemical make-up of a deposited
      layer can be controlled and varied through its depth (i.e., growth
      direction). As a result, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 shown in FIG. 9 includes several
      different alloys as illustrated by layers 30, 32, 34, 36, and 38.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Referring to FIG. 9, layers 32 and 36 represent nickel-rich
      (x&gt;0.5) deposits, whereas layers 30, 34, and 38 represent
      iron-rich (x&lt;0.5) deposits. While layers 32 and 36 are both
      nickel rich deposits, the value for x in each of layers 32 and 36
      need not be the same. For example, the x value in layer 32 may be
      0.7 whereas the x value in layer 36 may be 0.6. Likewise, the x
      values in layers 30, 34, and 38 can also vary or remain constant.
      In addition to the composition of the constituents (e.g., Ni and
      Fe) varying through the depth of the electrodeposited material 20,
      a thickness of each of the layers 30 to 38 varies through the
      depth as well. FIG. 9, while not to scale, illustrates the change
      or modulation in thickness through the layers 30, 32, 34, 36, and
      38.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 10 illustrates another embodiment of the composite
      material, shown here as composite material 10. In this embodiment,
      a porous substrate 12 is a consolidated porous body. That is, the
      porous substrate 12 in this embodiment is a unitary piece that
      includes a plurality of voids 25 that define an accessible,
      interior void structure. Examples of consolidated porous bodies
      include, foams, fabrics, meshes, and partially sintered compacts.
      The compositionally modulated material 20 is electrodeposited
      throughout the accessible, interior void structure to form a
      coating along the walls of the substrate 12 defining the voids 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Referring to FIG. 11, the compositionally modulated
      material 20 disposed within the plurality of voids 25 (as shown in
      FIG. 10) includes multiple alloys illustrated as distinct layers
      30, 32, 34, and 36. As described above the compositionally
      modulated material 20 is varied in both constituent concentration
      (i.e., to form the different alloy layers making up the material
      20) and in thickness of the layers. In the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 11, the nickel-rich layers 32 and 36 further include a
      concentration of particles disposed therein, thereby forming
      particle-reinforced composite layers. As shown in FIG. 11, layers
      32 and 36 need not include the same concentration of particles,
      thereby allowing the compositionally modulated material 20 to be
      further tailored to provide optimal material properties. While not
      wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
      increasing the concentration of the particles in a layer increases
      the hardness of that particular layer. The concentration of
      particles per layer can be controlled through modulating the flow
      rate of the bath during electrodeposition. The particles can have
      any shape, such as spherical particles, pyramidal particles,
      rectangular particles, or irregularly shaped particles. In
      addition, the particles can be of any length scale, such as for
      example, millimeter sized (e.g., 1 to 5 millimeter), micron-sized
      (e.g., 100 microns to 0.1 microns), nanometer sized (e.g., 100 nm
      to 1 nm). In some embodiments, 85% or more (e.g., 87%, 89%, 90%,
      93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) of the nanosized particles
      have an average grain size within a range of 10 nm to 100 nm. In
      certain embodiments, 85% or more of the nanosized particles have
      an average grain size within a range of 20 nm to 50 nm, 30 nm to
      50 nm, 10 nm to 30 nm, or 1 to 10 nm. Examples of some suitable
      particles include carbide particles, alumina particles, glass
      particles, polymer particles, silicon carbide fibers, and clay
      platelets.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] To form or deposit the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20, the porous substrate 12 is submerged
      into an electrochemical cell. Referring to FIG. 12, an
      electrodeposition cell 50, in one embodiment, includes a bath 55
      of two or more of metal salts, a cathode (i.e., working electrode)
      60, an anode (i.e., a counter electrode) 65, and a power supply
      (e.g. a potentiostat) 70, which electrically connects and controls
      the applied current between the working and counter electrodes, 60
      and 65, respectively. The cell 50 can also include a reference
      electrode 75 to aid the potentiostat 70 in accurately controlling
      the applied current by providing a reference base line current
      measurement. In general, when an electrical current is passed
      through the cell 50, an oxidation/reduction reaction involving the
      metal ions in the bath 55 occurs and the resulting product is
      deposited on the working electrode 60. As shown in FIG. 12, the
      porous substrate 12 is positioned in contact with the working
      electrode 60. For example, in certain embodiments, the porous
      substrate is formed of a conductive material and functions as an
      extension of the working electrode 60. As a result, the resulting
      product of the oxidation/reduction reaction deposits within the
      accessible interior void structure 25. In other embodiments, the
      porous substrate 12 is formed of a nonconductive material and
      thus, electrodeposition occurs at a junction between the working
      electrode 60 and the porous substrate 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In general, one of the advantages of the methods and
      resulting composite materials described in this disclosure is a
      wide range of choices of materials available for deposition into
      the interior void structure 25 of the porous substrate 12. For
      example, salts of any transition metal can be used to form the
      bath 55. Specifically, some preferred materials include salts of
      the following metals: nickel, iron, copper, cobalt, gold, silver,
      zinc, and platinum. In addition to the wide range of materials
      available, electrodeposition techniques have an additional
      advantage of easily modifiable processing conditions. For example,
      a ratio of the metal salts and other electrodepositable
      components, such as, for example, alumina particles, can be
      controlled by their concentration within the bath. Thus, it is
      possible to provide a bath that has a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1, 2:1,
      3:1, 5:1, 10:1 or 20:1 by increasing or decreasing the
      concentration of a Fe salt within the bath in comparison to the Ni
      salt prior to deposition. Such ratios can thus be achieved for any
      of the electrodepositable components. Where more than two
      electrodepositable components are provided, such ratios can be
      achieved as between any two of the components such that the
      overall ratios for all components will be that which is desired.
      For example, a bath with Ni, Fe and Cu salts could yield ratios of
      Ni:Fe of 1:2 and a Ni:Cu of 1:3, making the overall ratio of
      Ni:Fe:Cu 1:2:3. In addition, a bath with Ni salt and alumina
      particles could yield a ratio of Ni:Al2O3 of 2:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1 or
      1:3 by increasing or decreasing the concentration of particles
      within the bath.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIGS. 13A, 13B, and 13C illustrate applied conditions to
      the electrochemical cell 50 for depositing the compositionally
      modulated material 20. FIG. 13D illustrates a resulting
      composition map for the applied conditions shown in FIGS. 13A,
      13B, and 13C. FIG. 13C shows the current density over a period of
      130 seconds applied to the working electrode 60. The applied
      current drives the oxidation/reduction reaction at the electrode
      to deposit a material product having the form AxB1-x, where A is a
      first bath constituent and B is a second bath constituent. While
      FIG. 13C illustrates a current density range of between -20 to
      -100 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;, other current density ranges are also
      possible for example, a current density range of between about -5
      to -20 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;may be preferable in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Another way of defining the modulation of the compositions
      of the deposited alloys (AxB1-x, where x varies) is with respect
      to a composition cycle. A composition cycle 80 defines the
      deposition of a pair of layers. The first layer of the composition
      cycles is a A-rich and the second layer is B-rich. Each
      composition cycle has a wavelength. A value assigned to the
      wavelength is equal to the thickness of the two layers forming the
      composition cycle 80. That is, the wavelength has a value that is
      equal to two times the thickness of one of the two layers forming
      the composition cycle (e.g., ?=10 nm, when thickness of Ni-rich
      layer within the composition cycle is equal to 5 nm). By including
      one or more composition cycles the deposited material is
      compositionally modulating. In a preferred embodiment, the
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20 includes
      multiple composition cycles 20 (e.g., 5 composition cycles, 10
      composition cycles, 20 composition cycles, 50 composition cycles,
      100 composition cycles, 1,000 composition cycles, 10,000
      composition cycles, 100,000 composition cycles or more).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The applied current density as shown in FIG. 13C is
      determined from an applied variation in frequency of the current
      per time (FIG. 13A) in combination with an applied variation in
      amplitude of the current per time (FIG. 13B). Referring to FIG.
      13A, an applied frequency modulation, shown here as a triangle
      wave, effects the wavelength of the composition cycles. As shown
      by comparing FIGS. 13A and 13D, the wavelength of the composition
      cycles decreases as the frequency increases. While FIG. 13A
      illustrates this effect with an applied triangle wave, any
      waveform (i.e., a value that changes with time) may be applied to
      control or modulate the frequency and thus control or modulate the
      thickness/wavelengths of the deposited material 20. Examples of
      other waveforms that may be applied to tailor the changing
      thickness/wavelength of each of the deposited layers/composition
      cycles include sine waves, square waves, sawtooth waves, and any
      combination of these waveforms. The composition of the deposit
      (i.e., x value) can also be further modulated by varying the
      amplitude. FIG. 13B illustrates a sine wave modulation of the
      applied amplitude of the current applied to the working electrode.
      By changing the amplitude over time, the value of x varies over
      time such that not all of the Ni-rich layers have the same
      composition (nor do all the Fe-rich layers have the same
      composition).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Referring to FIGS. 14A and 14B, in some embodiments, the
      value of x is modulated within each of the layers, such that the
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20 is graded
      to minimize or mask composition discontinuities. As a result of
      applying one or more of the above deposition conditions, the
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20 can be
      tailored to include layers that provide a wide range of material
      properties and enhancements. One such enhancement is an increase
      in hardness. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory,
      it is believed that regions of nanolaminate material (i.e.,
      regions in which all of the composition cycles have a wavelength
      less than about 200 nm and preferably less than about 80 nm)
      exhibit a superior hardness not achievable by the same materials
      at greater lengths scales. This superior hardness is believed to
      arise from an increase in the material's elastic modulus
      coefficient, and is known as the “supermodulus effect.” In certain
      embodiments, the compositionally modulated electrodeposited
      material 20 is deposited to include one or more regions, which
      provide the composite material 10 with the supermodulus effect.
      That is, the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material
      20 disposed within the void structure 25 of the porous substrate
      12 or on an exterior surface of a substrate includes one or more
      regions in which all of the composition cycles include wavelengths
      less than 200 nm, and preferably less than about 80 nm. In one
      embodiment, the wavelengths are less than about 70 nm. In another
      embodiment, the hardness of the composite material 10 is enhanced
      by including varying concentrations of particles (e.g., Al2O3,
      SiC, Si3N4) within an electrodeposited metal. For example, by
      increasing the concentration of Al2O3 particles dispersed within
      layers of an electrodeposited Ni metal, an increase in Vicker's
      Hardness from 240 VEIN to 440 VEIN is achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In some embodiments, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 can include regions in which the
      composition cycles 80 include wavelengths less than 200 nm (and
      thus which may exhibit the supermodulus effect) and also include
      regions in which some portion (e.g., at least or about: 1%, 2%,
      5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 92% 95%, 97%,
      99% and 100%) of the composition cycles 80 include wavelengths
      greater than 200 nm. The portion(s) of the composition cycles 80
      that include wavelengths greater than 200 nm could also be
      represented in ranges. For example, the composition cycles 80 of
      one or more regions could include a number of wavelengths greater
      than 200 nm in a range of from 1-2%, 2-5%, 1-5%, 5-7%, 5-10%,
      1-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%,
      80-90%, 90-92%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 95-99%, 95-100%, 90-100%, 80-100%,
      etc., with the balance of the composition cycles being less than
      200 nm in that region. Without wishing to be bound by any
      particular theory, it is believed that, as hardness increases,
      ductility decreases. As a result, in order to provide a composite
      material that is enhanced to include regions of increased hardness
      and regions of increased ductility, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20, in some embodiments, can include one
      or more regions in which all of the composition cycles 80 have a
      wavelength of about 200 nm or less including wavelengths less than
      1 nanometer, one or more regions in which all of the composition
      cycles have a wavelength greater than 200 nm, and/or one or more
      regions in which a portion of the composition cycles 80 have a
      wavelength of about 200 nm or less and a portion have a wavelength
      greater than 200 nm. Within each of those portions, the
      wavelengths also can be adjusted to be of a desired size or range
      of sizes. Thus, for example, the region(s) having composition
      cycles of a wavelength of about 200 nm or less can themselves have
      wavelengths that vary from region to region or even within a
      region. Thus, is some embodiments, one region may have composition
      cycles having a wavelength of from 80-150 nm and another region in
      which the wavelengths are less than 80 nm. In other embodiments,
      one region could have both composition cycles of from 80-150 nm
      and less than 80 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In certain embodiments, the compositionally modulated
      material 20 is tailored to minimize (e.g., prevent) delamination
      of its layers during use. For example, it is believed that when a
      projectile impacts a conventional laminated material, the
      resulting stress waves may cause delamination or debonding due to
      the presence of discontinuities. However, the compositionally
      modulated electrodeposited material 20 described herein can
      include a substantially continuous modulation of both its
      composition (i.e., x value) and wavelength such that
      discontinuities are minimized or eliminated, thereby preventing
      delamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Referring to FIGS. 15A-15C, in addition to compositionally
      modulating the electrodeposited material 20 to form the composite
      10, the porous substrate material 12 can also be made of a
      material that is modulated through its depth. For example, as
      shown in FIG. 15A, in one embodiment, the porous substrate 12 is
      formed of particles 15 that gradually increase in size from an
      exterior 100 of the compact to an interior 110 of the composite
      10. The particles in such embodiments can range from, e.g., 5 nm
      on the exterior 100 to 50 microns in the interior 110, 5 nm on the
      exterior 100 to 10 microns in the interior 110, 5 nm on the
      exterior to 1 micron in the interior 110, 10 nm on the exterior
      100 to 10 microns in the interior 110, or from 10 nm on the
      exterior 100 to 1 micron in the interior. The differently sized
      particles 15 contribute to the material properties of the
      composite 10. For example, smaller particles have a greater
      surface area energy per unit volume than larger particles of the
      same material. As a result, the porous substrate can be tailored
      to provide additional advantageous material properties to
      different regions of the composite 10. Referring to FIGS. 15B and
      15C, the porous substrate 12 can have other particle arrangements
      to provide different material properties to the composite 10. For
      example, in FIG. 15B the particles have a repetitive size
      distribution and in FIG. 15C the particles have a graded
      distribution.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIGS. 16A and 16B show an enlarged cross-sectional view of
      the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20
      disposed between four adjacent particles 15 of a porous substrate
      12. In FIG. 16A, the particles 15 forming the porous substrate 12
      are non-conductive particles (e.g., alumina particles, glass
      particles). As a result of their non-conductivity,
      electrodeposition occurs between two electrodes disposed on either
      end of the porous substrate 12 and the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 is deposited in a bottom-up fashion.
      Thus, the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material
      fills the entire void structure 25 between the four particles. In
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 16B, the particles 15 are
      electrically conductive. As a result, electrodeposition can occur
      within the conductive porous material to produce layers that are
      initiated at a particle/void interface 120 and grow inwards to
      fill at least a portion of the interior void structure 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In addition to electrodepositing into a porous preform, the
      compositionally modulated material 20 can also be deposited on the
      exterior surfaces 100 of the porous substrate 12 to form a
      nanolaminate coating (e.g., a fuel shell or an exterior shell for
      a fuel tank as shown in FIG. 4). For example, after the accessible
      interior void structure 25 is at least partially filled in the
      case of an electrically conductive porous substrate or
      substantially filled in the case of a non-conductive porous
      substrate, an additional or capping layer 150 can be deposited
      onto the substrate to seal off the interior porous structure 25 as
      shown in FIG. 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In certain embodiments, the filling of the accessible
      interior void structure 25 is tailored such that the thickness of
      the compositionally modulating electrodeposited material 20 varies
      throughout the composite 10. For example, FIG. 18 illustrates a
      composite material 10 formed of a porous conductive foam 12 and a
      NixFe1-x compositionally modulated material 20. The thickness of
      the compositionally modulated material 20 continuously increases
      (i.e., thickens) from the interior portion 110 of the porous
      substrate 12 to the exterior 100. To create this thickening, the
      current density during deposition is continuously increased. In
      addition to including the compositionally modulated material 20
      disposed throughout the void structure 25 of the substrate 12, a
      dense layer of the compositionally modulated material, referred to
      as the capping layer 150 is further applied to the exterior 100 of
      the substrate 12 to close off the accessible pore structure 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Methods of forming the composite 10 using electrodeposition
      can include the following steps: (1) forming a bath including at
      least two electrodepositable components, (2) connecting the porous
      preform 12 to the working electrode 60, (3) inserting the porous
      preform 12, the working electrode 60, and the counter electrode 65
      into the bath 55, and (4) applying a voltage or current to the
      working electrode 60 to drive electrodeposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In general, in one embodiment, the voltage or current
      applied to the working electrode 60 varies over time so that the
      compositionally modulated material is electrodeposited into the
      voids 25 of the porous substrate 12. Thus, in some embodiments,
      the voltage or current is applied to the electrode 60 with a time
      varying frequency that oscillates in accordance with a triangle
      wave. In other embodiments, the voltage or current is applied to
      the electrode with a time varying frequency that oscillates in
      accordance with a sine wave, a square wave, a saw-tooth wave, or
      any other waveform, such as a combination of the foregoing
      waveforms. The voltage or current can be applied for one waveform
      cycle as shown in FIG. 13A, or preferably for two or more cycles
      (e.g., three cycles, five cycles, 10 cycles, 20 cycles). FIG. 13E
      shows the envisioned composition map for a 10 cycle deposit.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In addition to controlling the voltage or current, other
      deposition conditions can also be monitored and varied to tailor
      the compositionally modulating material 20. For example, it is
      believed that the pH of the bath has an effect on upon the quality
      of the deposited material. Thus, in some embodiments, the pH of
      the bath is controlled during electrodeposition. For example,
      prior to deposition a pH set point (e.g., a pH of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14) or range (e.g., a pH of 1-2,
      2-3, 3-4, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, or 13-14)
      is determined. During electrodeposition, the pH of the bath is
      monitored and if a difference from the set point is determined, pH
      altering chemicals, such as, for example, HCl or NaOH, are added
      to the bath to return the bath to its pH set point.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The concentration of the electrodepositable components in
      the bath can also be monitored and controlled. For example,
      concentration sensors can be positioned within the cell 50 to
      monitor the concentrations of the metal salts as well as any
      depositable particles within the bath. During electrodeposition of
      the compositionally modulated material 20, the concentrations of
      the depositable components (e.g., metal salts, particles) can
      become depleted or at least decreased from a predetermined optimal
      level within the bath. As a result, the timeliness of the
      deposition of the compositionally modulated material 20 can be
      effected. Thus, by monitoring and replenishing the concentrations
      of the depositable components electrodeposition can be optimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In certain embodiments, flow rate of the bath can be
      modulated or varied. As described above, both the applied current
      or voltage and the mass flow rate of the depositable components
      effects the x-value of the electrodeposit (e.g., NixFe1-x). Thus,
      in some embodiments, the flow rate of the bath containing the
      depositable components is varied in addition to the applied
      voltage or current to produce the modulation in the value of x. In
      other embodiments, the applied voltage or current remains constant
      and the flow rate is varied to produce the modulation in the value
      of x. The flow rate of the bath can be increased or decreased by
      providing agitation, such as, for example, a
      magnetically-controlled mixer or by adding a pump to the cell 50.
      By agitating the bath or by agitating the perform the mass
      transfer rate of the electrodeposited material is effected in that
      electrodepositable species may be more readily available for
      deposition thereby providing improved deposition conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate embodiments of an
      electrochemical cell 50 that includes a pump 200. In general,
      these cells 50 are referred to as flow cells because they force a
      bath solution through a porous substrate. Referring to FIG. 19,
      the flow cell includes a porous working electrode 60, which is
      also the porous electrically-conductive substrate 12, and a porous
      counter electrode 65. The working electrode 60, the counter
      electrode 65 and the reference electrode 75 are in communication
      and are controlled by the potentiostat 70. The bath fluid 55
      including the depositable components is forced through the porous
      working electrode 60 (and thus the porous substrate 12) and the
      counter electrode 65 at a flow rate adjustable at the pump 200.
      Thus, in certain embodiments, the flow rate of the pump 200 can be
      controlled in accordance with a triangle wave, square wave, sine
      wave, a saw tooth wave, or any other waveform, such that the flow
      rate can be modulated to produce the compositionally modulated
      material 20. FIG. 20 illustrates another embodiment of a flow cell
      50 for use with non-conductive porous substrates 12. In this cell
      50, the working electrode 60 and the counter electrode 65 are
      disposed within a wall of the cell 50 and the bath fluid 55 is
      forced through the porous non-conductive substrate 12.
      Electrodeposition occurs in a bottom-up fashion, that is, the
      deposition of material 20 proceeds from the working electrode 60
      to the counter electrode 65 substantially filling the void
      structure 25 along the way.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The methods and composite materials described herein can be
      tailored to provide the unusual combination of strength,
      ductility, and low-density. For example, the porous substrate 12
      forming the matrix of the composite material 10 can be formed of a
      light-weight ceramic material or can include a relatively large
      amount (e.g., 40% by volume, 50% by volume, 60% by volume) of
      accessible interior void space 25. The compositionally modulated
      material 20 electrodeposited into the accessible, interior void
      space 25 can be tailored to provide strength at least in part
      through nanolaminate regions and ductility at least in part
      through micron or submicron sized laminated regions. These
      composite materials can be utilized in automotive applications,
      ballistic applications, or any other application that would
      benefit from this combination of material properties.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0072] The following examples are provided to further illustrate
      and to facilitate the understanding of the disclosure. These
      specific examples are intended to be illustrative of the
      disclosure and are not intended to be limiting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] A fuel tank for a vehicle can be formed to have an interior
      portion made from a preform of reticulated vitreous carbon, a fuel
      shell made of a nanolaminate coating including Ni and Fe, an
      exterior foam or porous layer formed of a conductive fabric, and
      an exterior shell including a Ni/Fe nanolaminate coating (which
      can either be identical to the fuel shell layer or have a
      different composition and/or structure than the fuel shell layer).
      Both the fuel shell and exterior shell nanolaminate coatings are
      formed by means of electrodeposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] To form the fuel tank, a bath including 0.2M
      Ni(NH2SO3)2.4H2O, 0.2M FeCl2?4H2O, 0.40M H3BO3, 1.5 g/L sodium
      saccharin, 0.2 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1.0 g/L ascorbic acid,
      and enough sulfamic acid or nickel carbonate to attain a pH level
      of 3.00±0.01 is prepared. Anodes formed of titanium baskets
      including nickel S-rounds are obtained. The baskets are selected
      such that a nominal basket area is equal to or greater than a
      nominal workpiece area (i.e., the workpiece is the preform of
      reticulated vitreous carbon to be coated with nanolaminate). The
      baskets are positioned within the bath to optimize the uniformity
      of a current distribution over the workpiece.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The workpiece, which includes a 20 pores per inch
      reticulated vitreous carbon preform formed into a particular tank
      geometry (e.g., spherical), serves as the cathode in the
      electrodeposition process. After or right before the workpiece and
      the titanium basket anodes are submerged in the bath, a positive
      terminal of a power supply is connected in electrical contact with
      the baskets and a negative terminal of the power supply is
      electrically connected to the workpiece.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] A filter pump with a 1-micron particle size cartridge is
      placed in fluid communication with the bath such that the tank
      volume can be turned over at least about 4 times per hour. An
      oscillator or other means of gently moving the workpiece back and
      forth within the bath is connected to the workpiece to provide
      high rates of mass transfer to the cathode as well as to dislodge
      bubbles that may form during electrodeposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Also connected to the bath are reservoirs of FeCl2 and
      sulfamic acid solution and necessary plumbing and flow control to
      maintain the bath concentration of iron at approximately 0.02M and
      the pH level at about 3.00 by addition of FeCl2 and sulfamic acid
      either by a steady predetermined flow rate or by means of a
      feedback loop.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] After the bath is heated to and maintained at a temperature
      of about 110° F., electrodeposition of the fuel shell layer begins
      by applying a time-varying current waveform to the workpiece
      through the power supply according to the following conditions:
      (a) a current density at a working electrode varies in a
      square-wave with a nominal maximum plating current of 15
      mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and a nominal minimum plating current of 3
      mA/cm&lt;2&gt;, based on the nominal area of the workpiece exposed
      to the plating bath (b) a duty cycle of approximately 12%, with an
      off corresponding to a current density of 3 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;is
      utilized, and (c) a frequency modulation according to a triangle
      wave from a peak of 1 Hz to a minimum of 0.001 Hz, with a
      modulation frequency of 0.0001 Hz is selected.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Electrodeposition of the fuel shell layer occurs for
      approximately 7 days during which FeCl2 and sulfamic acid
      solutions are added to the bath to maintain the concentration of
      iron at about 0.02 M and a pH level of 3.00. In addition, the
      nickel concentration within the bath is monitored to ensure that
      it is not in excess of 0.3 M. When the concentration exceeds 0.3
      M, an appropriate amount of the bath is removed and the quantities
      of the original bath solutions (e.g., 0.2M Ni(NH2SO3)2.4H2O, 0.2M
      FeCl2.4H2O, 0.40M H3BO3, 1.5 g/L sodium saccharin, 0.2 g/L sodium
      dodecyl sulfate, 1.0 g/L ascorbic acid, and enough sulfamic acid
      or nickel carbonate to attain a pH level of 3.00±0.01) and
      deionized water are added to bring the bath solution back to its
      original state.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] After 7 days of electrodeposition using the above process,
      the workpiece is removed from the bath without turning off the
      power supply. A wrap or covering of a layer of a conductive fabric
      (such as, for example, a silverized nylon knit or a carbon
      non-woven fabric) is layered about the exterior of the workpiece
      (i.e., the workpiece now includes an interior portion formed of
      reticulated vitreous carbon, a fuel shell layer of Ni/Fe
      nanolaminate, and an exterior porous layer of a conductive
      fabric).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The workpiece is slowly reimmersed into the bath, and
      electrodeposition of an exterior shell layer of Ni/Fe nanolaminate
      is deposited using the process described above for about another 7
      days. Once complete the vehicle fuel tank is removed from the bath
      and rinsed with deionized water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0082] A small rectangular composite fuel tank including a 20 PPI
      (pores per inch) reticulated vitreous carbon foam preform and an
      electrodeposited compositionally modulated NiFe alloy was formed
      in a laboratory using the following procedure. A bath was prepared
      using 0.2M Ni(H2NSO3)2.4H2O, 0.04 M FeCl2.4H2O, 0.40M H3BO3, 1.5
      g/L sodium saccharin, 0.2 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1.0 g/L
      ascorbic acid, and sulfamic acid to attain a pH of 3.00±0.01. A
      10? by 10? by 1? piece of 20 PPI reticulated vitreous carbon foam
      preform was rigidly mounted in an insulating frame which suspended
      the preform in the frame's center by a finite number of small
      conducting elements, or contacts. The contacts were contained and
      insulated within the frame such that they did not come into
      contact with the electroplating bath once immersed, and terminated
      at a single bus located at the top edge of the insulating frame.
      This bus was in turn connected to two 10 gauge hooks which allowed
      the entire assembly to hang from a bus bar mounted across the top
      of a plating tank. The frame was designed to provide electrical
      contact to the preform while not disturbing the distribution of
      current over all of the preform's surfaces. Further, the frame
      provides heft which allows the frame-preform assembly to be
      immersed in the bath without buoyancy-induced misalignment.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The open-top plating tank had interior dimensions of 12? by
      12? by 12?, and was spanned over its top by three bus bars
      separated by 31/2?. The frame-workpiece assembly was hung from the
      central bus bar. The two remaining bus bars each supported two
      titanium anode baskets filled with nickel S-rounds, with each
      basket measuring 9? tall by 1? thick by 3? wide. The titanium
      anode baskets were enclosed within a napped polypropylene anode
      bag to minimize the suspension of anodically formed particles in
      the plating bath. The plating solution was continuously recycled
      through a 10?, 1 micron filter pump such that the entire tank
      volume passed through the filter at least three times per hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The central, cathodic bus bar was connected to the negative
      terminal of a 1 kW power supply. The two anodic bus bars were
      connected to the positive terminal of the same power supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Once positioned within the bath, a time-varying current was
      applied to the workpiece. The time-varying current was designed to
      have the following waveform characteristics: (1) the current
      density—based on the nominal surface area of the preform's major
      faces (2×100 in)—varied in accordance with a square-wave having a
      maximum deposition current density of 15 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and a
      minimum deposition current of 3 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; (2) a duty cycle
      of 0.12 with the “off” part of the cycle corresponding to a
      current density setting of 3 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; and (3) a frequency
      modulation according to a triangle waveform having a peak of 1 Hz,
      a minimum of 0.001 Hz, and a modulation rate of 0.0001 Hz. The
      time-varying current was applied to the working electrode for
      three days while maintaining the bath's iron composition and pH at
      0.02M and 3.0, respectively, by automated addback of iron chloride
      solution and sulfamic acid solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] After three days, the preform was removed and wrapped
      several times in tight-weave silverized nylon cloth. The workpiece
      was then re-immersed in the plating bath and the plating regime
      described above was continued for another three days, after which
      the workpiece was removed and thoroughly rinsed in DI water.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0088] A commercial nickel sulfamate plating bath was purchased
      from Technic, Inc. A 10? by 10? by 1? piece of 20 PPI reticulated
      vitreous carbon foam preform was rigidly mounted in an insulating
      frame which suspended the preform in the frame's center by a
      finite number of small conducting elements, or contacts. The

      <br>
      [0091] Once positioned within the bath, a DC current density of 3
      mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;was applied to the workpiece—based on the nominal
      surface area of the preform's major faces (2×100 in&lt;2&gt;).
      Plating continued for three days while maintaining the bath
      chemistry at the manufacturer's recommended makeup concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] After three days, the preform was removed and wrapped
      several times in tight-weave silverized nylon cloth. The workpiece
      was then re-immersed in the plating bath and the plating regime

      [0093] A cylindrical composite fuel tank including a 80 PPI (pores
      per inch) reticulated vitreous carbon foam preform and an

      in a laboratory using the following procedure. A bath was prepared
      using 0.2M Ni(H2NSO3)2.4H2O, 0.04 M FeCl2.4H2O, 0.40M H3BO3, 1.5
      g/L sodium saccharin, 0.2 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1.0 g/L
      ascorbic acid, and sulfamic acid to attain a pH of 3.00±0.01. A
      cylindrical piece of 80 PPI reticulated vitreous carbon foam
      measuring 10? long and having a diameter of 3? was penetrated to a
      depth of 9 inches along its axis by a stainless steel tube having
      a diameter of 2?. The center portion of the foam contained within
      the tube was subsequently removed, and the free end of the tube
      was affixed to a rotator. A metal brush was placed in contact with
      the free end of the tube, and further connected to the negative

      [0094] An open-topped plating tank having interior dimensions of
      12? by 12? by 12? and spanned over its top by two bus bars
      separated by 7? was filled with plating bath. The two bus bars
      each supported two titanium anode baskets filled with nickel
      S-rounds, with each basket measuring 9? tall by 1? thick by 3?
      wide. The titanium anode baskets were enclosed within a napped
      polypropylene anode bag to minimize the suspension of anodically
      formed particles in the plating bath. The plating solution was

      the plating bath.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Once positioned within the bath, the workpiece was rotated
      at a time-varying rotation speed while a time-varying current was
      applied to the workpiece. The current waveform was designed to
      have the following waveform characteristics: (1) the current
      density—based on the nominal surface area of the preform—varied in
      accordance with a square-wave having a maximum deposition current
      density of 15 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and a minimum deposition current of 3
      mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; (2) a duty cycle of 0.12 with the “off” part of
      the cycle corresponding to a current density setting of 3
      mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; and (3) a frequency modulation according to a
      triangle waveform having a peak of 1 Hz, a minimum of 0.001 Hz,
      and a modulation rate of 0.0001 Hz. The time-varying rotation rate
      was synchronized with the current waveform, but varied such that
      the short-duration portion of the rotation rate waveform was 50
      RPM and the long-duration portion was 200 RPM. The current was
      applied to the workpiece for three days while maintaining the
      bath's iron composition and pH at 0.02M and 3.0, respectively, by
      automated addback of iron chloride solution and sulfamic acid
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] After three days, the preform was removed and wrapped
      several times in tight-weave silverized nylon cloth. The workpiece

      [0101] An open-topped plating tank having interior dimensions of
      12? by 12? by 12? and spanned over its top by three bus bars
      separated by 31/2? was filled with plating bath. The central bus
      bars supported a magnetic preform shell of the desired shape,
      while the remaining two bars supported two titanium anode baskets
      filled with nickel S-rounds, with each basket measuring 9? tall by
      1? thick by 3? wide. The titanium anode baskets were enclosed
      within a napped polypropylene anode bag to minimize the suspension
      of anodically formed particles in the plating bath. The plating
      solution was unfiltered.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The two anodic bus bars were connected to the positive
      terminal of a 1 kW power supply. The central bus bar was connected
      to the negative terminal of the same power supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] After establishing electrical connections to the magnetic
      workpiece and the anodes, the workpiece was slowly immersed in the
      plating bath. The magnetic particles were drawn to the workpiece
      such that they formed a porous preform that became consolidated by
      the applied electroplate. The applied current waveform was
      designed to have the following waveform characteristics: (1) the
      current density—based on the nominal surface area of the
      preform—varied in accordance with a square-wave having a maximum
      deposition current density of 15 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and a minimum
      deposition current of 3 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; (2) a duty cycle of 0.12
      with the “off” part of the cycle corresponding to a current
      density setting of 3 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;; and (3) a frequency
      modulation according to a triangle waveform having a peak of 1 Hz,
      a minimum of 0.001 Hz, and a modulation rate of 0.0001 Hz. The
      current was applied to the workpiece for three days while
      maintaining the bath's iron composition and pH at 0.02M and 3.0,
      respectively, by automated addback of iron chloride solution and
      sulfamic acid solution. Also, magnetic fibers/particles were
      periodically added to the plating bath to build upon the existing
      porous baffle.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] After three days, the preform was removed and wrapped
      several times in tight-weave silverized nylon cloth. The workpiece
      was then re-immersed in the plating bath. The plating bath during
      this latter portion of plating was continuously recycled through a
      10?, 1 micron polypropylene filter cartridge such that the entire
      bath volume passed through the filter at least 3 times per hour.
      No additional magnetic fibers/particles were added during this
      portion of the deposition. After an additional three days of
      plating, the workpiece was removed and thoroughly rinsed in DI
      water.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Stress free material using control of electrodepositing process
      One difficulty with the preparation of coatings articles produced
      by electrodeposition processes arises from the internal stress in
      the electrodeposited materials that can lead to the failure of
      coatings and articles. A variety of means have been used to reduce
      the stress in electrodeposited materials including the use of
      stress reducing agents such as saccharin in nickel plating, and
      thiourea for copper plating. The ability to electrodeposited
      materials, and particularly metals, in stress free or low stress
      form without the use of additives that can negatively impact the
      performance of electrodeposited materials could provide an advance
      to the material science of electroplating and electroforming of
      coatings and articles. <br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This disclosure provides electrodeposition processes for the
      application of low stress or stress free coatings and the
      preparation of low stress or stress free articles. The low stress
      and stress free coatings and electroformed articles may be
      prepared as a single material that is unlayered, or as an
      electroformed coating or article that is comprised of layered or
      nanolayered metal(s) or metal alloy(s) without the use of
      additives for the reduction of stress. In one embodiment the
      technology described herein is directed to a method of applying a
      low stress or stress free coating to substrate, or of
      electroforming a low stress or stress free article using
      electrodeposition comprising the steps of: applying an electrical
      current to said substrate, said current having a time varying
      current density, wherein the current density is controlled as a
      function of time, said function of time comprised of two or more
      cycles wherein each cycle independently has a first time period
      and a second time period. In this embodiment the value of said
      current density during said first time period is greater than
      zero, and the value of the current density during said second time
      period is less than zero, provided that the ratio, RA, which is
      defined as the ratio of the area bounded by the function and a
      line representing zero current density for said first period
      divided by the absolute value of the area bounded by the function
      and a line representing zero current density for said second
      period, is greater than 1. In another embodiment the technology
      described herein is directed to a method of applying a low stress
      or stress free coating to substrate, or of electroforming a low
      stress or stress free article using electrodeposition comprising
      the steps of: (a) providing a bath including one or more
      electrodepositable species; (b) providing a substrate to be
      coated; (c) at least partially immersing the substrate in the
      bath, the substrate being in electrical communication with a power
      supply; and (d) applying an electrical current to said substrate,
      said current having a time varying current density. In this
      embodiment the current density is controlled as a function of
      time, and the function of time is comprised of two or more cycles
      wherein each cycle independently has a first time period and a
      second time period, where the value of said current density during
      said first time period is greater than zero, and the value of the
      current density during said second time period is less than zero,
      provided that the ratio, (3A, which is defined as the ratio of the
      area bounded by the function and a line representing zero current
      density for said first period divided by the absolute value of the
      area bounded by the function and a line representing zero current
      density for said second period is greater than 1. Embodiments
      described herein also provide coatings and articles comprising
      stress free or low stress materials electrodeposited without the
      use of stress reducing additives by the methods described herein.

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Materials deposited by electrodeposition must have low stress
      to avoid cracking or peeling in the plating process or subsequent
      use. Moreover if the electrodeposited materials contain thin or
      narrow features, then the stress must be tensile as compressive
      stress would likely result in buckling of the material. A good
      deal of stress is intrinsic to the plating process, and some
      systems such as Ag and Fe-Ni are notorious for their high stress.
      See e.g., Marc J. Maldou "LIGA and Micromolding" Chapter 4, The
      MEMS Handbook, 2nd edition, CRC Press, Edited by Mohamed
      Gad-el-Hak (2006). <br>
      <br>
      While it is possible to relieve stress from electrodeposited
      materials by using stress reducing agents during their deposition,
      such agents not only add to the cost of final product, perhaps
      more importantly they can affect the performance and properties of
      the deposited materials. The processes described herein provide,
      among other things, an electrodeposition process that produces low
      stress coatings without the use of stress reducing agents.
      Embodiments of the processes described herein may be used to
      electroform articles where the process employs a mandrel as a
      substrate that can be separated from the electrodeposited
      materials. The processes may also be used to form a coating on a
      substrate that is comprised of a single layer of low stress or
      stress free electrodeposited material and in some embodiments, the
      process can be used to form multiple layers or graded layers of
      electrodeposited materials, one or more of which are layers of low
      stress or stress free electrodeposited materials. Stress in a
      coating or layer may refer to the tendency of a material to curl
      or deform, causing it to peel away from the substrate onto which
      it is deposited. Tensile and compressive stresses in a coating or
      layer result in concave and convex delamination, respectively.
      Stress in an electrodeposited coating or article may be evaluated
      by any suitable means in the known in the art. For purposes of
      this disclosure, low stress coatings and articles are those that
      can maintain contact with a rigid substrate during
      electrodeposition when the bond strength is less than 400 MPa, or,
      more preferably less than 350MPa, 300MPa, 250MPa, 200MPa, 150MPa,
      100 MPa, 60 MPa, 40 MPa, 30 MPa, 20 MPa, or l OMPa. For the
      purposes of this disclosure stress free means that the coating or
      article has a level of stress that is at, or below, the level of
      measurement, and which does not affect the ability of the article
      to maintain contact with the substrate during electrodeposition. <br>
      <br>
      The stress of an electrodeposited material also may be
      characterized using conventional methods such as the bent strip
      method and commercially available testing equipment such a Model
      683 deposit stress analyzer, available from Specialty Testing and
      Development Co., PA. For purposes of this disclosure, low stress
      coatings, layers, and articles have less than 400 MPa, or, more
      preferably less than 350MPa, 300MPa, 250MPa, 200MPa, 150MPa,
      100MPa, 80 MPa, 60 MPa, 40 MPa, 30 MPa, 20 MPa, or l OM Pa of
      stress as assessed by the bent strip method. For the purposes of
      this disclosure, where a bent strip test is employed as means of
      assessing stress, "stress free" means that the coating, layer or
      article has a level of stress that is at, or below, the level of
      measurement in the bent strip test. For the purposes of this
      disclosure, "electrodeposition" defines a process in which
      electricity drives formation of a deposit on an electrode (e.g., a
      substrate) at least partially submerged in a bath including a
      component or species, which forms a solid phase upon either
      oxidation or reduction. The terms electrodeposition or
      electrodeposited include both electrolytic deposition (e.g.,
      reduction of metal ions to metals) and electrophoretic deposition.
      For the purposes of this disclosure, "electrodepositable species"
      define the constituents of a material deposited using
      electrodeposition. <br>
      <br>
      Electrodeposited species include, without limitation, metal ions
      forming a metal salt. Particles which are deposited in a metal
      matrix formed by electrodeposition, polymers and metal oxides can
      also be electrodeposited. Organic molecules (e.g., citric acid,
      malic acid, acetic acid, and succinic acid) may also be
      co-deposited with other electrodepositable species. For the
      purpose of this disclosure, current density is the current
      (generally in amperes) per unit area of a substrate upon which
      material is to be electrodeposited. Where current densities are
      stated to be positive, they are cathodic (reducing) currents and
      negative current densities are anodic (oxidizing) currents. For
      the purpose of this disclosure, the average current density for an
      electrodeposition process is taken as the integral of the current
      density versus time curve describing the process, divided by the
      total time and has the units of charge per unit area per unit
      time. Average current density can be calculated for one or more
      cycles of the function used to control current density in the
      electrodeposition processes described herein.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of this disclosure, nanolayered means layered
      material having at least one layer with at least one dimension
      (usually thickness) greater than 0.5 nm and less than 1,000 nm.
      For the purpose of this disclosure, an electrolyte can be an
      aqueous solution or an ionic liquid, either of which may comprise
      one or more electrodepositable species. In one embodiment a method
      of producing low stress or stress free coatings on a substrate, or
      of electroforming an article on a substrate (e.g., a mandrel)
      using electrodeposition comprises: applying an electrical current
      to said substrate, said current having a time varying current
      density, wherein the current density is controlled as a function
      of time, said function of time comprised of two or more cycles
      wherein each cycle independently has a first time period and a
      second time period, where the value of said current density during
      said first time period is greater than zero, and the value of the
      current density during said second time period is less than zero,
      provided that the ratio, (3A, which is defined as the ratio of the
      area bounded by the function and a line representing zero current
      density for said first period divided by the absolute value of the
      area bounded by the function and a line representing zero current
      density for said second period, is greater than 1. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment a method of producing low stress or stress
      free coating to substrate, or of electroforming an article on a
      substrate (e.g., a mandrel) using electrodeposition comprises: (a)
      providing a bath including one or more electrodepositable species;
      (b) providing a substrate to be coated; (c) at least partially
      immersing the substrate in the bath, the substrate being in
      electrically communication with a power supply; and (d) applying
      an electrical current to said substrate, said current having a
      time varying current density, wherein the current density is
      controlled as a function of time, said function of time comprised
      of two or more cycles wherein each cycle independently has a first
      time period and a second time period, and where the value of said
      current density during said first time period is greater than
      zero, and the value of the current density during said second time
      period is less than zero, provided that the ratio, RA, which is
      defined as the ratio of the area bounded by the function and a
      line representing zero current density for said first period
      divided by the absolute value of the area bounded by the function
      and a line representing zero current density for said second
      period, is greater than 1. While the description provided in
      Figure 1 is not to be viewed as limiting the type of functions
      that may be employed to produce low stress or stress free coatings
      and articles by electrodeposition, that figure illustrates
      exemplary functions that may be employed to produce low stress or
      stress free materials through electrodeposition. <br>
      <br>
      The embodiments described above may be better understood by
      reference to that figure. As positive current density is defined
      as a reducing cathodic current for the purposes of this
      disclosure, ratio (3A (Beta based on the integrated areas) must be
      greater than 1 for a cycle in order for there to be a net
      deposition of reducible materials (e.g. metal cations) at the
      cathode in the methods forming low or stress free coatings and
      articles described herein. The value of RA may effectively be any
      value greater than 1 and less than infinity for any cycle of the
      of the method but more typically (3A will be between a value that
      is greater than 1 and less than 100, or greater than 1.001 and
      less than 100, or greater than 1.01 and less than 100, or greater
      than 1.05 and less than 100, or greater than 1.1 and less than
      100. In some embodiments the value of (3A is greater than a value
      selected from 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,000, or
      10,000; in such embodiments the value of RA may be limited by an
      upper value of 100,000. In other embodiments the value of the
      ratio (3A may have a value greater than 1, or 1.01, or 1.05 or 1.1
      and less than a value independently selected from 1.2, 1.25, 1.3,
      1,35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8,
      3.0, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,000,
      or 10,000. In some embodiments the value of RA within a range
      selected from: 1.01 to 2, 1.01 to 1.7, 1.01 to 1.6, 1.01 to 1.5,
      1.01 to 1.4, 1.01 to 1.3, 1.01 to 1.2, 1.1 to 1.5, 1.1 to 1.6, 1.1
      to 1.7, 1.1 to 1.8, 1.3 to 1.5, 1.3 to 1.7, 1.3 to 1.9, 1.5 to
      1.7, 1.5 to 1.8, 1.5 to 1.9, 1.5 to 2.0, 1.6 to 1.9, 1.6 to 2, 1.7
      to 1.9, 1.8 to 2, 1.5 to 8, 1.5 to 6, 2 to 40, 2 to 20, 2 to 10, 4
      to 40, 1.1 to 50, or 2 to 50. <br>
      <br>
      The number of cycles, each of which includes first period of
      electrodeposition and a second period of oxidation (etching or
      dissolution), used to apply a coating or to prepare an article
      using the methods described herein depends upon the thickness of
      the desired coating or article and the characteristics of the
      cycle employed (e.g., total passed charge and RA which represents
      the ratio of the material deposited to the material removed in a
      cycle). In some embodiments the function used in the
      electrodeposition process has 3 or more cycles, 10 or more cycles,
      50 or more cycles, 100 or more cycles, 200 or more cycles, 500 or
      more cycles, 1,000 or more cycles, 2,000 or more cycles, 5,000 or
      more cycles, 10,000 or more cycles, 20,000 or more cycles, 50,000
      or more cycles, 100,000 or more cycles, 200,000 or more cycles,
      400,000 or more cycles, 500,000 or more cycles, 750,000 or more
      cycles, or 1,000,000 or more cycles. <br>
      <br>
      While current density is controlled as a function of time in the
      electrodeposition processes described herein, the function for the
      individual cycle need not, but can, be the same. In some
      embodiments the function is identical for each cycle (although
      other parameters including the temperature and plating bath
      composition can be varied). In other embodiments the same function
      may be applied for one cycle or over a series of consecutive cycle
      followed by the application of a different function (with or
      without a change in the other parameters). In some embodiments the
      function applied for the low stress or stress free
      electrodeposition process is identical for 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50,
      100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000,
      200,000, 500,000 consecutive cycles and the other plating
      parameters are also held constant (do not change). In other
      embodiments, the function applied for the low stress or stress
      free electrodeposition process is identical for 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,
      20, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000,
      100,000, 200,000, 500,000 consecutive cycles and one or more, or
      two or more, or three or more plating parameters (e.g., plating
      temperature, bath composition, or the concentration of the
      electrodepositable species in the bath) varied for one or more of
      the cycles. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment the function employed for the
      electrodeposition processes described herein has 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,
      10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1,000 consecutive cycles
      wherein the function is employed in the electrodeposition process
      is not identical for those consecutive cycles. In one variation
      the function is varied between a first function and a second
      function for alternate cycles. In another variation the function
      is varied from a first function to second function to a third
      function over three consecutive cycles. In some embodiments the
      value of the ratio (3A can be varied. In such embodiments, RA may
      be varied for 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000,
      10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000 or more
      consecutive cycles. In those embodiments where RA is increased or
      decreased from a first value to a second value by incrementally
      changing (3A, the disclosed methods may be used to create coatings
      or articles that vary from a first property or composition to a
      second property or composition in a continuous fashion (e.g.,
      graded materials). The functions describing the change in current
      density with respect to time for a cycle of electrodeposition may
      be of virtually any form. In some embodiments the function is one
      that has a discontinuous first derivative with respect to time.
      Such functions include square wave, rectangular wave, triangular
      wave, or saw tooth wave forms possessing a DC offset. <br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments the function describing the change in current
      density with respect to time may have a continuous first order
      derivative. In other embodiments such functions may have a
      continuous first order derivative with respect to time. Functions
      with continuous first order derivatives include shifted sine wave,
      shifted cosine wave, and other periodic wave type functions
      possessing a DC offset. Shifted sine wave functions, which are a
      special case of the general wave forms used to control the current
      density, may be described using three parameters, the offset
      current density, the frequency and the peak to peak current
      density used for the plating process. See Figure 2, which
      describes the terms that can be used with a "shifted sine wave"
      that has been shifted vertically on the current density axis by
      the application of an offset current density. For shifted sine
      wave functions a value 0, which is the ratio of the peak cathodic
      current density to the absolute value of the peak anodic current
      density may be defined. See Figure 2 and associated text. Where
      shifted sine or shifted cosine wave forms are used they are offset
      such that ratio (3A or (3 will be greater than 1, resulting in net
      electrodeposition of material at the cathode. In other embodiments
      the sine or cosine waves may be modified such that the amplitudes
      for the wave forms in the range of 0 to 180 and the range 180 to
      360 degrees is different, resulting in a (3A that is greater than
      one. In some embodiments wave forms other than shifted sine waves
      and square (rectangular) waves with DC offsets may be employed,
      and part or all of any method described herein may be conducted
      provided that the wave form utilized is not a sine wave or a
      square (rectangular) wave with a DC offset. <br>
      <br>
      Hence, any of the methods of this disclosure may be carried out
      with the proviso that when current density is controlled as a
      function of time, the function is not a sine wave or a square or
      rectangular wave form. The length of time for each cycle of the
      electrodeposition processes described herein may be the same or
      different, with the length of time varying independently for each
      cycle. In some embodiments the function describing the deposition
      process may have I to 4,000, 1 to 2,000, 1 to 800, 1 to 400, 1 to
      200, 1 to 100, 1 to 10, 2 to 50, 3 to 75, 10 to 200, 50 to 300, or
      100 to 400 cycles per second (Hz). In general, the frequency of
      the wave form (e.g., sine wave, square wave, or triangular wave)
      will vary from about 0.01 to about 1,000 Hz, with ranges typically
      being from about 10 to about 400 Hz. The peak anodic and cathodic
      currents, which are the maximum currents applied to a substrate
      during the periods of electrodeposition and oxidation (etching)
      during each cycle of the functions used to control current
      density, may also be modulated. Generally the absolute value of
      peak cathodic and anodic currents can be independently varied from
      about 1 to about 2,000 mA/cm2, with typical ranges being from
      about 10 to about 300 mA/cm2 or from about 60 to about 100 mA/cm2.
      The methods of electrodepositing low stress or stress free coating
      or electroforming articles may be used with a broad variety of
      electrodepositable species. In some embodiments the bath used for
      electrodeposition may contain only one electrodepositable species.
      <br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments where the bath contains only one
      electrodepositable species the electrodepositable species is
      selected from the group consisting of. nickel, iron, cobalt,
      copper, zinc, manganese, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium,
      gold, aluminum, magnesium, and silver. In some embodiments where
      the bath contains only one electrodepositable species the
      electrodepositable species is selected from the group consisting
      of. nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, platinum, palladium,
      rhodium, iridium, gold, aluminum, magnesium, and silver. In other
      embodiments where the electrolyte bath contains only one
      electrodepositable species the electrodepositable species is
      selected from the group consisting of: nickel, cobalt, manganese,
      platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, and silver. In still other
      embodiments where the bath contains only one electrodepositable
      species the electrodepositable species is selected from the group
      consisting of. nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, gold, and
      silver. In still other embodiments, the methods of
      electrodepositing low stress or stress free materials may be
      practiced with the proviso that the electrodepositable species is
      not iron when the bath (electrolyte) contains only one
      electrodepositable species of metal; in such embodiments the bath
      (electrolyte) may further not include stress reducing agents
      (e.g., thiourea or saccharin). <br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments the electrolyte bath (electrolyte) used for
      electrodeposition may contain two or more, or three or more, or
      four or more electrodepositable species. In some embodiments where
      the bath (electrolyte) contains two or more, or three or more, or
      four or more electrodepositable species, at least one
      electrodepositable species is selected from the group consisting
      of: molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc,
      manganese, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, gold, aluminum,
      magnesium, and silver. In other embodiments at least one
      electrodepositable species is selected from the group consisting
      of: molybdenum and tungsten. In embodiments, where the bath
      (electrolyte) for electrodeposition contains two or more, or three
      or more, or four or more electrodepositable species, the methods
      of electrodepositing low stress or stress free materials may be
      practiced with the proviso that the electrodepositable species is
      not iron.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments the material to be deposited is an alloy
      comprising nickel having greater than about 60% 70%, 75% 80%, 85%
      90% or 95% of the electrodeposited material as nickel on a weight
      basis. In other embodiments the material to be deposited will be
      an alloy comprising nickel and iron having greater than about 55%,
      60%, 70%, 75% 80%, 85% 90% or 95% of the electrodeposited material
      as the iron with the remainder made up of either nickel, or nickel
      and up to 5% other metals on a weight basis. In another embodiment
      the material to be deposited is an alloy comprising chromium,
      iron, and optionally nickel. In such alloys the chromium is
      present as 11-25% of the electrodeposited material, nickel is
      present from 0-20% of the electrodeposited materials, with the
      remainder made up of either iron, or iron and up to 5% other
      metals on a weight basis. <br>
      <br>
      In still another embodiment the material to be deposited is an
      alloy comprising copper and zinc. In such alloys the copper is
      present at 1-95% of the electrodeposited material, preferably
      between 50% and 80%, with the remainder made up of either zinc, or
      zinc and up to 10% other metals on a weight basis. In still
      another embodiment the material to be deposited is an alloy
      comprising copper and tin. In such alloys the copper is present at
      1-95% of the electrodeposited material, preferably 11 % to 13%,
      with the remainder made up of either tin, or tin and up to 10%
      other metals on a weight basis. In yet another embodiment the
      material to be deposited is an alloy comprising copper and
      aluminum. In such alloys the copper is present at 1-25% of the
      electrodeposited material, with the remainder made up of either
      aluminum, or aluminum and up to 10% other metals (such as

      electrodeposited alone or as an alloy wherein chromium comprises
      greater than 50% of the electrodeposited material on a weight
      basis. In methods of electrodepositing chromium the chromium may
      be electrodeposited from either a Cr+3 or Cr+6 salt. <br>
      <br>
      One embodiment provide for the electrodeposition of chromium as an
      alloy with iron, wherein the chromium comprises 1%-75% of the
      electrodeposited material on a weight basis with the remainder
      made up of either iron, or iron and up to 10% other metals on a
      weight basis. In such an embodiment the chromium may be
      electrodeposited from a Cr+3 salt. In still other embodiments, the
      material to be electrodeposited is an alloy comprising a metal
      selected from molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, iron, cobalt, copper,
      zinc, manganese, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, gold,

      50% 60% 70%, 75% 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% of the electrodeposited
      alloy is comprised of the selected metal. Other embodiments
      provide for the electrodepositing of iron with an organic molecule
      (e.g., citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid, or succinic acid). In
      such embodiments the organic molecule may comprise up to 2% of the
      total weight of the deposited material with the remainder made up
      of either iron, or iron and up to 10% other metals on a weight
      basis.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments where the system (electrolyte) contains one or
      more electrodepositable species, those species may be the same
      electrodepositable species for the entirety of electrodeposition
      processes (the same species for all cycles). In other embodiments
      where the system contains one or more electrodepositable species,
      the composition of the bath used for electrodeposition may be
      changed so that different species or mixtures of
      electrodepositable species are present for different portions of
      the electrodeposition processes (i.e., to form a material that is
      compositionally modulated throughout its growth direction). In
      addition to varying composition of the electroplating media
      (bath), a variety of electrodeposition parameters can be modulated
      while still electrodepositing low stress or stress coatings or
      electroforming low stress or stress free articles. In some
      embodiments one or more of the electrodeposition parameters that
      can be modulated in one or more independently selected cycles,
      (whether those cycles are consecutive or not) are selected from:
      peak positive current density; the length of time of said first
      time period; the peak negative current density; the length of time
      of said second time period, the average current density,
      electrodeposition temperature (temperature of the bath) or the
      composition of the electrodeposition media (e.g.,
      electrodeposition bath) may be. In other embodiments, one or more,
      or two or more, parameters selected from: the peak positive
      current density; the length of time of said first time period; the
      peak negative current density; the length of time of said second
      time period, or the average current density may be modulated in
      one or more, or two or more, independently selected cycles. <br>
      <br>
      In still other embodiments, one or more, or two or more,
      parameters selected from the temperature of the electrodeposition
      media (bath) or the composition of said the bath may be modulated
      in one or more, or two or more, independently selected cycles.
      Embodiments of the methods described herein may be employed to
      produce low stress or stress free coatings and articles that may
      consist of one layer (material having a single type of structure
      and composition) in addition to coatings and articles that are
      layered or nanolayered. Layers and nanolayers present in the
      coatings and articles described herein need not arise from single
      cycles of the function used to control the electrodeposition
      process, instead, layers or nanolayers may arise from the
      application of numerous cycles of a function used to control
      electrodeposition. Thus, in some embodiments, the methods
      described herein may be used to develop layered or nanolayered
      coatings and articles by utilizing different wave forms in
      combinations. For example, a single composition may be deposited
      as a low stress or stress free layer utilizing numerous cycles of
      a sine wave function, followed by the deposition of a next layer
      of the same composition utilizing numerous cycles of a saw tooth
      wave form. Alternatively, low stress or stress free layers may be
      built up by the application of numerous cycles of specific
      function describing the electrodeposition of a first composition
      followed by the use numerous cycles of the same function to apply
      a layer of different composition or a layer of the same
      composition at a different temperature. Embodiments of the methods
      described herein are particularly useful as they permit the
      electrodeposition and electroforming of low stress or stress free
      coatings and articles without the use of stress reducing agent;
      however, where desirable it is possible to use the methods
      describe above in combination standard electrodeposition process
      that either do not control stress or use stress reducing agents.
      Thus, in addition to the deposition of layers of a substance
      (e.g., a metal) using low stress or stress free electrodeposition
      as described herein, it is possible to deposit layers of low
      stress or stress free materials utilizing stress reducing agents
      or by standard electrodeposition (e.g., DC electroplating). In
      some instances, such as where control of defect propagation or the
      direction of corrosive decomposition of coatings is desired, it
      may be desirable to prepare layered or nanolayered materials that
      have repeating (e.g., alternating) layers of. stress free and low
      stress materials; low stress or stress free materials alternated
      with layers of uncontrolled stress materials; or layers of stress
      free, low stress and uncontrolled stress materials. A variety of
      substrates for electrodeposition may be employed in the methods
      described herein. While the substrate may comprise a solid,
      conductive material (such as a metal object to be coated), other
      substrates are also possible. For example, instead of being solid,
      the substrate may be formed of a porous material, such as a
      consolidated porous substrate, such as a foam, a mesh, or a
      fabric. Alternatively, the substrate can be formed of an
      unconsolidated material, such as, a bed of particles, or a
      plurality of unconnected fibers. In some embodiments, including
      for example, embodiments which utilize electrodeposition, the
      substrate is generally formed from a conductive material or a non-
      conductive material which is made conductive by metallizing. In
      other embodiments, the substrate may be a semi-conductive
      material, such as a silicon wafer, or a nonconductive material,
      such as a ceramic or plastic composite. Where it is desirable to
      prepare an article through the use of electroforming, a solid
      conductive mandrel that can be separated from the electroformed
      materials may be employed (i.e., titanium or stainless steel
      mandrel). The electrodeposition methods described herein may be
      used without etching substrates prior to the application of low
      stress coatings without the use of additives in the
      electrodeposition process (e.g., the bath) to relieve stress. The
      methods of coating a substrate described herein may be utilized
      without the use of etching by electrical current, that is to say
      the application of a net negative (anodic current) to the
      substrate prior to (or immediately prior to) the application of a
      low stress coating. Similarly, the methods of coating a substrate
      described herein may be utilized without the use of etching by
      chemical means prior to (or immediately prior to) the application
      of a low stress coating without the use of additive to relieve
      stress. Some embodiments of this present disclosure are directed
      to a coating or article produced by the methods of
      electrodepositing low stress or stress free materials described
      herein that do not require the use of stress reliving agents. In
      some embodiments, a coating or article comprises a single low
      stress or stress free layer of electrodeposited materials that has
      not been deposited using stress reducing agents. In other
      embodiments, a low stress or stress free coating or article of the
      present technology comprises: a first material having a first
      composition and defined by one or more of a first composition, a
      first average grain size, a first grain boundary geometry, a first
      crystal orientation, and a first defect density; and a second
      material having a second composition and a second nanostructure
      defined by one or more of a second composition, a second average
      grain size, a second grain boundary geometry, a second crystal
      orientation, and a second defect density. In still another
      embodiment, a low stress or stress free coating comprises: a first
      material having a first composition and a first nanostructure
      defined by one or more of a first composition, a first average
      grain size, a first grain boundary geometry, a first crystal
      orientation, and a first defect density; and a second material
      having a second composition and a second nanostructure defined by
      one or more of a second composition, a second average grain size,
      a second grain boundary geometry, a second crystal orientation,
      and a second defect density; with the proviso that the second
      composition is the same as the first composition while one of the
      first average grain size differs from the second average grain
      size, the first grain boundary geometry differs from the second
      grain boundary geometry, the first crystal orientation differs
      from the second crystal orientation, and the first defect density
      differs from the second defect density.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, property modulated coatings and articles are
      provided comprising a plurality of alternating layers, in which
      one or more of those layers are low stress or stress free layers
      that have specific mechanical properties, such as, for example,
      tensile strength, elongation, hardness, ductility, and impact
      toughness, and where the specific mechanical properties are
      achieved by altering the nanostructure of those layers. Examples
      of such are provided in Examples 1 and 2. In general, tensile
      strength may be controlled through controlling frequency of a
      signal used for electrodepositing a material. In general,
      percentage of elongation of a material can also be controlled
      through frequency. In general, hardness, ductility, and impact
      toughness can be controlled through controlling deposition
      temperature. Other methods for controlling tensile strength,
      elongation, hardness, ductility and impact toughness are also
      envisioned. The structure of low stress and stress free
      electrodeposited materials may also be controlled in order to
      produce materials with desired properties. Smaller grain sizes,
      which can range, e.g., from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100
      nanometers, generally will yield layers that exhibit high impact
      toughness. Large grain sizes, which generally will be greater than
      1,000 nanometers, such as, for example, 5,000 or 10,000
      nanometers, will generally produce layers that provide greater
      ductility. Of course, the grain sizes will be relative within a
      given group of layers such that even a grain size in the
      intermediate or small ranges described above could be deemed large
      compared to, e.g., a very small grain size or small compared to a
      very large grain size. Generally, such grain sizes can be
      controlled through process parameters, such as, for example
      deposition temperature (e.g., electrodeposition bath temperature).
      To modulate grain size utilizing temperature control, a first
      layer defined by large grains can be formed by increasing the
      deposition temperature and a second layer defined by smaller
      grains can be formed by decreasing the temperature. The thickness
      of the individual layers in the coatings and articles can range
      from about 0.1 nanometer to about 10,000 nanometers or more. Layer
      thickness may range from about 5 nanometers to 50 nanometers,
      although varied thicknesses are expressly envisioned. Coatings and
      articles prepared by the methods described herein may contain a
      single layer or any number of desired layers, including a number
      of layers within a range selected from: 2- 10, 10-20, 20-30,
      30-50, 50-100, 2-500, 100-500, 2-1,000, 500-1,000, 1,000- 5,000
      5,000- 10,000, or 2-10,000 or even more layers. Each layer may be
      independently created with a desired composition, thickness, and
      nanostructure/microstructure and with each layer being
      independently chosen to be of a low stress or stress free nature.
      <br>
      <br>
      The coatings and articles described herein may be used separately
      or as part of other coatings and articles and may be incorporated
      into laminated structures. In addition, the methods of preparing
      low stress or stress free coatings and articles utilizing the
      electrodeposition methods described herein, may be used in
      conjunction with other methods of preparing low stress or stress
      free coatings and articles. Such methods include the use of
      chemical deposition such as electroless (auto-catalytic)
      deposition or plating, chemical vapor deposition, or physical
      vapor deposition. Such processes may be advantageous where it is
      difficult to electrodeposit specific metals such as aluminum,
      titanium, and magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following examples are merely intended to illustrate the
      practice and advantages of specific embodiments of this
      disclosure; and are not intended in any way to limit or illustrate
      any limits of the methods, articles or embodiments described
      herein. Example 1: Low Stress Electrodeposition of Iron Deposition
      of iron layers in a low stress or stress free form may be
      accomplished using an offset sine wave to control current density
      in the electrodeposition process. The beta value is defined as the
      ratio of peak cathodic to peak anodic current densities;
      alternately, (3A is defined as the ratio cathodic charge density
      (integral of the cathodic portion of j(t) with respect to time) to
      the anodic charge density (integral of the anodic portion of j (t)
      with respect to time). At low beta value (&lt; 1.8), the
      electroplated iron layers have low hardness and high ductility.
      The electroplating system includes a tank, electrolyte of FeCl2
      bath with or without CaC12, computer controlled heater to maintain
      bath temperature, a power supply, and a controlling computer. The
      anode is low carbon steel sheet, and cathode is titanium plate
      which will make it easy for the deposit to be peeled off. Carbon
      steel can also be used as the cathode if the deposit does not need
      to be peeled off from the substrate. Polypropylene balls are used
      to cover the bath surface in order to reduce bath evaporation. The
      process for producing an iron laminate is as follows: 1. Prepare a
      tank of electrolyte consisting of 2.0 M FeCl2 plus 1.7 CaC12 M in
      deionized water. 2. Adjust the pH of the electrolyte to -0.5 - 1.5
      by addition of HCI. 3. Control the bath temperature at 60 C.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Clean the titanium substrate cathode and low carbon steel
      sheet anode with deionized water and immerse both of them into the
      bath. 5. To start electroplating a high ductility layer, turn on
      the power supply, and controlling the power supply to generate a
      shifted sine wave with a beta of 1.26 ((3A = 1.50) by setting the
      following parameters: 250 Hz with a peak cathodic current density
      of 43 mA/cm2, and a peak anodic current density of -34 mA/cm2
      applied to the substrate (i.e., a peak to peak current of 78
      mA/cm2 with a DC offset of 4.4 mA/cm2). Continue electroplating
      for an amount of time necessary to achieve the desired high
      ductility layer thickness. 6. Remove the substrate and deposit
      from the bath and immerse in DI water for minutes and blow it dry
      with compressed air. 7. Peel the deposit from the underlying
      titanium substrate to yield a free- standing low stress iron
      sheet. Example 2: Electrodeposition of Low Stress High Elongation
      Nickel-Iron Alloy Low stress or stress free Ni-Fe alloys can be
      electrodeposited using a shifted sine wave with a defined 0 value
      (see Figure 2 and associated text). At low beta values (&lt; 1.3),
      the electroplated iron-nickel alloy layers have low hardness, low
      stress, larger grain size, and high elongation, while at high beta
      (&gt; 1.5), the plated iron-nickel alloy layers have higher
      hardness, smaller grain size and lower elongation. At beta value
      of (&lt;1.25), the deposited Ni- Fe alloy film's stress is almost
      zero, which makes it possible to obtain low stress and ductile
      Ni-Fe alloy deposits without sulfur co-deposition caused by adding
      stress reducing additives such as saccharin. The low stress Fe-Ni
      deposit makes it possible to deposit very thick layers. It is also
      possible to deposit onto semiconductors and low adhesion
      substrates such as conductively coated non-conductive mandrels. <br>
      <br>
      Because no sulfur containing additives are used, it is possible
      for these Ni-Fe alloy deposits to be used at high temperature
      environments without brittleness caused by co-deposited sulfur.
      For electrodeposition of Ni-Fe alloys the system includes a tank,
      an electrolyte of a mixture of FeCl2 and NiC12, a computer
      controlled heater to maintain bath temperature, a power supply,
      and a controlling computer. The anode is an Ni-Fe alloy plate. Any
      conductive material can be used as the cathode, however, where
      titanium is used as the cathode, the deposit can be removed from
      its surface. Carbon steel can be used as the cathode if the
      deposit does not need to be removed from the substrate.
      Polypropylene balls are used to cover the bath surface in order to
      reduce bath evaporation. Electrodeposition of the Ni-Fe laminate
      is conducted as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. A tank (bath) of electrolyte consisting of a mixture of 1.0 M
      FeC12 and 1.0 M NiC12 in deionized water is prepared. <br>
      <br>
      2. The pH of the electrolyte is adjusted to 0.8 by addition of
      HCI. <br>
      <br>
      3. The bath temperature is maintained at 50 C. <br>
      <br>
      4. The substrate cathode (metals, alloys, semiconductors, or
      conductively coated non- conductive mandrels) and the Fe-Ni alloy
      anode are cleaned with deionized water and immersed in the
      electrolyte bath. <br>
      <br>
      5. Electroplating of a low stress, high ductility layer is started
      by providing power to the electroplating power supply, and
      controlling the power supply to generate a shifted sine wave with
      a 0 value of 1.25 by setting the following parameters: 250 Hz with
      a peak-to - peak current density of 60 mA/cm2, a DC offset current
      density 3.3 mA/cm2. Electroplating is continued for an amount of
      time necessary to achieve the desired thickness. <br>
      <br>
      6. The substrate bearing the electrodeposited Fe-Ni alloy is
      removed from the bath and immerse in deionized water for 10
      minutes and blown dry with compressed air. <br>
      <br>
      7. The electrodeposited Ni-Fe alloy is removed by peeling it from
      the underlying substrate to yield a free-standing nickel-iron
      film. Alternatively, the deposited nickel-iron alloy may be left
      as a deposit on the substrate. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3:</b> <br>
      <br>
      Electrodeposition of low stress Ni films using Shifted Sine Wave
      Electrodeposition of nickel films may be accomplished using a
      shifted sine wave similar to that employed in Example 2. At low
      beta values (&lt; 1.3) electroplated nickel films have low
      hardness, low stress, larger grain size, and high elongation,
      while at high beta (&gt; 1.5), the plated nickel films have higher
      hardness, smaller grain size and lower elongation. At beta value
      of (&lt;1.25), deposited Ni films have almost zero stress, which
      makes it possible to obtain low stress and ductile Ni deposits
      without sulfur co-deposition from stress reducing additives such
      as saccharin. The low stress of Ni deposit electrodeposited using
      the embodiments disclosed herein makes it possible to deposit very
      thick layers. By controlling the wave form used to deposit nickel
      in a low stress or stress free format, it is also possible to
      electrodeposite nickel onto low adhesion substrates such as
      conductively coated non- conductive mandrels. Because no sulfur
      containing additives are used, it is possible for these Ni
      deposits to be used in high temperature environments without
      becoming brittle due to co- deposited sulfur. For
      electrodeposition of nickel the system includes a tank, an
      electrolyte of NiC12, a computer controlled heater to maintain
      bath temperature, a power supply, and a controlling 17 computer.
      The anode is a nickel plate. Any conductive material can be used
      as the cathode. However, where titanium is used as the cathode,
      the deposit can be removed from its surface. Carbon steel can be
      used as the cathode if the deposit does not need to be removed
      from the substrate. Polypropylene balls are used to cover the bath
      surface in order to reduce bath evaporation. The process for
      producing an iron deposit is as follows: <br>
      <br>
      1. A tank (bath) of electrolyte consisting of a mixture of 1.0 M
      NiC12 in deionized water is prepared. <br>
      <br>
      2. The pH of the electrolyte is adjusted to 0.8 by addition of
      HC1. <br>
      <br>
      3. The bath temperature is maintained at 50 C. <br>
      <br>
      4. The substrate cathode (metals, alloys, semiconductors, or
      conductively coated non- conductive mandrels) and the nickel anode
      are cleaned with deionized water and immersed in the electrolyte
      bath. <br>
      <br>
      5. Electroplating of a low stress, high ductility layer is started
      by providing power to the electroplating power supply, and

      herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This disclosure relates to composite armor materials and
      methods of manufacturing such a materials. Armor produced using
      the disclosed methods and composite armor materials can include
      one or more of the following advantages: a) an outer layer or
      strike face providing excellent hardness and toughness b) a middle
      or core layer that absorbs substantial compressive energy and
      substantially impedes pressure waves associated with ballistic
      impact, and c) an inner layer (i.e., a spall liner) having
      improved reinforcement to prevent ballistic penetration.
      Additional advantages afforded by the claimed material include
      resistance to chemical attack, a high strength-to-weight ratio,
      and easy production of a multitude of armor geometries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Armor has been used throughout history as protective
      clothing or outer layer intended to prevent harm from projectiles.
      Today's advanced armor is a layered composite material. In
      general, modern composite armor includes three layers: (1) an
      outer region also known as a strike face that is intended to blunt
      and disrupt the impact of an incoming projectile and to distribute
      the resulting force, (2) a middle or core region designed to
      absorb energy and attenuate pressure waves, and (3) an inner
      region known as a spall liner to minimize and/or prevent complete
      penetration of the projectile or blast by-products.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present disclosure applies to materials used in armor
      (e.g., armored clothing/fabric, armored vehicles) and methods of
      manufacturing such materials. By employing deposition (e.g.
      electrodeposition) of laminate materials (e.g., nanolaminate
      materials, microlaminate materials), greater strength-to-weight
      ratios can be achieved as compared with conventional armor. In
      addition, the strike face of the disclosed material has excellent
      hardness and toughness, the core region can absorb substantial
      compressive energy and attenuate pressure waves, while the spall
      liner provides reinforcement to prevent ballistic or blast
      by-product penetration as compared to conventional armor. Methods
      described herein (e.g., electrodeposition) provide advantages
      including the ability to produce a multitude of armor geometries
      and the ability to create a cohesive layered material, i.e., a
      well-bonded layered material whose layers/regions work together to
      minimize damage from an impacting projectile.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a
      layered material that minimizes damage caused by an impacting
      projectile. The layered material includes a strike face region
      that blunts and disrupts the impacting projectile and distributes
      the force of impact over a comparatively large area; a core region
      designed to absorb energy from an impacting projectile and
      attenuate blast-induced pressure waves; and a spall liner region
      adapted to prevent penetration by-products of the impacting
      projectile. The strike face can include a compositionally or
      structurally modulated nanolaminate material that modulates
      between hard and tough constituent materials or phases. The core
      region can include a nano- or microlaminate material that
      reinforces a compliant phase material such as, for example, a
      polymer or foam. The spall liner can include a nano- or
      microlaminate reinforced long-range periodic material, such as
      fibrous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In another aspect, embodiments described in the present
      disclosure are directed to composite armor material comprising a
      plurality of layers, wherein the plurality of layers comprises an
      electrodeposited modulated material including a modulation
      wavelength less than about 1000 microns. Such embodiments can
      include one or more of the following features. The composite armor
      material may comprise a porous substrate including an accessible
      interior void structure at least partially filled with the
      electrodeposited modulated material. The composite armor material
      may be compositionally modulated. In some embodiments, the
      composite armor material may be structurally modulated.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure can also
      include one or more of the following features. In some
      embodiments, the composite armor material can have a plurality of
      layers arranged to define a strike face region, a core region, and
      a spall liner region, where the strike face region provides
      toughness and hardness to distribute force of an impacting
      projectile, and the core region provides energy absorption to
      absorb energy from the impacting projectile, and the spall region
      provides strength to inhibit penetration of the armor material.
      The strike face region may comprise a periodic hard-tough
      transitions, wherein the periodic hard-tough transitions may be
      graded. In some embodiments, the strike face region comprises a
      laminated material. In some embodiments, the core region comprises
      a metal phase and a compliant phase, wherein the metal phase may
      comprise a laminated material, and the compliant phase may include
      a porous template, in which void regions of the porous template
      may be filled by a gas or liquid. In some embodiments, the
      compliant phase may include a low density solid, such as a polymer
      or a foam having a density of less than about 5 g/cc. In some
      embodiments, the spall liner region of the composite armor
      material may comprise fibers and a laminated material, wherein the
      fibers may be reinforced with a sheath formed of the laminated
      material, and the fibers may be disposed within a matrix of the
      laminated material. In other embodiments, the boundaries between
      regions of the plurality of layers in the composite armor material
      are graded.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another aspect of this disclosure is to provide a method
      for the manufacture of a composite armor material, wherein one or
      more of the regions within the material is produced through
      electrodeposition. For example, at least one of the strike face
      region, core region, and spall liner region is made using
      electrodeposition of nanolaminate or microlaminate materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another aspect, embodiments described herein are
      directed to methods of producing a composite armor material. The
      methods includes providing an electrolyte containing a metal;
      providing a porous substrate; immersing the porous substrate in
      the electrolyte; passing an electric current through the porous
      substrate so as to deposit the metal onto the porous substrate;
      and changing one or more plating parameters in predetermined
      durations between a first value, which is known to produce a
      material with one property, and a second value, known to produce a
      material with a second property, to form a portion of at least one
      of a strike face region, a core region, and a spall liner region.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Embodiments of the above methods can also include one or
      more of the following features. The plating parameter of the
      method can include one or more of pH set point value of the
      electrolyte bath, electrolyte composition of the bath, applied
      plating current, applied plating voltage, and mass transfer rate.
      The plating parameter can be change, in some embodiments,
      according to one of a square wave, a triangle wave, and a sine
      wave.<br>

      attenuate blast-induced pressure waves; and 3) a spall liner
      designed to prevent complete penetration by products of the impact
      event. One or more additional regions can be added to the
      embodiment of FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Features of the strike face (1) include both superior
      hardness and toughness, which can be achieved by the controlled
      placement of hard and tough constituent materials within the
      strike face volume. Periodic hard-tough transitions can serve to
      arrest crack growth and improve fracture toughness.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring to FIG. 2, the strike face, for example, may
      consist of a thick compositionally or structurally modulated
      material (4) with a modulation wavelength (5) varying between 1
      and 1000 nm. The local hardness within the deposit can be
      controlled through the modulation wavelength, the grain size,
      and/or the composition/phase. Above a certain minimum, typically
      2-20 nm, smaller modulation wavelengths produce stronger, harder
      deposits through Hall-Petch strengthening. Below this wavelength
      cutoff (e.g., less than about 2-20 nm), hardness and strength
      decrease with decreasing wavelength. Wavelength modulations
      therefore can impart modulations in the local hardness of the
      laminate. For example, it is believed that as the wavelength
      decreases from 1000 nm towards ~2-20 nm, hardness and strength
      increases; once below the 2-20 nm range, it is believed that the
      strength and hardness begin to decrease. The same approach holds
      true with structurally modulated materials, such as materials that
      are modulated in grain size or phase. For example, in embodiments
      where the grain size is modulated, hardness peaks at a grain size
      of approximately 2-20 nm. For example, in alloy systems which
      exhibit phase transitions such as fcc?bcc at a given alloy
      composition, a comparatively ductile fcc alloy can be interposed
      between strong and hard bcc material to form the structurally
      (phase) modulated material. The strike face may also contain
      ceramic particles such as boron carbide, silicon carbide, silicon
      nitride, or alumina embedded within the electrodeposited metal
      matrix, which may itself be a compositionally modulated alloy as
      described above. Modulating the concentration of ceramic
      inclusions would provide additional hardness modulation, and would
      additionally function to abrade impacting projectiles (6). Hard
      regions (7) may therefore be characterized by of one or more of
      the following: 1-20 nm grains, 2-20 nm wavelengths, bcc phases,
      and ceramic particle-rich regions, while tough regions (8) include
      one or more of the following &gt;20 nm grains or wavelengths,
      &lt;2 nm grains or wavelengths, regions of low/no ceramic
      inclusions, and fcc phases. In all of the cases described above,
      an additional embodiment may include gradation of the transition
      between hard and tough regions, such that the interface is blurred
      and delamination impaired as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In some embodiments, such as illustrated in FIG. 4, strike
      faces may be produced by electrodepositing a tough metal phase (9)
      through one or more hard ceramic templates (10; i.e., a substrate,
      a porous substrate) including, for example, perforated ceramic
      plates (10a) and/or arrays of ceramic tiles (10b). The metal phase
      may itself be nano- and/or micro-laminated. The ceramic template
      may be modified, either by surface functionalization or
      roughening, to optimize the adhesion between itself and the metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The energy-absorbing material of the core layer (2)
      includes a minor volume fraction (&lt;50%, e.g., 45%, 40%, 35%,
      30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%) metal phase reinforcing and/or
      binding an otherwise soft/compliant phase, which may include
      gases, liquids, or solids such as polymers or low density solids
      (e.g., &lt;5 g/cc). An example of such a core material is a
      reticulated foam reinforced with a metal nano-/microlaminate
      coating (11) as shown in FIGS. 5a, 5b, and 5c. Another embodiment
      may include polymeric or foam templates (porous templates),
      analogous to the ceramic templates described above in FIG. 4 (10a,
      b), which have been infiltrated with nano- or micro-laminated
      metal having the structures described in the paragraphs
      accompanying FIG. 2 above. The common feature of these core
      designs is their substantial compressive energy absorption and
      their impedance to pressure waves induced by blasts. Thus, a core
      region material has a compliant phase (e.g., a foam, or other
      porous material, which can include a compliant solid such as a
      polymer) having a form which absorbs energy (e.g., a foam, a bed
      of beads filled with a liquid or gas.) The core region also
      includes a metal phase that reinforces and or binds (e.g.
      encapsulates bed of beads, nanolaminate coating on exterior of
      foam) the compliant phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The spall liner (3) component of the composite armor design
      comprises a strong reinforcing material with long range
      periodicity such as woven carbon fiber, woven S2 glass, or woven
      Kevlar. A representative block of spall liner material is shown as
      (12) in FIG. 6 below. FIG. 6 illustrates in cross-section a woven
      fibrous composite panel with a polymer matrix (14) for a single
      tow of reinforcing fiber (13). The exterior of this fibrous panel
      has been further reinforced with a nano-/microlaminated metal
      coating (15). In a variant (16) of the previous embodiment shown
      as FIG. 7, the fibers themselves may be reinforced with a thin
      nanolaminated metal sheath (17) prior to polymer infusion. A
      further embodiment replaces the polymer matrix entirely with a
      nanolaminated metal, infused through a non-conductive woven fiber
      material (e.g. S2 glass, Kevlar) or conformally plated onto a
      conductive fiber material (e.g. graphite, metalized S2 glass, or
      metalized Kevlar).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The nano- and/or microlaminated materials included in the
      strike face, core layer, and/or the spall liner can be produced by
      electrodeposition (electroplating) under controlled, time-varying
      conditions. These conditions include one or more of the following:
      applied current, applied voltage, rate of agitation, and
      concentration of one or more of the species within the
      electroplating bath (e.g., a bath including one or more of an
      electrodepositable species such as nickel, iron, copper, cobalt,
      gold, silver, zinc, or platinum). Nano- or microlaminations are
      defined here as spatial modulations, in the growth direction of
      the electrodeposited material, in structure (e.g. grain size,
      crystallographic orientation, phase), composition (e.g. alloy
      composition), or both. Nanolaminates include a modulation
      wavelength that is less than 1 micron—i.e., the modulation
      wavelength is nanoscale. (See International Patent Publication No.
      WO2007021980 for a further description of nanolaminate materials
      and electrodeposition of nanolaminate materials; WO2007021980 is
      herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) Microlaminates
      include a modulation wavelength that is less than 1000 microns.
      Metal nano- or microlaminates can be applied over a variety of
      substrates (e.g., preforms). In some embodiments the substrate
      includes a porous preform such as a honeycomb, fiber cloth or
      batting (woven or nonwoven), a reticulated foam (see FIGS. 5a, 5b,
      5c and 9b and 9c), or a tow of fibers (see FIG. 9a), most of which
      possess little structural integrity in their original form, and
      can therefore be shaped to the desired component geometry prior to
      electrodeposition. In addition, metal nano- or microlaminates can
      be deposited throughout a porous preform formed of an
      unconsolidated material (e.g., a bed of powder or beads) or
      through a porous preform created by perforated ceramic plates or
      tiles. Metal laminates can be deposited into the open, accessible
      interior void structure of a porous preform, as well as on an
      exterior surface of any preform (solid substrate or porous
      preform). Furthermore, plating conditions (i.e. parameters) can be
      controlled to effect both uniform nano- or microlaminate growth
      throughout the preform, as well as preferential growth and
      densification near the external surface of the porous preform.
      That is, deposition of the nano- or microlaminate material can be
      controlled such that the laminate's thickness increases throughout
      the porous preform (or at least a portion of the preform). In this
      fashion, all three layers (1, 2, and 3) of the armor can be
      produced in a single production run without removing the part from
      the plating tank.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods and Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] In some embodiments, nano- and/or microlaminated materials
      included within the strike face, the core layer, and/or the spall
      liner can include compositionally or structurally modulated
      materials. The compositionally modulated or structurally modulated
      materials can be formed through the use of electrodeposition. Some
      exemplary electrodeposition techniques and materials are provided
      within this section entitled “Methods and Materials.” These
      techniques and materials are not meant to be exhaustive, but
      rather are merely illustrative of possible embodiments of the
      technology disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The term “compositionally modulated” describes a material
      in which the chemical composition varies throughout at least one
      spatial coordinate, such as, for example, the material's depth.
      For example, in an electrochemical bath including a
      nickel-containing solution and an iron-containing solution, the
      resulting compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20
      (FIG. 8) includes alloys having a chemical make-up according to
      NixFe1-x, where x is a function of applied current or voltage and
      mass transfer coefficient at the deposition surface. Thus, by
      controlling or modulating at least one of the mass flow of the
      bath solution or the applied current or voltage to electrodes, the
      chemical make-up of a deposited layer can be controlled and varied
      through its depth (i.e., growth direction). As a result, a
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material, as
      illustrated by material 20 shown in FIG. 8, may include several
      different alloys as illustrated by layers 30, 32, 34, 36, and 38.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A “structurally modulated material” is similar to a
      compositionally modulated material, except that in a structurally
      modulated material the structure (e.g., grain size, phase,
      crystallographic orientation, etc.) is modulated rather than the
      composition. The remainder of this section will describe
      compositionally modulated materials. However, the same techniques
      can be used to create structurally modulated materials as well.
      For example, electrodeposition variables such as the flow rate
      which affects the deposition rate can be manipulated to grow the
      deposited material with a finer or larger grain size. Similarly,
      the growth rate and constituents of the deposited material can be
      manipulated to control the phase of the electrodeposited material.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Referring to FIG. 8, layers 32 and 36 represent nickel-rich
      (x&gt;0.5) deposits in a compositionally modulated laminate
      material, whereas layers 30, 34, and 38 represent iron-rich
      (x&lt;0.5) deposits. While layers 32 and 36 are both nickel rich
      deposits, the value for x in each of layers 32 and 36 need not be
      the same. For example, the x value in layer 32 may be 0.7 whereas
      the x value in layer 36 may be 0.6. Likewise, the x values in
      layers 30, 34, and 38 can also vary or remain constant. In
      addition to the composition of the constituents (e.g., Ni and Fe)
      varying through the depth of the electrodeposited material 20, a
      thickness of each of the layers 30 to 38 varies through the depth
      as well. FIG. 8, while not to scale, illustrates the change or
      modulation in thickness that can be made through the layers 30,
      32, 34, 36, and 38.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a different embodiment of a
      composite material 18 (e.g., a material included in one or more of
      layers 1, 2, or 3 of the armor in FIG. 1). In this embodiment, a
      porous substrate 19 is a consolidated porous body. That is, the
      porous substrate 19 in this embodiment is a unitary piece that
      includes a plurality of voids 25 that define an accessible,
      interior void structure. Examples of consolidated porous bodies
      include, foams, fabrics, meshes, fibrous panels, ceramic plates,
      ceramic titles, and partially sintered compacts. The
      compositionally modulated material 20 (a different embodiment than
      shown in FIG. 8) is electrodeposited throughout the accessible,
      interior void structure to form a coating along the walls of the
      porous substrate 19 defining the voids 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring to FIG. 11, the compositionally modulated
      material 20 disposed within the plurality of voids 25 (as shown in
      FIG. 10) includes multiple alloys illustrated as distinct layers
      31, 33, 35, and 37. As described above, the compositionally
      modulated material 20 is varied in both constituent concentration
      (i.e., to form the different alloy layers making up the material
      20) and in thickness of the layers. In the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 11, nickel-rich layers 33 and 37 further include a
      concentration of particles disposed therein, thereby forming
      particle-reinforced composite layers. As shown in FIG. 11, layers
      33 and 37 need not include the same concentration of particles,
      thereby allowing the compositionally modulated material 20 to be
      further tailored to provide optimal material properties. While not
      wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
      increasing the concentration of the particles in a layer increases
      the hardness of that particular layer. The concentration of
      particles per layer can be controlled through modulating the flow
      rate of the bath during electrodeposition. The particles can have
      any shape, such as spherical particles, pyramidal particles,
      rectangular particles, or irregularly shaped particles. In
      addition, the particles can be of any length scale, such as for
      example, millimeter sized (e.g., 1 to 5 millimeter), micron-sized
      (e.g., 100 microns to 0.1 microns), nanometer sized (e.g., 100 nm
      to 1 nm). In some embodiments, 85% or more (e.g., 87%, 89%, 90%,
      93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) of the nanosized particles
      have an average grain size within a range of 10 nm to 100 nm. In
      certain embodiments, 85% or more of the nanosized particles have
      an average grain size within a range of 20 nm to 50 nm, 30 nm to
      50 nm, 10 nm to 30 nm, or 1 to 10 nm. Examples of some suitable
      particles include carbide particles, alumina particles, glass
      particles, polymer particles, silicon carbide fibers, and clay
      platelets.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] To form or deposit the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20, the porous substrate 19 can be
      submerged into an electrochemical cell. Referring to FIG. 12, an
      electrodeposition cell 50, in one embodiment, includes a bath 55
      of two or more of metal salts, a cathode (i.e., working electrode)
      60, an anode (i.e., a counter electrode) 65, and a power supply
      (e.g. a potentiostat) 70, which electrically connects and controls
      the applied current between the working and counter electrodes, 60
      and 65, respectively. The cell 50 can also include a reference
      electrode 75 to control the potential of the substrate relative to
      a fixed, known reference potential. In general, when an electrical
      current is passed through the cell 50, an oxidation/reduction
      reaction involving the metal ions in the bath 55 occurs and the
      resulting product is deposited on the working electrode 60. As
      shown in FIG. 12, the porous substrate 19 is positioned in contact
      with the working electrode 60. For example, in certain
      embodiments, the porous substrate is formed of a conductive
      material and functions as an extension of the working electrode
      60. As a result, the resulting product of the oxidation/reduction
      reaction deposits within the accessible interior void structure.
      In other embodiments, the porous substrate 19 is formed of a
      nonconductive material and thus, electrodeposition occurs at a
      junction between the working electrode 60 and the porous substrate
      19.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In general, one of the advantages of the methods and
      resulting composite materials described in this disclosure is a
      wide range of choices of materials available for deposition into
      the interior void structure 25 of the porous preform 19 or on the
      exterior of a porous or solid preform. For example, salts of any
      transition metal can be used to form the bath 55. Specifically,
      some preferred materials include salts of the following metals:
      nickel, iron, copper, cobalt, gold, silver, zinc, and platinum. In
      addition to the wide range of materials available,
      electrodeposition techniques have an additional advantage of
      easily modifiable processing conditions. For example, a ratio of
      the metal salts and other electrodepositable components, such as,
      for example, alumina particles, can be controlled by their
      concentration within the bath. Thus, it is possible to provide a
      bath that has a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 10:1 or 20:1 by
      increasing or decreasing the concentration of a Fe salt within the
      bath in comparison to the Ni salt prior to deposition. Such ratios
      can thus be achieved for any of the electrodepositable components.
      Where more than two electrodepositable components are provided,
      such ratios can be achieved as between any two of the components
      such that the overall ratios for all components will be that which
      is desired. For example, a bath with Ni, Fe and Cu salts could
      yield ratios of Ni:Fe of 1:2 and a Ni:Cu of 1:3, making the
      overall ratio of Ni:Fe:Cu 1:2:3. In addition, a bath with Ni salt
      and alumina particles could yield a ratio of Ni:Al2O3 of 2:1, 2:1,
      1:2, 3:1 or 1:3 by increasing or decreasing the concentration of
      particles within the bath.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIGS. 13A, 13B, and 13C illustrate applied conditions to an
      electrochemical cell, such as that illustrated as 50 in FIG. 12,
      for depositing the compositionally modulated material 20. FIG. 13D
      illustrates a resulting composition map for the applied conditions
      shown in FIGS. 13A, 13B, and 13C. FIG. 13C shows the current
      density over a period of 130 seconds applied to a working
      electrode (e.g., working electrode 60 in FIG. 12). The applied
      current drives the oxidation/reduction reaction at the electrode
      to deposit a material product having the form AxB1-x, where A is a
      first bath constituent and B is a second bath constituent. While
      FIG. 13C illustrates a current density range of between -20 to
      -100 mA/cm&lt;2&gt;, other current density ranges are also
      possible for example, a current density range of between about -5
      to -20 mA/cm&lt;2 &gt;may be advantageous in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Another way of tailoring the modulation of the compositions
      of the deposited alloys (AxB1-x, where x varies) is with respect
      to a composition cycle. Referring to FIG. 13D, a composition cycle
      80 defines the deposition of a pair of layers. The first layer of
      the composition cycles is A-rich and the second layer is B-rich.
      Each composition cycle has a wavelength. A value assigned to the
      wavelength is equal to the thickness of the two layers forming the
      composition cycle 80. That is, the wavelength has a value that is
      equal to two times the thickness of one of the two layers forming
      the composition cycle (e.g., ?=10 nm, when thickness of Ni-rich
      layer within the composition cycle is equal to 5 nm). By including
      one or more composition cycles the deposited material is
      compositionally modulating. In an advantageous embodiment, the
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material includes
      multiple composition cycles (e.g., 5 composition cycles, 10
      composition cycles, 20 composition cycles, 50 composition cycles,
      100 composition cycles, 1,000 composition cycles, 10,000
      composition cycles, 100,000 composition cycles or more).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The applied current density as shown in FIG. 13C is
      determined from an applied variation in frequency of the current
      per time (FIG. 13A) in combination with an applied variation in
      amplitude of the current per time (FIG. 13B). Referring to FIG.
      13A, an applied frequency modulation, shown here as a triangle
      wave, effects the wavelength of the composition cycles. As shown
      by comparing FIGS. 13A and 13D, the wavelength of the composition
      cycles decreases as the frequency increases. While FIG. 13A
      illustrates this effect with an applied triangle wave, any
      waveform (i.e., a value that changes with time) may be applied to
      control or modulate the frequency and thus control or modulate the
      thickness/wavelengths of the deposited material. Examples of other
      waveforms that may be applied to tailor the changing
      thickness/wavelength of each of the deposited layers/composition
      cycles include sine waves, square waves, sawtooth waves, and any
      combination of these waveforms. The composition of the deposit
      (i.e., x value) can also be further modulated by varying the
      amplitude. FIG. 13B illustrates a sine wave modulation of the
      applied amplitude of the current applied to the working electrode.
      By changing the amplitude over time, the value of x varies over
      time such that not all of the Ni-rich layers have the same
      composition (nor do all the Fe-rich layers have the same
      composition). Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, in some embodiments,
      the value of x is modulated within each of the layers, such that
      the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material is graded
      to minimize or mask composition discontinuities. As a result of
      applying one or more of the above deposition conditions, the
      compositionally modulated electrodeposited material can be
      tailored to include layers that provide a wide range of material
      properties and enhancements.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] One such enhancement is an increase in hardness. Without
      wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that
      regions of nanolaminate material (i.e., regions in which all of
      the composition cycles have a wavelength less than about 200 nm
      and preferably less than about 80 nm) exhibit a hardness not
      achievable by the same materials at greater wavelengths. This
      hardness is believed to arise from an increase in the material's
      elastic modulus coefficient, and is known as the “supermodulus
      effect.” In certain embodiments, for example, the composite
      material 20 of FIG. 11, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 is deposited to include one or more
      regions, which provide the composite material 18 with the
      supermodulus effect. That is, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 disposed within the void structure 25
      of the porous substrate 19 or on an exterior surface of a solid or
      porous substrate includes one or more regions in which all of the
      composition cycles include wavelengths less than 200 nm, and
      preferably less than about 80 nm. In one embodiment, the
      wavelengths are less than about 70 nm. In another embodiment, the
      hardness of the composite material 18 is enhanced by including
      varying concentrations of particles (e.g., Al2O3, SiC, Si3N4)
      within an electrodeposited metal. For example, by increasing the
      concentration of Al2O3 particles dispersed within layers of an
      electrodeposited Ni metal, an increase in Vicker's Hardness from
      240 VHN to 440 VHN is achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In some embodiments, the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material can include regions in which the
      composition cycles include wavelengths less than 200 nm (and thus
      which may exhibit the supermodulus effect) and also include
      regions in which some portion (e.g., at least or about: 1%, 2%,
      5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 92% 95%, 97%,
      99% and 100%) of the composition cycles include wavelengths
      greater than 200 nm. The portion(s) of the composition cycles that
      include wavelengths greater than 200 nm could also be represented
      in ranges. For example, the composition cycles of one or more
      regions could include a number of wavelengths greater than 200 nm
      in a range of from 1-2%, 2-5%, 1-5%, 5-7%, 5-10%, 1-10%, 10-20%,
      20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, 90-92%,
      90-95%, 95-97%, 95-99%, 95-100%, 90-100%, 80-100%, etc., with the
      balance of the composition cycles being less than 200 nm in that
      region. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it
      is believed that, as hardness increases, ductility decreases. As a
      result, in order to provide a composite material that is enhanced
      to include regions of increased hardness and regions of increased
      ductility, the compositionally modulated electrodeposited
      material, in some embodiments, can include one or more regions in
      which all of the composition cycles have a wavelength of about 200
      nm or less including wavelengths less than 1 nanometer, one or
      more regions in which all of the composition cycles have a
      wavelength greater than 200 nm, and/or one or more regions in
      which a portion of the composition cycles have a wavelength of
      about 200 nm or less and a portion have a wavelength greater than
      200 nm. Within each of those portions, the wavelengths also can be
      adjusted to be of a desired size or range of sizes. Thus, for
      example, the region(s) having composition cycles of a wavelength
      of about 200 nm or less can themselves have wavelengths that vary
      from region to region or even within a region. Thus, is some
      embodiments, one region may have composition cycles having a
      wavelength of from 80-150 nm and another region in which the
      wavelengths are less than 80 nm. In other embodiments, one region
      could have both composition cycles of from 80-150 nm and less than
      80 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In certain embodiments, the compositionally modulated
      material can be tailored to minimize (e.g., prevent) delamination
      of its layers during use. For example, it is believed that when a
      projectile impacts a conventional laminated material, the
      resulting stress waves may cause delamination or debonding due to
      the presence of discontinuities. However, the compositionally
      modulated electrodeposited materials described herein can include
      a substantially continuous modulation of both its composition
      (i.e., x value) and wavelength such that discontinuities are
      minimized or eliminated, thereby preventing delamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Referring to FIGS. 14A-14C, a different embodiment of a
      compositionally modulated material 20 is shown. In addition to
      compositionally modulating the electrodeposited material 20 to
      form the composite 18, the porous substrate material 19 can also
      be made of a material that is modulated through its depth. For
      example, as shown in FIG. 14A, in one embodiment, the porous
      substrate 19 is formed of particles 22 that gradually increase in
      size from an exterior 100 of the compact to an interior 110 of the
      composite 18. The particles in such embodiments can range from,
      e.g., 5 nm on the exterior 100 to 50 microns in the interior 110,
      5 nm on the exterior 100 to 10 microns in the interior 110, 5 nm
      on the exterior to 1 micron in the interior 110, 10 nm on the
      exterior 100 to 10 microns in the interior 110, or from 10 nm on
      the exterior 100 to 1 micron in the interior. The differently
      sized particles 22 contribute to the material properties of the
      composite 18. For example, smaller particles have a greater
      surface area energy per unit volume than larger particles of the
      same material. As a result, the porous substrate 19 can be
      tailored to provide additional advantageous material properties to
      different regions of the composite 18. Referring to FIGS. 15B and
      15C, the porous substrate 19 can have other particle arrangements
      to provide different material properties to the composite 18. For
      example, in FIG. 15B the particles have a repetitive size
      distribution and in FIG. 15C the particles have a graded
      distribution.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] FIGS. 15A and 15B show an enlarged cross-sectional view of
      the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material 20
      disposed between four adjacent particles 22 of a porous substrate
      19. In FIG. 16A, the particles 22 forming the porous substrate 19
      are non-conductive particles (e.g., alumina particles, glass
      particles). As a result of their non-conductivity,
      electrodeposition occurs between two electrodes disposed on either
      end of the porous substrate 19 and the compositionally modulated
      electrodeposited material 20 is deposited in a bottom-up fashion.
      Thus, the compositionally modulated electrodeposited material
      fills the entire void structure 25 between the four particles. In
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 15B, the particles 22 are
      electrically conductive. As a result, electrodeposition can occur
      within the conductive porous material to produce layers that are
      initiated at a particle/void interface 120 and grow inwards to
      fill at least a portion of the interior void structure 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As illustrated in the embodiments of FIG. 16 and FIG. 17,
      in addition to electrodepositing into a porous preform, the
      compositionally modulated material 20 can also be deposited on the
      exterior surfaces 100 of the porous substrate 19 to form a
      nanolaminate or microlaminate coating. For example, after the
      accessible interior void structure 25 is at least partially filled
      in the case of an electrically conductive porous substrate or
      substantially filled in the case of a non-conductive porous
      substrate, an additional or capping layer 150 can be deposited
      onto the substrate to seal off the interior porous structure 25 as
      shown in FIG. 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In certain embodiments, the filling of the accessible
      interior void structure 25 is tailored such that the thickness of
      the compositionally modulating electrodeposited material 20 varies
      throughout the composite 18. For example, FIG. 17 illustrates a
      composite material 18 formed of a porous conductive foam 19 and a
      NixFe1-x compositionally modulated material 20. The thickness of
      the compositionally modulated material 20 continuously increases
      (i.e., thickens) from the interior portion 110 of the porous
      substrate 19 to the exterior 100. To create this thickening, the
      current density during deposition is continuously increased. In
      addition to including the compositionally modulated material 20
      disposed throughout the void structure 25 of the porous substrate
      19, a dense layer of the compositionally modulated material,
      referred to as the capping layer 150 is further applied to the
      exterior 100 of the substrate 19 to close off the accessible pore
      structure 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Methods of forming the composite 18 using electrodeposition
      can include the following steps: (1) forming a bath including at
      least two electrodepositable components, (2) connecting a preform,
      such as, for example the porous perform 19, to the working
      electrode 60, (3) inserting the preform, the working electrode 60,
      and the counter electrode 65 into the bath 55, and (4) applying a
      voltage or current to the working electrode 60 to drive
      electrodeposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In general, in one embodiment, the voltage or current
      applied to the working electrode 60 varies over time so that the
      compositionally modulated material is electrodeposited into the
      voids 25 of the porous preform 19. Thus, in some embodiments, the
      voltage or current is applied to the electrode 60 with a time
      varying frequency that oscillates in accordance with a triangle
      wave. In other embodiments, the voltage or current is applied to
      the electrode with a time varying frequency that oscillates in
      accordance with a sine wave, a square wave, a saw-tooth wave, or
      any other waveform, such as a combination of the foregoing
      waveforms. The voltage or current can be applied for one waveform
      cycle as shown in FIG. 13A, or preferably for two or more cycles
      (e.g., three cycles, five cycles, 10 cycles, 20 cycles). FIG. 13E
      shows the envisioned composition map for a 10 cycle deposit.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In addition to controlling the voltage or current, other
      deposition conditions can also be monitored and varied to tailor
      the compositionally modulating material 20. For example, it is
      believed that the pH of the bath has an effect upon the quality of
      the deposited material. Thus, in some embodiments, the pH of the
      bath is controlled during electrodeposition. For example, prior to
      deposition a pH set point (e.g., a pH of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14) or range (e.g., a pH of 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,
      5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, or 13-14) is
      determined. During electrodeposition, the pH of the bath is
      monitored and if a difference from the set point is determined, pH
      altering chemicals, such as, for example, HCl, H2SO4, sulfamic
      acid, or NaOH, are added to the bath to return the bath to its pH
      set point.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The concentration of the electrodepositable components in
      the bath can also be monitored and controlled. For example,
      concentration sensors can be positioned within the cell 50 to
      monitor the concentrations of the metal salts as well as any
      depositable particles within the bath. During electrodeposition of
      the compositionally modulated material 20, the concentrations of
      the depositable components (e.g., metal salts, particles) can
      become depleted or at least decreased from a predetermined optimal
      level within the bath. As a result, the timeliness of the
      deposition of the compositionally modulated material 20 can be
      effected. Thus, by monitoring and replenishing the concentrations
      of the depositable components electrodeposition can be optimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In certain embodiments, flow rate of the bath can be
      modulated or varied. As described above, both the applied current
      or voltage and the mass flow rate of the depositable components
      effects the x-value of the electrodeposit (e.g., NixFe1-x). Thus,
      in some embodiments, the flow rate of the bath containing the
      depositable components is varied in addition to the applied
      voltage or current to produce the modulation in the value of x. In
      other embodiments, the applied voltage or current remains constant
      and the flow rate is varied to produce the modulation in the value
      of x. The flow rate of the bath can be increased or decreased by
      providing agitation, such as, for example, a
      magnetically-controlled mixer or by adding a pump to the cell 50.
      By agitating the bath or by agitating the preform the mass
      transfer rate of the electrodeposited material is effected in that
      electrodepositable species may be more readily available for
      deposition thereby providing improved deposition conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIGS. 18 and 19 illustrate embodiments of an
      electrochemical cell 50 that includes a pump 200. In general,
      these cells 50 are referred to as flow cells because they force a
      bath solution through a porous substrate. Referring to FIG. 18,
      the flow cell includes a porous working electrode 60, which is
      also the porous electrically-conductive substrate 19, and a porous
      counter electrode 65. The working electrode 60, the counter
      electrode 65 and the reference electrode 75 are in communication
      and are controlled by the potentiostat 70. The bath fluid 55
      including the depositable components is forced through the porous
      working electrode 60 (and thus the porous substrate 19) and the
      counter electrode 65 at a flow rate adjustable at the pump 200.
      Thus, in certain embodiments, the flow rate of the pump 200 can be
      controlled in accordance with a triangle wave, square wave, sine
      wave, a saw tooth wave, or any other waveform, such that the flow
      rate can be modulated to produce the compositionally modulated
      material 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 19 illustrates another embodiment of a flow cell 50
      for use with non-conductive porous substrates 19. In this cell 50,
      the working electrode 60 and the counter electrode 65 are disposed
      within a wall of the cell 50 and the bath fluid 55 is forced
      through the porous non-conductive substrate 19. Electrodeposition
      occurs in a bottom-up fashion, that is, the deposition of material
      20 proceeds from the working electrode 60 to the counter electrode
      65 substantially filling the void structure along the way.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The methods and composite materials described herein can be
      tailored to provide the unusual combination of strength,
      ductility, and low-density. For example, the porous substrate 19
      forming the matrix of the composite material 18 can be formed of a
      light-weight ceramic material or can include a relatively large
      amount (e.g., 40% by volume, 50% by volume, 60% by volume) of
      accessible interior void space 25. The compositionally modulated
      material 20 electrodeposited into the accessible, interior void
      space 25 can be tailored to provide strength at least in part
      through nanolaminate regions and ductility at least in part
      through micron or submicron sized laminated regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In some embodiments, the composite material 18 is deposited
      on a solid preform (e.g., substrate) and/or a porous preform with
      closed porosity instead of a porous substrate with open porosity.
      In these embodiments, the composite material 18 is deposited on
      the exterior surface of the preform.<br>

      <b>[0002] BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Laminated metal, especially nano-laminated metal, because
      of its unique toughness and fatigue resistance and Thermal
      stability, their structure and thermal applications for people
      interested.<br>
      However, for anti-corrosion Reported words, at the nanometer level
      is formed by laminating an anti-corrosion coating of success is
      relatively small.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Plating has been successfully used to laminate the
      nano-coating is deposited on the metal and alloy components, For
      various engineering applications. Plating was known to form a
      dense coating of any conductive substrate of Low-cost method. Has
      proven a viable means of producing nano-plating for laminated
      coating, where individual<br>
      The laminate may be composed of metal, ceramic or organometallic
      composition or other microstructural features of the Change.<br>
      By varying the plating parameters (such as current density, bath
      composition, pH, stirring rate, and / Or temperature) can generate
      multi-laminated material in a single bath.<br>
      Alternatively, the mandrel or group Transfer from one bath to
      another bath, each of said bath to maintain a constant expressed
      different combinations of parameters,<br>
      Can achieve multi-laminated material or coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Organic, ceramic, metal and metal-containing coating
      corrosion resistance of them depends on the Properties,
      microstructure, adhesion, thickness, and they are covered by the
      electrochemical interaction of the matrix With.<br>
      In the case of the sacrificial metal or metal-containing coatings,
      such as zinc in the case of iron-based substrate, and the coating<br>
      Layer of the substrate is less than the negative, and therefore
      the occurrence of preferential oxidation of the coating, thereby
      protecting the substrate.<br>
      Because these coatings provide a sacrificial layer by preferential
      oxidation protection, even if they are scratched or rubbed<br>
      Injury will also continue action.<br>
      Sacrificial coating performance greatly depends on the rate of
      oxidation of the coating and the sacrifice<br>
      The thickness of the sacrifice layer.<br>
      The matrix only at the expense of anti-corrosion coating is
      subsisting at the proper position, and may<br>
      According to the environment and the coating is subjected to a
      coating resulting from the oxidation rate varies.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Alternatively, in the case of a barrier coating, such as
      nickel in the case of iron-based substrate, the coating ratio of
      the<br>
      More electronegative matrix, and therefore the corrosion by
      forming a barrier layer of oxide is generated effect.<br>
      In A<br>
      Type metals, such as Fe, Ni, Cr and Zn, is substantially higher
      electronegativity, inert (non-reactive) higher.<br>
      When the coating is more inert than the matrix, if the coating is

      In this case, the outer coating layer as an etch stop layer.<br>
      In case the outer coating<br>

      primer can be used as the sacrificial medium, by<br>
      This sacrificial protection of the substrate from corrosion.<br>
