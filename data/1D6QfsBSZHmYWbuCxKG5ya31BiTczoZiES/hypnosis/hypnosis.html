      the sand leaking process of the sandglass, the bulb in the
      sandglass is gradually covered by the sand, light emitted by the
      bulb dims gradually, and until all the sand in the sandglass
      accumulates on the weight triggering device, the weight triggering
      device is triggered to turn off the lamp. When the sandglass is
      turned over, a trigger board returns to an original position under
      the action of a spring, a trigger switch returns to an original
      position so that the bulb is turned on, and then the sandglass
      hypnosis lamp can be used normally. The sandglass hypnosis lamp
      has a function of inducing the people to fall asleep quickly.<br>

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The instant invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      the purpose of self-creating and using a custom hypnosis script
      that may be used to induce a hypnotic state in a user. In
      particular this invention relates to the use of a computer program
      for use with a computer, which queries a user and guides such user
      through the steps necessary for the creation of a hypnosis script
      including the imagery to produce hypnotic induction and the
      behavioral suggestions to produce a desired post-hypnotic effect.
      Through the use of a text-to-speech program component, the user is
      able to listen to the completed hypnosis script and thus benefit
      from a custom created hypnosis experience.<br>
      <br>
      [00<b>04] 2. Description of Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] A hypnotic state has been described as an altered state of
      consciousness with an associated heightened level of
      suggestibility. This heightened level of suggestibility has been
      found useful in the field for helping to treat people with a wide
      range of problems or issues relative to weight loss, addiction,
      pain management, time management and many other areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Useful techniques for inducing such an hypnotic state
      generally fall into three categories: drug induced hypnosis,
      concentration induced hypnosis (i.e., the swinging watch) and
      imagery. Of the three categories imagery is believed to be the
      most useful as it produced a useful hypnotic state (with the
      associated heightened level of suggestibility) without the stress
      of concentration (which also produces an unrelaxed state) or the
      side effects of drug induced states. In addition, the imagery
      method can be employed at almost any location without the need for
      unusual equipment or medical oversight.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In light of the benefits of an imagery induced hypnotic
      state, the market place has produced a plethora of imagery based
      techniques of providing the desired hypnotic state. For many
      years, these mass-produced hypnosis products have utilized a
      spoken hypnosis script which includes the working of hypnotic
      induction imagery, as well as the working of hypnotic behavioral
      suggestions. One form of these products offer the user either an
      audio or a video version of a predetermined hypnosis script, but
      are not intended for custom alteration by the user. The user of
      these products must conform to the imagery and suggestion choices
      as presented, even if some or all of it fails to suit the user's
      precise needs and/or preferences.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another product is the virtual reality device which
      provides presentation to at least the visual senses, but making no
      specific mention of the spoken word. Furthermore, it provides that
      special gear must be worn by the user to produce an actual, not
      imagery, visual presentation of the experience. The device and its
      associated accessories do not create or utilize a hypnosis script
      including neither hypnotic induction language meant to stimulate
      the imagination of the user, nor hypnotic behavioral suggestion
      language meant to produce a post-hypnotic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
      provide a method and associated apparatus for inducing a hypnotic
      state in a user.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is another objective of the present invention to provide
      a method and associated apparatus that creates such an hypnotic
      state through the use of a self-created hypnotic script.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It is yet another objective of the present invention to
      provide a method and apparatus wherein said hypnotic script is
      spoken aloud and which script may be customized by the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] These and other objectives of the present invention shall
      become apparent from the following specification, read in
      conjunction with the appended claims and attached drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0013] The apparatus taught by the present invention comprises a
      medium with a computer program imprinted thereon, operable within
      an interactive computer device equipped with means to present to
      the visual and auditory senses and further equipped with means to
      receive user input. The computer program provides the user with a
      method for creating and listening to a custom hypnosis script for
      the purpose of inducing a state of hypnosis and making hypnotic
      behavioral suggestions. The term custom refers to the inclusion of
      user selected preferences for the imagery and behavioral
      suggestions in the hypnosis script.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The method advantageously using this apparatus is comprised
      of operatively interfacing the program medium with the computer
      device; running the program, such that the program through the use
      of pre-determined queries solicits input from the user which input
      is then incorporated into an hypnotic script provided by the
      program; and presenting the hypnotic script to the user.<br>
      <br>

        visual query display typical of the present invention.</b><b><br>
        <br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0019] With reference to the drawings, there is depicted and
      described an apparatus and a method employing such apparatus for
      preparing and presenting a user customized hypnotic script which
      script when present to a user will produce an hypnotic state with
      an elevated level of suggestibility. The heightened level allows
      the user to be receptive to the imagery and behavioral suggestions
      that are made through the hypnotic script.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In order to obtain the advantages of the present invention,
      a typical interactive computer with a key board, mouse or other
      input means is provided which computer is also provided with text
      to speech attributes. Provided within the computer and on any
      typically provided storage media (a hard drive, floppy disc or the
      like) is a computer program which program is designed to query a
      user to provide certain information via the computer input means
      so that a self created, customized hypnotic script may be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The logical flow chart of the program itself is described
      in FIG. 1 which is a flow chart of the steps the program is
      required to perform in accordance with the present invention. As
      can be seen from FIG. 1, the program provides a customizable
      hypnotic script. This script can take any form suitable for the
      task at hand and prepared in accordance with standard hypnotic
      guidelines. A typical script found useful in accordance with the
      present invention is shown in Example 1 below.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As can be seen in Example 1, the script has a series of
      user defined, user entered information identified throughout the
      Example 1 as a "(User Entered Information)". As described in more
      details below the program queries the user to provide imagery
      words to insert into these user defined fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] As can also be seen in Example 1, the script may also
      incorporate certain behavioral suggestions. While these
      suggestions may take any useful form a series of such suggestions
      are provided in Example 2 below. As will also be described in more
      detail below, the inclusion of such behavioral suggestions results
      from a query of the user by the computer program and selection by
      the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3 are computer displays typical of
      those created by the computer program of the present invention;
      FIG. 1 querying the user as to the imagery of the script and FIG.
      2 querying the user as to any behavior suggestions the user may
      wish to incorporate into the hypnotic script.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As can be seen by a review of the hypnotic script, the user
      will choose hypnosis scripting preferences for the wording of
      hypnosis induction imagery, by answering questions about the
      desired imagery regarding the setting, the sights, the sounds, the
      smells, the colors, the season, the temperature, the user's
      physical presence and/or other such descriptive terms as may be
      included in the hypnosis imagery. These preferences are typically
      entered into the program by means of a keyboard, and/or a mouse,
      and/or any other known device which may be used for entering such
      information.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As described above, the program also presents a visual
      display (an example is depicted in FIG. 3), which prompts the
      computer user to enter a selection regarding the behavioral
      suggestion topic the user wishes to address in the hypnosis
      script, such as stop smoking, encourage healing, enjoying life,
      controlling anxiety and/or other such behavior. The topic
      selection is associated with appropriate preprogrammed text which
      is then included in the hypnosis script.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The user may also offer the option of creating a wholly
      original behavioral suggestion. If this option is selected, the
      program presents visual displays, an example is depicted in FIG.
      4, which prompt the user to enter preferences regarding the
      precise wording of hypnosis suggestions. The user's responses are
      entered into the program by means of a keyboard, and/or a mouse,
      and/or any other known device for entering information.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As the user enters any of the imagery or behavioral
      preferences, the program automatically inserts them into
      appropriate points of the hypnosis script text, sufficient to link
      all the user preferences together and form a meaningful, effective
      hypnosis script.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Returning to FIG. 1, after the user has completely
      responded to the queries of the program, the user selects the form
      of audio voice in which the script will be recited, the script is
      then saved in the form of a computer file and converted into a
      sound file which file can then be played and replayed by the user
      over the audio function of the apparatus used in accordance with
      the present invention. It is the playing of the script and the
      user's attention to the playing of the script which produces the
      advantageous hypnotic effect of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The script once played may be stored or saved as typically
      done with current computer technology. The script can then be
      played and replayed by the user as desired. The user may also
      return at any time to the program and create a new script.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As described above, the hypnotic script is played through
      the sound or audio system of a typical computer and takes the form
      of an electrically reproduced soothing "voice" which "voice"
      recites the script to the user. In addition to the voice, the
      script may also include other reproduced sounds such as music,
      sounds of nature and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The computer program used to generate the hypnotic script
      may be operated and interacted with in any manner known in the
      art, including operation on a standard desk top or lap top
      computer or remotely via the Internet with the user interacting
      with said program by contacting a web site and with the user
      customized hypnotic script being "e-mailed" to the user for
      playing. In any such case a typical user interacts with the
      program by responding (typically with a computer keyboard) to
      queries generated by the program with the program consolidating
      these responses into a hypnotic script.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Sample Hypnosis Script</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] At any time, during this hypnosis, you are fully able to
      awaken yourself, and return to your ordinary thinking. Uncross the
      legs, and arms. Tell your hands and face to relax. Let all your
      muscles and bones, relax. Your whole body from your feet to your
      scalp are allowed to relax. Give yourself complete permission, to
      take a break from your ordinary thinking and simply be
      comfortable. Give this to yourself, as a welcome gift.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Now, you become aware of your breathing. You breathe
      normally, and easily. Each time you inhale you breathe in,
      relaxation and comfort. Each time you exhale you breathe out
      tensions, and worries and they dissipate, far away from you. You
      inhale and breathe in relaxation and comfort. You exhale and
      breathe out tensions and worries. Breathe in relaxation. Breathe
      out tension. Breathe in relaxation. Breathe out tension. You feel
      good and comfortable.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In your imagination you can picture yourself, in a
      wonderful place (User Entered Information). This is a place,
      created just for you. A place for you to be, relaxed, and
      comfortable. You feel good as you (User Entered Information) in
      this special place. It is (User Entered Information) and it is
      (User Entered Information) here. It is (User Entered Information).
      It is (User Entered Information). As you look around, you can see
      (User Entered Information), (User Entered Information), and (User
      Entered Information). You see (User Entered Information), (User
      Entered Information), and (User Entered Information). It feels
      (User Entered Information), in this special place. You can smell
      (User Entered Information), here. You hear (User Entered
      Information). You feel so comfortable and good, in this wonderful
      place. You enjoy just being here.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In the distance, a little way from where you are, you
      notice a small cottage. It would take you twenty steps to reach
      the door of the cottage. You know that in this cottage you will
      certainly be able to obtain excellent ideas, that will help you to
      be, who you want to be, and feel what you want to feel.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] You decide that you definitely want to walk the twenty
      steps to the door of the cottage. You begin. Take the first step.
      Take the second step. Take the third step, feeling very good. Take
      the fourth step. Take the fifth step. Take the sixth step, feeling
      very safe. Take the seventh step. Take the eighth step. Take the
      ninth step. Take the tenth step. Take the eleventh step. Take the
      twelfth step. Take the thirteenth step. Take the fourteenth step.
      Take the fifteenth step. Take the sixteenth step. Take the
      seventeenth step. Take the eighteenth step. Take the nineteenth
      step. And take the twentieth step.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] You stand at the door of the cottage. Now open the door.
      Step inside. You find yourself, in a beautiful room. The room, is
      decorated just the way you like. You see all of the colors you
      like and as you look around, you see the beautiful things in this
      room. You feel wonderful, just being here. You feel safe and
      peaceful. This is a place, created just for you, for you to feel
      good, and relaxed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In the corner of the room, you see a comfortable chair. You
      move to the chair. You sit down, finding it extremely comfortable
      and soothing. As you sit there, you begin to think about how you
      can help yourself to become the person you truly wish to be. You
      think about yourself and how much you wish you could change
      certain things about you. You realize that you have tremendous
      power to make the changes you wish for.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] (This part of the script consists of either a
      user-selected, preprogrammed behavioral suggestion or, if
      optionally created by the user, the following dialogue)<br>
      <br>
      [0041] You think about (User Entered Information). You decide,
      with strength and confidence to transform this into (User Entered
      Information). You fully understand, believe, and totally accept
      (User Entered Information). You fully understand, believe, and
      totally accept (User Entered Information).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] You can feel the immense healing power you have unleashed.
      You can see and experience it, helping you to be healthy. You
      allow these powerful and positive ideas to enter the deepest parts
      of your mind and body, filling you with a strength that causes you
      to be who you want to be. The person you have now become and from
      now on, is able to attain the goals you have set forth for
      yourself, with confidence creating for yourself a wonderful life!<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Now rest and enjoy all you have accomplished. You can
      return to this special place whenever you wish to reinforce good
      ideas, to give yourself new ideas, or simply to relax. A good way
      of reinforcing the ideas you need, even when you haven't much
      time, is to say, (User Entered Information) to yourself. This will
      help you without having to go into your deep relaxation.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In a moment, you will hear a count of three, moving
      backward, from three to one. When you reach one, you will awaken,
      feeling refreshed and comfortable. Three, two, one. You are awake.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] We hope you enjoyed your hypnosis.<br>

      shortens my life. I want to enjoy good health and long life. I
      completely reject the poison of smoking. The smoker phase of my
      life is over. A wonderfully, healthy phase has begun. I feel the
      goodness of this decision already. Each moment brings greater and
      greater conviction and resolve to live my life as a non-smoker.
      This feels strong and good to me. I am proud and happy with this
      wonderful decision I have made.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0050] Pain Management:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] I am aware that there is some pain in my body. However, as
      each moment passes I feel more and more comfortable, more and more
      at ease. The pain can now be put in a distant place and I am able
      to control how much attention I wish to pay it. With this power, I
      choose to focus my attention on other, more pleasant things.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0052] Stress Management:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] Life can sometimes become complicated. It is not always
      possible to have all of the answers, all the time. I, therefore,
      feel satisfied that I have only partial answers sometimes. In
      fact, there may be no answer to a difficult question. I know that
      no human being is perfect, including me. Though I am a capable,
      competent person, I fully accept that I cannot expect total
      perfection from myself and I completely forgive myself for being
      less than absolutely perfect. Even in the face of great pressure,
      I know that I am at peace with myself, inside.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0054] Anxiety Control:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0055] I know that sometimes I have felt anxious in the past. I
      have decided that this feeling will become more and more unusual
      in my life. However, if I should feel anxious or fearful, I am
      certain that the unpleasantness will pass quickly and I will be
      fine. I will live through the experience and I will be okay in
      just a few minutes. Knowing this feels good and strong. I feel
      powerful and confident that I will be able to cope, even if the
      situation seems difficult at first. I can and I will cope.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0056] Increasing Self-Esteem:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0057] I can see myself as the person I truly want to be as though
      I were looking into a wonderful mirror. I can see the confident
      expression on my face, the sure way I am standing, the
      self-assured clothing I am wearing and I now direct that energy to
      heal my body. Every part of my body is to be healed, from the
      largest organ to the smallest cell. I will fully cooperate in my
      healing process, moving ever forward to a complete healing and
      total recovery. My body has received the instructions to mend and
      I can feel the process taking place already. I am well on my way
      to a wonderful recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0058] Restful Sleep:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0059] I am able to choose the proper time for me to sleep. When
      that time arrives, I will easily relax, be comfortable and gently
      drift off into a sound sleep. I will sleep well, enjoying a
      revitalizing, restful sleep. I will awaken at the right moment,
      feeling well-rested and refreshed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0060] Test Performance:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0061] Whenever I am tested, whether I have known a test is coming
      or I am surprised by a test, I will perform at my very best. I
      will call on my total memory and find all of the information and
      understanding required. I will be relaxed, yet alert and
      completely focused my energy on the question at hand, using my
      time wisely and successfully.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0062] Enjoying Life:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0063] Whatever happened to me before, whatever I have done
      before, I know, in my heart that I deserve to be happy and enjoy
      good feelings. I deserve to enjoy my life, appreciating and
      enjoying the simple, everyday things, as well as the special
      occasions. I give myself permission to enjoy the smell and taste
      of food, to enjoy laughing at something funny, to enjoy seeing and
      listening to beauty. I give myself permission to enjoy the people
      I love. I allow myself to smile often and to feel good that I am
      alive. Even if something I don't like happens and I cannot control
      it, I still can accept the bad with the good and be thankful for
      having a variety of emotions. Usually, I will be able to find
      reasons to be happy, because this is what I truly deserve.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0064] Job Performance:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0065] I will bring forward my energy and intelligence to do
      excellent work that I am proud to present. I am relaxed, but alert
      and insightful. No matter what task is given me, I will do my
      utmost to complete it with competence and skill. To do this, I
      draw on my superior talents and skills, working effectively with
      other people whenever necessary and doing the best job I am
      capable of doing. I feel satisfied that I am a capable, competent
      person.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0066] Dealing With Difficult People and Situations:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0067] I understand and accept that life may present people and
      situations that are difficult and distasteful. Though I would
      prefer to deal only with nice people and pleasant situations, this
      is not always possible because I sometimes there are great
      benefits to me as a result of dealing with difficulty. I sometimes
      must put my own long range interests above the unpleasantness in
      order to successfully deal with it. I am actually able to focus on
      what I need from the person or situation and feel good that I am
      moving to making important gains. With this understanding, I feel
      relaxed and good about myself.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0068] Sports Performance:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0069] Whenever I participate in a sporting contest or sporting
      event of my choosing, I will purposefully instruct my body and
      mind to act together to use my strength and concentration for
      performing my very best. I definitely choose to accomplish the
      most perfect performance of which I am capable. I feel powerful
      and confident in my talent and ability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0070] Improving Memory:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0071] I possess great mental energy. I am able to direct this
      energy as I please. When I choose, I can direct my great mental
      energy to my memory. My memory is precise and complete. When I
      try, I am able to remember experiences I have had and information
      I need in detail. When I study a particular subject or whenever
      else I wish, I will open my mind to capture information and easily
      be able to recall it at will. My memory grows stronger.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0072] Resisting Substance Abuse:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0073] Whenever I need to, I am able to find and use a great power
      to make good, lasting choices. Therefore, if I happen to feel a
      desire to use a particular substance that I want to avoid, I will
      look for, find and use the power to make good choices. I will
      allow the desire to pass harmlessly. I understand that this
      feeling of desiring the substance could happen again, but I also
      know that the good power grows stronger and stronger within me. I
      can certainly make good and lasting choices whenever I have the
      need to do so.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0074] Enhance Attractiveness:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] I feel myself becoming the person I want to be. I am
      comfortable and actually enjoy being around people. When I am with
      other people, my thoughts flow easily and I am able to speak with
      ease, as well, knowing that I am worth at least as much as any
      other person on the planet. My manner is relaxed and self-assured.
      When it is appropriate, I smile with grace and charm, knowing that
      I am attractive. Other people enjoy being with me and I enjoy
      their company, too. I will certainly attract friends and lovers if
      I should desire.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0076] Enhance Assertiveness:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0077] I feel myself becoming the person I want to be. I am a
      capable, intelligent person with a lot of good sense. I am
      confident that my decision-making is strong and that my ideas have
      merit. I weigh my decisions carefully and have the power to change
      my mind, but only when I am thoroughly convinced. I know that my
      opinions are worth at least as much as anyone else's. I am able to
      speak my mind and ask for what I want with strength and clarity. I
      refuse to tolerate other people imposing their ideas on me,
      unless, for my own reasons I choose to go along willingly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0078] Before Surgery:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0079] I know that I will soon go through surgery. I want this to
      be a wonderful success. I, therefore, direct my mind and body to
      completely cooperate with my Doctors and others who will
      participate in this experience. I will follow their instructions
      to the very best of my ability. I have faith in my Doctor's
      expertise and in my eventual, full recovery. I am comfortable and
      absolutely certain that everything will go extremely well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0080] After Surgery:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0081] I fully expect a complete recovery from the surgery I have
      gone through. I will do everything I possibly can to cooperate
      with my Doctors and others who will participate in this
      experience. I direct my mind and body to heal and become strong. I
      can and will focus my tremendous power and energy on accomplishing
      my total recovery. The healing has already begun and I can feel it
      growing even now. I have great hopes for my wonderful future.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0082] Dealing With Loss:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0083] I know that I have gone through a great loss. This has been
      a difficult and trying experience. I have mourned and will
      continue to mourn my loss because I am a feeling human being. I
      also know that I have wonderful things ahead of me and that my
      life still holds great promise. Though I will always cherish my
      memories and feel my loss, I also cherish my life and feel my
      hope. I know that I am able to summon my strength from within and
      help myself cope with my day to day living. As time goes on I will
      feel more and more my confident, true self. I have many good
      things ahead of me. My memories bring me love and wisdom.<br>
      <br>
      [<b>0084] Controlling Shopping:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0085] I now decide that shopping is an important activity to be
      treated with respect. Great care must be used in making decisions
      about what to purchase and when to purchase. Shopping is a
      necessary part of my life and though I may certainly enjoy the
      experience of shopping, I will purchase only those items that I
      truly need and use. I feel good about this decision and I am able
      to shop with a new strength and a sense of purpose. When I
      actually buy something it will be out of needing to use that item.
      This is my purpose in shopping.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0086] Credit Card Wisdom:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0087] I possess the power and the discipline to limit my
      purchases to those I can afford. I will only buy as much as I can
      pay for, in full, at that very moment. In this way I am more than
      able to control my spending. I will rely upon my intelligence and
      wisdom to make purchasing decisions and I will reject the use of
      credit cards in making my decisions. Only in the most extreme
      emergencies will I use a credit card, never on something less
      important. I feel strong and happy about this, knowing that by
      relying on my real resources instead of credit cards, I will
      actually have much, much more in the long run. I feel as though a
      great weight has been lifted from me.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0088] Controlling Hyperactive Behavior:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0089] I can picture myself as a clam, relaxed person. I am able
      to gather all of my thoughts together and concentrate on whatever
      I have chosen to do. I am placing all of my attention on just one
      thing at a time. In this way, I am able to understand more of what
      people are saying. I am able to understand more of what I am
      seeing. I am able to understand more of what I read. I can learn
      more. I can do this any time I want. If I should feel myself
      becoming too excited, I only have to say this to myself: calm
      down; pick out the thing I want to do; now put my thinking on that
      one place. This will work and I will enjoy myself much more.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0090] Exercising Regularly:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0091] I have decided that I want to exercise for better health
      and for enjoyment. I will think carefully about what form of
      exercise is best for me, seeking the advice of experts. I will
      look for a safe, useable plan. Then, when I have found a program
      to fit my needs, I will call on my inner strength and power to
      follow that program to the best of my ability. If I become
      discouraged from time to time, I will have the patience and wisdom
      to return to the plan quickly. I feel great, knowing that I am
      able to do this. I enjoy the satisfaction of exercising regularly
      and wisely.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0092] Gambling Control:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0093] In the past, I have gambled. I know this has been an
      incorrect decision. Gambling has hurt me in many ways. Gambling
      has prevented me from living the wonderful life I deserve. Every
      person deserves a happy, productive life and so do I. I have a
      great strength and power within me. I now call upon that inner
      power which I can feel moving throughout my entire body and mind.
      I choose to use this power to reject gambling and over things that
      keep me from my wonderful life. Each time gambling comes forward,
      I will reject it and send it away. Instead of gambling, I occupy
      myself with productive, useful activities. If I momentarily slip
      and want to gamble, I will call on my inner power immediately,
      wherever I may be. This will bring me back to doing good and
      useful things. In this way I truly win. I feel good. I feel myself
      a winner when I reject gambling.<br>

      an airplane. I have decided to relax and enjoy the experience. I
      am able and willing to place my trust in the pilot and crew,
      knowing that they are well-trained professionals who will do their
      jobs with skill and intelligence. Each one of them wants me to
      have a safe, good flight. When I feel and hear the engines of the
      plane, I understand the tremendous power they possess and I know
      this power is to be used for my safe flight. I can picture myself
      seated, secure and happy in the plane. I am confident that I will
      enjoy a wonderful flying experience.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0096] Body Image, Body Shaping:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0097] I am a wonderful, capable person with many gifts and good
      qualities. Whatever my body looks like is secondary to my sense of
      well-being. I can see myself in the mirror and be happy no matter
      what I see there. However, if I wish, I can change certain things
      about my appearance. I do possess a great inner power and strength
      which I may use to direct my body to change in shape and
      appearance. If I wish, I can direct my body to grow in certain
      parts and even decrease in other parts. As I look at myself in the
      mirror, I can see the parts I want to increase in size. I focus my
      inner power on these parts and I can see them taking the shape and
      size I want. I direct my body to move toward this increase in
      size, day by day, until I am satisfied. I am also able to see
      another part or parts of my body which I wish to decrease in size.
      I focus my inner power on this and I can see them taking the shape
      and size I want. I direct my body to move toward this decrease in
      size day by day, until I am satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0098] Being on Time:</b><b><br>

      [0099] Inside me, I possess an inner clock which knows the time.
      Using this clock, I have the ability to follow a schedule and be
      on time for anything I choose. I can tell myself to wake up at a
      certain time, and I will. I can judge accurately how much time I
      will need to get ready for something and I will be ready. In
      addition to my inner clock, I also have an inner strength which I
      may direct in any way I choose. I decide to direct my inner
      strength to cause me to do what is safely necessary to be on time.
      Having this power feels good to me. I am confident that I will be
      successfully on time from now on.<br>

      Maybe it has actually caused me some physical injury. Maybe it has
      actually caused me some emotional injury. Maybe both. Whatever my
      experience has been, it is now time for me to heal myself both
      emotionally and physically. Exactly why I have been chosen for
      this experience is something no human being can accurately answer.
      It may be that I will never know the precise answer. Understanding
      that there is no answer to some questions is my only answer. I
      need to focus my attention and my strength on healing, in order to
      live the happiest, most rewarding life I can. I possess a
      wonderful inner strength which I will use to do this. I can direct

      <b>[0102] Obsessive/Compulsive Control:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0103] I sometimes find myself able to think about only one thing.
      In the past, I have felt that I have no control over this. I may
      even play out certain rituals in order to try to have some control
      over this thing I am thinking about. I know that it has kept me
      from doing and thinking about other, more productive things. It
      has decreased some of the quality of my life. I am not as happy a
      person as I could be. I, therefore, now decide to change the way I
      think about this thing. I understand that whatever has happened in
      the past, I have an inner power to make my life what I now want it
      to be. Whatever the result, I am a strong and capable person and I
      will successfully deal with the thing. Playing out rituals only
      hurts my chances at really dealing with my life, so I have decided
      to completely reject them. Instead, I will concentrate my powers
      on those things which a human being is truly able to accomplish. I
      can't control the whole world, but I can successfully deal with
      the worst and best that life has to offer. <br>

      </div>
      <br>
      The disclosure relates to devices for inducing self hypnosis, as
      well as for teaching emotionally disturbed children. It utilizes
      momentary serial reflections of a user from a mirror with
      interspersed exposure to opaque colored areas, or combination of
      words, pictures, letters, numbers, etc. The repetity of exposure
      is variable under control of the user, and above certain cyclic
      rates, the impression upon the user is totally subliminal, and at
      the slowest speeds, completely hypnotic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to the field of psychology,
      educational psychology holistic healing, and religion. More
      specifically, it relates to devices used for meditation,
      self-hypnosis, teach and tension alleviation.<br>
      <br>
      Devices for creating visual stimulation of a user are known in the
      art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,279,088; and 3,278,676.
      More complex devices are exemplified by U.S. Pat. No 3,773,049.
      The bulk of these devices are electrically or electronically
      operated and are relatively complex and expensive to manufacture.
      This limits widespread use among the purchasing public.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Briefly stated, the invention contemplates the provision of a
      mechanically operated device which is relatively inexpensive to
      manufacture and simple to use while yet being capable of producing
      visual effects which are better suited to obtain such objectives
      as self-hypnosis, meditation, tension alleviation, and emotional
      relaxation.<br>
      <br>
      To this end, the disclosed embodiments are substantially entirely
      mechanical in construction and operation. In a first embodiment,
      the user seated in front of the device sees himself in a mirror at
      periodic intervals forming a part of an operational cycle. This
      cycle is performed manually at a relatively slow pace, to be
      followed by acceleration of movement of the mirror to a point
      where the person can no longer see his image in the mirror, but is
      affected subliminally by his reflection. The user will see a light
      between two plates, a white plate and a black plate. This light,
      to which the user is subliminally conscious has a tension-release
      on the viewer. The speed may be maintained for a brief period of
      time, lowered or moved through a regulator, after which power is
      removed, and the device comes to rest. The process can be repeated
      as often as is desired. Varieties of color stimuli, words and
      pictures, can be interchanged on the sides of the mirror prism
      according to the desired effect and purpose.<br>
      <br>
      In a second embodiment, the device includes a rotating plate
      having a plurality of segments of different colors, and one
      segment which is a reflective mirror. In front of the rotating
      plate is a fixed plate having an opening which corresponds to the
      shape of the segments on the rotating plate, so that when viewed
      through the opening, only one segment can be seen at a time. In
      this embodiment, the rotation of the plate is at relatively slower
      speeds, so that the effect created is hypnotically visual, rather
      than subliminal, creating the perfect mood for meditation, deep
      relaxation, or self hypnosis.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1-3, inclusive, the first embodiment of the
      invention, generally indicated by reference character 10, is
      supported upon a planar base element 11. A spacing block 12 is
      interconnected thereto by screw means 13 and supports a motor
      bracket 14 in turn supporting a small electric motor 15, which may
      be battery operated, but preferably powered by alternating
      current.<br>
      <br>
      The motor 15 includes an output shaft 16. Speed of rotation is
      governed by an off-on switch 17, and a rheostat 18. An end segment
      31 of the shaft 16 mounts a circular plate element 32 having
      forward surface 33 divided into seven pie-shaped radially oriented
      segments 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40. The segments 34-38 are
      painted or coated in differing colors, while the segment 40 forms
      a mirror surface.<br>
      <br>
      Positioned in front of the plate element 32 is a planar mask
      element 41 having an opening 42 through which the end segment 31
      projects. A lower end 43 thereof is supported by a bracket 44 on
      the plate 11.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the device is initially operated at a slow rotative speed.
      In the disclosed embodiment, the six colors employed are black,
      white, red, blue, green, and light green. These are exposed to
      view through the mask element for serial viewing for the creating
      of differing visual and thought stimulation. Other colors may be
      substituted, and words or other symbols (not shown) may also be
      placed upon the surfaces to enable the user to place these words
      in memory with repeated exposure. The seventh interval enables the
      viewer to briefly see his reflection to enable self revelation, or
      to meditate on a particular thought stimulus substituted for the
      mirror. After a brief period, the speed of rotation is increased
      for a period of time where the impressions received by the viewer
      are more frequent (twenty times per minute), following which the
      rotation should be again slowed to reach a very slow hypnotic
      speed where the user can close his eyes and automatically enter
      meditation on the visual stimulus and thoughts on the disk.<br>
      <br>
      The effect upon the user of the colors and the mirror reflection
      create a peaceful, tranquil and hypnotic atmosphere. Where a
      psychologist assists the user operating the machine, it is
      possible to enhance the process through talking with the user,
      with instructions prepared by the psychologist according to the
      user's needs. As the speed of the machine is slowed, the user at
      the same time slows his own mind activity, thus imparting to the
      user a feeling of peace and tranquility, and the ability to enter
      into deep relaxation by closing his eyes.<br>
      <br>
      Where the segments are provided with symbols, or suggestive words,
      a though process can be implanted in the mind of the user which
      will enable desired behavior in the individual after treatment has
      ceased. For example, the segments may be provided with the words
      "I want to stop smoking", each word being exposed during a
      different interval.<br>
      <br>
      Turning now to the second embodiment of the invention generally
      indicated by reference character 50, (FIGS. 4 and 5) parts
      corresponding to those of the principal embodiment have been
      designated by similar reference characters with the additional
      prefix "1".<br>
      <br>
      In the second embodiment, construction is somewhat simplified, and
      a driven shaft 51 mounts a triangular prism 52 having three
      exposed surfaces which are serially presented to the viewer. These
      include a white colored surface 53, a black colored surface 54,
      and a reflective mirror surface 55. Because only one surface is
      exposed to view at any given instant, no masking element is
      required, and the mirror surface, being one of only three
      surfaces, is exposed at faster cyclic frequency, enabling the user
      to think about himself in greater depth. It is possible to use the
      first and second embodiments in conjunction with each other,
      through which the meditative and hypnotic effect is received by
      the user without requiring him to close his eyes except for an
      instant. The secret of this phenomenon is that the mind itself in
      meditation or deep thought operates on two levels of thought. One
      is the subliminal level of thought frequency, and the slowing of
      thought frequency.<br>

        <b> </b><b>METHOD FOR TREATING BOUNDARY PSYCHIC AND ADDICTIVE
          DISORDERS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: medicine, psychotherapy. <br>
      SUBSTANCE: while analyzing patient's anamnesis and psychological
      peculiarities it is necessary to diagnose individual disadaptating
      cognitive-behavioral style by detecting peculiarities of its
      concepts, tendencies and associations to conduct rational
      psychotherapy. One should form the motivation to alternative
      behavior and hypnotherapy, moreover, to exclude possible
      resistance the procedure of hypnotizing should be suggested for a
      patients as exercises on creativity development. Moreover, at the
      first stage of hypnotherapy, a patient should be put into the
      stage of hypnotic trance due to tasks imitating creative
      self-studying and causing cognitive exhaustion and provoking the
      process of auto-suggestion of hypnotic phenomena. Out of them, the
      phenomena corresponding to the deepest stage of hypnotic trance
      should be induced with suggestion of support disappearance due to
      suggestion to imagine the light flow coming from beneath and
      replacing this support followed by visualization of more distanced
      images. At the second stage, one should perform hypnosuggestion of
      adaptive cognitive-behavioral style, for deepened curative impact
      it is useful to imitate the contact with patient's subconscious
      "ego" part by applying contact technique with touching patient's
      head with a hand and, due to earlier obtained diagnostic
      information. One should speak on behalf of subconsciousness on
      complete understanding the causes of present problems, agreement
      to refuse from disadaptating concepts and tendencies. Then one
      should finally fix adaptive cognitive-behavioral style by
      suggesting the patient to accept it completely. At the third stage
      one should perform dehypnotizing and fix curative information with
      patient's subconsciousness by causing amnesia of a seance. Therapy
      course includes 7-10 individual seances at duration of 1-2 h
      followed by dynamic survey. If necessary, one should fix the
      effect obtained due to maintenance seances. The method enables to
      overcome patient's latent resistance to the process of hypnotic
      induction to teach a patient to apply auto-hypnosis, meditation or
      deep relaxation. <br>
      EFFECT: higher efficiency of therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHOD OF TREATMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of medicine, namely to
      psychotherapy.<br>
      Hypnosis as a way to psychologically structured aid psychogenic
      disorders known since ancient times, but it fits the scientific
      study about the age-old period.<br>
      Modern hypnotherapy has a very small length, covering the last
      20-30 years.<br>
      Despite the fact that hypnotherapy can be one of the most
      effective areas of psychotherapy, by now becoming increasingly
      obvious imperfections and limitations of classical hypnosis, which
      is associated with social and psychological dynamics of human
      personality.<br>
      Arsenal medical hypnotic effect is insufficient and requires
      further development and expansion.<br>
      Known classical way of hypnotherapy.<br>
      It is based on direct peremptory, univariate, policy suggestion
      signs of hypnotic trance, direct and unambiguous orders to the
      patient a state of complete submission to a hypnotherapist and the
      phenomena of relaxation, feeling of heaviness, warmth, lightness
      in the body, feelings of detachment from the outside,
      insensitivity to external interference, increasing sleepiness,
      fixing at the doctor's voice.<br>
      In some cases, while in the somnambulistic stage inspire
      non-pathological hallucinations.<br>
      In addition, the impact of use, in isolation or combined tiring
      visual, auditory and tactile analyzers.<br>
      Treatment suggestion aimed at removing the symptoms of the disease
      are also prikazatelny character and uniquely determine the
      appropriate behavior of the patient in certain situations (VM
      Bekhterev, "Hypnosis.Suggestion. Telepathy ", M.," Thought ",
      1994, p. 47-310).<br>
      However, the method has several drawbacks that limit its use:
      mechanistic approach and impact, simplified, one-sided
      understanding of the fundamentals of human behavior.<br>
      Success thus depends entirely on how the hypnotherapist will
      demonstrate the power of his personality and the patient obey him.<br>
      Therapeutic suggestion in the classical method of hypnotherapy
      addressed to the superficial manifestations of the disease are
      symptomatic (pain relief, psevdoparalicha, irritability, sadness,
      anxiety, craving for alcohol, and the like).<br>
      It brings a short-term effect, as it does not affect the
      fundamentals of the disease.<br>
      In addition, treatment by this method requires a high
      Suggestibility hypnotizability patient and which are rare.<br>
      Today's patients are actively resisting this type of treatment to
      enslave.<br>
      The closest analogue is taken as a way of hypnotherapy M. Erickson
      ("Seminar with Dr. Medicine Milton H. Erickson. - M.," The Class
      ", 1994, s.13-304), which includes extensive use of light hypnotic
      trance states.<br>
      Mesmerizing and therapeutic suggestion in this method are
      addressed to the unconscious part of the personality and the
      veiled or otherwise.<br>
      These hidden encrypted effects are inserted into the message
      (words or phrases that have a thematic focus included in the
      masking text) or stories and metaphors, the plot of which
      corresponds to the model of hypnosis and solve the problem of the
      patient.<br>
      In the method frequently used method of "encouraging resistance"
      and "offer worst-case scenario."<br>
      In the first case, give the appearance of the adoption and
      approval of the undesirable behavior of the patient, using the
      appropriate statement ("it is good that you are not yet feeling of
      relaxation", "is better to keep still," "this is your best
      option," etc. ).<br>
      In the second case inspire necessitating extensive tasks that
      impede resistance, making it unprofitable, prompting a person to
      refuse to negative behavior (eg, recommending to retain and
      strengthen the muscle tension, if the patient resists relaxation).<br>
      In addition, in Ericksonian psychotherapy used hidden suggestion
      in the form of "negative negative command," which uses the
      particle "not" tend to stimulate the desire to do the opposite
      ("do not get too quickly to sink into a trance"), as well as the
      "choice of no choice" ("Do you want to immerse yourself into a
      trance quickly or slowly?") And" sequential decision "(a set of
      statements, with the first of which is obviously the patient
      agrees and the" inertia "will take a statement favorable to
      hypnosis).<br>
      The disadvantages of this method are: a lack of humanity of such
      manipulations, hidden to the human mind, mainly symptomatic
      treatment modality dependence of the effect of suggestibility and
      hypnotizability patients, long-term treatment, and unstable
      therapeutic effect.<br>
      The object of the invention is to provide a highly effective
      method of treatment of borderline mental disorders and addictive,
      has a wider functionality and versatility, allowing to obtain in a
      short time more stable therapeutic effect.<br>
      The essence of the invention is a method for the treatment of
      borderline mental and addictive disorders, include an analysis of
      history, rational psychotherapy and hypnosuggestive impact,
      characterized in that the analysis of the history and identity of
      the patient is diagnosed individual maladaptive
      cognitive-behavioral style, with rational psychotherapy form the
      motivation for alternative behavior, and hypnotherapy to eliminate
      possible resistance procedure hypnosis placing the patient as an
      exercise for the development of creativity needed to solve its
      problems in the first stage of hypnotherapy patient is immersed in
      a hypnotic state by means of tasks that simulate the creative
      self-study, causing cognitive fatigue and provoking a process of
      self-hypnosis hypnotic phenomena,the second stage is carried out
      gipnosuggestiyu adaptive cognitive-behavioral style, to deepen the
      therapeutic effects simulate contact with the unconscious patient
      and, using previously obtained diagnostic information, speak on
      behalf of the full understanding of the causes of problems and I
      agree completely abandon maladaptive concepts and systems, we
      finally fixed alternative style of behavior by suggestion patient
      set its full acceptance, the third stage of the session is
      performed degipnotizatsiyu and cause post-hypnotic amnesia, after
      the positive effect is carried out dynamic monitoring and, if
      necessary, support sessions.<br>
      Use of the invention allows to obtain the following technical
      result.<br>
      The method is highly effective.<br>
      It is successfully used in hypnotherapy to overcome the hidden
      resistance of the patient process of hypnotic induction, to
      accelerate his learning self-hypnosis, meditation and deep
      relaxation.<br>
      The achieved result is stable.<br>
      The onset of the positive effect of a reduction of the symptoms of
      borderline mental disorders and dependence is observed in all
      patients at the first session, after it has been steadily growing
      and is complemented by positive changes in their lives.<br>
      Expression and stability of the therapeutic effect is achieved in
      a short time - for 7-10 sessions lasting 1-2 hours.<br>
      The method has a broad range of indications, including borderline
      mental (neurotic, affective, psychosomatic, personality and
      behavioral) and addictive disorders (the state of food addiction -
      anorexia nervosa and bulimia, substance dependence - alcoholism,
      drug addiction, substance abuse, tabakizm, personalized
      psychological dependence on against individuals), as well as bad
      habits and any other disorders associated with psychogenic
      factors.<br>
      Age testimony - older than 7 years (at an earlier age the use of
      the method has not been studied).<br>
      Another area of use of this method is psychoprophylaxis borderline
      mental and addictive disorders, psychological self-improvement,
      the development of mentally healthy individuals adaptive
      abilities, resistance to stressful influences, inevitable in
      everyone's life.<br>
      Contraindications to the use of this method are acute psychotic
      states and dementia, acute infectious diseases, exacerbation of
      chronic somatic diseases, acute pain states with somatic origin.<br>
      The method is available to practitioners, psychotherapists.<br>
      It is implemented in the form of sessions and homework that
      carries the patient and can be used alone or in combination
      therapy, because of good compatibility with any other short-term
      or prolonged therapy, psycho-correction and pharmacotherapy.<br>
      The method is safe, has no side effects, is economical, does not
      require material costs and can be used in medical and
      psychological facilities of any kind.<br>
      The technical result is achieved by using a fundamentally new to
      hypnotherapy combined and sequential psychotherapeutic effects,
      eliminating the patient's resistance and covering the deep
      cognitive pathogenetic significance of conscious and subconscious
      formation of personality, using the activation techniques and
      simulation of the internal "I" of the patient.<br>
      This effectively in a short time to carry out positive changes, in
      which the fixation of adaptive behaviors and neutralization
      maladaptive pathological stereotypes.<br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      Originally formed the basis for an effective hypnotherapy, the
      main principles of which are to ensure a high hypnotizability by
      the congruence of behavioral manners hypnotherapist and suggestive
      techniques used psychological characteristics of the patient and
      pathogenetic approach in building a therapeutic suggestions.<br>
      The ability to adequately help the patient through hypnosis does
      not depend on the method itself as such, not of techniques and
      psychological characteristics of the relations in the dyad
      hypnotherapist - hypnotic.<br>
      These relationships define an adequate response to therapeutic
      suggestions regarding the depth of hypnotic trance and the actual
      problems of the individual patient, ie, hypnotizability and affect
      the dynamics of the recovery.<br>
      To accomplish this task is carried out to establish a deep
      empathic contact with the patient at the expense of the various
      manifestations of humanistic interest in helping him, similar to
      the conceptual and sensory-specific statements on topical issues
      and problems, demonstrations and simulations similar manners
      nonverbal behavior, the various manifestations of their own
      competence and ability to provide a complete help.<br>
      There is a criticism of the junk, the confrontation and the
      creation of blocks with relatives who are in conflict relationship
      with the patient (this can be done in the future).<br>
      From the results of this phase it depends not only on the success
      of hypnotherapy and psychotherapy in general, but also the
      probability of the fact of continuing medical contact a patient
      with the therapist.<br>
      Further, to ensure the level of pathogenic hypnotherapy analyze
      history and individual psychological characteristics of the
      patient.<br>
      The history sources reveal maladaptive conceptions and attitudes,
      as well as psychological trauma that caused the disease, with a
      focus on the characteristics of their interpretation by the
      patient.<br>
      Psychological diagnostics includes cognitive and analytical
      analysis of the structure of personality and identify abnormal
      maladaptive cognitive-behavioral style specific to the patient.<br>
      For this purpose, adequate clinical and psychological techniques
      in difficult cases - gipnoanaliz.<br>
      The cognitive element of this style is a specific characteristic
      for this patient way of thinking, situational and
      predsituatsionnogo thinking, interpreting, presenting himself the
      actual problems, stressful, and other significant for the
      development of the disease factors, and underlying this
      interpretation of the concept (a system of ideas, opinions,
      relations, the hierarchy of values in life).<br>
      The behavioral element includes stemming from these cognitive
      prerequisites for installation (models, patterns, habitual
      behaviors, psycho-emotional response).<br>
      In a normal person uses an adaptive cognitive-behavioral style
      that helps to overcome stress, borderline mental pathology and the
      phenomenon of dependence arise with maladaptive styles.<br>
      In the process of cognitive diagnostic and analytical work carried
      out identification and registration of self-examination by a
      spontaneous and random thoughts that occur when the patient
      memories, reflections on topics of concern, or when in stressful
      situations.<br>
      For this purpose, he was given instructions to write down their
      thoughts on the problematic issues.<br>
      In addition, the association experiment is carried out, aiming at
      the study of verbal and nonverbal (analog-shaped) patient
      associations connected with words, incentives have a case related
      to the structure of the disease.<br>
      These associations make it possible to clarify the direction of
      thinking of the patient.<br>
      At the end of treatment, a control association experiment to
      verify the results of hypnotherapy - the emergence of positive
      associations in response to a stressful stimulus presentation
      confirms a positive effect.<br>
      Then seek to discover underlying these thoughts and associations
      concepts, among which reveal the concept of the most deep ("deep",
      "nuclear") - less conscious, but at the same time has a
      determining influence on human behavior on which to base the
      concept of surface, dependent from them, they perceived a greater
      extent.<br>
      They are treated in terms of influence on the development of the
      disease, on the one hand, and in terms of the availability of
      resources, capacity of the subject, capable of healing, on the
      other.<br>
      On this basis the rational psychotherapy and suggestive influence,
      explaining, persuading and inspiring concept of the leading role
      of negative cognitive-behavioral patterns, which are an obstacle
      to harmonious life, and encouraging the patient to assimilate new
      positive, adaptive cognitive-behavioral style for successful
      fixation is proposed hypnosis.<br>
      Identify the ratio of patient to hypnotherapy, hypnotic presence
      of negativity is identified following the installation of
      resistance:<br>
      1).Concerns about damage to hypnosis ("do not know what the
      outcome is digging in the brain," "Suddenly I could not wake up,"
      "become a zombie," "suddenly there addiction", etc.).<br>
      Fear over the fact that during the session, "when the mind is shut
      off", will lose control over their behavior and physiological
      functions, and "this will lead to something bad";<br>
      2).Life principles, excluding the effects of the adoption of
      another person ("I do not want to me was another person"), a
      penchant for leadership, a kind of "competition during the
      session" - "who";<br>
      3).The negative attitude to a hypnotherapist;<br>
      4).Consciously or subconsciously desire to remain sick;<br>
      5).Fear of stripping, to relive repressed, emotionally sharp
      impressions, troubled memories.<br>
      In each case it has one or more of these units, they reveal, is
      adjusted or "bypass" with the help of the method of hypnotherapy.<br>
      When the patient's cautious attitude to hypnosis it is called in
      some other way - for example, self-hypnosis, meditation and deep
      relaxation.<br>
      If you have a negative attitude to all these methods is presented
      as their "creative mental exercise", "exercise for the development
      of creativity," "creativity training", etc., try to avoid words
      like trance, suggestion.<br>
      The patient explained that this method "enables creativity that is
      mobilized to overcome the disease and traumatic problems, restores
      the protective resources of the individual, depleted during the
      disease.<br>
      A state of deep relaxation that occurs during sessions, restores
      and enhances psychological capabilities facilitates efficient
      absorption of useful medical and psychological information. "<br>
      Hypnotic suggestion therapist during a session masked instructions
      "awaken creativity" of the patient, which is directed to "the
      study of emerging during a session of sensations and states to
      creative experiments in search of his own style of deep impact on
      myself."<br>
      Develop individual schemes of suggestion with hypnotic trance.<br>
      Suggestibility and hypnotizability not pre-checked because used
      technique allows high sensitivity of medical information to
      patients.<br>
      Hypnotherapy is preceded by a lecture on the state of trance,
      altered consciousness and possibilities of hypnosis and its safety
      and usefulness.<br>
      With continued vigilance terminology used masking.<br>
      The specificity of this lecture is a suggestion to the patient for
      oindividual manifestations of the hypnotic state ("conditions
      conducive to creative stimulation"), "lack of typical symptoms of
      sleep and shutdown of consciousness" during the session.<br>
      The words "activate", "stimulation", "mobilization", etc.
      recommended to be used with care, especially in pre conversation
      or beginning of a session because they are inherently contrary to
      relaxation and hypnosis.<br>
      Then talk about the "leisurely learning", "self-knowledge in a
      state of deep calm," and others.<br>
      Since part hypnoinductive dedicated suggestion somatovegetative
      equivalents trance, it is important in anticipating the lectures
      focus on psychosomatic - somatopsychic relations, noting the high
      efficiency effects on the psychological level through
      somatovegetative channels and vice versa - through mental channels
      to the level somatovegetative (provision of curative effect on the
      state of internal organs and systems using hypnosis).<br>
      At the same time, depending on the level of intellectual
      development and age of the patient describe the essence of
      neurophysiological state of mental relaxation that occurs when
      evoking a feeling of relaxation, heaviness, heat and
      weightlessness.<br>
      This is explained as "the effect of the central and peripheral
      myocardial angiorelaksatsii as a result of deliberate or
      accidental exposure to verbal and psychosensory levels, as the
      impact of words and images."<br>
      To explain the phenomena of hypnosis is used as the position of
      the school of Pavlov phase states, rapport - "sentry point," words
      like "signal of signals", etc.<br>
      The patient is told that "does not need to sleep as you sleep at
      night, and do not need to sleep, it is advisable only to study
      himself, his feelings, opportunities and listen to the doctor's
      recommendation for a more thorough self-study and enhance the
      capacity to govern themselves.<br>
      Everyone feels her during the session: someone there relaxing,
      pleasant feeling of heaviness, warmth or lightness, someone - just
      one of these sensations, while others do not feel anything.<br>
      Intuition, your creativity to customize a desired level of
      immersion, which can be combined with certain feelings.<br>
      Trust in the wisdom of nature.<br>
      No need to try and make an effort.<br>
      The only thing that matters is what you have decided to get rid of
      their illness (their problems). "<br>
      After that, begin the actual hypnotherapy.<br>
      In the first stage of the hypnotic session carried out the
      procedure of immersing in a hypnotic state.<br>
      The patient is given the task ("creative exercises"), which have
      tiring effect on cognition, "Encyclopedic Dictionary",
      "neologism", "Telegraph", "free flow", "Account".<br>
      Depending on the effect of using one or more of them.<br>
      In the "Encyclopedic Dictionary" patient task is to explain the
      fact by accident or as a result of conscious work falling within
      the scope of attention to the words, as if writing small articles
      in the encyclopedia.<br>
      For example, the knowledge of the word tree can be "written
      article": "Tree - big and strong plant, some specimens of which
      grow large - up to twenty meters or more in height and up to
      several meters in diameter.<br>
      Wood is widely used in farming and industry. "<br>
      In "neologism", "pop" in the minds of words into two or more parts
      and re-join to form "abracadabra".<br>
      For example, "synchrotron" is transformed into "tronosinhrofaz."<br>
      "Telegraph" is a simple imitation of the telegraph posts, in which
      each vowel in a word the conscious supplemented with the word
      "point" and each consonant - "dash" or vice versa.<br>
      For example, a "window" is converted to
      "on-to-dot-dash-and-dash-dot-on".<br>
      In the "free flow" speed of thought and without deliberation pass
      quickly from one to another.<br>
      If you use the "Accounts" patient counts from 1000 to 0 to pass
      even or odd numbers, and opened and closed eyes in each account.<br>
      In parallel rise of the phenomena of fatigue the patient to
      inspire: "Your creativity is gradually released from the noise and
      haste, calmly goes into a state in which to store energy, which is
      then, after a session can help you overcome any problems."<br>
      Further, by the therapist used by 1 to 20, which accelerates the
      formation of the stereotype of immersion in the healing state.<br>
      The patient inspire: "Now I'm going to count from 1 to 20 and 20
      to the figure you have there is the state that is most suitable to
      you today to feel better.<br>
      Your intuition will choose what is best for you.<br>
      This can be a good state of concentration or a special clarity of
      consciousness, thought, or a light nap, or almost sleep, but you
      will constantly hear every word, and every word I say will help
      you."<br>
      Then, using "creative style" consistently inspire feelings of
      relaxation, heaviness, heat, light and weightless, distributing
      them to the extent of 1 to 20, slowing down or speeding up the
      account, depending on the observed effects.<br>
      This option can be used generalized suggestion, in which are
      generalizing, compact suggestion hypnotic phenomena or detailed,
      detailed listing of the different stages and degrees.<br>
      The combination of both.<br>
      Words and phrases that are particularly essential to elicit
      relevant phenomena, isolated by pauses and intonation.<br>
      Below is a detailed version with elements of generalization
      suggestions:<br>
      "1 ... 2 ... 3 ....<br>
      Examine their ability to feel the difference between ... ...
      relaxation and tension of the body.<br>
      Learn how ... ... freed from tension, if you find it.<br>
      Try to strengthen the muscle tension, to feel like you are
      comfortable, that is more suitable - tension or relaxation ...
      ....<br>
      If you select the voltage, then hold it as long as possible in the
      muscles of the face, neck, arms, torso, legs ...<br>
      If you are more suited ... ... relaxation, try consistently ...
      relax ... the body from top to bottom ...<br>
      Relax your muscles ... parietal, occipital, temporal areas ....

      Relax the muscles of the neck ... ...<br>
      Study yourself, assess whether you can realize and to deepen ...
      ... relax, get rid of tension in the body ..., released ...<br>

      "4 ... 5 ... 6 ...<br>
      With each number you further and further away ... step back ...
      what you do not need and approach to what is desirable ... ... - a
      pleasant, comfortable state, to ensure that selects your intuition
      ".<br>
      Then inspire relaxation of arms, torso and legs, more or less
      detail focusing on the individual parts of the body, depending on
      the pace of implementation of suggestions, moving from private
      suggestions to generalized describing the presence of a sense of
      relaxation throughout the body, and involving creative "I" patient
      "leisurely seek their own style, their own versions of these
      feelings. "<br>
      Next instilled a feeling of heaviness in the body (heaviness in
      the head is usually unpleasant subjective, so a detailed way not
      inspired), with suggestions from private transfer to generalize:
      "7 ...8... ... Try to feel the weight of his body ... ...<br>
      Your body has a certain weight ... ... you have the senses to feel
      it ...<br>
      Each body part has a certain weight ... ... - and ever, and the
      head and arms, and torso, and legs ...<br>
      Learn that ... harder now ... that would be ... harder ... then

      appropriate expressions depending on the posture of the patient
      and where it is located). ..<br>
      Maybe ..., contact ... hands you realize how more prominent than
      the torso and legs ... and maybe vice versa ...<br>
      The severity ... in the hands can be realized more noticeable than

      Maybe the feeling of heaviness total pleasant ... ... when each

      Noticeable, tangible or otherwise ... ".<br>
      "9... 10...<br>
      With each number you get closer and closer to the state ... which
      is most suitable ...<br>

      After that inspire a feeling of warmth in the body: "Maybe

      "eleven...<br>

      Number 13, as experience shows, it is desirable to "cut off" at
      least the preceding and following it figures, because in a
      hypnotic trance can manifest themselves superstitious notions and
      fears of the patient.<br>
      Then induce a feeling of warmth in the abdomen: "At this point,
      you can feel your inner warmth ... ...<br>
      Heat ... in the human body is higher than the outside ... you can

      "15... 16...<br>

      In the same style continue to talk about the heat in the feet warm
      and generalized throughout the body set up to represent patients
      adequately and comparison.<br>
      After that inspire the feeling of lightness, of weightlessness and
      detachment equivalent deep trance state, parallel to completing
      the score to 20.<br>
      The occurrence of these sensations cause through visualization
      disappearance of the support (the phrase is not pronounced in
      connection with the possibility of a negative interpretation), on
      which the patient - sofas, couches, chairs or other. With
      suggestions representation of the light flux coming from the
      bottom and substitute this support.<br>
      Next, switch the patient's attention to bodily sensations to more
      distanced, remotely, carrying a hidden suggestion ease.<br>
      This mention the corresponding definitions of the desired state,
      and use masking indication "stimulating creativity":<br>
      "At this stage, useful to evaluate its ability to provide visual
      images of light and lightness ... ... and maybe feel a pleasant
      ... easy ... in the body ...<br>
      Try to imagine and feel that from the bottom, rather than on what

      And you can not feel anything ...<br>
      And enjoy it ... peace, this freedom ..., easily ... this light
      peace ... ".<br>
      To deepen the trance can be offered as rendering fog: "At this
      stage, you ... easily ... may feel that there is many at this
      stage, and you can dream about it, how you like wraps, wraps veil
      of mist ... ...<br>

      Maybe you imagine and feel it ... or imagine and feel anything
      else that will help you ... ... even deeper dive into the healing
      state of ... deeper ... ".<br>
      To deepen the confidence of the patient and suggestions
      implementing phenomena of hypnosis avoid using directive
      "hypnotics-hypnotic" terminology instead use vague language
      describing variants of trance like state different from sleep, and
      at the same time hidden increase drowsiness, such " Hypnosis -
      it's not exactly a dream ... ... or not ... sleep ... it ... more
      ... removal of what is not called a dream ... ... and the approach
      to, they say ... sleep ... more ... immersion in the beginning ...
      sleep ... or the depth that the most pleasant and desirable. "<br>
      To inspire "a deep sleep almost" in which the patient will only
      hear the therapist.<br>
      These suggestions effectively complement complex phrases,
      "stimulating creativity" (in fact, it is neutralized
      depotentsializiruyuschimi Activity resistance), such as: "At this
      stage, you can feel anything or feel nothing.<br>
      Examine their ability not to feel anything, and feel that you do
      not feel anything, or feel anything, and feel what you feel. "<br>
      Completing the bill are told: "I called the number 20, which means
      that now you are exactly in the state that is most suitable to you
      now.<br>
      Your creative intuition to choose what is best.<br>
      If need be, this state will become even deeper, or any other, may
      be wavy, but always be what is best for you. "<br>
      Verification of hypnotic trance and diagnose its depth is carried
      out in the event that are guided by suggestion states of deep
      immersion.<br>
      However, according to our observations and the data of other
      authors, the depth of hypnosis does not affect the outcome.<br>
      Modern Hypnosis operates mainly state of light trance, a kind of
      "detachment."<br>
      When properly oriented suggestions from enough to the patient,
      focusing, without foreign interference listened to them.<br>
      At the second stage of transition to the therapeutic phase and
      consistently implement 3 types of treatment suggestions.<br>
      The first type of suggestions contains information about a
      positive, adaptive style of thinking, adequate positive concepts,
      interpretations and associations related to interpersonal
      relationships, life in general and the actual problems of the
      patient, as well as individually significant images that reinforce
      this information.<br>
      They spend lots in the pauses between the depth of trance that
      support.<br>
      "Creativity" at this stage the patient is attracted to digest this
      information (direct or indirect suggestion, verbal and logical and
      imaginative material).<br>
      It is important to avoid over-stimulation of any activity, which
      can reduce the depth of hypnotic trance or ready to inspire the
      patient medical fragments is not required for their perception of
      any activity on his part.<br>
      The second type of suggestion is a "hypnotic basic integration"
      ("Hypnotic" telepathy "), simulating contact with the unconscious
      patient.<br>
      Depending on the mentality of the last "procedure" actually called
      telepathic or session "deep hypnotic diagnostics," "intuitive
      diagnostics," "intuitive diagnostic contact", etc.<br>
      Here, in view of a good knowledge of the pathogenesis of the
      disease, the patient's problems, the characteristics of his
      personality, cognitive style, nuclear concepts, characteristics of
      non-verbal sensory-imaginative thinking "speak" on behalf of the
      deep structures of the person mimic messages from the subconscious
      mind.<br>
      Keeping reached earlier deep hypnotic trance, use the contact
      passes, put his hand on the head of the patient (his pre-warned
      that during the session for a deeper contact will be made touch to
      the different areas of his head) and say that they begin to "read
      "understand or feel what is now thought of his subconscious,
      conscious of what is contained in the back of the patient's mind.<br>
      Location hands after choosing "the best diagnostic zone of contact
      with the subconscious" - sequential touching different parts of
      the patient's head, which resulted in exposure to symbolize the
      deep divisions of the psyche of one hand is placed on the area of
      the neck, just below the hairline.<br>
      It is useful to keep the hand in front of the forehead of the
      patient, without touching it, usually at the same time feel the
      heat emanating from his hands, which (if it is consistent with the
      outlook of the patient) is called, such as "diagnostic bioenergy
      waves."<br>
      After some time trying to find out what the patient feels when, if
      anything - a hand to deepen the contact applied to the forehead,
      and also specify which arise in this feeling - here they are
      inevitable, it remains only to interpret them.<br>
      Keeping the locking arms to attract the attention of the patient
      and the elimination of parallel thinking, using and changing the
      degree of pressure of the palms of the hands or individual
      fingers, micro macromovements or both hands or one hand.<br>
      There are also various options for moving a hand or hands.<br>
      During remarks on behalf of the subconscious change tone so that
      the patient is different from the therapist's words, "the words of
      the subconscious", and intonation are adjusted to the content of
      these statements.<br>
      To enhance simulation "telepathic" effect, use "quotes" a
      repetition of the patient's statements regarding his problems and
      typical for it (preferred) images of the interested psychosensory
      systems.<br>
      Suggestion that simulates contact with the subconscious, activate
      it and change its contents in a positive direction, carried out as
      follows.<br>
      At first, the therapist says, "I (my intuition) hears your
      subconscious ...<br>
      I can feel it ...<br>
      It wants to tell me a sincere message ...<br>
      I can translate it to the language biocurrent energy waves into
      the language of reason and repeat it out loud ...<br>
      Previously, it was afraid to assert itself ... obviously, it did
      not want to lose their positions ...<br>
      But it is tired of his game ... this game does not bring any
      satisfaction, moreover, it brings nothing but trouble, a growing
      number of challenges and joy of life escapes and escapes, life is
      filled with ... (here list the events that really disturbed
      patient For example, "... filled with anxiety, fear, shame,
      pessimism ...") ...<br>
      And how you want to live in a different way - easily and well,
      without worries, without fear, without shame, without pessimism!<br>
      (or other symptoms of the disease) ...<br>
      I understand your subconscious - it wants to inform you that tired
      ... (here according to nosology called manifestations of the
      disease, such as phobias - "tired non-existent horror stories
      scare you, deceive you tired of the fact that they are, although
      there is no there can be no "; alcoholism -" tired deceive you so
      that you can control the drinking and drinking a little bit and
      that will only be good, very good, if you drink, and that nobody
      will ever know ... "; in depression - "... to present everything
      in a black light, you insult the derogatory words, to deprive you
      not only hope for the future, but appetite and sleep ...").<br>
      Next inspire: "Now everything is clear, the old unhealthy thoughts
      and actions were a mistake, stupidity.<br>
      Starting a new life, there is a new birth ...<br>
      Subconscious reported that waives his misconceptions, wrong
      thoughts, wrong, unjustified, criminal desires.<br>
      Instead of the old ideas ... (called maladaptive nuclear concept)
      it takes ... (called the alternative fundamental adaptive
      concept). "<br>
      This can be given individually significant metaphor inspires
      visualization of normal behavior, simulates the adoption of
      positive subconscious cognitive-behavioral models.<br>
      It is important to post-hypnotic suggestion, which determines
      their use in different situations.<br>
      In the event of discrepancies or doubts, which can express the
      patient, conduct "a clarifying conversation", or on the basis of
      clinical logic to convince him that the subconscious mind was
      "deciphered" correctly.<br>
      Knowledge of the mechanisms of the disease in individual patients,
      and preliminary psychotherapeutic work allow successful correction
      of negative attitudes.<br>
      The third type of suggestion, following further therapeutic final
      phase - "Tabula rasa" - "Tabula Rasa" - a clean, blank state of
      mind - a metaphor that contains explicit and implicit suggestion
      of the existence of optimal adaptive concepts, strategies,
      thinking and behavior.<br>
      This involves a deep empathic contact with the patient and his
      full trust, respect for the therapist.<br>
      Keeping the hypnotic state, the patient offer for some time to
      forget all your ideas, opinions and value judgments with respect
      to themselves and others, is completely free from any options
      outlook and fully agree with the statements of the therapist,
      confirming their agreement statement: "I absolutely agree.<br>
      Fully believe you.<br>
      Fully accept that.<br>
      Profoundly disagree ".<br>
      Additionally or alternatively, these statements can be assertive
      nonverbal signals - responses in the form of raising the index
      finger of the right (leading) hand.<br>
      The therapist further compact repeats the contents of the first
      and second options, and suggestions with questions and allegations
      encourages the patient to express his agreement with them.<br>
      In the third stage the session is conducted awakening the patient.<br>
      For this purpose, a countdown of a digit, typically not greater
      than 10 to 1.<br>
      Before 0 expedient except to avoid a "reset" of the results of the
      session.<br>
      Count up stereotype forms immersion in a trance state, the reverse
      - the stereotype of awakening.<br>
      The patient inspire: "Now I'm going to count from 1 to ... and in
      the process of counting you will feel that it is better to feel.<br>
      Realize use intuition to choose what is best - it may be a
      condition of vitality, the desire to move actively, or conversely
      a pleasant state of relaxation, lethargy, or some intermediate
      between these two options the state.<br>
      It occurs immediately after the session or some time after it -
      when it will be most beneficial to you, when your creativity
      decide to create it. "<br>
      Variability final states give to the patient in any case sensed a
      positive result and verify the effectiveness of the therapist.<br>
      The pace picked up an account on the basis of the degree of
      immersion in a trance.<br>
      Final status inspire many times as necessary.<br>
      If there is a need, in order to optimally organize the subsequent
      therapy, the patient's awakening after being questioned about how
      he felt during the session.<br>
      All posts evaluated in terms of its "creative activity" during the
      session, including statements about the absence of any particular
      feelings and effects, in all cases interpret them as positive,
      appropriate, beneficial to recovery.<br>
      These questions, if advance and during the session indoctrinated
      states and sensations, and during the hypnotic induction was
      conducted diagnostics trance phenomena, may not have much value.<br>
      After receiving the required information, or instead of this
      procedure have an impact, contributing to the amnesia.<br>
      Properly constructed psychotherapeutic information "immersed" in
      the subconscious personality is perceived as its own, and its
      regulatory effect on behavior is very productive, since It does
      not cause resistance, perceived as their own motivation own needs.<br>
      In contrast, the realization that something is said by another
      person may in some cases be perceived as coercion and cause
      negativism.<br>
      To exclude the latter directly or indirectly inspire or in any way
      provoke amnesia statements hypnotherapist, correcting the
      patient's behavior.<br>
      At the same time use patterns of forgetting dreams upon awakening
      after natural sleep, the contents of which amneziruetsya at fixing
      attention to anything not related to them.<br>
      In this regard, after the elimination of the trance the patient to
      ask unexpected questions that can absorb his attention, and the
      most chronologically and / or thematically to distance it from the
      "here and now", such as these: "What is the earliest a pleasant
      childhood impression you can remember ? "," What is the best deed
      in my life you made? ".<br>
      It is important to ask questions about the pleasant, not to change
      the positive effect of the session.<br>
      Similarly, there are unexpected expressions, gestures and actions
      after the session.<br>
      In addition, using reception "quotes" - "frame" content session
      similar effects.<br>
      For these purposes discussed above by similar or identical
      expressions, gestures and actions before and after the session.<br>
      After the session is maintained adequate pause and change the
      location - back into the "zone of interview" - a place or room in
      which to conduct a preliminary conversation.<br>
      This is necessary in order to hypnosis place was the only place
      where there is a trance.<br>
      Method cognitive oriented hypnosis performed as individual daily
      sessions or at intervals of 2-3 days.<br>
      When hypnosis children and adolescents may present their parents.<br>
      The length and number of individual sessions, requires an average
      of from 7 to 10 psychotherapeutic meetings lasting for 1-2 hours.<br>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment using standard clinical
      and psychological criteria and test associative experiment.<br>
      Register sustainable positive adaptive concepts, attitudes and
      associations provides a measure of treatment success.<br>
      This is followed by dynamic monitoring and, if necessary,
      correction of deviations from the adaptive cognitive-behavioral
      style, clipping the effect obtained with the help of support
      sessions.<br>

      achieved as a result of self-hypnosis session, the second one has
      self-suggestion formulas in which hypnotic state arrival is bound
      to repeating the mantra-like combination of sounds and relaxation,

      one is given before and after the session, the third one is
      realized in hypnotic state, the fourth one is applied before going

      The method is practiced for the purpose of self-curative and
      preventive.<br>
      However, religious and idealistic basis of the method and the
      relevant objectives reduce its possible scope and a contingent of
      patients, aims to improve or acquire the capacity for psychic
      self-regulation.<br>
      It is known as a method of correction of psycho-emotional and
      psychosomatic state of psychic self-regulation by I.Shultsu (VS
      Lobzin, MM Reshetnikov, Autogenous training, Leningrad,
      "Medicine", 1986, p. 93 - 98, 130 - 133).<br>
      The patient is in a comfortable position, sitting or lying down,
      in a state of muscular relaxation.<br>
      Classes include 3 stages: during the first patient into a state of
      dormancy; while the second - says the formula of self-hypnosis;
      during the third - it comes out of dormancy.<br>
      Formula self-hypnosis pronounced mentally.<br>
      Their goal - to achieve the necessary relaxation reproduction
      sensations.<br>
      Before and after exercise a patient says to himself the words: "I
      am completely calm."<br>
      At the same time using the formulas sequentially relieve muscle
      tension; includes the braking phase (light nap); therapeutic
      exercise self-hypnosis; inspire calm breathing, feeling the heat
      in the solar plexus, coolness in the forehead.<br>
      During method development tasks, set before engaged gradually
      become more complicated by the principle "from simple to complex",
      for example, by causing local sensation of warmth or heaviness to
      the generalized evoking sensations throughout the body.<br>
      Schultz autogenous training is divided into two stages.<br>
      The first stage is intended for physical healing, the second - to
      master the mental processes.<br>
      The most widespread first step.<br>
      However, the known method is very complex, labor-intensive and
      time-consuming to perform.<br>
      So, on the development of first-year first stage takes 3-4 months,
      and the development of a second - about two years.<br>
      This train purposeful representation of color, objects, people,
      samples of abstract concepts.<br>
      As the closest analogue correction method adopted psycho-emotional
      and psychosomatic conditions through self-hypnosis (BM Allman, MT
      Lambrou "Hypnosis", M., "The Class", 1995, p.11 - 49).<br>
      The process includes goal setting hypnosis - getting rid of
      abnormal, or achieve the desired (required) psycho-emotional and /
      or psychosomatic condition; analysis of the anamnesis; rational
      psychotherapy; the selection of the most personalized designs and
      symbols associated with the desired state, the process, a sense,
      an explanation techniques immersion into a hypnotic state,
      including muscle relaxation using verbal self-hypnosis, figurative
      representation and bills that promote relaxation,
      samogipnotizatsii.<br>
      The procedure is performed by making the relaxation stress -
      muscle relaxation, or by successive advances in the limbs and
      trunk muscles feeling relaxed, gravity and heat.<br>
      In the hypnotic state of the patient carries out self-hypnosis,
      using images and symbols that demonstrate the necessary feeling
      state, and pronounces the words therapeutic auto-suggestion.<br>
      After the end of the session the patient goes out of the hypnotic
      state.<br>
      The disadvantage of this method is the absence of certain formulas
      of suggestion.<br>
      Achieving the necessary condition mainly due to the imaginative
      thinking that is sufficiently developed only in some patients.<br>
      In some cases there is deleted the expected effect to choose
      appropriate images.<br>
      Furthermore, the presence of sharp, actual experiences or
      sensations (such as pain) makes it difficult to dive into a
      hypnotic state and conduct therapeutic auto-suggestion on the
      proposed scheme, which is based on figurative representation.<br>
      The known method, therefore, does not allow for enough of deep
      immersion into a hypnotic state required to achieve a stable and
      pronounced therapeutic effect.<br>
      The range of application of the method is limited because with the
      help of the patient is not able to reproduce the desired state in
      real life, for example in a conflict situation, it is impossible
      to imagine any of the images without interrupting the contact with
      others and privacy.<br>
      The object of the invention to provide a method of correction of
      psycho-emotional and psychosomatic conditions, has rich
      functionality and provide a more pronounced and persistent
      psychotherapeutic effect.<br>
      Summary of the invention consists in that in the method of
      correction of psycho-emotional and psychosomatic conditions
      include setting target hypnosis analysis history, a rational
      therapy holding relaxation procedures immersion in the hypnotic
      state of a treatment autosuggestion using techniques pictorial
      representation and subsequent withdrawal thereof after rational
      psychotherapy the patient is informed about the health-restoring
      and harmonizing effect on the body of certain sounds, offering a
      list mantropodobnyh sound combinations having the character
      maloassotsiiruemyh auditory stereotypes of them he selected
      appropriate to his mood and the internal task one sound
      combination which verbally endow hypnotic and suggestive power
      "key to health" .provide information about the similarity of the
      human brain bio-computers and the possibility of targeted phased
      self-programming to achieve the desired state, form the four
      program, the first program includes the formula of self-hypnosis,
      containing assertive about what the desired state is reached as a
      result of a session of self-hypnosis, the second - the formula of
      self-hypnosis in which verbally linked the onset of the hypnotic
      state repeat mantropodobnyh sound combinations and relaxation, the
      third - the formula therapeutic auto-suggestion, the fourth - the
      formula post-hypnotic autosuggestion containing assertive about to
      achieve the desired state, the strengthening and acceleration of
      each session of hypnotic and therapeutic effect and the
      possibility of self-regulation problematic situations,and recite
      the formula of the first program prior to the hypnosis session,
      the second - before the session and in the process of relaxation
      procedures, which is carried out against the background of
      monotonous repetition of the refrain mantropodobnogo selected
      sound combination.<br>
      In the implementation of therapeutic auto-suggestion in a hypnotic
      state recite the formula of the third program in the background
      repetition mantropodobnogo sound combinations, and before leaving
      the hypnotic state recite the formula of self-hypnosis quarter
      program.<br>
      The procedure is carried out on an accelerated relaxation scheme
      using generalizing phrases and achieving a gradual transition from
      the local to the generalized feeling, ensuring they appear
      immediately throughout the body.<br>
      Use of the invention allows to obtain the following technical
      result.<br>
      The method is highly effective.<br>
      It allows you to adjust a variety of psycho-emotional and
      psychosomatic conditions including borderline mental disorders,
      vegetative neurosis and neuroses bodies.<br>
      It can be used to eliminate bad habits, pathological (alcoholism,
      tabagism, drug addiction, overeating) and prevention; to improve
      and restore health, enhance creativity, nervous and mental
      stability under stress, etc.<br>
      Obtained during the development process skills can be applied in
      real life, including in situations of direct exposure to traumatic
      factors imperceptibly without interrupting the core business or
      communication.<br>
      The method is available for most people - both healthy and
      patients with borderline mental disorders.<br>
      It is safe, has no side effects.<br>
      It relieves the patient from the time and cost for the purchase of
      expensive medicines.<br>
      The number is limited only contraindications endogenous diseases.<br>
      The method can be advantageously used in any type of medical
      institutions and at home.<br>
      The technical result is achieved through the integrated use of all
      the mechanisms and factors underlying the method of self-hypnosis,
      and make up the psychological structure of suggestion, as well as
      to create optimal conditions to facilitate the most successful and
      full implementation of the accelerated multilateral
      psihomodeliruyuschego impact on the level of conscious and
      subconscious with participation levels somatovegetativnyh and
      psychosomatic realized in conditions of deep self-concentration,
      dive into a state of self-hypnosis and focused positive
      autoprogramed desired states.<br>
      The use of stereotypes maloassotsiiruemyh auditory (sound
      combinations mantropodobnyh), developed by the author, eliminates
      extraneous thoughts and the patient's resistance, and has&nbsp;
      autosuggestive action.<br>
      In addition, it has a therapeutic effect and strengthens faith in
      the self-healing.<br>
      Mantropodobnye sound combinations, as a kind of symbol, allowing
      quick and stable contact them desired state, ie, form a
      conditioned reflex connection, acquire the role of a trigger
      mechanism that triggers the appearance of the desired
      psychosomatic and / or psycho-emotional state, which eventually
      occurs after several repetitions mantropodobnogo sound
      combinations (auditory stereotype) against self-programming.<br>
      Expression and stable effect is also achieved by phasing the
      positive self-programming with the use of self-hypnosis targeted
      formulas that are supported by the use of creative thinking.<br>
      Using the scheme of accelerated relaxation contributes to the
      rapid emergence of phase states of the central nervous system
      (CNS).<br>
      Preset programs so successfully implemented by achieving deep
      autogipnoticheskogo state.<br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      Pre-installed inside the patient's problem and form of
      self-hypnosis aim - to achieve the desired (required)
      psycho-emotional and / or psychosomatic condition.<br>
      Carry out analysis of history and personal characteristics of the
      patient.<br>
      Establish patterns of development of the disease or the occurrence
      of pathological (unwanted) status.<br>
      Then spend a rational psychotherapy, aimed at achieving the
      desired result.<br>
      Explain to the patient the mechanisms of the disease, the
      emergence of a pathological condition, the role of self-awareness,
      self-control and self-hypnosis in their origin and the process of
      recovery, a way out of the pathological and the desired state.<br>
      They point to the psychological and psychopathological features
      that led to maladjustment and that it is advisable to neutralize.<br>
      On the other hand, consider the personal characteristics that
      require stimulation of development.<br>
      At the same time establish an internal hierarchy (hierarchical
      relationship) symptoms and personality traits, their primal and
      interdependence in order to have the right of self-hypnosis (and
      therefore effective) orientation.<br>
      In addition, achieve such an understanding by the patient of their
      condition and ways out of it, that it unconditionally and
      wholeheartedly accepted the proposed method, including text
      auto-suggestion.<br>
      Then explain the essence of the method itself, and the motivation
      to enhance deliberately instill a high necessity of mastering
      them, its opportunities and greater efficiency.<br>
      Give an explanation of individual differences in sensation
      occurring during the sessions.<br>
      Explain the role of M &amp; E and sedative angiorelaksatsii,
      direct and inverse relationship between emotional and physical
      plans, mental and physical, describe the kind of muscle and other
      bodily organ equivalents psycho-emotional state of man.<br>
      Then inform the patient about the importance of auditory
      perception in the life of a person, especially the effect of
      different sounds on the psycho-emotional and psychosomatic
      condition, illustrate their positive and negative effects that can
      cause joy, ecstasy, tone up, or cause a feeling of rest, sleep,
      sadness or aggression (various types music, nature sounds, and
      others).<br>
      Further informed that in the course of numerous scientific
      experiments and taking into account the centuries-old practice of
      meditation have been allocated certain sounds and sound
      combinations, providing a powerful revitalizing and harmonizing
      effect on the psyche and the human body - the mantra.<br>
      The patient is supplied with a list of specially designed sound
      combinations mantropodobnyh having the character
      maloassotsiiruemyh auditory patterns, with an emphasis on a
      certain sound, for example, and others. Since then selecting
      mantropodobnogo sound combinations corresponding to the patient's
      mood and its internal problem.<br>
      It is reported that his choice is to be a mystery to the other
      (perhaps only except the doctor), giving it the power of hypnotic
      and suggestive, "the key to the recesses of the soul, and health."<br>
      Give instructions for its use: explain that during a session must
      be monotonous, repeating a refrain mantropodobnoe sound
      combination at a pace that seems most appropriate, in silence (to
      myself), or whisper to achieve the desired sensation, desired
      state.<br>
      You can assign a certain number of repetitions - 100, 200 and
      more.<br>
      It is important that repeating auditory stereotype, the patient
      presented in various ways its therapeutic effect, with each
      repetition suggesting the approach currently scheduled desired
      state.<br>
      Then carry out the selection of the most individualized images and
      symbols that show your feelings, states: relaxation, heaviness,
      heat, weightlessness, cool, dipping into a trance state, peace,
      joy, etc .; individually significant selection of images,
      respectively, problems of the patient - the images of sickness,
      pain, spasm, etc. - Those who need to develop, with the images
      produced by imaginative manipulation - removal from the body, the
      color change, the burning of a symbolic link, and the like, or
      vice versa - an approximation, distribution, absorption and
      others.<br>
      These images can come from the patient's personal past or indirect
      experience of others.<br>
      They can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic (bodily) or complex.<br>
      Gradually they have become more and more stereotyped, compact,
      concentrated (standardization images).<br>
      Then explain the technique of dipping into a hypnotic state (a
      state of self-hypnosis), including muscle relaxation using
      mantropodobnyh sound combinations, techniques of figurative
      representation and bills, respiratory rate, promotes relaxation,
      samogipnotizatsii.<br>
      Explain the specific technique of muscle relaxation, causing a
      feeling of heaviness, heat, weightlessness in the limbs and trunk,
      a cool head (VS Lobzin, NM Reshetnikov, Autogenous training,
      Leningrad, "Medicine", 1986, p.103 - 104).<br>
      Then tell patients about the similarity of the human brain
      bio-computer that runs the program, respectively, which man sets
      himself or receives from others.<br>
      In this connection, it is possible to target self-programming
      phase to achieve the desired state.<br>
      Patients are asked to formulate the four successive programs -
      affirmative, positive, without the particle "not" in the text,
      concrete and without contradictions describing the planned state -
      it may be sets of 3 - 5 sentences, for example, in the form of
      formulas of self-hypnosis.<br>
      Positive phased autoprogrammirovanie includes 4 programs.<br>
      The first program consists of auto-suggestion formula containing
      assertive about that desired (necessary) condition
      (psycho-emotional, psychosomatic) will be achieved as a result of
      self-hypnosis session.<br>
      For example: "Today I will begin to engage in self-hypnosis
      (meditation, self-programming, self-hypnosis, etc.) and 30 minutes
      (or through another scheduled time, with or without a particular
      time) by the end of the session I will be absolutely calm (or
      samovnushaetsya any other state)".<br>
      Formula self-hypnosis to recite the first program of self-hypnosis
      session.<br>
      The second program includes a formula of self-hypnosis, which
      verbal bind offensive hypnotic state and the necessary feelings in
      the process of immersion in a repeat mantropodobnogo sound
      combinations and relaxation, such as: "Now I begin to repeat his
      mantra, and gradually I have a state of rest and relaxation, with
      each repetition mantra, with every word I'm going to sink deeper
      and deeper into the healing state - to the extent that is
      necessary to me today, now, here. "<br>
      For the convenience of the patient selected mantropodobnoe sound
      combination called a mantra.<br>
      If mantropodobnoe sound combination is repeated an indefinite
      number of times, can be included in the formula dive planning to
      count a certain number of digits - 10, 20, 30 ..., for example:
      "... I will take it to number 10 right there to me the state."<br>
      Formula second program pronounces the patient before a session of
      self-hypnosis during the procedure and relaxation
      samogipnotizatsy.<br>
      The third program includes therapeutic auto-suggestion formula
      desired state (psychosomatic, psycho-emotional, somatic
      vegetative), for example: "My joy fills me more ...<br>
      "" The sense of fear is completely gone ... ".<br>
      Formula therapeutic auto-suggestion to recite autogipnoticheskom
      condition.<br>
      The fourth program includes post-hypnotic autosuggestion formula
      containing assertive about what the desired state has been reached
      and will be done at the right time and the right place, to
      strengthen and accelerate with every hypnotic session and the
      therapeutic effect and the possibility of self-regulation in
      problem situations.<br>
      Formula quarter recite program before leaving the state of
      self-hypnosis.<br>
      The content of the formulas of self-hypnosis should not be rigid.<br>
      After the formulation of programs, the patient begin a session of
      self-hypnosis.<br>
      The first training sessions (1-3) is carried out under the
      supervision of a physician.<br>
      Before the session, the patient is self-hypnosis sequentially
      pronounces the formula of the first and second programs.<br>
      Relaxation procedures carried out on the first stages of
      development of the method, lying or sitting with closed eyes,
      against a repetition of the patient selected mantropodobnogo sound
      combinations using techniques of figurative representation in the
      form of images and symbols (visual, auditory,
      kinesthetic-corporal, complex) and / or accounts.<br>
      In the process of relaxation procedures and samogipnotizatsii
      recite the formula of the second program.<br>
      Begin with the suggestion feeling relaxed person by direct
      instructions ("relax the muscles of the forehead, eyes, cheeks,
      relax your lips, tongue"), then relax from top to bottom muscles
      of the neck, shoulders, arms, torso, pelvic area, thighs, knees,
      shins and feet.<br>
      At the end of relaxation say: "The whole body is relaxed, soft,
      quiet."<br>
      Then inspire the emergence of the feeling of heaviness - in two
      hands later in the torso, legs ("heavy hand", "heavy body", "heavy
      legs").<br>
      The severity can be called "lead", "irresistible", you can focus
      on the sensation of pressure tyazheleyuschih parts of the body and
      the body to the place of their contact with the chair, the floor,
      and others.<br>
      After that inspire a feeling of heaviness in the whole body: "The
      whole body is heavy, leaden, their weight presses on anything that
      it touches."<br>
      In order to accelerate the implementation of a feeling of
      relaxation and the severity of them associated with the rhythm of
      breathing: "Every exit relaxation (severity) are amplified, the
      body settles, relaxes (heavier), more and more ...<br>
      "Further inspire the emergence of a feeling of warmth in two
      hands, then arms, abdomen, both legs and feet, saying: "Hands
      (hands, feet stomach, legs) warmed ...", "Hands (arms, stomach,
      feet, feet) warm "warm stream, tickling, pulsating, bursting, and
      the like."<br>
      Give analogy rasparivaniem hands (feet) in hot water, warming
      sensation of the extremities after the frost in a warm
      environment, the influence of a warm heating pad on the abdomen.<br>
      At the end of this stage inspire warmth throughout the body: "The
      whole body is warm and warmed by every cell in the body warm,
      heavy, soft ...".<br>
      Then inspire a feeling of weightlessness, lightness: "At this
      stage, the body can be light, airy, floating ...<br>
      Ease may appear once in the whole body or any part of it ...<br>
      The body is light, airy, floating, weightless ...<br>
      Light as a feather as gossamer as a speck of dust, as a cloud,
      clean, white cloud hovering in height, weightless, air ...<br>
      Light, like a balloon, rising higher and higher up in the mountain
      ...<br>
      And now you can not feel anything in the body, as if the body
      dissolved in the fog and alone, dissolved in whole or any part of
      it disappeared into the fog, alone. ..<br>
      Weightless, air, light body ...<br>
      And you can wonder, where are the arms or legs ...<br>
      And you can not feel anything ...<br>
      And enjoy it ... peace, this freedom, ease ...<br>
      Enjoy this release, this purity, this bright, clean quiet ...<br>
      "The procedure is carried out in a further relaxation of the
      accelerated scheme using generalizing phrases and achieving a
      gradual transition from the local to the generalized feeling,
      ensuring they appear immediately throughout the body.<br>
      After immersing the patient in a hypnotic state, he pronounces the
      formula of self-hypnosis third therapeutic program against the
      background of monotonous repetition, refrain mantropodobnogo sound
      combinations using techniques of figurative representation in the
      form of images and symbols that bind to the desired state.<br>
      Then a pause, during which the patient is resting in a state of
      passive concentration, watching images and bodily sensations.<br>
      In the hypnotic state of the patient is the scheduled time.<br>
      Before leaving the hypnotic state of the patient pronounces the
      formula of the fourth program of post-hypnotic suggestion.<br>
      To exit the trance itself inspire the emergence vigor, freshness
      and coolness in the head, the coolness and freshness in the oral
      and nasal cavities, respectively, at the oral and nasal breathing
      and lengthening of inhalation (for V.S.Lobzinu and
      M.M.Reshetnikovu - "Autogenous training "LA," Medicine ", 1986,
      p.118, 176).<br>
      However, if you want to save the state of rest, relaxation and so
      on, toning of auto-suggestion is not carried out, employment in
      this case ends the respective auto-suggestion, including using a
      countdown.<br>
      The duration of the first sessions of 30-40 minutes, frequency -
      2-3 times a week.<br>
      Under the guidance of a doctor spend 1-3 training sessions, during
      which the patient develops a method of psychic self-regulation.<br>
      The patient does not impose formulas, the content of which has a
      hard character, and do not achieve the implementation of the
      intermediate formulas easily if there is a deep sense of
      self-hypnosis more.<br>
      Gradually reduce the time immersion in a trance, moving to
      generalize the formulas and exercises with your eyes open, under
      noisy conditions, while walking, when doing anything in the
      process of communicating with others.<br>
      In the course of development of the method the patient is
      constantly tuned to the application of these skills in real life,
      including in problem situations, the direct effects of stressful
      factors when it develops the ability to carry out self-regulation
      imperceptibly, without interrupting the main activity or
      communication.<br>
      As a result, the patient develops the ability to achieve the
      desired state in a very short time - from several seconds to 1-5
      minutes, but you in the healing state of self-hypnosis, he can be
      any scheduled time.<br>
      Example: Patient A., 32 years old, a physicist, an employee of the
      company kinotorgovoy.<br>
      Diagnosis: obsessive-compulsive disorder (obsessive fear of
      suicide).<br>
      From history: psychopathological heredity is not burdened raise
      unremarkable; by nature inclined to doubt, hesitation, there are
      features alarming suspiciousness, shy with regard to persons of
      the opposite sex (Single), likes the usual order of things, the
      objectives are usually reached, socially and financially adapted
      satisfactorily.<br>
      A year ago, I bought an apartment, after some time has learned
      that the former owner of the apartment killed herself - jumped
      from the balcony.<br>
      Two months ago, the morning after the alcoholic abuzusa, amid
      somatopsychic the effects of alcohol intoxication suddenly in a
      new way to realize the story of buying an apartment, there were
      fears - if he could commit suicide in the same way, I went to the
      balcony - there was a strong sense of fear, palpitations, sweating
      , tremor of limbs, in a panic, and fled quickly got to work.<br>
      The thought of the possibility of suicide began to pursue him, has
      acquired a compulsive character, the condition was exacerbated by
      the evening, when necessary after work to go home, he moved to
      live with relatives, decreased mood became irritable, realized the
      absurdity of his fear and tried to fight it, but to no avail,
      periodically I am thinking that it is better to do away with
      themselves than to suffer so; unsuccessfully treated by
      psychologists.<br>
      The patient was treated in accordance with the inventive method.<br>
      Pre-installed compact and self-hypnosis is the objective - control
      of thoughts and emotional state of mind and a sense of comfort in
      her apartment.<br>
      After reviewing the history, personality characteristics of the
      patient and establishing patterns of development of symptoms was
      carried rational psychotherapy, during which the patient was given
      a full absurdity and groundlessness of his fears were explained
      mechanisms of the disease: the impact of emotionally charged ideas
      between the functional weakening of the central nervous system as
      a result of alcohol intoxication from anxiety and mistrust of the
      subject with the characteristics of inertia and uncertainty.<br>
      It was also noted the role of thinking, self-awareness,
      self-hypnosis as a basis for normal and psychogenic changed
      emotions.<br>
      Features alarming suspiciousness, inertia and related insecurity
      has been decided to adjust, while frustration tolerance and
      ability to control emotions needed stimulation.<br>
      The hierarchical relationship of symptoms and personality traits
      (the concept of which the patient agreed wholeheartedly) was as
      follows: 1. suspiciousness, anxiety, lack of confidence, a sense
      of vulnerability, the global fear of death ---&gt; 2.
      overestimated the value of mental comfort in the hierarchy of life
      values ---&gt; 3. The false identification of self-landlord with
      the former mistress of the apartment ---&gt; 4. strengthening of
      uncertainty in their ability to control their own behavior ---&gt;
      5. thinking about the possibility to commit suicide ---&gt; 6.
      Fear ---&gt; 7. commit deviations, the formation of compulsion
      against the backdrop of inertia ---&gt; return to level 1, the
      formation of "vicious circle".<br>
      Next, the patient was told that between the state of mind and
      state of the body forward and backward linkages - interdependence,
      which allows through myocardial angiorelaksatsiyu and achieve
      psychological and emotional relaxation, and through a variety of
      options for so-called "body sculpting" (purposeful changes facial
      expressions and pantomime) to reach the other psycho-emotional
      equivalents - such as gaining self-confidence through posture and
      facial expressions of confidence, determination.<br>
      Then, the patient was informed about the importance of auditory
      perception in the formation of psycho-emotional and psychosomatic
      conditions.<br>
      For example, a sedative or hypnotic effect can have a monotonous
      sound (the sound of rain, surf, etc.), Corresponding to the music,
      the latter can cause emotions such as joy, ecstasy.<br>
      At the same time, the annoying sounds and music, exciting,
      stimulating aggression.<br>
      It was further stated that the input of numerous scientific
      experiments and taking into account the centuries-old practice of
      meditation to allocate special sounds and sound combinations that
      have strong revitalizing and harmonizing effect on the psyche and
      the human body - the mantra.<br>
      To select the patient was offered a list of specially designed
      contact mantropodobnyh sound combinations having the character of
      auditory maloassotsiiruemyh stereotypes from which he chose to
      gain exposure sugestivnogo recommended to keep it a secret from
      others, because it is the key to the secret recesses of the soul
      and health.<br>
      This "mantra" the patient must repeat during the session
      monotonous refrain, in parallel with other thoughts, the teams and
      the intervals between them - or whisper to himself, figuratively
      representing its curative effect, with each repetition told myself
      approaching the scheduled state.<br>
      Then there were the images and symbols are chosen to demonstrate
      the desired states and feelings: 1. relaxation - the image of a
      transparent cloth thrown over a chair, hanging from it; 2. for the
      feeling of heaviness - a lead weight; 3. for the sensation of heat
      - hot water, a heating pad on the abdomen, bath with warm water,
      hot sand, beach, sun, 4. to feel weightless - white, pure cloud
      hovering in height; 5. dipping into a trance - dive into the
      depths of the sea; 6. to feel coolness - a mountain spring, a cool
      breeze; 7. for confidence - athlete giant, which incorporates a
      patient; 8. For a sense of comfort in the apartment - the image
      itself, relaxed, with a smile, resting lazily and happily smoking
      in the room and on the balcony; 9. awareness for pretentiousness
      frightening thoughts of suicide and desensitization of fear - an
      idea yourself jumping from the balcony down and back up.<br>
      For the fidelity of images was instructed to allocate them in the
      visual, auditory and physical components and gradually standardize
      the presentation.<br>
      Then it explains the technique has been dipping into the state of
      self-hypnosis by causing successive sensations of relaxation,
      heaviness, heat and weightlessness parallel repetition of mantras
      and sedation respiratory rate.<br>
      Next, the patient was informed about the similarity of the human
      brain bio-computer that runs the program, respectively, given by

      After discussion, the text program was started proper procedure

      desired intervals) will feel calm, confident and absolutely
      indifferent to his apartment, with a sarcastic smile, I will
      remember his absurd fear, felt a sense of relief and joy from what

      times.<br>
      The patient then pronounces the text of the second program: before

        <b> </b><b>METHOD OF NEUROLINGUISTIC TREATMENT OF
          PSYCHOFUNCTIONAL DISTURBANCES</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: psychotherapy. SUBSTANCE: treatment session is commenced by
      rational psychotherapy during which symptomatic expression of
      psychofunctional disturbances are revealed. LuscherÄs color test
      is produced and a patient is induced to associate revealed
      symptoms with color and to express it in the form of a figure.
      Patient is then brought into hypnotic state and is aided to recall
      a positive event from his(her) past experience and to associate it
      with color. Figure depicted by patient is 1.3-fold magnified and
      dyed into color associated with comfort state. Straight away, not
      later than 1-3 sec after patient is lead out of hypnosis and
      forgets experienced state, he(she) is shown transformed figure.
      When he(she) is contemplating the figure, he(she) is
      simultaneously being induced by positive emotions experienced in
      hypnotic state, which are marked. Image is shown then to patient
      every day for 10-12 s before going to bed and during frustration
      time. <br>
      EFFECT: enhanced treatment efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to medicine, namely to therapy, and can be
      used in medical, neurological and psihiatricheskhoy practice in
      the treatment of various psychosomatic disorders.<br>
      Borne diseases, mental and physical injuries of varying degrees of
      forming pathological personality reactions experiences disease,
      which, in turn, changes the objective condition of the body and
      makes a subjective symptoms complicating the disease, manifested
      vegetative components of emotional states.<br>
      So actually existing objective symptoms and syndromes reflect not
      only real organic restructuring of the organs and tissues, but
      also the psychological reactions to disease.<br>
      The totality of phenomena of the internal picture of the disease,
      is built into the process of the disease the most important
      component, which changes the overall clinical dynamics.<br>
      Neuro-Linguistic Programming with suggestive influence lets you
      program a positive for the disease, to stabilize the nervous
      system, to get calm emotional background and the hair dryer on it
      more successfully to treat disorders caused morphological,
      functional and psychological levels.<br>
      Using objective methods of investigation proved the feasibility of
      using psycho impact on the body and through the substrate using a
      psychic change the function of the body and the biochemical
      composition of the secretions.<br>
      The writings on hypnosis Zh.Sharko given to the possibility of
      both inducing and stop nasal and even uterine bleeding both
      superficial and deep.<br>
      Under the influence of the phenomenon of verbal suggestion cause
      second-degree burns: the appearance of redness and blisters, that
      belongs to the strongest vazimotorov dysfunction, which may
      include observable "supernatural" phenomena, such as the
      appearance of stigmata under the influence of suggestion from
      fonatichno believers.<br>
      Suggestion reception tasty or tasteless food affects the content
      and quality of gastric juice in the first case and raises the
      total acidity content of hydrochloric acid in the second - the
      total acidity drops to a minimum, and free hydrochloric acid while
      absent.<br>
      Experiments have shown that the nature of bile can be changed
      depending on an imaginary meal: the verbal suggestion fatty meal
      stands thick dark bile, and when the alleged admission of dry,
      devoid of fat food the bile is released and the liquid light.<br>
      Also, the content of pancreatic secretion observed changes
      depending on the composition of food instilled, ie "fatty foods"
      cause the appearance of lipase, "meat" - trypsin and
      "carbohydrate" - distazy (Djachuk NV Psychotechnics.<br>
      Mental technology, PCB, M., 1996, p.106 - 117).<br>
      Currently widespread psycho devoted to the treatment of
      alcoholism, which are designed on the basis of AR Dovzhenko.<br>
      It has been shown to develop a conditioned reflex negative for
      alcohol by the use of different methods of psychotherapy, the
      implementation of the coding and the impact on reflex zones to
      secure the established reflex (RF Patent N 2018325, A 61 M 21/00,
      1994; Russian patent N 2006220, A 61 M 21/00, 1994; Russian patent
      N 2011374, A 61 M 21/00, 1995).<br>
      The closest method (prior art) is a method in which treatment is
      represented psycho psychosomatic disorders.<br>
      The known method involves the use of methods of psychotherapy,
      administering to a patient in a state of hypnotic trance,
      suggestive influence, suggestion of a new model of health.<br>
      In the process of psychotherapy, the method comprises determining
      the color preferences of Luscher color test and impose a
      therapeutic information inspire visual images, verbal colored
      preferences (RF patent, N 2087159, A 61 M 21/00, 1997).<br>
      The known method has a fairly high efficiency, but its main
      drawback is the dependence of the patient by the physician.<br>
      This relationship is reflected in the fact that, while maintaining
      or troublesome symptoms occurs is the necessity to repeat the
      session.<br>
      The developed method allows to increase the efficacy of the
      treatment, which is achieved by constant reinforcement created by
      reflex.<br>
      To do this for a long time created by placing the patient at the
      time the session associative visual image, which is intimately
      linked with the emotional background of the patient, taking into
      account his individual temperament.<br>
      The method consists in identifying the color shaped association
      with symptoms psihofunktsionalnogo disorder taking and color
      features comfort of the patient, establishing an anchor engaging
      color image with a comfortable condition and presentation
      poduchennogo image psychologically significant periods of life.<br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      When an appointment is recommended to the patient to be examined,
      to establish the diagnosis and, if necessary, start or continue
      pathogenetic or symptomatic treatment.<br>
      At the same time the methods of rational psychotherapy convince
      the patient the ability to cure or significantly alleviate the
      suffering.<br>
      To explain the nature of the medical condition, using visual
      material, which allows the patient to report violations occurred
      in the most simplified form.<br>
      Explain in simplified form, the mechanism of action of therapeutic
      agents, and the dynamics of the changes in a single organ or
      system of the body.<br>
      When a patient comes to a session, it is induced to tell in detail
      about the problems and / or illness that forced him to turn to a
      therapist.<br>
      At the same time in the course of confidential conversation doctor
      uses elements of psychoanalysis helps the patient to verbalize
      their feelings and express their symptomatic mental and / or
      functional disorders.<br>
      Rational psychotherapy continue to use psychotherapeutic metaphor
      (David Gordon Therapeutic metaphors, St. Petersburg, the White
      Rabbit, 1995, 196 pp.), Cited examples from life or from
      literature, which shows the association of sensations, emotional
      states with a specific color (for example: folk songs and tales of
      angst associated with black color, but Happiness see in pink,
      etc.).<br>
      After that impose Lusher test (Burlachuk LF, Morozov SM Dictionary
      of psychological diagnostics, Kiev, Naukova Dumka, 1989, pp. 72 -
      73), that is, before the patient laid out colored boxes, the
      minimum number of colors in this method should be at least 8, and
      a complete test contains 36 different colors and shades.<br>
      Patients are asked to find a color that he believed associated
      with the identified symptom.<br>
      Also offer to portray sensations identified as a figure who may
      have a different shape and size, in the form of a geometric figure
      or figures of any irregular shape.<br>
      The patient explained that he had to be guided only by internal
      motives, without logical reasoning.<br>
      Images of a figure and its filling color may be performed on
      paper, but it is more convenient to use for this purpose personal
      computer with a color image.<br>
      Monitor to obtain a color image (or a sheet of paper) is placed in
      an area convenient for observation, eliminate distractions.<br>
      When psychotherapy is still convince the patient that recovery or
      removal of the problem is possible only with the active
      participation and his sincere desire of the patient, as well as
      the strict fulfillment of all the requirements psychotechnologies.<br>
      Additionally, lead therapeutic metaphor similar states and their
      successful correction and psychotherapeutic influence is achieved
      by mobilizing the patient meet their needs on an emotional level
      with the desired outcome.<br>
      Then explain to the patient that used psycho requires translation
      into a state of hypnosis.<br>
      After obtaining the consent of the patient is placed in the most
      comfortable chair, and a method of neurolinguistic programming
      into a state of hypnotic immersion light while maintaining the
      report (I-II degree of Katkov).<br>
      Induces the patient to recall the episode of a comfortable state
      of positive past experience and feel it emotionally.<br>
      This could be an episode of a condition associated with the
      achievement of high results, with a declaration of love or the joy
      of contemplation of nature paintings, etc.<br>
      Offers patients called the color with which it is associated
      pleasant episode comfortable state.<br>
      Once the patient is called color psychotherapeutic conversation
      continued while the patient figure shown on the monitor is
      increased by 1.3 times, and fill color, which he called the
      patient experience at a comfortable state.<br>
      As soon as the transformed figure ready to inspire the patient
      amnesia and removes it from the state of hypnosis.<br>
      As fast as possible, no later than 1 - 3 out of him and impose an
      increased full of new colors in the image their figure.<br>
      Against this background, induce the patient experienced their
      emotions in hypnosis and achieve their set marker comfortable
      state.<br>
      Marking or anchor mesh allows the right moment with a simple
      behavioral responses to cause all the experience as a whole (John
      Grinder, Richard Bandler "Frogs into Princes.<br>
      Neuro-linguistic programming ", NGO" Modek ", Voronezh, 1994, p.98
      - 169).<br>
      These reactions, which are commonly used for marking, may be: a
      smile, a sigh, closing of the eyes, etc.<br>
      In this method, the color and painted in a figure associated with
      the subconscious mind of the patient, as reformed at a
      subconscious level, and on this background labeling of emotions at
      the conscious level, allows you to call and play afterwards as
      unconsciously and consciously painted a positive emotion.<br>
      Upon completion of the session, enlarged and painted in the color
      of the new shape is transferred to the paper or printed with a
      printer.<br>
      Patients are offered daily at bedtime, it is best if it is already
      in bed for 10 - 12 seconds to look at the resulting image, and
      repeat this procedure during periods of frustration.<br>
      To provide feedback and control the dynamics of the patient during
      the session is used as subjective indicators, such as the status
      and skin color, physiognomy, changes in tone, pace, tone and
      volume of voice, liveliness of facial expressions, gestures,
      rhythm, breathing, muscle tension in the or other parts of the
      body, and objective indicators, such as the measurement of
      galvanic skin response or electrical resistance (conductivity) in
      biologically active points of common action.<br>
      The embodiment of the method.<br>
      Patient P., '52<br>
      In conversation revealed that three years ago she underwent
      surgery apendektomii that complicated peritonitis.<br>
      After discharge from the hospital, the patient noted persistent
      abdominal pain, depressed mood, lack of confidence, a feeling of
      anxiety insurmountable obstacles.<br>
      In the process of rational therapy with therapeutic metaphors that
      were told in the first person patient Make sure you can improve.<br>
      Upon presentation of the test Luscher patients is associated with
      their condition brown and portrayed it in the form of two
      intersecting circles of irregular shape.<br>
      In a state of hypnotic immersion as a nice episode of past
      experience the patient remembered state, which she experienced in
      the nursing home when she was first brought, and showed the child.<br>
      This condition is associated with her yellow and pink.<br>
      Psychotherapy continued, but this time, at the same time, the
      patient depicted figures of two irregularly shaped intersecting
      circles have increased by 1.3 times and painted yellow-pink color.<br>
      Once the figure was finished, the patient inspired period hypnotic
      amnesia events transfusion, brought out of hypnosis and
      immediately presented enlarged and painted in yellow-pink figure
      in the form of two intersecting circles of irregular shape.<br>
      All the features of the image figure is a replica of the figure,
      which was displayed at the beginning of a patient session.<br>
      Against the background of the presentation figure induced
      consciously relive emotions comfortable state, tested it in a
      state of hypnosis and transferred into consciousness through
      visualization of color, and the cause the patient smile.<br>
      Then c using the therapeutic metaphors emerged strengthened
      consciously unconsciously relationship between figure, positive
      emotions and a smile comfortable state.<br>
      At the beginning of the session it measured the electrical
      conductivity at a point he-gu, who was right - 28 and on the left
      - 30 a.<br>
      The final stage of the session, right - 60 and on the left - 58 a.<br>
      Objectively revealed improvement of the general condition was also
      used in the final stage of therapy, and the patient was given the
      recommendation of maintaining stability improvement.<br>
      To do this, it must daily at bedtime for 10 - 12 seconds to look
      at the image, and repeat this procedure in the period of
      frustration.<br>
      Over the next six months, the patient noted a significant
      improvement in their condition.<br>
      With the proposed method were treated 5 patients with neurotic and
      neurosis-like disorders.<br>
      When observing them for a year, three of the five patients
      reported that they feel healthy, two patients reported
      improvement.<br>
      Moreover, all patients reported a significant improvement in mood.<br>

        <b> </b><b>METHOD OF VISUAL HYPNOSIS&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      PURPOSE:To provide a method of hypnosis which simultaneously uses
      a suggestive sound guiding a person to hypnosis, and a moving
      picture giving the person such an illusion that the person is
      pulled into the picture when seeing it. CONSTITUTION:In the modern
      society, it is a commonly sense that to get rid of stress, a
      person must hear a soft music to relax, and change the brain wave
      to alpha wave. However, it seems that under a condition where the
      head is disturbed and the stress grows worse, a modern person may
      recover more quickly by hearing a loud, violent music to tear to
      pieces the thinking circuit of his or her own head, than by
      hearing a soft music. For the same reason, it seems that the
      suggestive effect is larger when both the vision and the sense of
      hearing are used to disturb the tired brain and spirit, than when
      the eyes are closed and the whole attention is concentrated to a
      suggestive person's words. Consequently, the person is made to
      simultaneously experience the suggestion of the vision and the
      suggestion of the hypnosis introduced by a doctor, and is
      compulsively introduced into hypnosis to increase the suggestive
      effect.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [Field of the Invention This invention relates to a hypnotic
      method of simultaneous use and implied sound that leads to move
      the screen and hypnosis that retracted fall into the illusion that
      going in and looking.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      The Conventional hypnosis method, given the implied third party is
      allowed to relax the subject, and two types of self-hypnosis to
      enter the hypnotic state over implied in others hypnosis and the
      subject himself mind that leads to the hypnotic state I have.<br>
      <br>
      There are also those that are commercialized as a video or
      cassette, but only it is not only teaching materials over the way
      of academic hypnotic.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      Accumulate stress [0008], to the people who are frustrated float
      are various ideas in my head, if much that I'll put in hypnosis,
      you can even say please relax disconnect the power of the body I
      think that hypnotherapy is not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the also the original when it was also awake as could
      well relax by the implied effect, it is easy to return to the head
      of the confused state.<br>
      <br>
      Effective treatment means when the stress is Takaji became such as
      insomnia, poor concentration and gastritis in that sense is
      considered to not be.<br>
      <br>
      Although modern people is the fact that hypnosis is effective it
      is to understand, as it is referred to as hypnosis, there are many
      people who have the image that something special that.<br>
      <br>
      Psychiatry of the tapping courage and time without door, also

      treatment plants and scary when you are that something strange
      city, troubled what neurological and stress It would not than is
      sending daily life.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      In modern society [it means for solving the problems], listening
      to quiet music in order to relieve stress and relax, and for that
      it must be in alpha waves has become a common sense the brain
      waves.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      However, it is placed in a state where head is confused stress was
      Takaji for modern people to listen to violent music loud than
      quiet music, the better to shred thinking circuit of their own
      head to shreds it is believed that early recovery .<br>
      <br>
      Close the eyes in the same reasons, rather than full attention to
      the words of the implied person, visually at the same time is
      allowed to experience a hypnotic suggestion by the moving screen
      and the doctor that causes the illusion, using visual and a
      hearing at the same time was separated Conran and tired head and
      spirit leads to forced hypnosis is, it is intended to try to
      increase the implied effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, by changing the contents of the implied acoustic, other α
      wave creation of brain waves indicating a relaxed state, wave β
      indicating the concentration, it is possible to create also Fmθ
      wave shown a deep sleep state.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      [For work] user is sitting chair take a relatively comfortable
      position, gaze to move the screen rotates the second figure.<br>
      To enter the hypnotic state by listening to imply sound that leads
      to hypnosis by a third party that has been pre-recorded at the
      same time.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      And "moving screen" in the EXAMPLES herein, spiral or rotate
      around a center of the screen of the video of the (drawing b),
      concentric (drawing c) to straight line of (drawing a) by the
      video screen, such as the release of the video from the center of
      the screen, comprehensive I mean the visual image of falling into
      illusion, such as going drawn into the viewer.<br>
      <br>
      When placing a hypnosis, an image fall into illusion going drawn
      into a visual image, and if solving hypnosis, rotating the spiral
      screen, in a concentric or linear image is the video It is carried
      out by show as sucked into the center of the screen.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the "implied acoustic" herein is not only direct
      implication voice to the subject, because the background music and
      natural sound is also included in order to increase the subliminal
      and the implied effect, was the representation that dare to say
      "acoustic" .<br>
      <br>
      Thing that was recorded on video tape the computer graphics of the
      moving screen along with the implied sound.<br>
      <br>
      What was recorded on the optical laser disc the computer graphics
      of the moving screen along with the implied sound.<br>
      <br>
      Although modern people, according to the present invention is the
      fact that hypnosis is effective it is to understand, as it is
      referred to as hypnosis, many people have an image that something
      special that.<br>
      <br>
      Psychiatry of the tapping courage and time without door, also
      while has a fear that was said to be carried out to such hypnotic
      treatment plants and scary when you are that something strange
      city, saddled with stress, such as neurological ones We have sent
      a day-to-day life.<br>
      <br>
      Its meaning is just to put in a hypnotic state has seen a monitor
      screen, I think that it is easy to secure as it is possible to use
      at home.<br>
