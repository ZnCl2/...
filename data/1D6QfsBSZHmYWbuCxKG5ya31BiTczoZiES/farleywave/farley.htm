          Get A Bite Of The Energy Market</small></small></h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="anaconda.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;" id="first"><span
        class="date"></span>A device consisting of a giant rubber tube
      may hold the key to producing affordable electricity from the
      energy in sea waves. Invented in the UK, the 'Anaconda' is a
      totally innovative wave energy concept. Its ultra-simple design
      means it would be cheap to manufacture and maintain, enabling it
      to produce clean electricity at lower cost than other types of
      wave energy converter. Cost has been a key barrier to deployment
      of such converters to date.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Named after the snake of the same name
      because of its long thin shape, the Anaconda is closed at both
      ends and filled completely with water. It is designed to be
      anchored just below the sea's surface, with one end facing the
      oncoming waves.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A wave hitting the end squeezes it and
      causes a 'bulge wave'* to form inside the tube. As the bulge wave
      runs through the tube, the initial sea wave that caused it runs
      along the outside of the tube at the same speed, squeezing the
      tube more and more and causing the bulge wave to get bigger and
      bigger. The bulge wave then turns a turbine fitted at the far end
      of the device and the power produced is fed to shore via a cable.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Because it is made of rubber, the
      Anaconda is much lighter than other wave energy devices (which are
      primarily made of metal) and dispenses with the need for hydraulic
      rams, hinges and articulated joints. This reduces capital and
      maintenance costs and scope for breakdowns.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Anaconda is, however, still at an
      early stage of development. The concept has only been proven at
      very small laboratory-scale, so important questions about its
      potential performance still need to be answered. Funded by the
      Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and in
      collaboration with the Anaconda's inventors and with its developer
      (Checkmate SeaEnergy), engineers at the University of Southampton
      are now embarking on a programme of larger-scale laboratory
      experiments and novel mathematical studies designed to do just
      that.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Using tubes with diameters of 0.25 and
      0.5 metres, the experiments will assess the Anaconda's behaviour
      in regular, irregular and extreme waves. Parameters measured will
      include internal pressures, changes in tube shape and the forces
      that mooring cables would be subjected to. As well as providing
      insights into the device's hydrodynamic behaviour, the data will
      form the basis of a mathematical model that can estimate exactly
      how much power a full-scale Anaconda would produce.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When built, each full-scale Anaconda
      device would be 200 metres long and 7 metres in diameter, and
      deployed in water depths of between 40 and 100 metres. Initial
      assessments indicate that the Anaconda would be rated at a power
      output of 1MW (roughly the electricity consumption of 2000 houses)
      and might be able to generate power at a cost of 6p per kWh or
      less. Although around twice as much as the cost of electricity
      generated from traditional coal-fired power stations, this
      compares very favourably with generation costs for other leading
      wave energy concepts.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The Anaconda could make a valuable
      contribution to environmental protection by encouraging the use of
      wave power," says Professor John Chaplin, who is leading the
      EPSRC-funded project. "A one-third scale model of the Anaconda
      could be built next year for sea testing and we could see the
      first full-size device deployed off the UK coast in around five
      years' time."</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Anaconda was invented by <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Francis Farley</span> (an
      experimental physicist) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rod
        Rainey</span> (of Atkins Oil and Gas).&nbsp; There may be
      advantages in making part of the tube inelastic, but this is still
      under assessment.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Wave-generated electricity is
      carbon-free and so can help the fight against global warming.
      Together with tidal energy, it is estimated that wave power could
      supply up to 20% of the UK's current electricity demand.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The two-year project 'The
      Hydrodynamics of a Distensible Wave Energy Converter' is receiving
      EPSRC funding of just over £430,000.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Abstract <span
        style="font-weight: normal;">-- A generally horizontal
        distensible (elastically flexible) tube 1 in the sea containing
        water and oriented in the direction of wave travel with
        distensibility such that the propagation velocity of pressure
        waves inside the tube (referred to as bulge waves) is the same
        as the velocity of propagation of the waves in the sea outside.
        Energy is then transferred from the ocean waves to the bulge
        wave. Energy extraction means at the stem and/or bow deliver
        useful energy. Said energy extraction means may comprise pistons
        actuating pumps or linear or rotating generators, or may
        comprise one-way valves with the effect that water is pumped
        into a pressure system or into the distensible tube. In a
        preferred embodiment one-way valves at or near the stern admit
        water to the tube which flows out at the bow through a water
        turbine driving an electric generator. The tube may be suspended
        below the surface from floats 4, or may be supported on the sea
        bed (figure 2). </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><span
        style="font-weight: normal;">The invention relates to an
        apparatus for extracting useful energy from the waves of the
        sea.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">James Lighthill in reference
        [1] shows how pressure waves can propagate along a distensible
        tube. The pressure causes the tube to dilate locally and this
        reduces the velocity of propagation.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The more distensible the tube,
        the slower is the wave velocity. It is convenient to refer to
        these waves in the tube as "bulge waves". Lighthili applies his
        analysis to blood flow in arteries.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">This invention, on a much
        larger scale, applies the same principle to extract energy from
        ocean waves. A long distensible tube full of water is oriented
        in the direction of wave propagation and the velocity of the
        bulge wave inside the tube is more or less equal to the velocity
        of the ocean waves outside. In this case energy is transferred
        from the ocean to the bulge wave which grows along the length of
        the tube. At the end of the tube a piston or other means is used
        to capture the energy of the bulge wave and generate useful
        power.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Many prior wave energy
        inventions use flexible membranes and/or tubes oriented in the
        direction of wave travel, but none appear to rely on the
        distensibility of a tube made (or partly made) of an elastic
        material, as a means of storing wave energy prior to conversion.
        The novelty of this invention is the use of a tube with elastic
        walls carrying bulge waves matched to the velocity of the ocean
        waves.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Definitions Elastic: A
        substance, material or object is elastic if it can be deformed
        by an applied force and return to its original shape when the
        force is removed. An elastic object obeys Hooke's law that the
        strain produced is substantially proportional to the applied
        stress. All solid materials are more or less elastic up to some
        limiting strain. For example the limiting strain for steel is
        about 0.1% while for rubber the limiting strain may be around
        50%. By highly elastic we mean a substance, material or object
        for which the limiting strain is greater than 5%. The elasticity
        of an object depends upon its shape as well as the material from
        which it is made. Thus a helical spring made of steel can be
        highly elastic in the direction of its principal axis, although
        the' steel itself is not.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Distensible: A tube is
        distensible if it responds to changes of internal pressure with
        a proportional change of its cross-sectional area from its
        undisturbed value. Distensible tubes have highly elastic walls,
        either because they are made of elastic material or because they
        are in some way folded or corrugated. For a tube of
        cross-sectional area S with internal pressure p, the
        distensibility is defined as D = (uS) dS/dp (1).</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">It is important for this
        invention to distinguish between distensibility and flexibility:
        some examples may make this clear. A motor car tyre is flexible
        but not distensible: when inflated it is elastic for small
        deformations. The inner tube of the motor car tyre is
        distensible. An inflatable boat is flexible but not distensible:
        its size does not vary with the inflation pressure.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">This is because inflatable
        boats are made of reinforced elastomeric sheet which is flexible
        but not highly elastic.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Bulge wave: As described by
        Lighthill in reference [1], in a distensible tube a longitudinal
        pressure wave, associated with a change of cross-section and a
        longitudinal fluid velocity, can propagate along the tube. This
        wave is called a bulge wave. The velocity of propagation of the
        bulge wave is c where c2 = 1/(pD), p is the density of the fluid
        inside and D the distensibility as defined above in equation
        (1).</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Bow and stern: For a long
        object in the sea oriented generally in the direction of wave
        propagation, the end facing into the waves will be referred to
        as the bow: the other end facing in the direction of propagation
        will be referred to as the stem.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The invention According to this
        invention in its first characteristic the wave energy converter
        comprises a long distensible tube, generally horizontal,
        immersed or partially immersed in the sea and oriented generally
        in the direction of wave propagation, said tube being open or
        closed at the bow and furnished with energy extraction means at
        one or both ends, the distensibility of the tube being chosen so
        that the velocity of the bulge wave along the tube is generally
        equal to or close to the velocity of the waves in the
        surrounding sea.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The tube is filled with water
        or other liquid of similar density which may with advantage be
        at a pressure higher than that in the surrounding sea.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention the
        cross-section of the distensible tube may be of any shape and
        the elasticity of the walls may vary around the circumference,
        part of the circumference in some embodiments being
        substantially inelastic. Furthermore the shape, size and
        elasticity of the cross-section, and consequentially the
        distensibility, may with advantage vary along the length of the
        tube.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its second characteristic the walls of said tube may be
        comprised of any highly elastic material such as natural or
        synthetic rubber with or without fibre reinforcement or a highly
        elastic arrangement of less elastic substances such as helical
        springs, corrugated metal or a reticulated structure of flexible
        membranes inflated with compressed air or other fluid.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its third characteristic the energy extraction means at the ends
        of the tube may compnse any machinery or process which is driven
        by the oscillating pressure and oscillating longitudinal
        velocity inside the tube, for example without limitation one or
        more turbines or pistons operating at any angle to the
        horizontal actuated by the water pressure inside said tube and
        driving hydraulic pumps or linear or rotating generators, or
        overtopping means allowing water inside the tube to be driven
        over a weir or through one or more non-return valves into a
        reservoir at elevated pressure, a separate non-return valve
        allowing water to enter the tube from the sea when the pressure
        inside is low, or any combination of the above.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In an alternative embodiment
        the energy extraction means comprises a vertical tube containing
        water with means for adjusting the height of the water surface
        and with a piston moving more or less vertically. In a further
        alternative the vertical tube is closed at the top except for a
        hole furnished with a float valve which allows air to escape but
        not water and is further furnished with a non-return valve
        leading to a hydraulic accumulator, with the effect that when
        the water inside the tube reaches the top of the tube the float
        valve closes and water is driven at high pressure into said
        hydraulic accumulator.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its fourth characteristic the distensible tube may be located on
        the sea bed, fixed in position by conventional attachments
        according to the art or ballasted with liquid or solid ballast
        so as to sink to the sea bed. Alternatively the tube may be
        fixed at some distance below the sea surface by attachment to a
        supporting frame attached to the sea bed. In another embodiment
        the distensible tube may be furnished with buoyancy means the
        whole being ballasted to float with said tube partly or wholly
        submerged. In this case the tube is held in position with
        moorings according to the art.</span><br style="font-weight:

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><span
        style="font-weight: normal;">Particular embodiments of the
        invention will now be described by way of example with reference
        to the figures. Figure 1 illustrates by way of example in side
        elevation a long distensible tube 1 with rigid bow 2 furnished
        with a multiplicity of hollow buoyant chambers 4 with the effect
        that the apparatus floats with the tube 1 more or less
        horizontal and slightly below the sea surface 3. The device is
        held in position by moorings 7 according to the art. The walls
        of the tube 1 are highly elastic and made for example of natural
        or synthetic rubber as illustrated in the cross-section view AA
        in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span>. The high
        elasticity of the walls has the effect of making the tube 1
        distensible, the said elasticity being chosen so that the
        velocity of the bulge wave propagating inside the tube is close
        to the velocity of the waves in the sea outside.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">At the stern and/or bow the
        tube is furnished with energy extraction means 5 of which there
        are many alternative embodiments which will be described in
        detail below.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The operation of the device is
        as follows. The oscillating pressure and pressure gradient
        outside the Lube wall due to the ocean waves excites a bulge
        wave near the bow which propagates along the tube at the bulge
        wave velocity. As the bulge wave moves along the tube, the ocean
        wave is moving along the tube at the same speed and at each
        point contributes a further increase in pressure. The result is
        a cumulative more or less linear increase in the amplitude of
        the bulge wave, which in effect progressively sucks energy in
        from the wave. Depending on its length, the oscillating internal
        pressure amplitude at the end of the tube can be 3-5 times the
        amplitude of the oscillating pressure in the ocean wave. Useful
        energy is then extracted from the oscillating pressure at the
        end of the tube, as explained in detail below. In a typical case
        the amplitude of the bulge wave at the stern of the tube 1 is
        such that the tube must expand and contract by about 50% in
        cross-sectional area from its undisturbed value.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In an alternative embodiment,
        illustrated in side elevation in <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Figure 2</span>, the distensible tube 1 is furnished on
        its lower surface with a multiplicity of flexible bags 8 filled
        with ballast means, for example without limitation sand, gravel
        or liquid mud, with the effect that the tube 1 is held firmly on
        the sea bed 9. It may be further located by means of moorings 7.
        In a preferred embodiment the flexible bags 8 may be joined
        together to comprise one long bag with the same effect. This
        embodiment is useful in shallow water such that the ocean waves
        on the sea surface 3 produce a significant pressure oscillation
        at the depth of the distensible tube 1, exciting a bulge wave as
        explained above. The tube is furnished at the stern with energy
        extraction means 5 of which there are many alternative
        embodiments which will be described in detail below. The
        operation of the device is similar to that described above.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Figure 3</span> illustrates in cross-section by way of
        example a variety of constructions which may be adopted for the
        distensible tube. The cross-section may be of any shape. To
        achieve the large changes in cross-sectional area mentioned
        above, all or part of the circumference of the tube must be
        highly elastic. Figure 3a illustrates an embodiment in which the
        walls of the tube 10 are made of natural or synthetic rubber,
        the elasticity of the walls being chosen to achieve the correct
        distensibility as specified above. The elasticity of the walls
        need not be the same at all points of the circumference. <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3b</span> illustrates by way
        of example an embodiment in which the lower side of the tube is
        a substantially inelastic plate 11, while the rest of the
        circumference lOis highly elastic. <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Figure 3c</span> illustrates a construction in which
        the sides of the tube 10 are elastic but the top and bottom 11
        comprise inelastic plates. In a further alternative, illustrated
        in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3d</span>, the top
        and bottom 11 of the tube are inelastic but the sides of the
        tube 12 are corrugated; in this case the tube can expand and
        contract vertically like a conventional metal bellows, and the
        distensibility is controlled by the vertical spring constant of
        the corrugated walls. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure
          3e</span> illustrates an embodiment in which the whole
        circumference of the cross-section is corrugated, the
        distensibility being controlled by the circumferential spring
        constant of the walls. There can be any number of corrugations.
        Figure 3f illustrates an embodiment in which the cross-section
        is normally elliptical, but can expand out to a more circular
        shape with greater cross-sectional area by the bending of the
        walls, which are effectively corrugated as in Figure 3e, but
        with only two corrugations.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In a preferred embodiment
        illustrated in transverse cross-section in Figure 4a the walls
        of the tube compnse a reticulated structure of flexible
        membranes, inflated by compressed air or other fluid, according
        to the art of inflated structures. Said membranes may be
        themselves highly elastic or alternatively fibre-reinforced
        elastomenc sheets with limited elasticity. Although the flexible
        membranes comprising a structure may be themselves substantially
        inelastic, an inflated structure can be highly elastic: well
        known examples are a motor car tyre and a football. The
        principles are illustrated in Figures 4b and 4c which show part
        of an inflated structure comprising a multiplicity of similar
        cells joined together in a linear array. When the cells are
        inflated with compressed air the upper and lower membranes adopt
        the shape that maximizes the volume of the cell; this is
        achieved when the upper and lower membranes lie on the circle
        circumscribing the corner points 16, 17, 18 and 19. This circle
        is shown by dotted lines in Figure 4b. It will be seen that in
        Figure 4b the upper and lower membranes become rather flat, with
        the result that in this case the structure is not significantly
        elastic in the horizontal direction.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In Figure 4c however the
        internal vertical membranes are shorter, with the effect that
        the upper and lower membranes, which again follow the shape of
        the circumscribing circle, are substantially curved. It results
        that the structure is highly elastic in the horizontal
        direction. The effective modulus of elasticity of the structure
        can be varied by changing the pressure inside the cells.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In the embodiment of the
        distensible tube illustrated in transverse cross-section in
        Figure 4a, the dimensions of the cells are so chosen that the
        inner and outer membranes are highly curved with the effect that
        the wall of the enclosed hollow tube is highly elastic in the
        circumferential direction and the distensibility of the tube is
        large. The distensibility of the tube can be varied by changing
        the inflation pressure of the wall with the effect that the
        velocity of the bulge wave inside the tube can easily be
        adjusted from time to time to match the prevailing wave
        conditions.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">This is a major advantage of
        this embodiment for wave energy conversion. In some embodiments
        the walls of the distensible tube may be made of a highly
        elastic material such as natural or synthetic rubber said walls
        further comprising internal spaces which may be inflated with
        air or other fluid with the effect that the distensibility of
        the tube may be adjusted from time to time.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In all the embodiments
        illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, the cross-section of the tube
        may be the same at all longitudinal positions along the tube. Or
        with advantage the dimensions or the circumferential elasticity
        of the cross-section may vary along the tube.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Particular embodiments of the
        energy extraction means mounted at the stem of the distensible
        tube will now be described with reference to Figures 5 to 10. In
        the embodiment illustrated by way of example in Figure 5 a rigid
        cylindrical tube 20 is attached to the distensible tube 1 at its
        stern end. The piston 21 slides inside the rigid tube 20 and via
        a connecting rod 23 drives a conventional hydraulic pump 25
        which delivers hydraulic fluid which may be oil, air or water to
        a useful output via the connecting pipes 26. The space behind
        the piston 21 is with advantage filled with air and vented to
        the atmosphere via tube 22. In operation the bulge wave
        propagating along the distensible tube 1 builds up to a large
        amplitude as it reaches the stem.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The oscillating pressure in the
        bulge wave drives the piston to and fro with the effect that the
        said hydraulic fluid is pumped under pressure to a useful
        output.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Another embodiment of the
        energy extraction means is illustrated by way of example in
        Figure 6. In this embodiment the distensible tube 1 is
        tenninated at the stern with a bent tube 29 connected to a rigid
        cylinder 30 with piston 31 A hydraulic pump 33 is supported for
        example on an open framework 34 and connected to the piston by
        means of the connecting rod 32. A reservoir 35 contains water 36
        and the water level is maintain above the mean level of the sea
        by auxiliary pumps (not illustrated). This reservoir is
        connected to the energy extraction means by a nan-ow pipe with
        the effect that the mean water level in the cylinder 30 is
        maintained substantially above the level of the sea but the pipe
        is too narrow to pass the bulge wave pressure oscillations to
        the reservoir. The piston 31 is buoyant and on average floats on
        the water in the cylinder 30. The rising and falling of the
        water level in the cylinder 30 under the action of the bulge
        wave drives the piston to and fro vertically with the effect
        that useful hydraulic energy is generated by the hydraulic pump
        33 and passed to a useful output via connecting pipes (not
        illustrated) according to the art. In this embodiment, if the
        wave energy is very high so that the bulge wave is exceptionally
        large, the piston 31 will rise above the end of the cylinder 30
        and water will spill out of the cylinder into the surrounding
        sea with the effect of relieving the excess pressure in the
        system and protecting it from damage. The piston will fall back
        into the cylinder and the lost water will be replaced by water
        from the reservoir via the pipe 37. If the bulge wave
        oscillation is of large amplitude the pressure inside the
        distensible tube may fall below the sea water pressure outside
        with the effect that the walls of the distensible tube could
        collapse inwards. To avoid this, the tube may with advantage be
        furnished with a one-way valve 38 which allows sea water to
        enter the tube if the pressure inside is lower than outside.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Another embodiment of the
        energy extraction means is illustrated by way of example in
        Figure 7. In this embodiment the distensible tube 1 is
        terminated at the stern by a bend connected to a vertical tube
        42. Which is closed at the top close to sea level by a bulkhead
        43. Said bulkhead is furnished with a hole 44 fitted with a
        float valve 45 with the effect that air can flow freely in and
        out of the tube 42 but water cannot escape. The bulkhead is
        further furnished with a one-way valve 46 leading to a hydraulic
        accumulator 47 which contains water under pressure according to
        the art. In this embodiment the water surface 41 inside the
        vertical tube 42 is on average more or less the same as in the
        sea outside but is driven up and down through a large amplitude
        by the bulge wave inside the tube. As the water surface 42 rises
        the air above it is vented to the atmosphere via the hole 44;
        but when the water reaches the bulkhead the float valve closes
        and a high pressure shock is generated. This forces some water
        through the one-way valve 46 into the hydraulic accumulator 47
        with the effect that energy is captured to the hydraulic
        accumulator. From the accumulator sea water under pressure may
        be led off through the pipe 48 to do useful work according to
        the art. The water thus lost from the tube 42 is replaced from
        the sea when the pressure in the bulge wave goes negative via
        the one-way valve 38 substantially as described above. The
        overall effect of this embodiment is that the bulge waves cause
        sea water to be pumped at high pressure to a useful output with
        no moving parts (apart from the float valve and one-way valves).
        In this embodiment the distensible tube 1 may optionally be open
        to the sea at the bow.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Another embodiment of the
        energy extraction means is illustrated by way of example in
        Figure 8. In this embodiment the distensible tube 1 is connected
        to a long rigid output pipe 51 by means of an intermediate
        transition and matching section 50. Said transition and matching
        Section 50 may comprise several stages (not illustrated) with
        changes of cross-section and of distensibility with the effect
        that the bulge wave with comparatively small pressure
        oscillations and with large longitudinal velocity oscillations
        is converted without substantial loss or reflection into a wave
        with high pressure oscillations and low velocities, the latter
        being more suitable for transmitting energy to shore through a
        comparatively narrow pipe.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In the embodiment illustrated
        by way of example in longitudinal side elevation in Figure 9 the
        distensible tube 1 is furnished at the stern with a partially
        distensible end pipe 60 furnished with one or more one-way
        valves 61 which allow sea water to enter the pipe but not to
        leave.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The tube is further furnished
        at the bow with a rigid pipe 62 open to the sea and fitted with
        an internal frame 63 which supports an electric generator 65 and
        water turbine 64. The operation of the system is as follows. The
        pressure inside the distensible tube 1 is generally higher than
        the pressure outside. But during the low pressure phase of the
        bulge wave arriving at the stern, the pressure in the end pipe
        60 is lower than the pressure in the sea with the effect that
        water is sucked into said end pipe through the one-way valve or
        valves 61. During the high pressure phase of the bulge wave the
        one-way valve is closed and water cannot leave the tube. The
        result is a net intake of water at the stern which maintains the
        high average pressure in the distensible tube 1 and the result
        is a more or less uniform flow of water along the tube from
        stern to bow.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Said water flows out into the
        sea at the bow through the turbine 64 generating electricity
        according to the art. A mooring 7 serves to hold the device in
        position. With advantage the end pipe 60 may be furnished with
        one or more side chambers 66 which may be distensible or rigid
        and may contain air. Said side chambers have the effect of
        improving the matching of the bulge wave and smoothing the flow
        of water to the turbine. In this embodiment the distensible tube
        1 may in addition be furnished with a multiplicity of one-way
        valves 68 dispersed along the length of the tube with the effect
        of allowing more water to enter the tube at these positions and
        enhancing the flow through the turbine 64.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Figure 10 shows by way of
        example in longitudinal lateral cross-section another embodiment
        of the one-way valve system which may be attached to the stern
        of the distensible tube or at some position along the length of
        the tube and used in combination with a turbine at the bow as
        described with reference to Figure 9. The purpose of this
        embodiment is to increase the pressure inside the distensible
        tube 1 with a view to avoiding any tendency of the tube to
        collapse inwards. Referring to Figure 10, in this embodiment the
        distensible tube 1 is furnished at its stern with a rigid tube
        70 with sliding piston 71 which compresses and expands the
        corrugated bellows 73. The high pressure inside the tube 1 is
        balanced by the helical spring 74. The space 78 inside the
        bellows communicates with the interior of the distensible tube 1
        through the one-way valve 72 and with the sea via one-way valve
        75, while the space between the bellows and the rigid tube 70
        may with advantage be vented to the atmosphere via the tube 76.
        In operation the oscillating pressure in the bulge wave inside
        the distensible tube 1 drives the piston 71 to and fro. When
        moving to the left in Figure 10 it sucks water from the sea via
        one-way valve 75 into the space 78. When moving to the right it
        drives the water from space 78 through the one-way valve 72 into
        the distensible tube 1. In this embodiment the distensible tube
        1 is furnished at the bow with a turbine and electric generator
        substantially as already illustrated and described in relation
        to Figure 9 with the effect that the energy of the waves causes
        water to be pumped through the turbine generating useful
        electricity. Many other arrangements of pistons may be adopted
        according to the art with the effect of pumping water at
        elevated pressure into the distensible tube 1. In particular,
        there may with advantage be a number of chambers 78, which may
        be brought into operation in varying numbers, by locking the
        one-way valves. In this way the minimum bulge wave pressure
        required to move the piston may be varied, to suit the wave
        conditions, and other more complex control strategies adopted.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In an alternative embodiment
        similar to Figure 9 but not illustrated, the one-way valve 61 at
        the stern may be reversed, allowing water to leave the end pipe
        60 but not to enter and a turbine can be located in this stream
        of water at the stern. In another alternative instead of passing
        through a turbine, the flow of water can be directed into an
        elevated reservoir either in the sea or on land with the effect
        that water is pumped from the sea to the reservoir. This may be
        used for example for flushing out estuaries or supplying fish
        farms.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In another embodiment
        illustrated by way of example in longitudinal cross-section in
        Figure 11 two distensible vessels of any shape 80 containing
        water or other fluid are connected by a more or less ngid pipe
        81 with the effect that under the action of the waves water
        flows to and fro along the pipe between the said vessels. Any
        energy extraction means described above may be connected to the
        vessels with the effects substantially as already described. In
        particular either one or both the vessels may be furnished with
        one or more one-way valves 82 or more elaborate one-way valve
        systems as illustrated in Figure 10 with the effect that water
        is pumped from the sea into the vessels. The vessels may be
        further furnished with one or more turbines 83 generating
        electric power substantially as already described.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">It will be apparent that some
        particular features of one of the alternative embodiments
        described by way of example above may be combined with
        particular features of another embodiment, all within the scope
        of the invention.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Abstract -- <span
        style="font-weight: normal;">A wave energy converter makes use
        of pressure waves (bulge waves) that travel along a generally
        horizontal distensible tube 1 in the sea 7. The tube 1 contains
        water under pressure and is oriented in the direction of wave
        travel. Its flexibility / expandability is such that the
        velocity of pressure waves inside the tube is the same as the
        velocity of the waves in the sea. The tube 1 has highly elastic
        walls incorporating or surrounded by helical reinforcement
        members 2. The velocity of the pressure waves can be tuned to
        match the wave velocity by regulating the pressure of the water
        inside the tube. Energy is then transferred from the ocean waves
        to the bulge wave. Energy extraction means 6 at the end of the
        tube 1 delivers useful energy as electricity or high pressure
        sea water. </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The invention is an apparatus
        for extracting useful energy from the waves of the sea, and is
        an improved embodiment of the invention described in reference
        [IJ.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">James Lighthill in reference
        (21 shows how pressure waves can propagate along a distensible
        tube. The more distensible the tube, the slower is the wave
        velocity. It is convenient to refer to these waves in the tube
        as "bulge waves". Lighthill applies his analysis to blood flow
        in arteries. This invention, on a much larger scale, applies the
        same principle to extract energy from ocean waves. A long
        distensible tube full of water is oriented in the direction of
        wave propagation and the velocity of the bulge wave inside the
        tube is more or less equal to the velocity of the ocean waves
        outside. In this case energy is transferred from the ocean to
        the bulge wave which grows along the length of the tube. At the
        end of the tube a piston or other means is used to capture the
        energy of the bulge wave and generate useful power.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Many prior wave energy
        inventions use flexible membranes andlor tubes oriented in the
        direction of wave travel, but none appear to rely on the
        distensibility of a tube made (or partly made) of an elastic
        material. The novelty of this invention is the use of a tube
        with elastic walls carrying bulge waves matched to the velocity
        of the ocean waves. By adding helical reinforcement to the
        elastic walls the distensibility of the tube can readily be
        controlled.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Elastic tubes reinforced by
        helical windings are known to enclose a smaller volume when
        stretched by an axial force and have therefore been proposed as
        pumping means in wave power converters using the vertical
        heaving of floating bodies. In contrast according to this
        invention the tube is used at maximum volume, no axial force is
        applied to the tube which is immersed in the water and responds
        to the lateral pressure exerted directly upon it by the waves.
        The propagation of bulge waves in an elastic tube with helical
        reinforcement and the application to wave power conversion are
        both novel concepts.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Definitions Elastic: A
        substance, material or object is elastic if it can be deformed
        by an applied force and return to its original shape when the
        force is removed. An elastic object obeys Hooke's law that the
        strain produced is substantially proportional to the applied
        stress. All solid materials are more or less elastic up to some
        limiting strain. For example the limiting strain for steel is
        about 0.1% while for rubber the limiting strain may be around
        50%. By highly elastic we mean a substance, material or object
        for which the limiting strain is greater than 5%. The elasticity
        of an object depends upon its shape as well as the material from
        which it is made. Thus a helical spring made of steel can be
        highly elastic in the direction of its principal axis, although
        the steel itself is not.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Distensible: A tube is
        distensible if it responds to changes of internal pressure with
        a more or less proportional change of its cross-sectional area
        from its undisturbed value. Distensible tubes have highly
        elastic walls, either because they are made of elastic material
        or because they are in some way folded or corrugated. For a tube
        of cross-sectional area S with internal pressure p. the
        distensibility is defined as D = (1/5) dS/dp (I).</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">It is important for this
        invention to distinguish between distensibility and flexibility:
        some examples may make this clear. A motor car tyre is flexible
        but not distensible: when inflated it is elastic for small
        deformations. The inner tube of the motor car tyre is
        distensible. An inflatable boat is flexible but not distensible:
        its size does not vary with the inflation pressure.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">This is because inflatable
        boats are made of reinforced elastomeric sheet which is flexible
        but not highly elastic. A garden hose is flexible but not
        distensible. A toy balloon is distensible.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Bulge wave: As described by
        Lighthill in reference 12), in a distensible tube a longitudinal
        pressure wave, associated with a change of cross-section and a
        longitudinal fluid velocity, can propagate along the tube. This
        wave is called a bulge wave. The velocity of propagation of the
        bulge wave is c where c2 = 1/(pD), p is the density of the fluid
        inside and D the distensibility as defined above in equation
        (1).</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Bow and stern: For a long
        object in the sea oriented generally in the direction of wave
        propagation, the end facing into the waves will be referred to
        as the bow: the other end facing in the direction of propagation
        will be referred to as the stern.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Pitch: The pitch of a helix is
        the angle between the lines of the helix and the transverse
        plane perpendicular to the axis of the helix.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The invention According to this
        invention in its first characteristic the wave energy converter
        comprises a long distensible tube, generally horizontal,
        immersed or partially immersed in the sea and oriented generally
        in the direction of wave propagation, said tube being closed and
        containing water under pressure and furnished with energy
        extraction means at one or both ends, the distensibility of the
        tube being adjusted so that the velocity of the bulge wave along
        the tube is generally equal to or close to the velocity of the
        waves in the surrounding sea. The tube is of circular
        cross-section and the diameter may with advantage vary along the
        length of the tube.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its second characteristic the impermeable wall of the tube is
        comprised of a highly elastic material such as natural or
        synthetic rubber and furnished with a multiplicity of helical
        reinforcement means made of any material. Said reinforcement
        means may comprise without limitation wires, cables, tapes,
        ropes, strings or cords made of substantially inextensible
        material such as metal, natural or synthetic fibre or partially
        extensible synthetic material such as high modulus polyethylene,
        polyester or keviar. Each element of said reinforcement means is
        in the form of a helix circumscribing the tube or embedded in
        the wall of the tube extending from one end of the tube to the
        other and fixed to the tube at each end. With advantage the
        helical reinforcement means are parallel to each other and
        equally spaced around the circumference of the tube. Said
        helices may be right-handed or left-handed or both and of
        constant and identical pitch. Right-handed and left-handed
        helices may with advantage be woven together to comprise a
        reticulate structure or they may be of different diameters so
        that one fits inside the other.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its third characteristic the distensible tube with helical
        reinforcement is filled with water connected to pressure means.
        Said pressure means ensures that the pressure inside the tube is
        maintained and controlled according to the art. It may comprise
        for example without limitation a hydraulic accumulator with
        elastic walls or a hydraulic accumulator containing air under
        pressure or a hydraulic accumulator in which the contained water
        is raised vertically or a tube supplying water under pressure
        from the shore or from an auxiliary vessel or structure.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The effect of the pressure
        inside the tube is twofold. On the one hand it tends to expand
        the tube laterally but, because of the helical reinforcement,
        this can only occur if the tube contracts axially. On the other
        hand the pressure acting on the ends of the tube tends to
        lengthen it axially. If the pitch angle of the helical
        reinforcement is close to 35 degrees, these two tendencies
        cancel each other and the tube is maintained in stable
        equilibrium. If this equilibrium is disturbed, for example by
        squeezing the tube in one place, a bulge wave will be generated
        and will propagate along the tube. The velocity of propagation
        of the bulge wave along the tube is proportional to the square
        root of the pressure inside. If the velocity of the bulge wave
        is equal to the velocity of propagation of the waves in the sea,
        then energy is transferred from the sea to the bulge wave and a
        bulge wave of large amplitude arrives at the stern.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its fourth characteristic the energy extraction means at the
        ends of the tube may comprise any machinery or process which is
        driven by the oscillating pressure and oscillating longitudinal
        velocity inside the tube and produces useful hydraulic or
        electrical energy, for example without limitation one or more
        turbines or pistons operating at any angle to the horizontal
        actuated by the water pressure inside said tube and driving
        hydraulic pumps or linear or rotating electric generators, or
        overtopping means allowing water inside the tube to be driven
        over a weir or through one or more non-return valves into a
        reservoir at elevated pressure.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In an alternative embodiment
        the energy extraction means comprises a vertical tube containing
        water closed at the top except for a hole furnished with a float
        valve which allows air to escape but not water and is further
        furnished with a non-return valve leading to a hydraulic
        accumulator, with the effect that when the water inside the tube
        reaches the top of the tube the float valve closes and according
        to the art of the hydraulic ram pump some water is driven at
        high pressure into said hydraulic accumulator.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its fifth characteristic the distensible tube is furnished with
        buoyancy means and ballasted to float with the tube partly or
        wholly submerged. The tube is moored and held in position with
        moorings according to the art. In another embodiment the
        distensible tube may be located on the sea bed, fixed in
        position by conventional attachments according to the art or
        ballasted with liquid or solid ballast so as to sink to the sea
        bed or may be fixed at some distance below the sea surface by
        attachment to a supporting frame attached to the sea bed.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Some specific embodiments of
        the invention will now be described by way of example with
        reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 shows
        in side elevation a distensible tube with a multiplicity of
        helical reinforcement means; Figure 2 illustrates in side
        elevation and partly in cross Section an enlarged view of the
        distensible tube showing for clarity only one element of the
        helical reinforcement means; Figure 3 shows in cross sectional
        side elevation further detail of the stern section comprising a
        particular embodiment of the pressure means and energy
        extraction means; Figure 4 shows in cross sectional side
        elevation an alternative embodiment of the stern section with
        energy extraction means using the principle of the hydraulic ram
        pump to deliver water at high pressure to useful output A
        particular embodiment of the invention will now be described by
        way of example with reference to the figures. Figure 1
        illustrates by way of example in side elevation a long
        distensible tube 1 made of highly elastic material, filled with
        water and circumscribed by a multiplicity of reinforcement means
        2 each in the form of a helix made of substantially inelastic
        material for example without limitation steel wire, steel tape,
        steel cable, steel rope or siring, tape, or cord made of natural
        or synthetic fibre or any combination of these. With advantage
        the reinforcement means may comprise steel cable covered with
        PVC or nylon. For clarity, only one helix 2 is shown by way of
        example in the enlarged view of a part of the distensible tube
        illustrated in side elevation and partly in section in Figure 2.
        With advantage the helices 2 are equally spaced around the
        circumference of the tube I. With advantage the tube may be
        furnished with an equal number of left-handed and right-handed
        helices. Said left-handed and right-handed helices cross in many
        places and may with advantage be of slightly different
        diameters; or they may be woven together to comprise a
        reticulate structure. With advantage the pitch angle of the
        helices is close to 35 degrees. With advantage the helices 2 may
        be embedded in the wall of the distensible tube 1. With
        advantage the tube 1 may be furnished with a multiplicity of
        circular collars, not illustrated, furnished with grooves or
        slots to locate the reinforcement means during assembly, said
        collars being highly elastic.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Referring again to Figure 1,
        the tube is furnished at the bow with a bow section 4 which may
        have rigid walls or flexible walls made of fabric coated with
        elastomer. The distensible tube I and the reinforcement means 2
        are both firmly attached to the bow section. The bow section may
        be furnished with anchoring means 5 for attaching the whole
        machine to the sea bed according to the art. Likewise at the
        stern, the tube and the reinforcement means are both firmly
        attached to the stern section 6. The stern section 6 may
        incorporate any of a variety of energy extraction means which
        convert the oscillating pressure and oscillating flow in the
        bulge wave into useful hydraulic or electrical power. Some of
        these have been described in reference 11].</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">As illustrated in Figure 1, the
        distensible tube I may be furnished with a multiplicity of
        buoyancy means 3 with the effect that it floats, partially or
        fully immersed, near the surface 7 of the sea shown as a broken
        line in the figure. Alternatively it may be baliasted so that it
        rests on the sea floor, or it may be fixed to a framework
        attached to the sea floor.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">An embodiment of the energy
        extraction means is illustrated by way of example without
        limitation in Figure 3. In this embodiment the energy extraction
        means is combined with the pressure means used to regulate the
        pressure inside the distensible tube 1. The distensible tube I
        and the helical reinforcement means (not illustrated) are finnly
        attached to the rigid stern section 6. A pressure vessel 10
        attached to the stern section 6 is divided into two volumes 11
        and 12 by the vertical partition 13 which does not extend
        completely to the top of the pressure vessel.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Volume 11 serves as a
        high-pressure accumulator while volume 12 serves as a
        low-pressure accumulator. Both volumes are partly filled with
        water 14 while the space 15 above the water surface is filled
        with air or some other gas at high pressure. The two volumes
        communicate via the space 16 above the partition 13 with the
        effect that the gas pressure in the two volumes is always the
        same. The water surface 17 in the high-pressure accumulator 11
        is higher than the water surface 18 in the low-pressure
        accumulator 12 with the effect that water flows through the
        turbine 19 generating electricity. These water levels are
        maintained by flow out of and into the bulge tube via the
        one-way valves 20 and 21 respectively, said valves being
        illustrated in Figure 3 by way of example without limitation as
        duck bill valves. With advantage the system may be furnished
        with a multiplicity of one-way valves operating in each
        direction and a multiplicity of turbines.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The operation of the energy
        extraction means illustrated in Figure 3 is as follows. The
        average pressure in the distensible tube I is equal to the
        pressure of the air 15 in the pressure vessel 10 plus the
        average hydrostatic head arising from the water levels 17 and 18
        relative to the mean depth of the tube. The air pressure is
        adjusted so that the velocity of the bulge wave in the tube is
        close to the velocity of the waves in the sea with the effect
        that energy is captured from the sea in the form of oscillating
        bulge waves in the tube. During the high-pressure phase of the
        bulge wave arriving at the stern, water is propelled through the
        one-way valve 20 into the high-pressure accumulator 11 with the
        effect that the water level 17 in this accumulator rises.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Conversely during the
        low-pressure phase of the bulge wave, water is sucked out of the
        low-pressure accumulator 12 via one-way valve 21 into the bulge
        tube and consequently the water level 18 in this accumulator
        falls. The overall effect is that water is driven from the
        distensible tube I via the one-way valve 20 into the
        high-pressure accumulator, through the turbine 19, into the
        low-pressure accumulator 12 and back into the distensible tube 1
        via one-way valve 21 with the effect that water is circulated
        through the turbine and the bulge wave energy is converted into
        electrical power. The two accumulators 11 and 12 have the effect
        of smoothing the flow through the turbine. Small differences in
        the total volume of water in the pressure vessel are
        accommodated by the compressibility of the air above the water
        surfaces. In very rough seas the water level 17 in the
        high-pressure accumulator may rise to the top of the partition
        13 and overflow into the low pressure accumulator with the
        beneficial effect of limiting the power output. With advantage
        the distensible tube 1 is inclined slightly upwards towards the
        stern, with the effect that any air which may accidentally be
        sucked into the tube from the low-pressure accumulator via the
        one-way valve 21 is immediately pumped back into the pressure
        vessel 10 via one-way valve 20.</span><br style="font-weight:

      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">An alternative embodiment of
        the energy extraction means illustrated in Figure 4 converts the
        wave energy into hydraulic power in the form of high pressure
        sea water, which may be used for desalination or for generating
        electricity by means of a Pelton wheel or turbine according to
        the art. Referring to Figure 4, the distensible tube us
        connected to the stern section 6 which comprises a rigid tube 40
        bent upwards. The tube 40 is closed at the top by a strong
        horizontal bulkhead 42 which communicates via the hole 43 with a
        closed vessel 44 containing gas under pressure. The pressure
        inside said vessel determines the pressure inside the bulge tube
        I and may be adjusted to regulate the velocity of the bulge wave
        as described above. The hole 43 is furnished with a float valve
        45 which allows gas to flow freely through the hole but closes
        whenever the surface 41 of the water inside the tube rises to
        the level of the bulkhead. The bulkhead 42 is further furnished
        with a closed vessel 47 which serves as high pressure hydraulic
        accumulator containing water and gas and storing water at high
        pressure according to the art.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The tube 40 communicates with
        said hydraulic accumulator 47 through a hole which is normally
        closed by the one-way valve 46. The operation of the system is
        as follows. The bulge wave arriving at the stern section 6
        causes the water level 41 in tube 40 to rise and fall while the
        air above the surface vents to the vessel 43. When the rising
        water reaches the bulkhead 42 the float valve suddenly closes
        giving rise to a high pressure hydraulic shock in the tube 40
        according to the well known principle of the hydraulic ram pump.
        Said high pressure shock drives water through the one-way valve
        46 into the hydraulic accumulator 47 with the effect of
        increasing the volume of high pressure water stored in the
        accumulator. This water is led through pipe 48 to a useful
        output, for example without limitation to drive a Pelton wheel
        generating electricity or for desalination by reverse osmosis. A
        small amount of the said high pressure water is used to drive a
        hydraulic motor or turbine 49 to operate the water pump 50 which
        pumps water from the sea 7 into the tube 40 to replace the water
        which passed through the one-way valve 46. To achieve this
        requires only a few per cent of the captured energy because the
        pressure in the tube 40 is much lower than the pressure in the
        accumulator 47. The small arrows in Figure 4 show the direction
        of water flow inside the pipes. In Figure 4 the float valve 45
        and one-way valve 46 are illustrated by way of example without
        limitation as ball valves, but any appropriate design of valve
        may be used according to the art.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In all cases the operation of
        the distensible tube wave energy converter is as follows. The
        oscillating pressure and pressure gradient outside the tube due
        to the ocean waves excites a bulge wave near the bow which
        propagates along the tube at the bulge wave velocity. As the
        bulge wave moves along the tube, the ocean wave is moving along
        the tube at the same speed and at each point contributes a
        further increase in pressure. The result is a cumulative more or
        less linear increase in the amplitude of the bulge wave, which
        progressively sucks in energy from the wave. In effect the bulge
        is surfing in front of the wave picking up energy as it moves.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Depending on the length of the
        tube, the oscillating pressure amplitude at the stem can be 3
        1o5 times the amplitude of the oscillating pressure in the ocean
        wave. Useful energy is then extracted from the oscillating
        pressure at the end of the tube, as explained above.</span><br

        style="font-weight: normal;">The water rises and falls inside a
        partially submerged hollow chamber, open to the sea at the
        bottom but closed at the sides and top, except for a hole
        equipped with a float valve 29. When the water reaches the top
        of the chamber the float valve 29 closes and some water is
        driven at high pressure through a non-return valve (7, fig.1)
        into a hydraulic accumulator. This hydraulic ram may be mounted
        on an elongated hull or hulls 20 with superstructure 21
        supporting elevated ballast 24 which is varied to bring the roll
        period into resonance with the waves. Auxiliary floats 22 on
        each side above the waterline contact the water when the roll
        angle is large and prevent capsize. Water pumped by the rams at
        high pressure may be used to generate electricity, for
        desalination or, if the equipment is deployed in a fresh water
        lake, for irrigation.; The hydraulic ram may be incorporated
        into a floating buoy (fig. 2). <br>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The invention relates to a
        floating apparatus for extracting useful energy from the waves
        of the sea using a hydraulic ram pumping water as the power
        output mechanism. The invention comprises two components; a new
        power conversion mechanism based on the well known hydraulic ram
        and a new floating structure which resonates with the waves in
        roll Hydraulic rams have been used for many years for pumping
        water from a low pressure stream into an elevated reservoir. The
        sudden closing of a valve in a pipe, in which water is flowing,
        creates a pressure pulse which drives some water through a
        one-way valve to the output. So far this principle has not been
        used for wave energy conversion and the concept needs to be
        adapted to this end According to the present invention the
        motion of a water surface relative to a structure is used to
        operate a hydraulic ram generating high pressure water directly.
        The water is pumped into a pressure vessel hydraulic accumulator
        or an elevated reservoir, with the result that power is
        extracted from the waves.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">It is well known that efficient
        conversion with a floating structure of moderate size may be
        obtained if the structure oscillates in resonance with the
        waves. This condition obtains if the natural period of the
        structure oscillating in a calm sea is close to the period of
        the incoming waves. But for most floating bodies of moderate
        size the natural period of oscillation in heave, roll or pitch
        is too short to satisfy this condition. According to this
        invention the natural period of a floating body in roll or pitch
        may be lengthened by appropriate design of the hull, by lowering
        the centre of buoyancy and by raising the centre of gravity with
        ballast means above the waterline which increases the moment of
        inertia and reduces the stability Energy may then be extracted
        from the enhanced rolling or pitching motion that ensues.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its first characteristic the wave powered hydraulic ram
        comprises a partially submerged hollow chamber of any shape,
        with a large opening to the sea at one side or at the bottom,
        the top of the chamber being located more or less level with the
        sea surface when there are no waves.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its second characteristic the said chamber is furnished at or
        near the top with one or more holes fitted with float valves.
        The float valve allows air to flow freely in and out of the
        chamber but, when the water level inside the chamber reaches the
        top, the valve closes and the hole is blocked so water cannot
        leave the chamber through the hole. With advantage the float
        valve is close to neutrally buoyant in sea water. When the water
        rising inside the chamber reaches the top, the drag exerted by
        the water on the valve lifts the valve and it snaps shut But
        when the water outside the chamber is falling, or equally when
        the chamber is rising through the water, the pressure of water
        above the valve causes it to open and water flows downwards
        through the valve, into the chamber and out at the bottom or the
        open side as the case may be.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention in
        its third characteristic the said chamber is furnished at or
        near the top with a hole communicating with a pressure vessel,
        containing water and air under pressure This hole is normally
        closed by a non-return valve which allows fluid to flow out of
        the chamber into the pressure vessel but not to return. Said
        pressure vessel functions as a hydraulic accumulator according
        to the art. When the water rising inside the chamber under the
        action of the waves reaches the top of the chamber, the float
        valve closes suddenly and some water is forced out of the
        chamber into the pressure vessel. A delivery pipe connected near
        the bottom of the pressure vessel leads the water under pressure
        to a useful output. There may be a multiplicity of holes with
        non-return valves connecting the chamber of the hydraulic ram to
        the pressure vessel. A multiplicity of hydraulic rams may
        deliver water under pressure to a single pressure vessel or a
        multiplicity of pressure vessels According to the invention, the
        operation of the wave powered hydraulic ram is as follows. The
        action of the waves causes the water surface to rise and fall
        inside the chamber or the chamber to rise and fall relative to
        the water surface When the water surface reaches the top of the
        chamber the float valve closes generating a high pressure inside
        the chamber according to the well known principles of the
        hydraulic ram and water is forced out of the chamber through the
        non-return valve or valves into the pressure vessel or vessels.
        From said pressure vessel, water under pressure flows through
        the delivery pipe to a useful output. The water under pressure
        may be used for any kind of useful work, for example to generate
        electricity, for desalination or, if the machine is operated in
        a fresh water lake, for irrigation.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">When a float valve in a wave
        powered hydraulic ram closes, there will be a sudden pulse of
        pressure which may generate noise and impulsive forces which can
        fatigue the structure According to the invention, it is arranged
        that when the valve closes a small volume of air is trapped in a
        pocket at the top of the said chamber with the effect that this
        air acts as a compliant air cushion and the peak pressure inside
        the chamber is reduced. For the same purpose according to the
        invention the float valve may be solid or hollow and made of an
        elastomeric material such as a fibre-reinforced polymer with the
        effect that the deformation of the material smoothes out the
        pressure transient. With advantage said float valve may comprise
        an elastomeric ball seating into a conical socket or an
        elastomeric cylinder seating into a tapered slot. When the valve
        is open said ball or cylinder is located near said hole or slot
        by a cage structure according to the art.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">With advantage the said chamber
        may be wide at the bottom and narrower at the top with the
        effect that the water rising inside the chamber is accelerated
        and generates a higher pressure when the said float valve
        closes. Also with advantage the length and shape of the chamber
        may be chosen so that the natural oscillation frequency of the
        water inside it resonates with the prevailing external wave
        frequency according to the art.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention one
        or more wave powered hydraulic rams as described above may be
        mounted on any structure fixed to the shore or sea bed with the
        result that the rams are actuated by the rising and falling of
        the sea surface. One or more wave powered hydraulic rams may
        also be mounted on any floating structure in which case the rams
        will be actuated by the heaving, rolling and pitching motion of
        the structure as well as by the waves outside the structure. The
        said floating structure may be of any shape or form for example
        without limitation a buoy, a vertical cylinder, a ship or a
        structure with multiple hulls or multiple floats.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In all cases a multiplicity of
        hydraulic rams may feed water under pressure into a single
        hydraulic accumulator or into a multiplicity of hydraulic
        accumulators in series or parallel. The water under pressure may
        be used for any kind of useful work, for example to generate
        electricity either on the structure or on a neighbouring
        structure or onshore, for desalination or, if the machine is
        operated in a fresh water lake, for irrigation.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">According to the invention one
        or more wave powered hydraulic rams may be mounted on a floating
        resonant oscillator. Said resonant oscillator comprises in the
        fourth characteristic of the invention one or more hulls which
        may with advantage be elongated and oriented with their long
        axes generally parallel to the approaching wave fronts and
        perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. If more than
        one, the hulls are fixed to each other by means of a rigid
        framework The hull or hulls support above sea level a
        superstructure which projects laterally on each side of the hull
        or hulls The invention further comprises in its fifth
        characteristic one or more ballast means supported on the said
        superstructure above the level of the sea, with the effect of
        raising the centre of gravity of the resonant oscillator and
        reducing its lateral stability with the result that its natural
        roll period is increased. By correctly choosing the quantity of
        ballast means and its height above sea level, the roll period of
        the oscillator can be made equal to the prevailing period of the
        incoming waves with the result that the structure rolls
        laterally to and fro in resonance through large angles under the
        action of the waves In a preferred embodiment the ballast means
        comprises water in one or more elevated tanks mounted on the
        said superstructure and the quantity of water is varied from
        time to time by filling or emptying the tanks, with the effect
        that the natural period of the oscillator may be adjusted to
        correspond to the period of the waves prevailing in the sea at
        any time.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">In a preferred option the
        invention further comprises one or more submerged closed hollow
        vessels fixed underneath the hulls some distance below the
        waterline, with the effect that when the structure rolls the
        upthrust on the said hollow vessels tends to decrease the
        lateral stability and increase the natural roll period. By
        moving the said water ballast from the said elevated tanks into
        said submerged hollow vessels the natural roll period may be
        further adjusted.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The invention further comprises
        in its sixth characteristic two or more auxiliary floats mounted
        on the said superstructure and projecting laterally on each side
        of the hull or hulls above the level of the sea If the
        oscillator rolls through a large angle these auxiliary floats
        come into contact with the water with the effect of limiting the
        roll angle and preventing the oscillator from capsizing
        According to the invention one or more wave powered hydraulic
        rams as described above are mounted on the hull or hulls of the
        resonant oscillator described above with the effect that the
        rolling, heaving or pitching of the resonant oscillator,
        together with the rising and falling of the water surface
        outside the structure, actuates the rams as described above and
        causes water to be pumped under pressure into pressure vessels
        and thence to a useful output.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Specific embodiments of the
        invention will now be described by way of example with reference
        to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 shows an
        embodiment of the wave powered hydraulic ram in vertical cross
        section.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Figure 2 shows in plan and
        vertical elevation a floating buoy wave energy converter
        incorporating a multiplicity of hydraulic rams Figure 3 shows in
        plan and vertical elevation a resonant oscillator wave energy
        converter in the form of a catamaran furnished with hydraulic
        rams.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">A particular embodiment of the
        invention will now be described with reference to Figure 1 which
        shows the principal components of the wave powered hydraulic ram
        in vertical cross section In this figure the approximate level
        of the water surface when there are no waves and the chamber is
        in its equilibrium position is shown by the dashed line.
        Referring to this figure, the wave powered hydraulic ram
        comprises a partially immersed hollow chamber 1, closed on all
        sides and at the top but open to the sea at the bottom, a hole 2
        with float valve 3, and one or more exit holes 6 furnished with
        non-return valves 7 connecting to the pressure vessel 8 which
        contains water and air under pressure. The hole 2 is more or
        less level with the undisturbed water level shown by the dashed
        line in Figure 1. The action of the waves causes the water
        surface 9 to rise and fall with respect to the chamber 1, while
        the air trapped above the water can flow in and out of the
        chamber through the hole 2 When the water surface in its upward
        motion approaches the top of the chamber, the float valve 3
        rises and suddenly closes off the hole 2.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The result is a sudden rise in
        pressure at the top of the chamber and following the well-known
        principles of the hydraulic ram some water is forced through the
        exit hole or holes 6 via the non- return valve or valves 7 into
        the pressure vessel 8. From there it flows via pipe 10 which may
        be rigid or flexible to a distant elevated reservoir or further
        hydraulic accumulators (not illustrated).</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The high pressure water in the
        accumulator or reservoir can then be used to deliver useful
        energy according to the usual principles of hydraulic power.
        With advantage the chamber is furnished above the waterline with
        a small pocket 5. When the float valve closes as described
        above, the air trapped inside said pocket 5 acts as a
        compressible cushion and limits the peak pressure inside the
        chamber At the top of the chamber 1 of the hydraulic ram, there
        may be a multiplicity of holes 2 each furnished with a float
        valve 3, and operating as described above Another embodiment of
        the wave powered hydraulic ram is illustrated in plan and
        elevation in Figure 2 which shows a floating buoy destined to
        extract energy from the waves. The upper part of Figure 2 shows
        a plan view of the buoy seen from above The lower part of this
        figure shows the buoy in elevation with a cut-away part shown in
        section Referring to this figure, the buoy comprises a
        cylindrical hull 11 closed on all sides, surrounded by a skirt
        12 which may be vertical or tapered and inclined. The space
        between the body of the buoy 11 and the skirt 12 is closed at
        the top by the bulkhead 15 and divided into a multiplicity of
        separate spaces 16 by the vertical partitions 13. These spaces
        serve as chambers for a multiplicity of hydraulic rams which
        pump water under pressure through the multiplicity of pipes 14
        into the pressure vessel 8 located near the centre of the buoy.
        Water under pressure leaves the pressure vessel via pipe 10 to a
        useful output as described above. The hull can be of any shape
        and the chambers surrounding it can be of any shape.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">With advantage the buoy can be
        furnished with a superstructure in the form of a lattice frame
        (not illustrated) which supports elevated ballast means,
        preferably water in an elevated tank, and further supports
        auxiliary floats (not illustrated) located laterally above the
        waterline. With advantage the buoy may further comprises one or
        more submerged closed hollow vessels (not illustrated) fixed
        underneath the buoy some distance below the waterline. The
        functions of the elevated ballast means, the auxiliary floats
        and the submerged hollow vessel have been described above.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The operation of each of the
        multiplicity of hydraulic rams is as follows. The buoy floats on
        the sea with the undisturbed water surface approximately level
        with the bulkhead 15 Under the action of the waves the buoy
        heaves, pitches and rolls with the result that the water surface
        9 inside the chamber 16 between the skirt 12 and the buoy 11
        rises and falls freely relative to the bulkhead 15 while air
        flows in and out of the said chamber through the hole 2. When
        the surface 9 of the water inside the chamber 16 reaches the
        bulkhead, the float valve 3 closes, blocking the hole 2 and
        forcing the rising water to flow under pressure through the
        non-return valve 7 via the pipe 14 into the pressure vessel 8.
        The flexible pipe 10 is connected to the pressure vessel and
        leads the water under pressure to the shore or to a neighbouring
        platform where it is used to do useful work. Alternatively the
        water under pressure may drive a Pelton wheel or other form of
        turbine mounted on the buoy, so as to generate electricity which
        is then conducted ashore or to a neighbouring platform by
        flexible cables.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">It will be appreciated that the
        vertical partitions 13 serve to separate the multiplicity of
        hydraulic rams from each other so that each responds
        independently to the local motion of the water relative to the
        individual bulkheads 15. This enables the buoy to extract energy
        from its rolling or pitching motion, as well as from the
        vertical heaving of the system as a whole The vertical
        partitions may also serve as attachment points for the mooring
        cables 17.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The size of the chambers
        required for the hydraulic rams to capture a given amount of
        power may be calculated as follows. When the float valve closes,
        the total kinetic energy of the water in the chamber is
        transferred as hydraulic energy to the pressure vessel This
        happens once per wave cycle. In general the amplitude of motion
        of the buoy relative to the water surface will be Q times the
        wave amplitude and the cross section of the chamber at the lower
        end may be q times the cross section at the top. It is well
        known that the maximum capture width for a small floating body
        moving in heave is 1/k where k is the wave number (2 times pi
        divided by the wavelength) of the waves in the sea, see
        reference 1. If the body moves in pitch the capture width can be
        2/k and if it moves in heave and pitch together the capture
        width can be 3/k. It follows from these considerations that to
        obtain a capture width of n/k, the total volume V of water in
        all the chambers should be V- A3 - 8r2qQ2 where X is the
        wavelength in the sea. For a buoy of diameter 20 m with typical
        values of the parameters, ?. = 150 m, Q=5, q 3, n = 3, this
        implies that the volume of water to be trapped between the buoy
        10 and the skirt 12 is fairly large but not unreasonable. Power
        could then be captured over an effective frontage (capture
        width) of for example 75 m.</span><br style="font-weight:

      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">A multiplicity of hydraulic
        rams generally as described above and illustrated by way of
        example in Figures 1 and 2 may be mounted more or less at sea
        level on any structure fixed to the shore or sea bed and a
        multiplicity of hydraulic rams may feed water under pressure
        into a single hydraulic accumulator. A multiplicity of hydraulic
        rams with chambers of any shape generally as described above and
        illustrated by way of example in Figures 1 and 2 may be mounted
        more or less at sea level at the front, side or back of a
        floating structure of any shape and may be used to extract
        energy from the movement of the waves and the movement of the
        structure.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Another embodiment of the wave
        powered hydraulic ram will now be described with reference to
        Figure 3 which shows a resonant oscillator in the form of a
        catamaran furnished with hydraulic rams destined to extract
        power from the sea. The upper part of this figure shows the
        oscillator in plan view as seen from above, with the hydraulic
        rams shown in section. The lower part of this figure shows the
        oscillator in elevation as seen from the side, with the
        hydraulic rams shown in section. Referring to Figure 3, this
        embodiment comprises a floating structure with two or more long
        parallel hulls 20 which may be of any shape connected by a
        superstructure in the form of a lattice frame 21. The said
        superstructure supports two or more auxiliary floats 22 of any
        shape, located above the waterline symmetrically on either side
        of the hulls. The said auxiliary floats may with advantage
        contain ballast of any kind, in particular water ballast. To
        locate the ballast the said floats may with advantage be divided
        by internal vertical transverse partitions (not illustrated).
        The superstructure further supports centrally one or more
        elevated containers or reservoirs 24 which may be filled with
        ballast of any kind, and in particular with water ballast. To
        locate the ballast the said elevated container 24 may with
        advantage be divided by internal vertical transverse partitions
        (not illustrated). This embodiment may with advantage further
        comprise one or more closed hollow vessels 26 located centrally
        below the waterline by a lattice frame attached to the said
        superstructure Depending on the state of the waves, said hollow
        vessel may be empty or may contain ballast, in particular water
        ballast, pumped as occasion demands from the auxiliary floats 22
        or from the elevated container 24. To locate the ballast the
        said closed hollow vessel may with advantage be divided
        longitudinally by internal vertical transverse partitions (not
        illustrated). This embodiment further comprises a multiplicity
        of hydraulic rams 28, substantially as described above and
        illustrated in figures 1 and 2, attached to the hulls 20. Each
        hydraulic ram is furnished with a float valve 29 comprising for
        example without limitation a cylinder of elastomeric material
        which seats into a tapered rectangular slot 30. The chamber 28
        of each hydraulic ram is connected via a non-return valve (not
        illustrated) to a pressure vessel 31 containing air and water
        under pressure. The pressure vessels may with advantage be
        connected together by pipes (not illustrated) and may be
        connected to a further central hydraulic accumulator (not
        illustrated). A flexible pipe (not illustrated) is connected to
        the pressure vessels and leads the water under pressure to the
        shore or to a neighbouring platform where it is used to do
        useful work. Alternatively the water under pressure may drive a
        Pelton wheel or other form of turbine mounted on the resonant
        oscillator, so as to generate electricity which is then
        conducted ashore or to a neighbouring platform by flexible
        cables.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The operation of the said
        resonant oscillator furnished with hydraulic rams is as follows.
        The structure is oriented so that the waves approach laterally
        from the left or right in Figure 3 The ballast in the elevated
        container 24 and the auxiliary floats 22 is adjusted, preferable
        by pumping water, so that the roll period of the structure is
        the same as the prevailing wave period in the sea.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">The structure then rolls with a
        large amplitude driving the hydraulic rams 28 up and down in the
        water. The rising and falling of the water surface engendered by
        the waves increases the relative motion of the water surface
        relative to the rams. Substantially as described above, it then
        results that the rams pump water under pressure into the
        pressure vessels 31 and this water is led off to do useful work
        according to the art. In large waves the oscillator may roll
        with large amplitude with the effect that the auxiliary floats
        22 enter the water and prevent the structure from capsizing. In
        storms it is desirable to move ballast from the elevated
        container 24 and from the auxiliary floats 22 into the said
        closed hollow vessels 26, preferably by pumping water from one
        to the other, with the effect that the structure becomes more
        stable and does not capsize.</span><br style="font-weight:
        normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Hydraulic rams operated by
        waves are particularly well adapted to supplying high pressure
        sea water for desalination plants. They may also be used in
        fresh water lakes to pump water for irrigation References [1]
