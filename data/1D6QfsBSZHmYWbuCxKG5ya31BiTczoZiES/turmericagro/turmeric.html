      <big> </big> Mother rhizomes are used for planting and well
      developed healthy and disease free rhizomes are to be selected.
      Small pits are made with a hand hoe in the beds in rows with
      spacing of 25 cm x 30 cm and covered with soil or dry powdered
      cattle manure. The optimum spacing in furrows and ridges is
      between 45-60 cm between the rows and 25 cm between the plants. A
      seed rate of 2,500 kg of rhizomes is required for planting one
      hectare of turmeric. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Climatic Condition for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      Turmeric is a tropical herb and is grown in both tropics and
      subtropics. It will grow luxuriantly in shade if not too dense,
      but it produces larger and better rhizomes in the open ground
      exposed to the sun. Turmeric require humid climate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Suitable Soil for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      Soils for Turmeric cultivation should be rich and friable. Soils
      with a little higher sand content (Loams and sandy loams) are well
      suited. It is grown in different types of soils from light black,
      sandy loam and red soils to clay loams. It grows on light black,
      ashy loam and red soils to stiff loams in irrigated and rain fed
      areas. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Land Preparation for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      In Turmeric Farming ,while preparing the land, minimum tillage
      operations may be adopted. Beds of 15 cm height,1 m width and of
      convenient length may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing
      between beds. In the case of the irrigated crop, ridges and
      furrows are prepared and the rhizomes are planted in shallow pits
      on the top of the ridges. Spacing generally adopted is 45-60 cm
      between the ridges and 15-20 cm between the plants. Solarisation
      of beds is beneficial in checking the multiplication of pests and
      diseases causing organisms. The polythene sheets used for soil
      solarisation should be kept away safely after the work is
      completed. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Plantation Time for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      Planting season varies with the area of cultivation and variety.
      Planting is done during May-June or July- August in different
      tracts. Turmeric can be rotated with crops such as Finger millet,
      Rice and Sugarcane. It is rarely cultivated in pure stand, but is
      usually grown mixed with crops like Castor, Maize , and Finger
      millet, Onions, Brinjal and Tomato . <br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Planting material in Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      In Turmeric Farming, carefully preserved seed rhizomes free from
      pests and diseases which are collected from organically cultivated
      farms should be used for planting. However, to begin with seed
      material from high yielding local varieties may be used in the
      absence of organically produced seeds. For sowing, both the mother
      rhizomes and fingers are used. The fingers are cut into 4 - 5 cm
      long pieces, and the mother rhizomes are planted as such or split
      into two; each having at least one sound bud. The seed is
      sometimes sprouted under moist straw before sowing. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Irrigation or water supply for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      For turmeric number of irrigations will depend upon the soil and
      climatic conditions. Depending upon the soils and rainfall 15 to
      25 irrigations are given in medium heavy soils and in case of
      light textured red soils 35-40 irrigations are needed. <br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Crop Rotation for Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
      <br>
      Turmeric is grown in rotation with sugar cane, chilli, onion,
      garlic, elephant foot yam, vegetables, pulses, wheat , ragi and
      maize. It is cultivated as a subsidiary crop to ginger <http:
        agrifarming.in="" tag="" ginger=""> in some areas and in other
        areas with chilli and quick-growing vegetables. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Manures and Fertilization in Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
        <br>
        Mostly for good crop and maximum output the farmers are using
        natural fertilizers, animal dungs, and avoid using chemicals or
        other harmful pesticides.Turmeric needs heavy manuring.
        Application of well rotten cow dung or compost from own farm
        @2-3 tonne /acre may be given as basal dose while planting
        rhizomes in the pits. In addition, application of neem cake @
        0.8 tonnes/ acre is also desirable. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Pests and Disease Control in Turmeric Farming :</b><br>
        <br>
        If shoot borer incidence is noticed, such shoots may be cut open
        and larve picked out and destroyed. If necessary neem oil 0.5%
        may be sprayed at fortnightly intervals. <br>
        <br>
        No major disease is noticed in turmeric. Leaf spot and leaf
        blotch can be controlled by restricted use of Bordeaux mixture
        1%. Application of Trichoderma at the time of planting can check
        the incidence of rhizome rot. <br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Harvesting Turmeric :</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric harvesting -- Usually harvesting extends from January
        to March-April. Early varieties mature in 7-8 months and medium
        varieties in 8-9 months. The crop is ready for harvesting when
        the leaves turn yellow and start drying up. At the time of
        maturity, leaves are cut close to the ground, the land is
        ploughed and rhizomes are gathered by hand-picking or the clumps
        are carefully lifted with a spade. The picked rhizomes are
        collected and cleaned. The mother and finger rhizomes are
        separated before curing. Harvesting is done by either manually
        or by mechanical. <br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Curing, Boiling &amp; Drying of Turmeric Fingers :</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric finger boiling Curing involves boiling of fresh
        rhizomes in water and drying in the sun. The objective of
        boiling is to destroy the viability of the fresh rhizomes and to
        obviate the raw odor, to reduce the drying time, to gelatinize
        the starch for hardening the rhizomes and give a more uniform
        colored product and an even distribution of color in the
        rhizome. In the traditional methods, the cleaned rhizomes are
        boiled in copper or galvanized iron or earthen vessels, with
        water just enough to soak them. Boiling process should be done
        over a slow fire until they softened. Boiling is stopped when
        froth comes out and white fumes appear giving out a typical odor
        when properly cooked, the rhizomes would be soft and yield when
        pressed between fingers. The boiling lasts for 45 to 60 minutes
        when the rhizomes are soft. Over cooking spoils the color of
        final product while under cooking renders the dried product
        brittle. Turmeric drying Turmeric drying The cooking of turmeric
        is to be done within two or three days after harvesting. The
        mother rhizomes and the fingers are generally cured
        separately.The cooked fingers are dried in the sun by spreading
        5 to 7 cm thick layers on bamboo mat or drying floor. A thinner
        layer is not desirable, as the colour of the dried product may
        be adversely affected. It may take 10 to 15 days for the
        rhizomes to become completely dry. The yield of the dry product
        varies from 20 to 30 percent depending upon the variety and the
        location where the crop is grown. <br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Preservation of Turmeric seed :</b><br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes for seed are generally heaped under the shade of trees
        or in well-ventilated sheds and covered with turmeric leaves.
        Sometimes, the heap is plastered over with earth mixed with cow
        dung. The seed rhizomes can also be stored in pits with sawdust.
        The pits can be covered with wooden planks with one or two holes
        for aeration. 5.13 <br>

        <br>
        <b>COMMON NAMES:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Commonly known as turmeric, turmeric aVnd curcumin.<br>
        <br>
        <b>LATIN NAME:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Curcumae Longae<br>
        <br>
        <b>HISTORY:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>This root is highly revered in Ayurvedic medicine, as well
        as general South Asian cuisine. Native to Southern Asia, the
        name curcuma comes from the Arabic word "kurkum", or "saffron",
        and is an indication of its relationship to the vibrant orange
        color of both herbs. Since Biblical times, turmeric has been
        used to spice foods, make perfume and color clothing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HERBAL PROPERTIES AND USES:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Turmeric has a vast variety of medicinal uses. In
        traditional medicine, it used to treat liver ailments, ulcers,
        parasitic infections, skin problems, bruises, joint pain and
        inflammation, sprains, strains, cold and flu symptoms, as well
        as a general digestive aid. Scientific research shows that
        turmeric aids in breaking down liver toxins, strengthens the
        functioning of the gallbladder, aids in lipid (fat)
        metabolizing, and stops blood clotting. In general, it is a good
        anti-inflammatory agent. What is more, recent studies show that
        turmeric may help prevent colon, breast, lung and other forms of
        cancers.<br>

        </b>Well drained, fertile soil<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUN REQUIREMENTS:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Turmeric prefers warm direct or indirect sun.<br>
        <br>
        <b>GROWING ZONES:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Turmeric is a tropical plant that does well when given
        abundant heat and moisture. This root will grow well in any
        region that has a temperate summer, and will die in the winter.
        USDA Zones 7b-10b<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLANTING TIME:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Unless you live in the tropics, where it can be planted
        anytime, plant in late spring. Fresh roots can be planted
        directly into soil.<br>
        <br>
        <b>POLLINATION:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>The dried rhizome of turmeric can be used in subsequent
        plantings.<br>
        <br>
        <b>FLOWERING/SEEDING TIME:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Turmeric shoots appear in about two months from planting.
        The rhizomes can usually be harvested from seven to ten months
        after planting, when leaves and stems become dry.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HARVESTING:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>When the plant has changed from abundant green to dry, dig
        up the entire plant, ensuring that you dig up the entire root
        (as this is the part that is used medicinally). Plan to harvest
        your turmeric root at the end of the summer growing season.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DRYING METHODS / YIELD:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Drying turmeric is a fairly complicated process. First you
        must boil the roots, then leave in the sun to dry, or use a
        dehydrator. The plant may also be used fresh and raw in a grated
        form.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLANT YIELD:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Approximately 700 grams of fresh root yields per plant.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PRESERVATION / PACKAGING METHODS:</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Store fresh roots in the refrigerator, as you would fresh
        ginger. Dried, the root can be made into a powder and stored in

            WHY ARE FARMERS SWITCHING TO STI?<br>
            Turmeric cultivation is simplified in accordance with basic
            principles of SRI<br>
            Production of healthier seedlings<br>
            Maintenance and enhancement of the long-term fertility of
            the soil, and savings of water and electricity<br>

            Improvement in the social and economical status of the
            farming community<br>
            <br>
            CULTIVATION PRACTICES INVOLVED<br>
            <br>
            Land preparation:<br>
            <br>
            While preparing the nursery for turmeric production, at the
            same time we cultivate a green manure crop (Daincha) in the
            main field. While preparing the land, the usual tillage
            operation may be adopted. Farmyard manure (FYM), neem cake,
            basal fertilizers, and micronutrients are applied to the
            soil as recommended. Beds should be prepared – 15 cm in
            height and 120 cm in width, and a convenient length – with
            at least 30cm spacing between the beds. In the case of
            irrigated crops, ridges and furrows are prepared, and the
            seedlings are planted on the top of the bed. Spacing
            generally adopted is 40 cm between rows and 30 cm between
            plants, compared with 30 cm by 30 cm with standard methods.<br>
            <br>
            Planting materials:<br>
            <br>
            With this new methodology, we use sections of seed rhizomes
            weighing 20 to 35 grams each. For an acre, 180 kg of seed
            rhizomes are needed (usually there are 30 to 50 rhizomes per
            kg, with single rhizomes having a length of 7 to 9 cm, and a
            perimeter of 7 to 8 cm ). Single rhizomes are cut into 3 to
            4 pieces, each having 2 rings with a bulged portion. In a
            single rhizome, 8 to 10 rings are seen. We need about 22,000
            pieces per acre (55,000 per ha).<br>
            <br>
            Seed Treatment:<br>
            <br>
            Fungicide (any type) - 2 gms / one liter of water<br>
            Insecticide (any type) - 2 mls / one liter of water<br>
            Urea - 5 gms / one liter of water<br>
            The fungicide used is organic, so no inorganic fungicides
            are used.<br>
            The above materials are soaked in water for half an hour,
            after which they are kept for warming in air-tight gunny
            bags for eight days in a protected area. This should
            initiate the germination, which starts earlier in the bulged
            portions that protrude outward.<br>
            <br>
            Pro-Tray Filling:<br>
            <br>
            Farmers fill the trays in which seedlings are to be raised
            with coco-peat, vermi-compost, some Effective Microorganisms
            (EM) solution, Trichoderma viridae, Pseudomonas, and a
            mixer. Then the trays are filled with partially-germinated
            seed, and the remaining space in the pits is filled with the
            above mixer of coco peat. Then the trays are kept under a
            shade net for 40 to 45 days. The usual daily maintenance
            activities are taken to ensure proper growth.<br>
            <br>
            Transplantation:<br>
            <br>
            After 40 days, we plant the seedlings in the main field with
            the support of drip irrigation and fertigation. Spacing
            between rows for STI is 40 cm between rows, and 30 cm
            between plants, while conventional spacing is 30 cm by 30
            cm, as noted above. We have to protect the crop properly and
            carefully from pests and diseases through organic and
            inorganic methods. The materials used are listed in the
            comparative cost accounting below.<br>
            <br>
            YIELD:<br>
            <br>
            From a well-maintained crop, we get nearly 25 quintals
            (dried weight) per acre. This is 12.5 tons per acre, which
            is 25% more than what is achieved with conventional
            production methods, 10.0 tons per acre.<br>
            <br>
            WHAT ARE THE CONNECTIONS WITH SRI?<br>
            <br>
            These practices were inspired by the experiences that
            Thambal farmers have had with using the System of Rice
            Intensification (SRI). Turmeric is a very different plant
            from rice, but some of the basic ideas for SRI turn out to
            be relevant for turmeric even though it is a rhizome-based
            crop, and not a grain.<br>
            <br>
            1. With STI, the planting material is reduced drastically,
            as with SRI -- by more than 80%.<br>
            <br>
            2. Spacing between the plants is also reduced, although not
            as much as with SRI; the plant-to-plant distance for STI is
            one-third greater than in conventional turmeric cultivation.<br>
            <br>
            3. Fertilization is not much different; but organic
            fertilization is increased with green manure (dhaincha)
            applied to the crop, and the materials used for crop
            protection are all organic.<br>
            <br>
            4. With STI, irrigation applications are reduced by
            two-thirds, which is effective because of the plants'
            greater root growth and the better structure of the soil
            given its more organic management.<br>
            <br>
            5. STI requires more careful management as with SRI, but
            costs are reduced and the results are very worthwhile.<br>
            <br>
            COST COMPARISON OF CONVENTIONAL vs. STI<br>
            <br>
            The main factor driving or limiting farmers' turmeric
            cultivation is their cost of cultivation. The crop generally
            requires more cost and more care than others. In the
            previous two years, farmers got more income because of
            higher price; but this year they face heavy losses because
            of lower prices. Still, STI reduces the loss for farmers as
            yield is more with 20% less cost. The significant
            improvement in farmers' net income from turmeric production
            with STI methods is seen below.<br>

        BOTANICAL NAME: Curcuma domestica syn. Curcuma longa<br>
        COMMON NAMES:&nbsp; turmeric; Indian saffron; ukon; nghe;
        wong-keong<br>
        FAMILY:&nbsp; Zingiberaceae, the ginger family<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLANT DESCRIPTION</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is native to the monsoon forests of south east Asia. It
        is a perennial herb to 1m tall with underground rhizomes. It
        produces tall, very beautiful, white flower spikes, if clumps
        are left undisturbed for a year. The flower is so attractive
        that it is worth growing for this alone. It requires a
        well-drained soil, frost-free climate and 1000 to 2000mm of rain
        annually or supplementary irrigation. It thrives best on loamy
        or alluvial fertile soils and cannot stand waterlogging. Heavy
        shade will reduce the yield but light shade is beneficial.<br>
        <br>
        <b>USES</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Ground turmeric comprises 25% of curry powder and is used to
        give it a yellow colour. The harvested rhizomes are boiled and
        sun-dried for 7-8 days but can be used fresh. It is also used as
        a yellow food dye, replacing tetrazine. Leaves wrapped around
        fish flavour it during cooking. In Indonesia, the young shoots
        and rhizome tips are eaten raw.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLANTING DETAILS</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Plant turmeric in September or October, into a warm soil.
        The rhizomes should be planted 5-7 cm deep. It is often planted
        on ridges, usually about 30-45 cm apart and with 15-30 cm
        between plants. The crop is planted by setts (small rhizomes)
        with one or two buds. Approximately 1,700 kg of setts are
        required to one hectare. Expected yield would be 13 to 35
        tonnes/ha of fresh turmeric. In cooler areas of Australia
        turmeric can be grown in glasshouses. Like all herbaceous
        perennials clumps of turmeric need to be broken up and fresh
        pieces planted every 3 to 4 years.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HARVEST</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Rhizomes are harvested 9 to 10 months after planting, the lower
        leaves turning yellow or stems drying and falling over are
        indications of maturity. It is possible for the home gardener to
        just dig carefully at the side of a clump and remove rhizomes as
        needed rather than harvesting the whole clump...<br>

        Botanical Name: Curcuma longa<br>
        Family: Zingiberaceae<br>
        Origin: South East Asian region (India)<br>
        <br>
        <b>Uses of Turmeric:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Used as a conditioner.<br>
        <br>
        2. Useful as a dye wife varied uses in drug and cosmetic
        industries.<br>
        <br>
        3. Used medicinally fof external application and consumed as a
        stimulant.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Area and Production:</b><br>
        <br>
        India is the largest producer of turmeric with a annual
        production of 3.49 lakh tones (1991-92) and 4.35 lakh tones
        (96-97). The turmeric export-stands at 18.95 thousand, tones
        (92-93) and 25 M thousand tones (96-97). The major producing
        states are Tamil Nadu, A. P. and Orissa.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Soil:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Different kinds of soils such as sandy loam to clay loam or
        alluvial soils are suitable. Well-drained loamy soils are the
        best.<br>
        <br>
        2. Soil should be rich in organic matter and uniform in texture.<br>
        <br>
        3. Rich loamy soils having natural drainage and irrigation
        facilities are the best<br>
        <br>
        4. Turmeric cannot withstand water stagnation or alkalinity.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Climate:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Tropical crop, requiring warm and humid climate.<br>
        <br>
        2. Temperature range-246C to 28°C.<br>
        <br>
        3. Growth ceases when, temperature falls below 20°C, and hence
        early-planted turmeric gives good yield.<br>
        <br>
        4. Thrives well in localities with annual rainfall from 70 - 225
        cm.<br>
        <br>
        5. Can be grown at an altitude of 1200 m.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cultivation of Turmeric:</b><br>
        <br>
        I) Seed Material:<br>
        a. Seed Selection:<br>
        <br>
        1. Seed of turmeric consists of rhizomes.<br>
        <br>
        2. Both mother and finger rhizomes are used.<br>
        <br>
        3. The fingers are cut into pieces, each 4-5 cm long with 1-2
        buds. Mother rhizomes are planted as such or split into two,
        each having one sound bud.<br>
        <br>
        4. Mother rhizomes are preferred since they give 50% more yields
        than the finger rhizome and also give good growth.<br>
        <br>
        5. Large sized, plumy and healthy mother rhizomes at least 100 g
        in weight should be used.<br>
        <br>
        <b>b. Seed Rate:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Varies according to type of planting material, spacing and
        weight of rhizomes.<br>
        <br>
        2. Mother rhizomes: 2000-2500 kg/ha.<br>
        <br>
        3. Finger rhizomes: 1500-2000 kg/ha.<br>
        <br>
        4. For Maharashtra: 2250 kg/ha.<br>
        <br>
        5. As an intercrop in fruit garden: 400 - 500 kg/ha.<br>
        <br>
        <b>c. Seed Treatment:</b><br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes are treated with 50 Lindane powder and Bavistine (2
        g/1) by dipping for 15-20 minutes for prevention of diseases and
        rhizomes fly during early period.<br>
        <br>
        <b>II) Preparation of Land:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Starts immediately after harvest of previous crop or
        with/onset of early rains in plains. .<br>
        <br>
        2. Land is ploughed 15-20 cm deep arid exposed to sun for one
        month. 2-3 crosswise harrowing are given.<br>
        <br>
        3. Temporary ridges are opened to prevent soil erosion on slopy
        lands.<br>
        <br>
        <b>III) Systems of Planting:</b><br>
        <br>
        1. Flat Beds: Used under rainfed conditions where soils are
        light. Flat beds 1 m in width and-of suitable length varying
        according to the slope of land are prepared.<br>
        <br>
        2. Ridges and Furrows: Under irrigated-conditions where the land
        is leveled or plain and soils are heavy, planting is clone on
        ridges and furrows, opened at 75 cm distance and haying 3-3.5 m
        length. Broad ridges should having 90 -100 cm width and 3 - 6 m
        length depending on the slope.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Planting of Ginger:</b><br>
        a) Season of Planting: May to July depending on tract. In
        Maharashtra, second forth night of May is the best time of
        planting rhizomes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Method of Planting:</b><br>
        <br>
        i)&nbsp; On Flat Beds: (25 x 2.5 cm) in each direction.<br>
        <br>
        ii) On ridges and furrows: 40-60 x 25 cm.<big> </big>Rhizomes
        are planted at l/3rd height of ridge on broad ridge.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Manuring and Fertilization:</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is a heavy feeder crop. In Maharashtra, on the basis of
        experiments conducted at Turmeric Research Station, Digraj

        type - 7 months.<br>
        <br>
        4. State: Turmeric is harvested when leaves start yellowing and
        ultimately the stem dries down. The plants are-cut close to the
        ground.<br>
        <br>
        5. The crop is irrigated lightly for easy digging.<br>
        <br>
        6. Harvesting consists of digging of underground clumps of
        rhizomes with Pick axe or digging fork. <br>
        <br>
        7. Fingers are separated from mother rhizomes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Yield:</b><br>
        <br>
        250-300 q/ha for fresh rhizomes. In Maharashtra the average
        yield is 225 g/ha. Cured Produce: 20-25 % of fresh rhizome by
        weight<br>
        <br>
        <b>Preservation of Seed: </b><br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes for seed are heaped in the shade of trees or in well
        ventilated sheds and covered with turmeric leaves. Sometimes the
        heap is plastered over with earth mixed with cow dung.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Quality of Finger:</b><br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <b>Turmeric Oil:</b><br>
        <br>
        A volatile oil is obtained by steam distillation of ground
        turmeric after 8-10 hours. The oil is pale yellow to orange
        yellow in colour. The aroma of oil is due to tumerone and
        artumerous.<br>
        <br>
        Turmeric oleoresin is obtained by solvent extraction method and
        is highly valued.<br>

        <div align="center"><big><b>How To Grow Turmeric</b><br>
          </big></div>
        <big> </big><b><br>
        </b><b>WHERE TO GROW</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric does best in a hot, humid environment. In general,
        turmeric is only recommended for hardiness zones 9 and warmer if
        growing outdoors. However, it can be grown over summer outdoors
        in colder zones if dug up and brought inside over winter or
        grown in containers year round.<br>
        <br>
        Plant turmeric somewhere where it will receive full sun or light
        shade. In areas with cooler summers, you should grow in full sun
        to have a better shot at a successful crop. In hotter areas, it
        will do well with a little afternoon shade.<br>
        <br>
        Even when growing turmeric outdoors, you may want to consider
        growing it in a container that can be moved indoors once
        temperatures drop. Containers will also help to keep the soil
        warm and moist, essential to maintaining the plant to maturity.
        Choose a container that is at least 12 inches deep and equally
        as wide.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHEN TO GROW</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric takes 8-10 months to fully mature. It is dormant over
        winter, even in tropical climates. In general, turmeric plants
        do not do well when temperatures drop below 65° F. Plant in the
        early fall in zones 9-11. Plant in late spring (well after
        frost) in northern grow zones.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SOIL</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Plant turmeric in rich, well-drained soil. It can grow in most
        any type of soil, but drainage will only help and thick, clay
        soils will make it more difficult to care for. Test the pH of
        the soil to make sure it is between 6.0 and 7.8.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLANTING</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric is grown from rhizomes (root cuttings) much like
        ginger, not from seed. In fact, turmeric does not propagate
        seeds. It can be a bit difficult to find sometimes. You can find
        turmeric root at Indian stores, specialty nurseries or online.
        Whole Foods usually carries it. Only plant healthy, firm
        rhizomes and avoid any that appear to be rotting or diseased.<br>
        <br>
        Plant small rhizomes or pieces with at least 1 or 2 buds (facing
        up) about 2 inches deep. Water and keep the soil moist but not
        soaking wet until they sprout. Transplant if necessary once the
        plants are at least 2 inches tall. Keep them spaced about 16
        inches apart. Thin if necessary to give them plenty of room to
        breath and flourish.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WATERING &amp; CARE</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric needs to be watered frequently. Keep in mind, it is
        normally a tropical plant. Frequent misting with a spray bottle
        can help, particularly when growing indoors. Keep the soil
        moist, particularly in hot, dry climates. Water less frequently
        in cooler climates and try to keep the soil from ever getting
        soggy.<br>
        <br>
        Turmeric will benefit from bi-monthly feedings of a good organic
        fertilizer or compost tea.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HARVESTING</b><br>
        <br>
        Harvest turmeric root 8-10 months after planting. While the
        leaves and stems are edible, most people harvest turmeric only
        for its roots. Most herbs can be harvested throughout the
        growing season, but turmeric root is best if harvested all at
        once when mature. Dig up the rhizomes and save a few pieces to
        plant for the following season. When planting in the spring in
        cooler climates, you can harvest before the first frost of the
        fall but will not yield much ginger. Best to bring the plants
        indoors for the winter and harvest in early spring.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OVERWINTER DORMANCY</b><br>
        <br>
        Tumeric is dormant over winter. In warmer climates, the roots
        can be left in the ground and will survive and sprout new
        flowers in the spring. In colder climates, you need to
        transplant to containers and/or move your turmeric indoors. If
        you live in an area with mild winters where freezing ground is
        only of small concern, you may be able to mulch over your
        turmeric for the winter to protect them until the spring. <br>
        In general, only growers in zones 7b-11 should leave turmeric
        outside over winter. The roots will survive as long as they
        don’t freeze.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TIPS &amp; ADVICE</b><br>
        <br>
        Use gloves when peeling turmeric root as they may stain your
        hands yellow.<br>
        <br>
        Boil turmeric for 45 minutes, peel and dry for about a week.
        Then grind into the fine yellow powder used in curries and other
        spices.<br>
        <br>
        Store roots in a cool, dark place until use.<br>
        <br>
        Aphids and mites by be attracted to turmeric, but most insects
        in the U.S. are not interested in the plant. Spray them off with
        a hose.<br>

        </b><br>
        <b>History</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric has been used in India for more than 5000 years now.
        Initially it was cultivated as a dye as its’ vivid yellow colour
        works brilliantly as a colouring agent. Then its highly
        developed uses were came to know and people started using it for
        cosmetic and beautification purposes and eventually as a
        medicine.&nbsp; Later it was became popular as a spice.
        Originating in India turmeric had reached China by 700 A.D, East
        Africa by 800 A.D and West Africa by 1200 A.D. Then it had begun
        to become popular all through the world. It is known that the
        Arab traders had carried turmeric with them to Europe in the
        13th centaury.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Products and Uses</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is available in the market as in a whole dried form or
        in a powdered form. It is also used as an ingredient in
        preparation of curry mixtures. Oils and oleoresins are extracted
        from turmeric which is mainly used as coloring and flavoring
        agent in the food industry. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is mainly used as a flavoring and coloring agent in the
        food industry. It is also used as a coloring in textiles and
        preparation of specific paints. In Ayurvedic and Chinese
        medicine turmeric is a common ingredient. In India turmeric is
        largely used as a disinfectant in day today life and in
        religious ceremonies.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Major Growing Areas</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is grown in wet and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka as
        a mono crop and an inter crop under coconut.&nbsp; Major growing
        districts are Kurunagala, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy and Matale
        districts.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Varieties</b><br>
        <br>
        Though there are number of locally grown varieties they are not
        specially identified. There are imported varieties namely,
        Gunter, Puna and Madurasi Majal. and they have been mixed with
        local varieties.<br>
        Soils and Climatic needs<br>
        <br>
        <b>Soil</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Many soil types are suitable. However well drained sandy loam
        soils rich with organic matter are the most suitable soil type.
        Ill drained rocky or clay type soils are not suitable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Climate</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Altitude: up to 1500 MSL<br>
        <br>
        Rain fall: For the successful growth annual rain fall should be
        1500mm or high. However turmeric can be grown in the dry zone
        under irrigation.<br>
        <br>
        Temperature: 20 ºC – 35º C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        p.H – 5.5 – 6.5<br>
        <br>
        Shade: Medium shade is most suitable. High shade declines the
        yield. Can grow successfully as an inter crop with coconut and
        banana.<br>
        <br>
        Season: Main season- March April<br>
        <br>
        Minor season - October-November - Crop establishment<br>
        <br>
        <b>Planting material:</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        There are two types of rhizomes as mother rhizomes and finger
        rhizomes. Matured finger rhizomes are the most suitable planting
        material. Piece of rhizome should be 40-50g in weight and be
        with 1-2 buds. <br>
        <br>
        Planting material should be disease free and selected from a
        high yielding cultivation. Before planting, rhizomes should be
        immersed in a fungicide for about 5 minutes to avoid fungal
        growth during planting.<br>
        <br>
        Planting material requirement is 2500kg/ha.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Field Planting</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric is planted in raised beds or ridges. Field should be
        ploughed up to 35-40cm in depth and tilling soil is done. Beds
        are 1m in width and length is vary with the space available.
        However when inter cropped with coconut width and length can be
        changed according to the available space. Height of the bed is
        about 15cm and drains, with 50cm in depth, should be prepared in
        between beds.<br>
        <br>
        Spacing – between rows – 30cm<br>
        between plants – 25cm<br>
        03 rows per bed<br>
        Planting depth - 5-7.5cm &nbsp;<br>
        Planting should be done after the rain. If no adequate moisture
        beds should be irrigated.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mulching</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        To protect moisture and to keep weeds under arrest mulching
        should be done immediately after planting. Straw, coir dust, dry
        leaves or coconut leaves are most suitable mulching material.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Fertilizer application</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        To add adequate Ca and Mg dolomite is mixed with the soil
        immediately after ploughing at the rate of 1-2 mt. /ha. To get a
        higher yield saw dust ash also added to the soil at the rate of
        3-4kg/sq, meter of the bed during land preparation period.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Fertilizer recommendation</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <div align="center"><img alt="" src="exportagri.jpg"
            height="223" width="642"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Fertilizer is applied after weeding and should be mixed with the
        soil. After that beds should be mulched. Fertilizer is applied
        with rain or should be irrigated after fertilizer
        application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        In addition glyricidia leaves can be added as an organic
        fertilizer and thereby can cut down the need of chemical
        fertilizer and to protect the soil moisture.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Weeding</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Weeding has to be done after one month of planting. The second
        weeding is done after three months of planting and the beds
        should be mulched again to protect the moisture. Cleaning drains
        and earthling up also done with the weeding.<br>
        <b><br>
          Crop Protection</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Diseases</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>Leaf scorching</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Caused by a fungus. Yellow patches appears first and then spread
        to the whole leaf.&nbsp; At the serious stage leaves look
        scorched. Agronomic practices and cultural methods are used as
        protection measures and if the problem is serious Macozeb-2 is
        sprayed.<br>
        <br>
        Other diseases in turmeric are Leaf blotch, leaf rot and Rhizome
        rot.<br>

        </b><br>
        Stem borer is the major pest attacks to turmeric cultivation.
        Adult moth lays eggs in leaf sheaths and caterpillar enters to
        the pseudo stem and damages the internal tissues of the plant.
        Initially plants become yellow then turn into brown and die.
        Dead heart symptom is the clear evidence to identify the
        presence of stem borer. Damaged plant parts have to be destroyed
        to control the spread and if the condition is serious
        recommended insecticide has to be sprayed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Leaf rolling caterpillars and scale insects are other minor pest
        attacks.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harvesting</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Harvesting is done after 8-10 months of planting. If planted in
        March-April Season turmeric is ready to be harvested by December
        – January. During that time plants become yellow in colour and
        start leaves drying. Harvesting is done with care not to damage
        rhizomes and attached soil clusters should be removed with a
        wooden stick.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Processing</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Mother and finger rhizomes should be separated, washed
        thoroughly and remove all stem parts. They should be left for
        about a day for wilting. Mother rhizomes should be cut into
        pieces. Rhizomes should be boiled well in a closed pot filled
        with ¾ of water. When boiled properly rhizomes become tender.
        Instead of water steam boiling can also be applied. Pressure
        cookers can also be used to boil a few kilo grams of turmeric.
        Boiled rhizomes should be left in-door for about a day and then
        put for sun drying. Drying in first three days is limited to 3-4
        hours and after that continues drying is must. Whole drying
        process requires 10-15 days. When dried properly, metallic sound
        can be heard. Dried rhizomes are rubbed on a rough surface to
        become them to bright yellow in color.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

        <div align="center"><big><b>Cultivation of Turmeric</b></big></div>
        <br>
        <b>Climate and soil</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric can be grown in diverse tropical conditions from sea
        level to 1500 m above sea level, at a temperature range of
        20-35oC with an annual rainfall of 1500 mm or more, under rain
        fed or irrigated conditions. Though it can be grown on different
        types of soils, it thrives best in well-drained sandy or clay
        loam soils with a pH range of 4.5-7.5 with good organic status.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Varieties</b><br>
        <br>
        A number of cultivars are available in the country and are known
        mostly by the name of locality where they are cultivated. Some
        of the popular cultivars are Duggirala, Tekurpeta,Sugandham,
        Amalapuram, Erode local, Alleppey, Moovattupuzha, and Lakadong.
        The improved varieties of turmeric are- Suvarna, Suguna,
        Sudarsana, Prabha, Prathibha, Krishna, Sugandham, Roma, Suroma,
        Ranga, Rasmi, Rajendra, Sonia, Alleppey, Supreme, Kedaram.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cultivation</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Preparation of land</b><br>
        <br>
        The land is prepared with the receipt of early monsoon
        showers.The soil is brought to a fine tilth by giving about four
        deep ploughing. Hydrated lime @ 500 kg/ha has to be applied for
        laterite soils and thoroughly ploughed. Immediately with the
        receipt of pre-monsoon showers, beds of 1.0 m width, 15 cm
        height and of convenient length are prepared with spacing of 50
        cm between beds. Planting is also done by forming ridges and
        furrows.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Seed material</b><br>
        <br>
        Whole or split mother and finger rhizomes are used for planting
        and well developed healthy and disease free rhizomes are to be
        selected. Small pits are made with a hand hoe on the beds with a<br>
        spacing of 25 cm x 30 cm. Pits are filled with well decomposed
        cattle manure or compost, seed rhizomes are placed over it then
        covered with soil. The optimum spacing in furrows and ridges is<br>
        45-60 cm between the rows and 25 cm between the plants. A seed
        rate of 2,500 kg of rhizomes is required for planting one
        hectare of turmeric.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Manuring and fertilizer application</b><br>
        <br>
        Farmyard manure (FYM) or compost @ 30-40 t/ha is applied by
        broadcasting and ploughed at the time of preparation of land or
        as basal dressing by spreading over the beds or in to the pits
        at<br>
        the time of planting. Zinc @ 5 kg/ha may also be applied at the
        time of planting and organic manures like oil cakes can also be
        applied @ 2 t/ha. In such case, the dosage of FYM can be
        reduced. Integrated application of compost (@ 2.5 t/ha) combined
        with FYM, biofertilizer (Azospirillum) and half recommended dose
        of NPK is also recommended.Fertilizers @ 60 kg N, 50 kg P2O5 and
        120 kg K2O per hectare are to be applied in split doses as given
        below.<br>

        <br>
        <b>Mulching</b><br>
        <br>
        The crop is to be mulched immediately after planting with green
        leaves @ 12-15 t/ha. Mulching may be repeated @ 7.5 t/ha at 45
        and 90 days after planting after weeding, application of<br>
        fertilizers and earthing up.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Weeding and irrigation</b><br>
        <br>
        Weeding has to be done thrice at 60, 90 and 120 days after
        planting depending upon weed intensity. In the case of irrigated
        crop, depending upon the weather and soil conditions, about 15<br>
        to 23 irrigation's are to be given in clayey soils and 40
        irrigation's in sandy loams.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mixed cropping</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric can be grown as an inter crop with with chillies,
        colocasia, onion, brinjal and cereals like maize, ragi, etc.<br>

        <b>Plant protection</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Diseases</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Leaf blotch</b>- <br>
        <br>
        Leaf blotch is caused by Taphrina maculans and appears as
        small,oval, rectangular or irregular brown spots on either side
        of the leaves which soon become dirty yellow or dark brown. The
        leaves also turn yellow. In severe cases the plants present a
        scorched appearance and the rhizome yield is reduced. The
        disease can be controlled by spraying mancozeb in the pr0portion
        of 3gm per litre of water or combination of Carbendazim and
        Mancozeb in the ratio of 3gm in 1 litre of water .<br>
        <b><br>
          Leaf spot</b>- <br>
        <br>
        Leaf spot is caused by Colletotrichum capsici and appears as
        brown spots of various sizes on the upper surface of the young
        leaves. The spots are irregular in shape and white or grey in
        the centre. Later, two or more spots may coalesce and form an
        irregular patch covering almost the whole leaf. The affected
        leaves eventually dry up. The rhizomes do not develop well. The
        disease can be controlled by spraying zineb at the rate of 3gm
        per litre of water or Copper Oxy Chloride in the ratio of 3.5gm
        per litre of water.<br>
        <b><br>
          Rhizome rot</b>-<br>
        <br>
        The disease is caused by Pythium graminicolum or
        P.aphanidermatum. The collar region of the pseudostem becomes
        soft and water soaked, resulting in collapse of the plant and
        decay of rhizomes. Treating the seed rhizomes with mancozeb
        50gms in 15 litres of water for 30 minutes prior to storage and
        at the time of sowing prevents the disease. When the disease is
        noticed in the field, the beds should be drenched with
        combination of carbendazim and mancozeb in the proportion of 3
        gm per litre of water.<br>
        <b><br>
          Nematode pests</b>- <br>
        <br>
        Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and burrowing nematode
        (Radopholus similis) are the two important nematodes causing
        damage to turmeric. Wherever nematode problems are common, use
        only healthy, nematode free planting material. Increasing the
        organic content of the soil also checks the multiplication of
        nematodes. Pochonia chlamydosporia can be applied to the beds at
        the time of sowing @20 g/bed (at 106 Cu/g) for management of
        nematode problems.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Insect pests</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Shoot borer</b>-<br>
        <br>
        The shoot borer is the most serious pest of turmeric. The larvae
        bore into pseudo stems and feed on internal tissues. The
        presence of a bore-hole on the pseudo stem through which frass
        is extruded and the withered central shoot is a characteristic
        symptom of pest infestation. The adult is a medium sized moth
        with a wingspan of about 20 mm; the wings are orange yellow with
        minute black spots. Fully-grown larvae are light brown with
        sparse hairs. Spraying malathion at the rate of 2.5ml per litre
        of water or Dichlorovos at the rate of 2 ml per litre of water
        at 21 day intervals during July to October is effective in
        controlling the pest infestation. The spraying has to be
        initiated when the first symptom of pest attack is seen on the
        inner most leaf.<br>
        <b><br>
          Rhizome scale</b>-<br>
        <br>
        The rhizome scale infests rhizomes in the field(at later stages
        of the crop) and in storage. Adult (female) scales are circular
        (about 1mm diameter) and light brown to grey and appear as
        encrustations on the rhizomes. They feed on sap and when the
        rhizomes are severely infested, they become shrivelled and
        desiccated affecting its germination. Treat seed material with
        quinalphos by dissolving 7.5ml in 10 litres of water (for 20-30
        minutes) before storage and also before sowing in case the
        infestation persists. Discard and do not store severely infested
        rhizomes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Organic Production</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Conversion plan</b><br>
        <br>
        For certified organic production, at least 18 months the crop
        should be under organic management i e only the second crop of
        turmeric can be sold as organic. The conversion period may be
        relaxed if the organic farm is being established on a land where
        chemicals were not previously used, provided sufficient proof of
        history of the area is available. It is desirable that organic
        method of production is followed in the entire farm; but in the
        case of large extent of area, the transition can be done in a
        phased manner for which a conversion plan has to be prepared.As
        a mixed crop it can also be grown or rotated with green
        manure/legumes crops or trap crops enabling effective nutrient
        built up and pest or disease control. When grown in a mixed
        cultivation system, it is essential that all the crops in the
        field are also subjected to organic methods of production.<br>
        <br>
        In order to avoid contamination of organically cultivated plots
        from neighboring non-organic farms, a suitable buffer zone with
        definite border is to be maintained. Crop grown on this
        isolation belt cannot be treated as organic. In sloppy lands
        adequate precaution should be taken to avoid the entry of run
        off water and chemical drift from the neighboring farms. Proper
        soil and water conservation measures by making conservation pits
        in the inter spaces of beds across the slope have to be followed
        to minimize the erosion and runoff. Water stagnation has to be<br>
        avoided in the low lying fields by taking deep trenches for
        drainage.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Management practices</b><br>
        <br>
        For organic production, traditional varieties adapted to the
        local soil and climatic conditions that are resistant or
        tolerant to diseases, pests and nematode infection should be
        used. All crop residues and farm wastes like green lop pings,
        crop residues, grasses, cow dung slurry, poultry droppings etc.
        available on the farm can be recycled through composting,
        including vermicomposting so that soil fertility is maintained
        at high level. No synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides or
        fungicides are allowed under organic system. Farmyard manure may
        be applied @ 40 t/ha along with vermi compost @ 5-10 t/ha and
        mulching with green leaves @ 12-15 t ha-1 at 45 days intervals.
        Based on soil test, application of lime/dolomite, rock phosphate
        and wood ash has to be done to get required quantity of
        phosphorus and potassium supplementation. When the deficient
        conditions of trace elements become yield limiting, restricted
        use of mineral/chemical sources of micro nutrients by soil
        application or foliar spray are allowed as per the limits of
        standard setting or certifying organizations.Further,
        supplementation of oil cakes like neem cake (2 t/ha), compost(5
        t/ha) and suitable microbial cultures of Azospirillum and
        phosphate solubilizing bacteria will improve the fertility and
        yield.<br>
        <br>
        Use of biopesticides, biocontrol agents, cultural and
        phytosanitary measures for the management of insect pests and
        diseases forms the main strategy under organic system. Spraying
        Neemgold in the ratio of 50 ml in 15 litres of water or neem oil
        50ml in15 litres during July-October (at 21 day intervals) is
        effective against the shoot borer.<br>
        <br>
        Selection of healthy rhizomes, soil solarization and
        incorporation of Trichoderma, seed treatment and soil
        application of biocontrol agents like Trichoderma or Pseudomonas
        multiplied in suitable carrier media such as coir pith compost,
        well rotten cow dung or quality neem cake may be done at the
        time of sowing and at regular intervals to keep the rhizome rot
        disease in check.To control other foliar diseases spraying of
        copper oxy chloride 3 gm in 1 litre of water. Application of
        quality neem cake mentioned earlier along with the bioagents
        Pochonia chlamydosporia will be useful to check the nematode
        population.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harvesting</b><br>
        <br>
        Depending upon the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest
        in 7-9 months after planting during January-March. Early
        varieties mature in 7-8 months, medium varieties in 8-9 months
        and late varieties after 9 months. The land is ploughed and the
        rhizomes are gathered by hand picking or the clumps are
        carefully lifted with a spade. The harvested rhizomes are
        cleared of mud and other extraneous matter adhering to them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Processing</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Curing</b><br>
        <br>
        Fresh turmeric is cured for obtaining dry turmeric. The fingers
        are separated from mother rhizomes. Mother rhizomes are usually
        kept as seed material. Curing involves boiling of fresh
        rhizomesin water and drying in the sun.In the traditional method
        of curing, the cleaned rhizomes are boiled in water just enough
        to immerse them. Boiling is stopped when froth comes out and
        white fumes appear giving out a typical odour. The boiling
        should last for 45-60 minutes when the rhizomes turn soft. The
        stage at which boiling is stopped largely influences the colour
        and aroma of the final product. Over cooking spoils the colour
        of the final product while under-cooking renders the dried
        product brittle.<br>
        <br>
        In the improved scientific method of curing, the cleaned fingers
        (approximately 50 kg) are taken in a perforated trough of 0.9 m
        x 0.5 m x 0.4 m size made of GI or MS sheet with extended
        parallel handle. The perforated trough containing the fingers is
        then immersed in a pan; 100 litres of water is poured into the
        trough so as to immerse the turmeric fingers. The whole mass is
        boiled till the fingers become soft. The cooked fingers are
        taken out of the pan by lif ting the trough and draining the
        water into the pan. The water used for boiling turmeric rhizomes
        can be used for curing fresh samples. The processing of turmeric
        is to be done 2 or 3days after harvesting. If there is delay in
        processing, the rhizomes should be stored under shade or covered
        with sawdust or coir dust.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Drying</b><br>
        <br>
        The cooked fingers are dried in the sun by spreading them in5-7
        cm thick layers on bamboo mats or drying floor. A thinner layer
        is not desirable, as the colour of the dried product may be
        adversely affected. During night time, the rhizomes should be
        heaped or covered with material which provides aeration. It may
        take 10-15 days for the rhizomes to become completely dry.<br>
        <br>
        Artificial drying, using cross-flow hot air at a maximum
        temperature of 60 degree centigrade also gives a satisfactory
        product. In the case of sliced turmeric, artificial drying has
        clear advantages in giving a brighter coloured product than sun
        drying which tends to undergo surface bleaching. The yield of
        the dry product varies from 10-30% depending upon the variety
        and the location where the crop is grown.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Polishing</b><br>
        <br>
        Dried turmeric has a poor appearance and a rough dull outer
        surface with scales and root bits. The appearance is improved by
        smoothening and polishing the outer surface by manual or
        mechanical rubbing.Manual polishing consists of rubbing the
        dried turmeric fingers on a hard surface. The improved method is
        by using a hand operated barrel or drum mounted on a central
        axis, the sides of which are made of expanded metal mesh. When
        the drum filled with turmeric is rotated, polishing is effected
        by abrasion of the surface against the mesh as well as by mutual
        rubbing against each other as they roll inside the drum.
        Turmeric is also polished in power operated drums. The yield of
        polished turmeric from the raw material varies from 15-25%.<br>

        The colour of the processed turmeric influences the price of the
        produce.For an attractive product, turmeric powder (mixed with
        little water) may be sprinkled during the last phase of
        polishing.<br>

        <b>Preservation of seed rhizomes</b><br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes for seed purpose are generally stored by heaping in
        well ventilated rooms and covered with turmeric leaves. The seed
        rhizomes can also be stored in pits with saw dust, sand along
        with leaves of Strychnos nuxvomica (kanjiram). The pits are to
        be covered with wooden planks with one or two openings for
        aeration. The rhizomes are to be dipped in quinalphos 7.5ml in
        10 litres of water solution for 15 minutes if scale infestations
        are observed and in mancozeb 35gm in 10 litres of water to avoid
        storage losses due to fungi...<br>

                      done at the time of planting with green leaves @
                      4-5 tonnes per acre. It is to be repeated again @
                      2 tonnes / acre at 50th day after planting. Cow
                      dung slurry may be poured on the bed after each
                      mulching to enhance microbial activity and

        Turmeric (Curcuma longa), the ancient and sacred spice of India
        is a major rhizomatous spice produced and exported from India.
        Turmeric is used as condiment, dye, drug and cosmetic in
        addition to its use in religious ceremonies. India is the

        rainfall of 1500 mm or more per annum, or under irrigated
        conditions. It is grown on different types of soils from light
        black, ashy loam and red soils clay loam's. However, it thrives
        the best in a well-drained sandy or clayey loam.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Varieties</b><br>
        <br>
        A number of varieties are available in the country and are known
        mostly by name of locality where they are cultivated. Popular
        varieties are Duggirala, Sugandham, etc., Among the clonal
        selections Suguna, Sudarshana and Suvama yielding 25-35
        tonnes/hectare and IISR prabha with a curcumin content of 6.52
        are important.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Preparation of land</b><br>
        <br>
        The land is prepared with the receipt of early monsoon in May.
        The soil is brought to a fine filth by giving about four deep
        ploughings. Weeds, stubbles, roots etc. are removed. Immediately
        with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers, beds of 1-1.5 m width,
        15 cm height and of convenient length are prepared with spacing
        of 50 cm between beds. Planting is also done by forming ridges
        and furrows.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Planting</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric can be planted during April-May with the receipt of
        premonsoon showers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Seed materials</b><br>
        <br>
        Whole or split mother rhizomes are used for planting. Well
        developed healthy and disease free rhizomes are to be selected.
        Rhizomes are treated with 0.3% Dithane M-45 and 0.5% Malathion
        for 30 minutes before sowing. Small pits are made with a hand
        hoe in the beds in rows with a spacing of 25 cm x 30 cm and
        covered with soil or dry powdered cattle manure. The optimum
        spacing in furrows and ridges is 45-60 cm between rows and 25 cm
        between plants. A seed rate of 2,500 Kg of rhizomes is required
        for planting one hectare.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Manuring</b><br>
        <br>
        Cattle manure or compost at the rate of 40 tonnes per hectare is
        applied by broadcasting and ploughing at the time of preparation
        of land or as basal dressing by spreading over the beds to cover
        the seed pits after planting. Fertilizers at the rate of 30 Kg
        N, 30 Kg P205 and 60 Kg K20 per hectare are to be applied in
        three splits . In areas low in major nutrient status fertilizer
        rate to be applied is @ 60 kg N, 50 kg P205 and 120 kg K20. The
        beds are to be earthed up, after each top dressing with the
        fertilizers<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mulching</b><br>
        <br>
        The crop is to be mulched immediately after planting with green
        leaves at the rate of 12-15 tonnes per hectare. It may be
        repeated for a second time after 50 days with the same quantity
        of green leaves after weeding and application of fertilizers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>After Cultivation and growing as intercrop</b><br>
        <br>
        Weeding may be done thrice at 60, 120 and 150 days after
        planting depending upon weed intensity. Turmeric can be raised
        as a mixed crop with chillies, colocasia, onion, brinjal and
        cereals like maize, ragi etc.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of irrigated crop, depending upon the weather and
        the soil conditions, about 15 to 20 irrigations, are to be given
        in clayey soils and 40 irrigations in sandy loams.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Plant Protection</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Insect Pests</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Shoot borer (Conogethes putictiferalis)</b><br>
        <br>
        The shoot borer is the most important pest of turmeric. The
        larvae bore into the pseudostems and feed on the growing shoot
        resulting in yellowing and drying of the infested shoots. The
        presence of bore hole on the pseudostem through which the frass
        is extruded and the withered central shoot are the symptoms of
        pest infestation. Adults are small moths with orange wings with
        minute black spots. Fully grown larvae are light brown.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Control </b>: Spraying of malathion 0.l% or monocrotophos
        0.05% or Dipel(0.3%) (Bacillus thuringiensis product) during
        July-October at 21 day intervals is effective against the pest.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Leaf roller (Udaspes folus)</b><br>
        <br>
        The larvae of the leaf roller cut and fold the leaves and remain
        within and feed on them. Adults are medium sized butter flies
        with brownish black wings with large white spots. Fully grown
        larvae are dark green.<br>
        <b><br>
          Control </b>: Spraying with carbaryl 0.1% may be undertaken
        in case the infestation is severe.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Rhizome scale (Aspidiella bartii)</b><br>
        <br>
        The rhizomes scales infest rhizome in the field and in storage.
        They feed on the plant sap and in the field in severe cases of
        infestation, the plants wither and dry. In storage the pest
        infestation results in shriveling of buds and rhizomes and may
        also affect the sprouting of rhizomes. The adult female scales
        are minute, circular and light brown to grey and appear as
        encrustations on the rhizomes.<br>
        <b><br>
          Control</b>: The pest can be controlled by discarding severely
        infested rhizomes and by dipping the seed rhizomes in quinalphos
        0.075% twice prior to storage and sowing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Diseases</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Leaf blotch</b><br>
        <br>
        The disease is caused by Tapbrina maculans. The disease appears
        as small, oval, rectangular or irregular brown spots on either
        side of the leaves, they soon become dirty yellow or dark brown.
        The leaves also turn yellow. The yield goes down considerably.
        in severe cases the plants present a scorched up appearance. The
        disease can be controlled by spraying the plants with 0.2%
        Dithane M-45.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Leaf spot (Colletotriclium capsici)</b><br>
        <br>
        The symptoms appear as brown spots of different sizes on the
        upper surface of the young leaves. The spots are oval, whitish
        or greyish in centre, Later two or more spots may coalesce and
        form an irregular patch covering almost the whole leaf. The
        affected leaves eventually dry up. The rhizomes do not develop
        well. The disease can be controlled by spraying the plants with
        0.3% Zineb or 1% Bordeaux mixture.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Rhizome rot:</b><br>
        <br>
        The disease is caused by Pythium graminicolum starting from the
        margins, the leaves get dried up. Collar region of the
        pseudostems becomes soft and water soaked, and the plant
        collapses. Dip the rhizomes in 0.3% Dithane M-45 solution for 30
        minutes prior to storage and at the time of sowing prevents the
        disease. When the disease is noticed in the field, the beds
        should be drenched with 0.3% Dithane M-45 or 0.3% cheshunt
        compound.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harvesting:</b><br>
        <br>
        Depending upon the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest
        in seven to nine months, Usually it extends from January-March.
        Early varieties mature in 7-8 months, medium varieties in 8-9
        months and late varieties after 9 months.<br>
        <br>
        Usually the land is ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by
        hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted with a spade.
        Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and other extraneous
        matter adhering to them. The average yield per hectare comes to
        20-25 tonnes of green turmeric.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Processing:</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Curing:</b><br>
        <br>
        Fingers are separated from mother rhizomes. Mother rhizomes are
        usually kept as seed material. The fresh turmeric is cured for
        obtaining dry turmeric. Curing involves boiling of fresh
        rhizomes in water and drying in the sun.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>The traditional method of curing:</b><br>
        <br>
        The cleaned rhizomes are boiled in copper or galvanized iron or
        earthen vessels, with water just enough to soak them. Boiling is
        stopped when froth comes out and white fumes appear jigging out
        a typical odor. <br>
        <br>
        The boiling lasts for 45-60 minutes when the rhizomes are soft.
        The stage at which boiling is stopped largely influences the
        colour and and aroma of the final product. Over cooking spoils
        the colour of the final product while undercooking renders the
        dried product brittle.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The improved scientific method of curing turmeric :</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b>The cleaned fingers/mother rhizomes are taken in perforated
        trough made of G1 or MS sheet with extended parallel handle. (A
        medium type trough of size 0.90 x 0.40 in can hold about 50 kg
        of raw turmeric). <br>
        <br>
        The perforated trough containing the raw turmeric are then
        immersed in a pan with water which can hold 3-4 toughs at the
        same time. Boil it till the fingers/mother rhizomes become soft.
        The cooked turmeric is taken out of the pan by lifting the
        trough and draining the water into pan itself. The same hot
        water in the pan can be used for boiling next set of raw
        turmeric, which are already filled in troughs. The cooking of
        turmeric is to be done within 2-3 days after harvest.<br>
        <br>
        The rhizomes may also be placed in baskets with perforated
        bottom and sides, and then dipped in covered tanks when the
        quantity is large or may be put directly into the vessels when
        the quantity is small. The mother rhizomes and the fingers are
        generally cured separately.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Drying :</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The cooked fingers are dried in the sun by spreading in 5-7 cm
        thick layers on bamboo mats or drying floor. A thinner layer is
        not desirable, as the colour of the dried product may be
        adversely affected. During night time, the material should be
        heaped or covered. It may take 1015 days for the rhizomes to
        become completely dry. Artificial drying, using cross-flow hot
        air at a maximum temperature of 60'C is also found to give a
        satisfactory product. In the case of sliced turmeric, artificial
        drying had clear advantages in giving brighter coloured product
        than sun drying which tends to suffer surface bleaching. The
        yield of the dry product varies from 20-30% depending upon the
        variety and the location where the crop is grown.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Polishing:</b><br>
        <br>
        Dried turmeric has a poor appearance and rough dull colour
        outside the surface with scales and root bits. The appearance is
        improved by smoothening and polishing the outer surface by
        manual or mechanical rubbing.<br>
        <br>
        Manual polishing consists of rubbing the dried turmeric fingers
        on a hard surface or trampling them under feet wrapped in gunny
        bags. The improved method is by using hand operated barrel or
        drum mounted on a central axis, the sides of which are made of
        expanded metal mesh. When the drum filled with turmeric is
        rotated, polishing is effected by abrasion of the surface
        against the mesh as well as by mutual rubbing against each other
        as they roll inside the drum. The turmeric is also polished in
        power-operated drums, The yield of polished turmeric from the
        raw material varies 12-25 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Colouring:</b><br>
        <br>
        The colour of the turmeric always attracts the buyers. In order
        to impart attractive yellow colour, turmeric suspension in water
        is added to the polishing drum in the last 10 minutes. When the
        rhizomes are uniformly coated with suspension, they may be dried
        in the sun.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Preservation of seed rhizomes:</b><br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes for seed purpose are generally stored after heaping
        under shade of tree or in well ventilated shade and covered with
        turmeric leaves. Some times the heap is plastered with earth
        mixed cow dung. The seed rhizomes can also be stored in pits
        with sawdust. The pits can be covered with wooden planks with
        one or two holes for aeration.<br>

            Averaged over two years, graded N rates applied with 120 kg
            K2O/ha raised turmeric yields from 16.2 to 19.8 t/ha (Table
            1). Similarly, incremental rates of K applied along with 90
            kg N/ha increased fresh rhizome yields from 16.5 to 19.3
            t/ha. Sufficient soil P prevented a significant response to
            P application. Application of 120-120-2-10 kg N-K2O-B-Zn/ha
            resulted in the highest average rhizome yield of 19.8 t/ha
            over two years. These rates could be considered necessary
            for a maximum economic yield (MEY). This MEY recommendation
            produced a 25 percent higher yield com- pared to the current
            state fertilizer recommendation. <br>

        <br>
        The economics analysis of organic and conventional turmeric
        cultivation have been examined and the under organic farming has
        been assessed with respect to important sustainability
        indicators such as conservation of soil, water, power and
        farmers economic well-being and livelihood security. The study
        is based on primary data for 2010-11 collected from 30 organic
        farming and 30 conventional sample households from the Erode
        district of Tamil Nadu. The organic farming sample households
        have been found younger and more educated having larger
        landholdings and better resources. The organic farming is labour
        intensive, but its cost of cultivation is lower due to saving on
        chemical fertilizers, irrigation, seeds and agrochemicals. The
        yield on organic farmer has been reported lower but it is more
        than compensated by the price premium received and yield and
        profit stability observed on the organic farming. In addition,
        the organic farming has been found superior in terms of economic
        well being and livelihood security of the farmer.<br>

            <br>
            A study was carried out at Ludhiana (Punjab) to evaluate the
            effect of planting method, plant density and planting
            material on growth, yield and quality of turmeric (Curcuma
            longa). The experiment consisted of two planting methods
            (flat and ridge), three plant densities (1,66,667; 1,11,111
            and 83,333 plants ha-1) and three types of planting material
            (mother, primary and secondary rhizomes). Fresh rhizome
            yield of 164.8 and 160.3 q ha-1 (pooled data) was produced
            in flat and ridge method of planting but the differences
            were non-significant. Closer plant spacing or higher plant
            density produced highest fresh, dry and processed turmeric
            yield and it decreased with decrease in plant density;
            whereas, number and weight of rhizomes increased with
            decrease in plant density. Use of mother rhizome as planting
            material resulted in better emergence (86.6% and 83.1%),
            taller plants (49.6 and 50.0 cm) with more number of leaves
            and leaf area index (4.4 and 3.8), more tillers plant-1 (2.7
            and 3.1), higher number (17.09 and 23.89) and weight (136.96
            and 227.66 g) of total rhizomes plant-1 as compared to use
            of primary and secondary fingers as planting material during
            2003-04 and 2004-05, respectively. Planting of mother
            rhizomes produced highest fresh (207.7 q ha-1), dry (46.0 q
            ha-1) and processed (44.1 q ha-1) turmeric yield and it
            decreased significantly with decrease in seed size. Curcumin
            content did not change due to different planting methods,
            plant densities and planting materials.<br>

        <big> </big><b><br>
        </b><b>Maintenance of buffer zone</b><br>
        <br>
        In order to cultivate turmeric organically a buffer zone of 25
        to 50 feet shall be maintained if the nighbouting farms are
        non-organic. The produce from this zone shall not be treated as
        organic. Turmeric being an annual crop, the conversion period
        required will be two years, Turmeric can be cultivated
        organically as an intercrop with other crops provided organic
        methods of cultivation is followed for all the companion crops.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Sources of planting material</b><br>
        <br>
        Carefully preserved seed rhizomes free from pests and diseases
        which are collected from organically cultivated farms should be
        used for planting. However, to begin with seed material from
        high yielding local varieties may be used in the absence of
        organically produced seeds. A seed rate of 2500 kg rhizomes is
        required for planting one hectare.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Preparation of land and planting</b><br>
        <br>
        While preparing the land, minimum tillage operations may be
        adopted. Beds of 15 cm height, 1 m width and of convenient
        length may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing between
        beds. Solarisation of such beds is beneficial in checking the
        multiplication of pests and diseases causing organisms. The
        polythene sheets used for soil solarisation should be kept away
        safely after the work is completed.<br>
        <br>
        At the time of planting apply 25 g powdered neem cake and mix
        well with the soil in each pit taken at a spacing of 20-25 cm
        within and between rows. Seed rhizomes may be put in shallow
        pits and covered with well rotten cattle manure or compost mixed
        with Trichoderma (10 g compost inoculated with Trichoderma).
        Turmeric can be planted during April-May with the receipt of pre
        monsoon showers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cultural practices</b><br>
        <br>
        Mulching the turmeric beds with green leaves is an essential
        operation to enhance germination of seed rhizomes and to prevent
        washing off of soil due to heavy rain. This also helps to add
        organic matter to the soil and conserve moisture during the
        later part of the cropping season. Judicious mix of leguminous
        leaves with high nitrogen content and leaves rich in phosphorous
        like acalypha weed and leaves rich in potassium like calatropis
        can be used according to availability. The first mulching is to
        be done at the time of planting with green leaves @ 10-12 tonnes
        per ha. It is to be repeated again @ 5 tonnes/ha at 50th day
        after planting. Cow dung slurry may be poured on the bed after
        each mulching to enhance microbial activity and nutrient
        availability. Weeding may be carried out depending on the
        intensity of weed growth. Such materials may be used for
        mulching. Proper drainage channels are to be provided in the
        inter-rows to drain off stagnant water.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Manuring</b><br>
        <br>
        Application of well rotten cow dung or own compost from own form
        @ 5-6 t/ha may be made as a basal dose while planting rhizomes
        in the pits. In addition, application of neem cake @ 2 tonnes/
        ha is also desirable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Plant protection</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Pests</b><br>
        <br>
        Regular field surveillance and adoption of phytosanitary
        measures are required for pest management. If shoot borer
        incidence is noticed, such shoots may be cut open and pick out
        larvae and destroy them. Spray neem oil 0.5% at fortnightly
        intervals if necessary.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Diseases</b><br>
        <br>
        No major disease is noticed in the crop. Leaf spot and leaf
        blotch can be controlled by restricted use of Bordeaux mixture
        1%. Application of Trichoderma at the time of planting can check
        the incidence of rhizome rot.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harvesting and post harvest operations</b><br>
        <br>
        Turmeric is to be harvested at correct maturity. Depending upon
        the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest in 7-9 months,
        medium varieties in 8-9 months and late varieties after 9
        months.<br>
        <br>
        Usually the land is ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by
        hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted with a spade.
        Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and other extraneous
        matter adhering to them. The average yield per hectare comes to
        20-25 tonnes of green turmeric.<br>
        <br>
        Fingers are separated from mother rhizomes. Mother rhizomes are
        usually kept as seed material. The fresh turmeric is cured for
        obtaining dry turmeric. Curing involves boiling of rhizomes in
        fresh water and the drying in the sun.<br>
        <br>
        No chemical should be used for processing. The cleaned rhizomes
        are boiled in copper or galvanized iron or earthen vessels, with
        water just enough to soak them. Boil till the fingers/mother
        rhizomes become soft. The cooked turmeric is taken out of the
        pan by lifting the thoughs and draining the water into pan
        itself. The same hot water in the pan can be used for boiling
        next set of raw turmeric which is already filled in troughs. The
        cooking of turmeric is to be done within 2-3 days after harvest.<br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes may also be cooked using baskets with perforated bottom
        and sides. The mother rhizomes and the fingers are cured
        separately.<br>
        <br>
        The cooked fingers/mother rhizomes are dried in the sun by
        spreading in 5-7 cm thick layers on bamboo mats or cement floor.
        A thinner layer is not desirable as the colour of the dried
        product may be adversely affected. During night time, the
        material should be heaped or covered. It may take 10-15 days for
        the rhizomes to become completely dry. Artificial drying using
        cross-flow hot air at a maximum temperature of 60°C is also
        found to give satisfactory product. In the case of sliced
        turmeric, artificial drying has clear advantages in giving
        brighter coloured product than sun drying which tends to suffer
        due to surface bleaching. The recovery of dry product varies
        from 20-30% depending upon the variety and the location where
        the crop is grown.<br>
        <br>
        Dried turmeric has a poor appearance and rough dull colour
        outside the surface with scales and root bits. Smoothening and
        polishing the outer surface by manual or mechanical rubbing
        improve the appearance.<br>
        <br>
        Manual polishing consists of rubbing the dried turmeric fingers
        on a hard surface. The improved method is by using hand-operated
        barrel or drum mounted on a central axis, the sides of which are
        made of expanded metal mesh. When the drum filled with turmeric
        is rotated, polishing is effected by abrasion of the surface
        against the mesh as well as by mutual rubbing against each other
        as they roll inside the drum. The turmeric is also polished in
        power-operated drums. The yield of polished turmeric from the
        raw material varies 15-25%.<br>
        <br>
        The colour of the turmeric always attracts the buyers. In order
        to impart attractive yellow colour, turmeric suspension in water
        is added to the polishing drum in the last 10 minutes. When the
        rhizomes are uniformly coated with suspension they may be dried
        in the sun.<br>
        <br>
        Rhizomes for seed purpose are generally stored after heaping
        under shade of tree or in well ventilated shade and covered with
        turmeric leaves. Sometimes the heap is plastered with earth
        mixed with cow dung. The seed rhizomes can also be stored in
        pits with sawdust. The pits can be covered with wooden planks
        with one or two holes for aeration.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract &nbsp;</b><br>
        <br>
        An experiment was conducted in Hill Agricultural Research
        Station (HARS),&nbsp; Khagrachari during 2011-2012 to estimate
        the soil loss and changes in soil properties under indigenous
        cultivation methods of ginger, turmeric, aroid, and jhum rice in
        hill slopes. The use of indigenous cultivation methods for
        growing different crops has created negative impact on soil
        productivity in hill slope. Among the four crops, the annually
        highest soil loss (22.68 t/ha) occurred by ginger cultivation
        which was statistically similar with turmeric (16.52 t/ha)
        followed by aroid (12.02 t/ha) and lowest soil loss (7.92 t/ha)
        occurred by jhum rice cultivation. There were no significant
        changes in soil physical properties like soil texture, bulk
        density, soil moisture content, field capacity. Organic matter
        and all the nutrients were higher in eroded soil than the
        post-harvested&nbsp; soil. A considerable amount of organic
        matter along with macro and&nbsp; micronutrients has been
        depleted through traditional method of crop cultivation. <br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Cucuma longa Linn. (Fam-Zingiberaceae) is a valued medicinal
        plant contains curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and
        bisdemethoxycurcumin) as major bioactive constituents.
        Previously reported analytical methods for analysis of
        curcuminoids were found to suffer from low resolution, lower
        sensitivity and longer analytical times. In this study, a rapid,
        sensitive, selective high-throughput ultra high performance
        liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS)
        method was developed and validated for the quantification of
        curcuminoids with an aim to reduce analysis time and enhance
        efficiency. UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis showed large variation
        (1.408-5.027% w/w) of curcuminoids among different samples with
        respect to their occurrence of metabolite and their
        concentration. The results showed that Erode (south province)
        contains highest quantity of curcuminoids and concluded to be
        the superior varieties. The results obtained here could be
        valuable for devising strategies for cultivating this medicinal
        plant. <br>

        <b>Integrated Plant Protection | Post Harvest Information</b><br>
        <br>
        TURMERIC (Curcuma domestica L) one of the major spice crops of
        India as well as North Eastern hill region belongs to the family
        Zingiberaceae. It is used as spice, dye, cosmetic and in
        religious ceremony. The crop is mainly grown in Jhum fields
        (Shifting cultivation) without using inorganic fertilizers,
        pesticides, weedicides etc. The soil, climate and other
        ecological factors favour the growth and development of turmeric
        and there is a tremendous scope to increase the production and
        productivity of turmeric in this region. The total area of the
        turmeric in NEH region is 13.66 thousands ha with total
        production of 84.06 thousand tonnes with productivity level of
        61. 9 q/ha against the national productivity of 39.12 q/ha. A
        brief agro-technique for increasing yield of the crop is given
        below:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Climatic and Soil</b>: <br>
        <br>
        Turmeric prefers warm humid climate with average rainfall of
        1500 mm and temperature of 20-30 °C. Well-drained, friable sandy
        loam soil (up to 15-20 cm depth) rich in organic matter is
        preferred.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Planting time:</b> <br>
        <br>
        The time for plating is March to April in this region.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Seed rate</b>: <br>
        <br>
        About 18-20 quintals of healthy disease free rhizomes are
        sufficient for one hectare land.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Method of planting:</b> <br>
        <br>
        Turmeric rhizomes are planted in the furrows by dibbling at a
        spacing of 30 x 30cm. After dibbling the rhizomes are covered
        with the loose soil from the ridge. The rhizomes should be
        treated with the 0.3 per cent Agallol or Dithane M-45 solution
        for 30 minutes and then dried in the shade before planting.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Varieties suitable for NEH Region ~</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b>
        <div align="center"><b> </b><b><img alt="" src="megapib.jpg"
              height="200" width="499"></b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <b>Manure and Fertilizer:</b> <br>
        <br>
        The highest yield was obtained by applying the farmyard manure @
        25t/ha followed by the application of 120 kg/ha nitrogen, 60
        kg/ha phosphorous and 90 kg/ha potash in the form of Urea, DAP
        and MOP respectively. Whole amount of the phosphorous and
        potassium is applied as basal and half nitrogen (60 kg) is
        applied at the time of first earthing up (45 days after sowing)
        and the remaining amount of nitrogen at second earthing up (90
        days after sowing).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mulching and Shade:</b> <br>
        <br>
        Turmeric requires 2-3 mulching, first immediately after planting
        to preserve moisture and ensure better germination, while second
        40-50 days after sowing check soil erosion, weeds and enhance
        number of tillers during rhizome initiation. Third mulching is
        beneficial when rainy season is over to conserve moisture during
        rhizome development.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Weeding:</b> <br>
        <br>
        It is very important to keep the weeds under control and to
        maintain desirable soil conditions for the normal growth of
        crop. The first weeding may be done in June followed by
        subsequent hoeing and earthing from July to September at forth
        nightly intervals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harvesting:</b> <br>
        <br>
        The crop is ready for harvesting in about 8-9 months after
        sowing in the North Eastern region depending upon variety,
        fertility status of soil and moisture availability. The crop
        planted during March-April becomes ready for harvest by the
        middle of December at mid hill altitude of Meghalaya. At the
        time of maturity dry leaves are cut close to the ground.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Storage:</b> <br>
        <br>
        The rhizomes should be dried in shade for 4 to 6 days after
        removing the dirt and leaves, Rhizome should be treated with
        Dithane M-45 (3g/litre of water) for 30 minutes before storage.
        They are put in underground pits, locally known as kattir. The
        dry grasses/paddy straws should be spread at the bottom of each
        pit before the rhizomes are placed for storage. The pit should
        be covered with dry grasses and sealed by plastering with mud to
        protect the rhizomes against the heat of the sun and to prevent
        entry of water in pits. The pit is opened in January or February
        for sorting out the diseased and rotten rhizomes and healthy
        rhizomes are used for further planting.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Major Diseases~</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>Leaf spot:</b> It is an important disease of turmeric.
        Elliptic to oblong, 4-5 cm long, 1-3 cm wide spots are found on
        leaves. Later on spots become yellow with greyish-white centre.<br>
        <b>Control:</b> Foliar of Mancozeb (2.5 g/l) during
        June-September at 15 days interval is found effective.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Rhizome rot:</b> Water soaked lesion are found at the base of
        pseudostem.<br>
        <b>Control:</b> Treat the seed rhizome with Rhidomil (2.5 g/l)
        for 40 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Major Insects~</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>Thrips:</b> The nymphs and adults suck the sap from leaves
        due to which plants turn yellow and sometimes dry up. Rhizomes
        formed from the infested plants become smaller in size.<br>
        <b>Control: </b>Spraying of Rogor or Monocrotophos (2.5 ml/l)
        is found effective to control the insect.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Scale:</b>&nbsp; The grey shell scales damage the crop by
        sucking the sap from rhizomes and stems and deteriorate the
        quality of rhizomes.<br>
        <b>Control:</b> Spraying of 0.05% Quinalphos or Monocrotophos is
        found effective to control the insect.<br>

        Cultivation of turmeric is economically profitable because of
        its varied uses &amp; easy cultivation features as already
        described in Golden Treasure of Ayurveda : “Turmeric” .<br>
        <br>
        Turmeric cultivation favours by alluvial soil &amp; temperate
        climate, both features are predominantly available in India.
        Following are the basic steps for organic cultivation of
        Turmeric (Organic Farming)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>Turmeric Rhizome</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
          Soil:</b><br>
        <br>
        Grows well in loamy or alluvial soil with good drainage system.
        Loose and friable soil helps. Gravy, clayey and stony , acidic,
        alkaline, soils are not suitable pH- 5.5.-6.5. Water logging
        conditions harm the plant<br>
        <br>
        <b>Climate:</b><b><br>

          Propagation of Turmeric</b><b><br>
          <br>
        </b><b>Propogation:</b><br>
        <br>
        Done through fingers of corm. Appropriate period for plantation-
        April end (India) Small pieces of finger corm having one or two
        buds are planted at a depth of 5-6 cm in the soil. Weight of
        each finger- 40g. Plant to plant distance- 20 cm and b/w rows-
        30 cm. Irrigation should be done immediately for proper settling
        of fingers<br>
        <br>
        <b>Manuring/ Bio-fertilizers:</b><br>
        <br>
        Phosphorus and potas affect the yield and growth of plants. So,
        10 kg/acre of each should be well mixed in the field at the time
        of planting and after that 2 quintal/acre of vermicompost should
        be spread when the field has been irrigated immediately after
        plantation.<br>

        <br>
        <b>Harvesting of Turmeric</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Post- harvesting: Small finger like rhizome pieces should be
        separated and kept aside as stock for raising the next crop.
        Kept in heaps in shady areas, properly covered with C.longa
        leaves and some soil, air passage holes should be made in these
        heaps Cleaned and dried in shade for 1 week until hardening
        takes place. Hard rhizome pieces are biled for 1-2hrs in 100L of
        water containing 100g of sodium bicarbonate. 50 g of sodium
        bisulphate and hydrochloric acid is also added. When rhizomes
        get softened, boiling should be stopped and these are dried in
        the field for 10-15 days.<br>
        <br>
        Polishing- After drying, it is polished. 2kg of lime, 30 g
        sodium bisulphate, 30 ml HCl, 50 g alum and 150 ml castor oil
        are added to 100 g of C. longa.<br>

        Andaman and Nicobar Islands being situated in the tropical
        rainfall belt, agriculture operations in these Islands are
        carried out under rainfed conditions. Irrigation facilities
        being limited, paddy cultivation has its own limitations. Proper
        utilization of land available with the farmers with the value
        added crop is needed for the improvement of the economy of the
        farmers. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Turmeric being a value added crop may be cultivated by the
        farmers on commercial basis. Presently crop is cultivated in a
        very limited area i. e. 38 ha. with a production of 79.00 MT
        (approx.) <br>
        <br>
        Turmeric (Curcuma Longa) the sacred spice is used as condiment,
        dye, drug and cosmetic in addition to its use in religious
        ceremonies. It is an erect, perennial herb grown as an annual
        crop. <br>
        <br>
        <b>CLIMATE AND SOIL: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric prefers a warm, humid climate with a rainfall of 1500
        mm and temperature of 200 -30 0 C. It thrives well up to 1200 mm
        above mean sea level. Well-drained sandy or clayey loam or red
        loamy soils having acidic to slightly alkaline soil is ideal for
        its cultivation. It does not stand water logging.<br>
        <br>
        <b>VARIETY: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        A number of varieties are available in the locality where they
        are cultivated. GL-Duram III and CLS 22 are found suitable in
        these Islands. <br>
        <br>
        <b>PROPAGATION: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Whole or split mother rhizome or finger rhizomes are used
        for&nbsp; planting . Seed @ 2500 kg/ha .is optimum. Each
        planting unit consists of bits of 20-25 gm each. The seed
        rhizomes are treated with Dithane M–45 75 WP (3 gm/lit of water)
        and malathion 50 EC (4 ml/lit of water) for 30 minutes for
        storage as well as during the planting time. It is either
        planted on raised beds of 1 m width and convenient length with
        15 cm height or on ridges and furrows. The spacing is kept 30 cm
        x 15 cm in beds and 40– 60 cm x 25 cm (on ridges or in
        furrows).. Repeated cropping in the same area should be avoided.
        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <b>MANURING:&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The basal dose of FYM @ 40 tonnes per ha may be incorporated at
        the time of land preparation. The general dose of fertilizers
        should be (60:50:120 kg NPK per ha.)&nbsp; 130 kg urea, 270 kg
        rock phosphate and 200 kg murate of potash per ha. The entire
        dose of MOP and half of rock phosphate is applied as basal dose.
        Half of urea is given 45 days after planting &amp; the other
        half with the remaining dose of rock phosphate is given 3 months
        after planting. The beds should be earthed up after each
        fertilizer application. Application of neem cake @ 2 tonnes per
        ha. at the time of planting helps in reducing the incidence of
        rhizome rot disease and increasing the yield.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MULCHING: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The crop is mulched immediately after planting with green leaves
        @ 12000 – 15, 000 kg per ha. It may be repeated for a second
        time after 50 days with the same quantity of green leaves.<br>
        <br>
        <b>AFTER CARE: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        First earthing up should be given after 50 days. It cannot
        withstand prolonged water logging and also does not tolerate
        heavy shade.<br>
        <br>
        <b>INTER CROPPING: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric comes up well under sparse shade also. It can be grown
        as an intercrop in coconut gardens like ginger or as mixed crop
        with red gram, chilli, colocasia, vegetables and maize.<br>
        <br>
        <b>IRRIGATION: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric can be grown either as a rainfed crop or an irrigated
        crop. In case of irrigated crop, depending on weather and soil
        condition, 15 –40 irrigations may be necessary at&nbsp; 7– 10
        days intervals .&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <b>INSECT PEST :&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>Shoot Borer</b> :&nbsp; The shoot borer is the most important
        pest of turmeric . The larvae bore into the pseudostem and feed
        on the growing shoot resulting in yellowing and drying of the
        infested shoots. The presence of bore hole on the pseudostem
        through which the frass is extruded and the withered central
        shoots are the symptoms of pest infestation. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Spraying with malathion 50 EC (2 ml/lit of water) or
        monocrotophos 36 EC (1.5 ml/lit of water) during July – October
        at 21 day interval is effective against the pest.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DISEASES:</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>Leaf Blotch</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a fungal disease. The
        disease appears as small oval rectangular brown spots on either
        side of the leaves.<br>
        <br>
        They soon become dirty yellow or dark brown. The leaves also
        turn yellow. The yield goes down considerably. For control spray
        foliage with Dithane M-45 75 WP (3 gm/lit of water) <br>
        <br>
        For controlling leaf spot give foliage sprays 5-6 times at 15
        days interval during June-September with Dithane M-45 75 WP
        (2.5&nbsp; gm/lit of water) or hinosan 50 EC (2 ml/lit of
        water). &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <b>HARVESTING: &nbsp;</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Turmeric takes 7-9 months for harvesting, drying up of the
        aerial portion indicates&nbsp; maturity.&nbsp; On an average a
        yield of 25 – 30 tonnes/ha of fresh rhizomes may be obtained.<br>
        <br>
        <b>POST HARVEST TECHNOLOGY </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The harvested rhizomes are washed well to remove adhering soil.
        The fingers are separated and cooked in boiling water for 1 hour
        under slight alkaline condition (100 g of sodium bicarbonate or
        sodium carbonate in 100 litres of water) and sun dried on
        bamboo. Turmeric is boiled usually in copper/ galvanized iron or
        earthen vessels. It takes 40–60 minute of boiling to reach the
        correct stage (soft). &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The cleaned fingers (50 kg) are taken in a perforated trough of
        convenient size made of GI with extended parallel handle. The
        alkaline solution is poured into a pan so as to immerse the
        fingers. It is boiled till they become soft. Mother and finger
        rhizomes are generally cured separately. <br>
        <br>
        The dry recovery varies from 15-30 % depending on variety,
        location and cultural practices. The dried turmeric is subjected
        to polishing either manually or by rubbing it on concrete
        flooring or mechanically in power operated drums. Turmeric
        powder is added to the drum to enhance the colour of the
        rhizome. Cured turmeric is screened as finger , round and split.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PRESERVATION OF SEED RHIZOMES: </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Rhizomes for seed purpose are generally stored by heaping under
        shade of the tree or in well ventilated shade and covered with
        turmeric leaves. Some times the heap is plastered with earth
        mixed cow dung. The seed rhizomes can also be stored in pits
        with sawdust. The pits can be covered with wooden planks with
        one or two holes for aeration.<br>

        or condiment. It is extensively used as stimulant, blood
        purifier, tonic as a carminative and remedy against the skin
        diseases, pain and anthelmintic (Srimal, 1997). India is a major
        producer, consumer and exporter of turmeric but major part of
        its produce is consumed with in the country and export accounts
        for nearly 5.9 per cent of total production. During 2007-08, the
        turmeric export from India was 49,250 tons valued at Rs 15,700
        lakhs contributing 11 per cent of total spices export (Selvan,
        2009). Plants originating from the primary rhizome (average
        weight 19 g) had a greater leaf area and total plant dry weight
        than the plants originating from secondary rhizome having
        average weight of 9 g (Maia&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; 1995). The date

        metal contaminated soil, in particular to a method of repairing
        the copper, zinc, arsenic contaminated soil by utilizing
        dioscorea zingiberensis. The method comprises the following
        steps of: directly planting the dioscorea zingiberensis in the
        copper, zinc, arsenic compositely contaminated soil and
        performing conventional cultivation. The dioscorea zingiberensis
        can normally grow in the contaminated soil, has no obvious
        poisoning symptoms and does not affect the root tuber saponin
        content in the dioscorea zingiberensis; the root system of the
        dioscorea zingiberensis is developed, the biomass is large, and
        a large amount of various heavy metals can be absorbed and
        accumulated; and particularly, the contents of heavy metals Zn
        and Cd in fibrous roots are obviously higher than a soil
        background value to achieve the level of super enrichment. The
        method has the advantages of simple cultivation, low management
        cost, capability of benefiting from one-time planting for many
        years, extremely high medicinal value and capabilities of
        preventing the heavy metals from reentering a food chain and

        Soil is essential humanity, an important part of the survival of
        one of the natural resources, but also the ecological
        environment. along with Industrial development, urban pollution
        and increasing agricultural production continues to progress,
        along with the heavy metal compounds on foreign soil The
        pollution is worsening (Pambrun V, Marquot A, Racault.

        biologically activated sludge systems-effect of low temperature
        [J]. Environ Science Pollution Resource.2008, 15: 592-599), soil
        heavy metal pollution has become a serious global environmental
        problems. Heavy metal contamination can lead to soil
        Degradation, lower crop yield and quality of (Luo Yongming, Teng
        should. Pollution of soil degradation status and countermeasures

        soil migrate transformation is absorbed by plants or
        microorganisms, thereby threatening the food chain Human life
        and health (Alloway B J.Heavy metals in soil [M]. London:
        Blackie Academic &amp; professional, 1995: 1-65).. Further heavy
        metal contamination in the soil system with low migration

        through the new soil, soil replacement Mechanical and physical
        principles dig or heat treatment, electrochemical method other
        physical and chemical principles, to reduce the heavy metal
        content in soil (Probstein RF, Hick RE.Removal of contaminants
        from soils by electric fields [J]. Science.1993, 260: 498-503).
        Chemical properties of heavy metals can be taken based on a
        number of improvement measures, such as adding a modifier, a
        curing agent, suppression Reducing agents such as water-soluble
        heavy metals in soil, and the effectiveness of mobility, heavy

        expensive, required complex equipment, difficult to apply to
        large-scale contamination of soil improvement, most only It is
        the presence of heavy metals morphological changes, temporary
        relief of heavy metals harmful and often leads to destruction of
        soil structure, biological activity Fertility decline and
        degradation, it is difficult to restore the original state of
        the soil, etc., and may cause secondary pollution damage to the

        phytoextraction and phytomining technologies [J]. Journal of
        Environmental Quality.2007,36: 1429-1243).. Because
        phytoremediation has the advantage of cheap and clean, but also

        <br>
        In phytoremediation, the hyperaccumulator traditional sense
        often plant small, slow growth, low biomass, or The proportion
        of those who absorb heavy metals is not large enough to stem
        transportation (Wang KR.Tolerance of cultivated plants to

        Ability to accumulate general but strong resistance, biological
        and repair effect of a good amount of plants, such as ryegrass
        and alfalfa. But these Accumulation of heavy metals in plants
        may be to feed, fertilizer and other forms to enter or re-enter
        the food chain and endanger human health. therefore, In
        practice, phytoremediation, look for strong resistance,
        biological capacity, short growth cycle, the total heavy metal
        uptake and accumulation, And avoid heavy metals and re-enter the

        The cultivation of turmeric heavy metals contamination in soil
        is a kind of super heavy metal tolerance of plants, the roots of
        heavy Metal has superior enrichment capability.<br>
        <br>
        The turmeric for field planting in the field of heavy metals
        contamination area, choose deep soil loose adaptation of land,
        often performed Arable land regulations will stem turmeric
        species live in the contaminated soil, according to conventional
        fertilizer, when carried turmeric height reaches 30cm
        scaffolding, Regular farmland weeding, pest management and other
        fields.<br>
        <br>
        Planted in the soil of heavy metals contamination in turmeric,
        the roots absorb large amounts of heavy metals from the soil,
        with the plant Growth, root biomass was increased, the total
        amount of its heavy metal accumulation increases. When the plant
        is mature, shoot Sub-withered, you can carry out excavation of
        turmeric root, and then plant new species of turmeric stems,
        repeated operation, can effectively reduce soil Content of heavy
        metals, thereby remediation of contaminated soil.<br>
        <br>
        The turmeric heavy metals contamination in the soil can grow
        normally, no obvious toxic symptoms, yield about 8000-10000
        Plants around its roots mature after excavation, the measured
        moisture content of 70% 100g of fresh ginger root can be
        extracted saponin about 0.7g.<br>

        (1) seeding, warm temperature, drought, waterlogging bogey, fear
        of frost, growth period of 240 days, planting the first lunar
        month, the lunar year can be harvested in mid-October, when the
        temperature at 13 ° C or more, turmeric root seed germination
        temperature can break ground, timely planting can improve the
        yield and pharmaceutical quality, late planting shorten the
        growing season, it will reduce the yield and quality;<br>
        <br>
        (2) fertilization, during the growth of both water and nutrients
        to promote some of their own growth and development, but also to
        grow fibrous roots absorb water and soil nutrient to use solar
        energy to build carbohydrates in leaves, stems from the
        transport itself to grow turmeric root nutrition, the nutrition
        delivered to the turmeric root, therefore, must be cultivated
        under conditions sufficient decomposition of organic fertilizer
        mainly basal, pre-promote seedling topdressing nitrogen, medium
        phosphorus, potassium-based promotion of growth, late Since root
        has taken shape, nutrition root from the plow layer of topsoil
        is shallow, not topdressing fertilizer, fertilizer dissolved
        under anhydrous conditions, high concentrations can harm fibrous
        roots, withered seedlings appear, effective nutritional turmeric
        root rotten;<br>
        <br>
        (3) Drainage, long-term soil waterlogged soil gap lack of
        oxygen, temperature turmeric under anoxic conditions anaerobic
        respiration, internal root will produce large amounts of
        alcohol, causing the death of rotten roots, so to timely
        drainage, keeping temperature and humidity soil;<br>
        <br>
        (4) Harvesting, one week before the beginning of winter when the
        water content is low, with high doses, should be timely harvest,
        early harvest yield and quality, late harvest encounter frost
        can cause damage, affecting the yield and quality.<br>
        <br>
        Through the temperature characteristic of turmeric understanding
        of the present invention, the use of seeding, fertilization,
        drainage, harvesting technology, making temperature turmeric
        high yield, good quality and increase the economic benefits. <br>
