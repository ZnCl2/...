      <br>
      Field of the invention The present invention relates to a process
      for producing energy by nuclear reactions between a metal and
      hydrogen that is adsorbed on the crystalline structure of the
      metal. Furthermore, the invention relates to an energy generator
      that carries out such reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of the prior art </span><br>
      <br>
      A method for producing heat by nuclear reactions caused by
      hydrogen that is adsorbed on a Nickel active core has been
      described in WO95/20316, in the name of Piantelli et. al..
      Improvements of the process are described in Focardi, Gabbani,
      Montalbano, Piantelli, Veronesi, "Large excess heat production in
      Ni-H systems", in Il Nuovo Cimento, vol. IHA, N.11 , november
      1998, and bibliography therein.<br>
      <br>
      A problem that was observed during the experiments was the
      preparation of the cores on which hydrogen had to be adsorbed and
      the reactions had to be carried out; such cores were made of
      Nickel and had the shape of small bars.<br>
      <br>
      One of the various critical aspects of the process was the choice
      of a suitable method for adsorbing hydrogen and the quality of the
      hydrogen matter, as well as the repeatability of the triggering
      conditions of the process.<br>
      <br>
      Other critical aspects were how to clean the small bar before the
      adsorption of the hydrogen, as well as how to optimize the optimal
      bar surface conditions and the method for triggering and shutting
      down the reactions. Due to such problems, the set up of the
      process and its industrial exploitation turned out to be somewhat
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      A further critical aspect is the core sizing and design to attain
      a desired power.<br>
      <br>
      In DE4024515 a process is described for obtaining energy from the
      nuclear fusion of hydrogen isotopes, in which the atoms are
      brought into contact with clusters that contains from three to one
      hundred thousand atoms of a transition metal, and in which the
      clusters are obtained by cooling finely subdivided metal
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the invention</span><br>
      <br>
      It is therefore a feature of the present invention to provide a
      method for producing energy by nuclear reactions of hydrogen that
      is adsorbed in a crystalline structure of a metal, which ensures
      repeatability of the triggering conditions of the reactions.<br>
      <br>
      It is, furthermore, a feature of the present invention to provide
      such a method for industrially making the precursors of the active
      cores, and for industrially adsorbing hydrogen in them.<br>
      <br>
      It is another feature of the present invention to provide an
      energy generator that effects the above described nuclear
      reactions, whose production rate and size are also such that an
      industrial production is allowed.<br>
      <br>
      It is similarly a feature of the present invention to provide such
      a generator, which allows easily adjusting the output power.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further feature of the present invention to provide such a
      generator, which can be easily shut down.<br>
      <br>
      These and other features are accomplished by a method for
      producing energy by nuclear reactions between hydrogen and a
      metal, said method providing the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      - prearranging a determined quantity of crystals of a transition
      metal, said crystals arranged as micro/nanometric clusters that
      have a predetermined crystalline structure, each of said clusters
      having a number of atoms of said transition metal which is less
      than a predetermined number of atoms; - bringing hydrogen into
      contact with said clusters;<br>
      <br>
      - heating said determined quantity of clusters up to an adsorption
      temperature larger than a predetermined critical temperature, that
      is adapted to cause an adsorption into said clusters of said
      hydrogen as H- ions, said hydrogen as H- ions remaining available
      for said nuclear reactions within said active core after said
      heating step; triggering said nuclear reactions between said
      hydrogen as H- ions and said metal within said clusters by an
      impulsive action exerted on said active core that causes said H-
      ions to be captured into respective atoms of said clusters, said
      succession of reactions causing a production of heat; removing
      said heat from said active core maintaining the temperature of
      said active core above said critical temperature, said step of
      removing said heat carried out according to a predetermined power.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said step of prearranging is carried out in such a
      way that said determined quantity of crystals of said transition
      metal in the form of micro/nanometric clusters is proportional to
      said power.<br>
      <br>
      The number of atoms that form each cluster is the variable through
      which the predetermined power can be obtained from an active core
      that comprises a predetermined amount of metal. In fact, each
      cluster is a site where a reaction takes place, therefore the
      power that can be obtained is substantially independent from the
      clusters size, i.e. from the number of atoms that form the
      cluster. In particular, the number of atoms of the clusters is
      selected from a group of numbers that are known for giving rise to
      structures that are more stable than other aggregates that
      comprise a different number of atoms. Such stability is a
      condition to attain a high reactivity of the clusters with respect
      to hydrogen to give H- ions. For instance, a stability function
      has been identified for Nickel, which depends upon the number of
      atoms that form the clusters, obtaining specific stability peaks
      that correspond to that particular numbers.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen that is used in the method can be natural hydrogen,
      i.e., in particular, hydrogen that contains deuterium with an
      isotopic abundance substantially equal to 0,015%. Alternatively,
      such hydrogen can be hydrogen with a deuterium content which is
      distinct from that above indicated, and/or hydrogen with a
      significant tritium content.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the hydrogen in use is molecular hydrogen H2;
      alternatively, the hydrogen is preliminarily ionized as H", or it
      can be a mixture that contains H- and H2. The transition metal can
      be selected from the group comprised of: Sc, Ti,<br>
      V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Pd, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd,
      Lu, Hf1 Ta1 W1 Re1 Os1 Ir1 Pt, Au, lanthanoids, actinoids. Such
      metals belong to one of the four transition groups , i.e.: metals
      that have a partially filled 3d-shell, e.g. Nickel; - metals that
      have a partially filled 4d-shell, e.g. Rhodium;<br>
      - metals that have a partially filled 5d-shell, i.e. the "rare
      earths" or lanthanoids, e.g. Cerium; metals that have a partially
      filled 5d-shell, i.e. the actinonoids, e.g. Thorium.<br>
      <br>
      The metal in use can also be an alloy of two or more than two of
      the above listed metals.<br>
      <br>
      Among the listed transition metals, or their alloys, the ones are
      preferred those that crystallize with a crystalline structure
      selected from the group comprised of:<br>
      <br>
      - face-centred cubic crystalline structure;<br>
      <br>
      - body-centred cubic crystalline structure;<br>
      <br>
      - compact hexagonal structure.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, metals are used that have a crystalline open face
      structure, in order to assist the H- ions adsorption into the
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said transition metal is Nickel. In particular, said
      Nickel is selected from the group comprised of: natural Nickel,
      i.e. a mixture of isotopes like Nickel 58, Nickel 60, Nickel 61 ,
      Nickel 62, Nickel 64; - a Nickel that contains only one isotope,
      said isotope selected from the group comprised of:<br>
      <br>
      Nickel 58;<br>
      Nickel 60<br>
      Nickel 61 ; - Nickel 62;<br>
      Nickel 64;<br>
      <br>
      - a formulation comprising at least two of such isotopes at a
      desired proportion.<br>
      <br>
      The H- ions can be obtained by treating, under particular
      operative conditions, hydrogen H2 molecules that have been
      previously adsorbed on said transition metal surface, where the
      semi-free valence electrons form a plasma. In particular, a
      heating is needed to cause lattice vibrations, i.e. phonons, whose
      energy is higher than a first activation energy threshold, through
      non-linear and anharmonic phenomena. In such conditions, the
      following events can occur: a dissociation of the hydrogen
      molecules that is adsorbed on the surface; an interaction with
      valence electrons of the metal, and formation of H- ions;<br>
      <br>
      - an adsorption of the H- ions into the clusters, in particular
      the clusters that form the two or three crystal layers that are
      most close to the surface. The H- ions can just physically
      interact with the metal, or can chemically bond with it, in which
      case hydrides can be formed.<br>
      <br>
      The H- ions can also be adsorbed into the lattice interstices, but<br>
      <br>
      - adsorption at the grain edges, by trapping the ions into the
      lattice defects; replacement of an atom of the metal of a clusters
      may also occur.<br>
      <br>
      After such adsorption step, the H- ions interact with the atoms of
      the clusters, provided that a second activation threshold is
      exceeded, which is higher than the first threshold. By exceeding
      this second threshold, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion
      principle and with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the
      conditions are created for replacing electrons of metal atoms with
      H- ions, and, accordingly, for forming metal-hydrogen complex
      atoms. This event can take place due to the fermion nature of H-
      ion; however, since H- ions have a mass 1838 times larger than an
      electron mass, they tend towards deeper layers, and cause an
      emission of Auger electrons and of X rays. Subsequently, since the
      H- ion Bohr radius is comparable with the metal core radius, the
      H- ions can be captured by the metal core, causing a structural
      reorganization and freeing energy by mass defect; the H- ions can
      now be expelled as protons, and can generate nuclear reactions
      with the neighbouring cores. More in detail, the complex atom that
      has formed by the metal atom capturing the H- ion, in the full
      respect of the energy conservation principle, of the Pauli
      exclusion principle, and of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
      is forced towards an excited status, therefore it reorganizes
      itself by the migration of the H- ion towards deeper orbitals or
      levels, i.e. towards a minimum energy state, thus emitting Auger
      electrons and X rays during the level changes. The H- ion falls
      into a potential hole and concentrates the energy which was
      previously distributed upon a volume whose radius is about
      10&lt;'12&gt; m into a smaller volume whose radius is about 5x10
      &lt;15&gt; m. At the end of the process, the H- ion is at a
      distance from the core that is comparable with the nuclear radius;
      in fact in the fundamental status of the complex atom that is
      formed by adding the H- ion, due to its mass that is far greater
      the mass of the electron, the H- ion is forced to stay at such
      deep level at a distance from the core that is comparable with the
      nuclear radius, in accordance with Bohr radius calculation. As
      above stated, owing to the short distance from the core, a process
      is triggered in which the H- ion is captured by the core, with a
      structural reorganization and energy release by mass defect,
      similarly to what happens in the case of electron capture with
      structural reorganization and energy release by mass defect or in
      case of loss of two electrons, due to their intrinsic instability,
      during the fall process towards the lowest layers, and eventually
      an expulsion of the the H- ion takes place as a proton, as
      experimentally detected in the cloud chamber, and nuclear
      reactions can occur with other neighbouring cores, said reactions
      detected as transmutations on the active core after the production
      of energy.<br>
      <br>
      According to the above, the actual process cannot be considered as
      a fusion process of hydrogen atoms, in particular of particular
      hydrogen isotopes atoms; instead, the process has to be understood
      as an interaction of a transition metal and hydrogen in general,
      in its particular form of H- ion.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said predetermined number of said transition metal
      atoms of said clusters is such that a portion of material of said
      transition metal in the form of clusters or without clusters shows
      a transition of a physical property of said metal, said property
      selected from the group comprised of:<br>
      - thermal conductivity;<br>
      - electric conductivity;<br>
      - refraction index. The micro/nanometric clusters structure is a
      requirement for producing H- ions and for the above cited orbital
      and nuclear capture processes. For each transition metal, a
      critical number of atoms can be identified below which a level
      discrete structure (electronic density, functional of the
      electronic density and Kohn-Sham effective potential) and Pauli
      antisymmetry, tend to prevail over a band structure according to
      Thomas-Fermi approach. The discrete levels structure is at the
      origin of the main properties of the clusters, some of which have
      been cited above. Such features can be advantageously used for
      aqnalysing the nature of the surface, i.e. for establishing
      whether clusters are present or not. In particular said step of
      preparing a determined quantity of micro/nanometric clusters
      comprises a step of depositing a predetermined amount of said
      transition metal in the form of micro/nanometric clusters on a
      surface of a substrate, i.e. a solid body that has a predetermined
      volume and a predetermined shape, wherein said substrate surface
      contains at least 10&lt;9&gt; clusters per square centimetre.<br>
      <br>
      The step of prearranging a determined quantity of clusters can
      also provide a step of sintering said determined quantity of
      micro/nanometric clusters, said sintering preserving the
      crystalline structure and preserving substantially the size of
      said clusters. <br>
      <br>
      The step of preparing the determined quantity of clusters can
      provide collecting a powder of clusters into a container, i.e.
      collecting a determined quantity of clusters or aggregation of
      loose clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said substrate contains in its surface at least
      10&lt;10&gt; clusters per square centimetre, in particular at
      least 10&lt;11&gt; clusters per square centimetre, more in
      particular at least 10&lt;12&gt; clusters per square centimetre.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said clusters form on said substrate a thin layer of
      said metal, whose thickness is lower than 1 micron; in particular
      such thickness is of the same magnitude of the lattice of the
      crystalline structure of the transition metal. In fact, the core
      activation by adsorption of the H- ions into the clusters concerns
      only a few surface crystal layers.<br>
      <br>
      In particular said step of depositing said transition metal is
      effected by a process of physical deposition of vapours of said
      metal.<br>
      <br>
      Said process of depositing can be a process of sputtering, in
      which the substrate receives under vacuum a determined amount of
      the metal in the form of atoms that are emitted by a body that is
      bombarded by a beam of particles.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the process of depositing can comprise an
      evaporation step or a thermal sublimation step and a subsequent
      condensation step in which the metal condensates onto said
      substrate. Alternatively, the process of depositing can be
      performed by means of an epitaxial deposition, in which the
      deposit attains a crystalline structure that is similar to the
      structure of the substrate, thus allowing the control of such
      parameters.<br>
      <br>
      The transition metal can be deposited also by a process of
      spraying. Alternatively, the step of depositing the transition
      metal can provide a step of heating the metal up to a temperature
      that is close to the melting point of the metal, followed by a
      step of slow cooling. Preferably, the slow cooling proceeds up to
      an average core temperature of about 600&lt;0&gt;C. The step of
      depositing the metal is followed by a step of quickly cooling the
      substrate and the transition metal as deposited, in order to cause
      a "freezing" of the metal in the form of clusters that have a
      predetermined crystalline structure. In particular said quickly
      cooling occurs by causing a current of hydrogen to flow in a
      vicinity of said transition metal as deposited on said substrate,
      said current having a predetermined temperature that is lower than
      the temperature of said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said step of bringing hydrogen into contact with
      said clusters is preceded by a step of cleaning said substrate. In
      particular, said step of cleaning is made by applying a vacuum of
      at least 10&lt;'9&gt; bar at a temperature set between
      350&lt;0&gt;C and 500&lt;0&gt;C for a predetermined time.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said vacuum is applied according to a
      predetermined number, preferably not less than 10, of vacuum
      cycles and subsequent restoration of a substantially atmospheric
      pressure of hydrogen. This way, it is possible to quantitatively
      remove the gas adsorbed within the metal, in particular the gas
      which is adsorbed in the metal of the active core. In fact, such
      gas drastically reduces the interaction between the plasma of
      valence electrons and the hydrogen ions, and can limit or avoid
      the adsorption of the hydrogen in the clusters, even if an initial
      adsorption has occurred on the metal surface. If the substrate and
      the deposited metal are exposed to a temperature that is
      significantly above 500&lt;0&gt;C, the cluster structure can be
      irremediably damaged.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, during said step of bringing hydrogen into contact
      with said clusters, said hydrogen has a partial pressure set
      between 0,001 millibar and 10 bar, in particular set between 1
      millibar and 2 bar, in order to ensure an optimal number of hits
      between the surface of said clusters and the hydrogen molecules:
      in fact, an excessive pressure increases the frequency of the
      hits, such that it can cause surface desorption, as well as other
      parasitic phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, during said step of bringing hydrogen into contact
      with said clusters, the hydrogen flows with a speed less than 3
      m/s. Said hydrogen flows preferably according to a direction that
      is substantially parallel to the surface of said clusters. In such
      condition, the hits between the hydrogen molecules and the metal
      substrate occur according to small impact angles, which assist the
      adsorption on the surface of the clusters and prevents re-
      emission phenomena in the subsequent steps of H- ions formation.
      Advantageously, said step of creating an active core by hydrogen
      adsorption into said clusters is carried out at a temperature that
      is close to a temperature at which a sliding of the reticular
      planes of the transition metal, said temperature at which a
      sliding occurs is set between the respective temperatures that
      correspond to the absorption peaks [alpha] and [beta].
      Advantageously, the concentration of H- ions with respect to the
      transition metal atoms of said clusters is larger than 0,01 , to
      improve the efficiency of the energy production process. In
      particular, this concentration is larger than 0,08.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, after said step of creating an active core by
      adsorbing hydrogen into said clusters a step is provided of
      cooling said active core down to the room temperature, and said
      step of triggering a succession of nuclear reactions provides a
      quick rise of the temperature of said active core from said room
      temperature to said temperature which is higher than said
      predetermined critical temperature. In particular, said quick
      temperature rise takes place in a time that is shorter than five
      minutes. The critical temperature is normally set between 100 and
      450&lt;0&gt;C, more often between 200 and 450&lt;0&gt;C. More in
      detail, the critical temperature is larger than the Debye
      temperature of said metal.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, said step of triggering said nuclear reactions
      provides an impulsive triggering action selected from the group
      comprised of: - a thermal shock, in particular caused by a flow of
      a gas, in particular of hydrogen, which has a predetermined
      temperature that is lower than the active core temperature; a
      mechanical impulse, in particular a mechanical impulse whose
      duration is less than 1/10 of second; - an ultrasonic impulse, in
      particular an ultrasonic impulse whose frequency is set between 20
      and 40 kHz; a laser ray that is impulsively cast onto said active
      core; an impulsive application of a package of electromagnetic
      fields, in particular said fields selected from the group
      comprised of: a radiofrequency pulse whose frequency is larger
      than 1 kHz; X rays; v rays; an electrostriction impulse that is
      generated by an impulsive electric current that flows through an
      electrostrictive portion of said active core; an impulsive
      application of a beam of elementary particles; in particular, such
      elementary particles selected from the group comprised of
      electrons, protons and neutrons;<br>
      <br>
      - an impulsive application of a beam of ions of elements, in
      particular of ions of one or more transition metals, said elements
      selected from a group that excludes O; Ar; Ne; Kr; Rn; N; Xe.<br>
      - an electric voltage impulse that is applied between two points
      of a piezoelectric portion of said active core; an impulsive
      magnetostriction that is generated by a magnetic field pulse along
      said active core which has a magnetostrictive portion.<br>
      <br>
      Such impulsive triggering action generates lattice vibrations,
      i.e. phonons, whose amplitude is such that the H- ions can exceed
      the second activation threshold thus creating the conditions that
      are required for replacing electrons of atoms of the metal, to
      form temporary metal-hydrogen complex ions. Preferably, said step
      of triggering said nuclear reactions is associated with a step of
      creating a gradient, i.e. a temperature difference, between two
      points of said active core. This gradient is preferably set
      between 100&lt;0&gt;C and 300&lt;0&gt;C.<br>
      <br>
      This enhances the conditions for anharmonic lattice motions, which
      is at the basis of the mechanism by which H- ions are produced.
      Advantageously, a step is provided of modulating said energy that
      is delivered by said nuclear reactions.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, said step of modulating comprises removing and/or
      adding active cores or active core portions from/to a generation
      chamber which contains one or more active cores during said step
      of removing said heat. Said step of modulating comprises a step of
      approaching/spacing apart sheets of said transition metal which
      form said active core in the presence of an hydrogen flow.<br>
      <br>
      The step of modulating can furthermore be actuated by absorption
      protons and alpha particles in lamina-shaped absorbers that are
      arranged between sheets of said transition metal which form said
      active core. The density of such emissions is an essential feature
      for adjusting said power.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, a step is provided of shutting down said nuclear
      reactions in the active core, that comprises an action selected
      from the group comprised of:<br>
      <br>
      - a further mechanical impulse;<br>
      - cooling said active core below a predetermined temperature, in
      particular below said predetermined critical temperature;<br>
      - a gas flow, in particular an Argon flow, on said active core. In
      particular, said step of shutting down said nuclear reactions can
      comprise lowering the heat exchange fluid inlet temperature below
      said critical temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said succession of reactions with production of
      heat is carried out in the presence of a predetermined sector
      selected from the group comprised of:<br>
      <br>
      - a magnetic induction field whose intensity is set between 1
      Gauss and 70000 Gauss; an electric field whose intensity is set
      between 1 V/m and 300000 V/m. The objects of the invention are
      also achieved by an energy generator that is obtained from a
      succession of nuclear reactions between hydrogen and a metal,
      wherein said metal is a transition metal, said generator
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      - an active core that comprises a predetermined amount of said
      transition metal;<br>
      <br>
      - a generation chamber that in use contains said active core; - a
      means for heating said active core within said generation chamber
      up to a temperature that is higher than a predetermined critical
      temperature; a means for triggering said nuclear reaction between
      said transition metal and said hydrogen; a means for removing from
      said generation chamber the heat that is developed during said
      reaction in said active core according to a determined power; the
      main feature of said generator is that:<br>
      <br>
      - said active core comprises a determined quantity of crystals of
      said transition metal, said crystals being micro/nanometric
      clusters that have a predetermined crystalline structure according
      to said transition metal, each of said clusters having a number of
      atoms of said transition metal that is less than a predetermined
      number of atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said determined quantity of crystals of said
      transition metal in the form of micro/nanometric clusters is
      proportional to said power.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said clusters contain hydrogen that is adsorbed as
      H- ions.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said means for heating said active core comprises an
      electric resistance in which, in use an electric current flows. In
      particular, said active core comprises a substrate, i.e. a solid
      body that has a predetermined volume and a predetermined shape, on
      whose surface said determined quantity of micro/nanometric
      clusters of said transition metal is deposited, for at least
      10&lt;9&gt; clusters per square centimetre, preferably at least
      10&lt;10&gt; clusters per square centimetre, in particular at
      least 10&lt;11&gt; clusters per square centimetre, more in
      particular at least 10&lt;12&gt; clusters per square centimetre.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said active core has an extended surface, i.e. a

      encumbrance of said active core, said extended surface in
      particular obtained using as substrate a body that is permeable to

      metal; - a powder of clusters collected within a container, said

      <br>
      Preferably, said transition metal is selected from the group
      comprised of:<br>
      <br>

      selected from a group that excludes O; Ar; Ne; Kr; Rn; N; Xe.<br>
      <br>
      - a means for applying a magnetic field impulse along said active
      core that has a magnetostrictive portion.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a means is associated with said means for triggering
      that is adapted to create a gradient, i.e. a temperature
      difference between two points of said active core, in particular
      said temperature difference set between 100&lt;0&gt;C and
      300&lt;0&gt;C.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said active core is arranged in use at a distance less
      than 2 mm from an inner wall of said generation chamber. This way,
      the production of H- ions is enhanced, since this distance is
      comparable with the mean free path of the hydrogen molecules at
      the working temperature and the working pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said generator comprises a means for modulating

      <br>
      Said means for modulating can comprise a means for removing/adding

      and/or to space apart said sheets while a hydrogen flow is

      are arranged adjacent to one another, said means for modulating
      can comprise lamina- shaped absorbers that are arranged between

      core up to said predetermined temperature which is set between 100
      and 450&lt;0&gt;C in a time less than five minutes.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, said quickly cooling in said clusters preparation

      hydrogen treatment chamber is/are obtained by means of said
      hydrogen flow on said active core, said flow having a
      predetermined temperature that is lower than the temperature of
      said active core.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of preferred
        exemplary embodiments. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      With reference to Figs. 1 , 2 and 3, an exemplary embodiment 100
      of the method according to the invention is described, for
      producing energy by a succession of nuclear reactions between
      hydrogen 31 and a transition metal 19. According to this exemplary
      embodiment, the method provides a step 110 of prearranging
      clusters 21 , for example a layer of clusters 20 on a substrate
      22, this layer 20 defined by a surface 23. A crystal layer 20 of
      thickness d4 preferably set between 1 nanometre and 1 micron is
      diagrammatically shown. The metal is deposited with a process
      adapted to ensure that the crystals as deposited have normally a
      number of atoms of the transition metal less than a predetermined
      critical number, beyond which the crystal matter looses the
      character of clusters. In the case of prearranging the clusters on
      a substrate, the process of depositing is adapted to ensure that 1
      square centimetre of surface 23 defines on average at least
      10&lt;9&gt; clusters 21. The method provides then a treatment step
      120 of the clusters with hydrogen 31 , in which hydrogen 31 is
      brought into contact with surface 23 of the clusters 21 , in order
      to obtain a population of molecules 33 of hydrogen that is
      adsorbed on surface 23, as shown in Fig. 3. The bonds between the
      atoms of the hydrogen molecules are weakened, up to having a
      homolytic or heterolytic scission of the molecules 33, obtaining,
      respectively, a couple of hydrogen atoms 34 or a couple consisting
      of a hydrogen negative H" ion 35 and a hydrogen positive
      H&lt;+&gt; ion 36, from each diatomic molecule 33 of hydrogen. A
      contribution to this process of weakening the bond and of making,
      in particular H- ions 35, is given by a heating step 130 of
      surface 23 of the clusters up to a temperature Ti larger than a
      predetermined critical temperature TD, as shown in Fig. 15; this
      heating causes furthermore, an adsorption of the hydrogen in the
      form of H- ions 37 into clusters 21 (Fig. 3).<br>
      <br>
      The clusters 21 with the adsorbed hydrogen 37 in this form
      represent an active core that is available for nuclear reactions,
      which can be started place by a triggering step 140; such step
      consists of supplying an impulse of energy 26 that causes the
      capture 150 by an atom 38 of the clusters of the H- ions 37
      adsorbed within the clusters, with a consequent exchange of an
      electron 42, as diagrammatically shown in Fig. 5, such that the
      succession of reactions causes a release of energy 43 to which a
      step 160 of production of heat 27 is associated, which requires a
      step of removal 170 of this heat towards an use, not shown.<br>
      <br>
      During the step 110 of prearranging clusters 21 , the
      predetermined number of atoms of the transition metal of the
      clusters is controlled by observing a physical property of the
      transition metal, chosen for example between thermal conductivity,
      electric conductivity, refraction index. These physical quantities
      have a net transition, when the number of atoms of a crystal
      aggregate exceeds a critical number above which the aggregate
      looses the properties of a cluster. For each transition metal, in
      fact is a number of atoms detectable below which a discrete level
      structure according to Kohn-Sham tends to prevail over a band
      structure according to Thomas-Fermi, which is responsible of the
      main features that define the many features of the clusters, some
      of which properties are used for determining the nature of surface
      23 during the step 110 of prearranging the clusters. In Fig. 4 in
      the periodic table of the chemical elements the position is
      indicated of the transition metals that are adapted for the
      process. They are in detail, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Y,
      Zr, Nb, Pd, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, Lu, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir1 Pt,
      Au, lanthanoids, actinoids, an alloy of two or more than two of
      the above listed metals. They belong to one of the four transition
      metals groups, i.e.: metals that have a partially filled 3d-shell,
      e.g. Nickel; metals that have a partially filled 4d-shell, e.g.
      Rhodium; metals that have a partially filled 5d-shell, i.e. the
      "rare earths" or lanthanoids, e.g. Cerium; metals that have a
      partially filled 5d-shell, i.e. the actinonoids, e.g.Thorium. The
      particular electronic conformation of the transition metals allows
      in fact that the conditions of anharmonicity are created such that
      the wave vectors sum with each other of the phonons, which
      interfere at the surface of the metal that is also a surface of
      discontinuity, and a reticular fluctuation is generated that is
      both in spatial phase and in time phase within the clusters, and
      such that an energy "gap" is exceeded that is necessary to start a
      chain of processes whose final act is the orbital capture of the
      H- ion 37, as diagrammatically shown in Fig. 5. In order to
      achieve a result that is industrially acceptable, it is necessary
      to reach a temperature higher than the Debye temperature T0, for
      example the temperature Ti as shown in fig. 15, which shows a
      typical temperature trend from heating step 130 to heat removal
      step 170, during which a balance value is obtained of the
      temperature Teq at the active core 1. The triggering step is
      assisted by the presence of a thermal gradient [Delta]T along the
      metal surface of the active core 1 , as shown for example in Fig.
      24.<br>
      <br>
      The clusters 21 (Figs. 2 and 3) have a crystalline structure 19
      that is typical of the chosen transition metals or alloy of
      transition metals. In Figs, from 6 to 10 crystal reticules with
      open faces are shown, which assist the process for adsorption of
      the hydrogen, in the form of H- ion 37 (Fig. 3), into a cluster 21
      , characterised by such structural arrangement. They comprise:
      face-centred cubic crystalline structure, fee (110) (Figs. 6, 7
      and 8);<br>
      - body-centred cubic crystalline structure, bcc (111) (Fig. 9);<br>
      - compact hexagonal structure, hep (1010) (Fig. 10). For example,
      the Nickel can crystallize according to the face-centred cubic
      structure shown in the perspective view of Fig. 6, where six atoms
      2 are shown arranged according to a diagonal plane.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 7 a top plan view is shown of a three-dimensional model
      comprising a plurality of atoms arranged according to the
      structure of Fig. 6, whereas Fig. 8 is a further perspective view
      of a model that shows, between the atoms of the upper level, six
      atoms 2 that are arranged on two different rows separate from a
      space 60. As shown in Fig. 11 , in this space 60 the hydrogen
      atoms 37 are arranged in the form of adsorbed H- ions in the above
      described crystalline structure. This occurs also for transition
      metals that crystallize in a body-centred cubic crystalline
      structure, as shown in the perspective view of Fig. 9, where the
      five atoms 2 are shown arranged at the vertices and at the centre
      of a diagonal plane of a cube, and also for metals that
      crystallize in the structure of Fig. 10.<br>
      <br>
      The step of prearranging clusters 110, in case of an active core
      that is obtained by depositing a predetermined amount of said
      transition metal in the form of micro/nanometric clusters on a
      surface of a substrate, is shown with higher detail in the block
      diagram of Fig. 12 and in the temperature profile of Fig. 13. In
      particular, after a step 111 of loading a substrate in a
      preparation chamber, a step 113 is provided of depositing the
      transition metal on the substrate preferably by means of
      sputtering, or spraying, or epitaxial deposition; the deposited
      metal is then heated further up to a temperature close to the
      melting temperature Tf (Fig. 13), in order to bring it to an
      incipient fusion, and then follows a slow cooling, step 118, in
      particular up to an average core temperature of about
      600&lt;0&gt;C, after which a quick cooling 119 is operated up to
      room temperature. This has the object of "freezing" the cluster
      structure that had been obtained at high temperature, which would
      otherwise evolve towards balance, without stopping at a cluster
      size, if the slow cooling 118 would be continued.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 14 a block diagram is shown an alternative step of
      prearranging clusters 110, in which the depositing step 113 is
      followed by a step 114 of cleaning the substrate, which is carried
      out preferably by means of repeatedly creating and removing a
      vacuum of at least 10&lt;~9&gt; bar at a temperature of at least
      350&lt;0&gt;C. Such operative conditions, in particular the ultra
      high vacuum, have the object for quantitatively removing any gas
      that is adsorbed on or adsorbed in the substrate, which would
      reduce drastically the interactions between the valence electron
      plasma of surface 23 and the hydrogen ions H", avoiding the
      adsorption of the hydrogen 31 in the clusters 21 even if a
      physical surface adsorption has been achieved. Then a treatment
      step 120 follows of the clusters 21 with a flow of cold hydrogen,
      which causes also the quick cooling step 119. As shown in the
      diagram of Fig. 15, in a period of the cooling step 119 the
      temperature of the active core is higher than the critical
      temperature TD, which allows an adsorption of the hydrogen
      negative ions 37 in the clusters 21 (Fig. 3), such that at the end
      of step 110, after the quick cooling step 119, an active core is
      obtained that is adapted to be triggered, without that a specific
      treatment with hydrogen and a specific heating step 130 are
      necessary (v. Fig. 1 ).<br>
      <br>
      In any case, the step 120 of feeding hydrogen is carried out in
      order to provide a relative pressure between 0,001 millibar and 10
      bar, preferably between 1 millibar and 2 bar, to ensure an optimal
      number of hits of the hydrogen molecules 31 against surface 23,
      avoiding in particular surface desorption and other undesired
      phenomena caused by excessive pressure; furthermore, the speed 32
      of the hydrogen molecules 31 (Fig. 3) is less than 3 m/s, and has
      a direction substantially parallel to surface 23, in order to
      obtain small angles of impact 39 that assist the adsorption and
      avoid back emission phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 15, furthermore, the temperature is shown beyond which the
      planes reticular start sliding, which is set between the
      temperatures corresponding to the absorption peaks [alpha] and
      [beta], above which the adsorption of the H- ions 37 in the
      clusters 21 is most likely. Figure 15 refers also to the case in
      which, after the step of adsorption of hydrogen, that is effected
      at a temperature that is higher than critical temperature TD, a
      cooling step 119 is carried out at room temperature of the active
      core. The step of triggering 140 follows then a specific heating
      step 130 starting from the room temperature up to the
      predetermined temperature Ti that is larger than the Debye
      temperature of the metal TD, in a time t&lt;*&gt; that is as short
      as possible, preferably less than 5 minutes, in order not to
      affect the structure of the clusters and/or to cause desorbing
      phenomena before triggering step 140.<br>
      <br>
      The critical temperature T0 is normally set between 100 and
      450&lt;0&gt;C, more preferably between 200 and 45O&lt;0&gt;C;
      hereafter the Debye temperature is indicated for some of the
      metals above indicated: Al 426K; Cd 186K; Cr 610K; Cu 344.5K; Au
      165K; [alpha]-Fe 464K; Pb 96K; [alpha]-Mn 476K; Pt 240K; Si 640K;
      Ag 225K; Ta 240K; Sn 195K; Ti 420K; W 405K; Zn 300K.<br>
      <br>
      Such impulsive triggering action generates lattice vibrations, or
      phonons, having an amplitude such that the H- ions can pass the
      second activation threshold and achieve the conditions necessary
      for replacing electrons of atoms of the metal, creating
      metal-hydrogen complex ions (Fig. 5).<br>
      <br>
      The orbital capture of the H- ions 37 is assisted by a gradient of
      temperature between two points of the active core, in particular
      set between 100&lt;0&gt;C and 300&lt;0&gt;C, which has a trend
      like the example shown in Fig. 24.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 16 an energy generator 50 is shown according to the
      invention, comprising an active core 1 housed in a generation
      chamber 53. The active core can be heated by an electric winding
      56 that can be connected to a source of electromotive force, not
      shown. A cylindrical wall 55 separates generation chamber 53 from
      an annular chamber 54, which is defined by a cylindrical external
      wall 51 and have an inlet 64 and an outlet 65 for a heat exchange
      fluid, which is used for removing the heat that is developed
      during the nuclear reactions. The ends of central portion 51 are
      closed in a releasable way respectively by a portion 52 and a
      portion 59, which are adapted also for supporting the ends in an
      operative position.<br>
      <br>
      Generator 50, furthermore, comprises a means 61 , 62, 67 for
      triggering the nuclear reaction, consisting of: a means for
      producing an impulsive electric current through an
      electrostrictive portion of the active core; - a means for casting
      a laser impulse on the active core.<br>
      <br>
      In Figs, from 19 to 23 three different embodiments are shown of an
      active core having an extended surface, using as substrate a body
      that is permeable to hydrogen, for example a package 81 of sheets
      82 of the transition metal, wherein a surface 83 can be in turn a
      porous surface; alternatively, the active core can also be a
      plurality of particles of whichever shape, preferably with nano-
      or micro- granulometry, in particular micro/nanometric clusters.
      Such particles can be sintered as shown in Fig. 20 to form a body
      85 having a desired geometry, or they can be loose, enclosed in a
      container 84, preferably of ceramic. Another possibility, shown in
      Fig. 22, consists of a tube bundle 86 where tubes 87 act as
      substrate for a layer 88 of transition metal that is deposited in
      the form of clusters at least on a surface portion of each tube

      The device of Fig. 17 has an elongated casing 10, which is
      associated with a means for making and maintaining vacuum
      conditions inside, not shown. In particular the residual pressure
      during the step of cleaning the substrate is kept identical or
      less than 10&lt;~9&gt; absolute bar, for removing impurities, in
      particular gas that is not hydrogen. Furthermore, a means is
      provided, not shown in the figures, for moving substrate 3 within
      casing 10, in turn on at least three stations 11 , 12 and 13.
      Station 11 is a chamber for preparation of the clusters where the
      surface of the substrate 3 is coated with a layer of a transition
      metal in the form of clusters by a process of sputtering. In
      chamber 11 a means is provided, not depicted, for bringing and
      maintaining the substrate at a temperature identical or higher
      than 350&lt;0&gt;C. In station 12 a cooling step 119 is carried
      out (Figs. 14 and 15) of the deposited metal on the substrate, by
      feeding cold hydrogen and at a pressure preferably set between 1
      millibar and 2 relative bar, so that they can be adsorbed on the
      metal. In station 13 instead a controlling step is carried out of
      the crystalline structure, for example by computing a physical
      property, such as thermal conductivity, electric conductivity, or
      refraction index, in order to establish the nature of clusters of
      the crystals deposited on the substrate 3; preferably,
      furthermore, a thickness control is carried out of the crystal
      layer and of the cluster surface density.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 18 represents diagrammatically a device 80 that comprises a
      single closed casing 90, in which a section for preparing an
      active core 1 of the type shown in Fig. 17 and a reactor 50 are
      enclosed, thus preserving the core from contamination, in
      particular from gas that is distinct from hydrogen during the time
      between the step of depositing the clusters and the step of
      triggering the reactions.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The problem of procurement of energy has driven industry and
      research laboratories more and more to study new sources of
      energy. Among these, a particularly interesting source is the
      nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      During the studies on nuclear fusion, one applicant has, to that
      end, realised a "Device for the startup and control of the process
      of energy production obtained by means of excitation of vibrations
      of the crystal lattice of a material containing deuterium,"
      described in Italian patent application no. SI/92/A/000002.<br>
      <br>
      The process upon which the functioning of said device is based
      comprises a step for the preparation of an electrode composed of a
      metallic material formed either by a single metal or by an alloy
      of metallic components capable of receiving deuterium, and having
      a precise crystalline structure, e.g. isometric. Said step of
      preparation of the electrode comprises first an operation of
      degassing the electrode in order to clean its crystalline
      structure. Subsequently, a certain quantity of deuterium (D) is
      let into the crystal lattice of the electrode at a pre-established
      temperature and pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Then, when the ratio of the number of deuterium atoms to the
      metallic atoms (D/Me) exceeds the threshold limit of 0.7, a fusion
      reaction D+D is activated among the deuterium atoms adsorbed in
      the crystal lattice following the application of a disturbance
      which sets the consecutive lattice planes into push-pull
      vibration.<br>
      <br>
      Systems for removal of the thermic energy generated by the fusion
      are provided for.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> </div>
      The device and process illustrated above, however, present
      considerable difficulties when it comes to actually putting them
      into practice. First of all, the use of deuterium is expensive in
      the case of industrial application of the device. Furthermore, the
      startup step of the reaction is scarcely controllable or
      repeatable.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, in many cases, the amount of energy obtained has been
      different than that expected on the basis of the energetic values
      attributable to a D+D reaction and, in any case, has been not
      constant in identical initial conditions of preparation and
      startup.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An object of the present invention is, instead, to provide a
      process for the generation of energy which is able to accomplish a
      fusion of hydrogen isotopes adsorbed on metal and which can be
      inexpensively reproduced at an industrial level as well as easily
      activated and shutdown.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide an energy
      generator which activates the abovementioned process.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects are accomplished by the present invention
      wherein the generation process is characterised by the fact that
      it comprises:<br>
      <br>
      - a charging step in a metallic core of a quantity of hydrogen
      isotopes H and D which are adsorbed in the crystal lattice of said
      core;<br>
      - a heating step in which said core charged with hydrogen isotopes
      is heated to reach a temperature higher than the threshold
      temperature corresponding to Debye's constant temperature of the
      material composing said core;<br>
      - a startup step of said core wherein a vibrational stress is
      produced which activates a nuclear fusion reaction of said
      hydrogen isotopes;<br>
      - a stationary step during which it is possible to exchange the
      heat produced by the H+D nuclear fusion reaction which occurs in
      the core because of a steady continuation of a coherent multimodal
      system of stationary oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      A step is also provided for the shutdown of the fusion reaction,
      in case it is necessary to interrupt it, by means of production of
      a further vibrational stress which disorganises said coherent
      multimodal system of stationary oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      The threshold temperature which must, necessarily, be surpassed in
      said heating step is Debye's constant and which, for many of the
      metals utilizable, is set out in table I. To have a greater
      probability of success of the reaction, said threshold temperature
      must be exceeded by at least a AT comprised between several
      degrees and several tens of degrees, according to the type of
      material in which the active core is formed. Debye's constant can,
      in any case, be calculated analytically, since it is equal to
      h/K*vcr, with h being Planck's constant, K being<br>
      Boltzmann's constant and vcr being a typical frequency of each
      material (for further details, see Charles Kittel, Introduction to
      Solid State Physics, John Willey &amp; Sons,<br>
      New York).<br>
      <br>
      The type of hydrogen to be adsorbed in said core is preferably
      natural hydrogen or, in other words, having a ratio between
      isotopes D and H of about 1/6000. It is however possible to obtain
      the reaction also with natural hydrogen depleted of or enriched
      with deuterium, with a ratio of isotopes D to H in any case higher
      than 1/80000 and preferably comprised between 1/10000 and 1/1000.<br>
      <br>
      The novel characteristic of the generator is that it is provided
      with a reactor comprising: - an active core, on which natural
      hydrogen possibly enriched with deuterium is adsorbed; - a
      generation chamber containing said active core; - a prechamber for
      heating of a thermal carrier fluid; - a dome for the collection of
      said thermal carrier fluid; - a plurality of tubes wherein said
      fluid flows from said prechamber to said collection dome crossing
      said generation chamber.<br>

      generator according to the present invention will become apparent

      <br>
      <br>
      With reference to figure 1, a generator for actuating the process
      according to the invention comprises a generation chamber 2
      crossed by a tube nest 5 in copper which extends between two
      flanges 10 welded to a support shell 11 which externally defines
      chamber 2. Tubes 5 cross flanges 10 and communicate with
      prechamber 3 comprising an annular jacket 3a delimited by a
      cylindrical shell 13 with inlets 3b. Furthermore, tubes 5
      communicate with a collection dome 4 communicating through flanged
      nozzles 14 with means for heat exchange and a circulation pump
      which are not shown.<br>
      <br>
      Chamber 2 communicates, through axial ducts 6 which cross dome 10
      on one side and prechamber 3 on the other side, with a gas tank
      and an air pump not shown by means of connections of a known type
      placed externally of shell 13. Ducts 6 are suited to feed hydrogen
      or other gases into chamber 2.<br>
      <br>
      On tubes 3, a metallic active core 1 of a thickness of several
      millimetres is electroplated. Around support shell 11, an electric
      coil 9, for example immersed in a ceramic matrix 9a, is wrapped.<br>
      <br>
      The fluid, coming from inlets 3b and crossing tube nest 5,
      preheats itself in the jacket 3a, and removes the heat generated
      in core 1 during an anharmonic fusion reaction of the isotopes of
      hydrogen, the startup of which will be described further on.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to figure 2, another embodiment of the generator
      according to the invention comprises an active core 1 having the
      form of a cylindrical bar inserted in chamber 2 contained in a
      heating cylinder 20 in which an electric winding 9 is immersed.<br>
      <br>
      A jacket 15 formed by a support shell 11 and a cylindrical shell
      13 allows for the passage of a thermal carrier fluid which enters
      through an inlet 22 and exits from an outlet 23 after having
      axially lapped shell 11.<br>
      <br>
      The gas present in chamber 2 is controlled through chamber 24
      communicating with a gas tank and with an air pump not shown by
      means of connections of a known type. Core 1 is in contact with an
      electrode 25 suited to transmit to it an impulse of a
      piezoelectric type to activate the anharmonic fusion reaction of
      the hydrogen isotopes as will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      In both the generators of figures 1 and 2, windings 9 have a
      multiple function since, besides generating a magnetic field
      necessary for the adsorption of the hydrogen by the core, they
      also have the function of heating the chamber of the thermal
      carrier fluid as well as the function of startup of the reaction,
      for example by means of an electrical impulse with a
      magnetostrictive effect.<br>
      <br>
      Core 1, in the first case shown (fig. 1), is a metal layer, for
      example a multiple layer of Nickel and Chromium alternated, while
      in the second case (fig. 2), it is a cylindrical metallic bar, for
      example of Nickel-Chromium steel. Core 1 preferably has a
      homogeneous surface without, in so far as possible, any nicks or
      defects. In the crystal lattice of core 1, by means of known
      techniques, natural hydrogen, having a ratio of D isotopes to H
      isotopes of about 1/6000, is made to adsorb. The percentage of
      deuterium D with respect to the hydrogen H can also be greater
      than that indicated even though, with<br>
      D/H ratio greater than 1/1000, there may not be an economic
      advantage in the exploitation of the reaction, due to the current
      costs of deuterium, as well as the difficulty of interrupting the
      reaction with a normal shutdown operation as will be described
      further on.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Charging step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Among the known techniques for charging hydrogen in the active
      core so that the hydrogen isotopes become chemically adsorbed in
      the crystal lattice, there are the following: - electrolytic
      adsorption - immersion of the core in a gaseous environment
      containing hydrogen at a pre-established temperature and pressure;
      - immersion of the core in solutions of HC1, HNO3, H2SO4; -
      immersion of the core in galvanic baths containing, for example,
      NH3 when the metal constituting the core is deposited on a support
      composed of a material such as Cu or ceramic.<br>
      <br>
      Some materials require the application of a magnetic field having
      an intensity greater than the saturation field, generally greater
      than 0.1 Tesla. In the two cases of the generators described
      above, the magnetic field is produced by winding 9.<br>
      <br>
      The absolute pressure of the hydrogen inside the generation
      chamber must be maintained at values preferably comprised between
      1 and 1000 millibar and, in any case, lower than 4 bar, beyond
      which adsorption no longer takes place unless at extremely high
      pressures ( &gt; 50 bar).<br>
      <br>
      The chemical adsorption of the hydrogen isotopes in the metal of
      the core causes the disassociation of the H2 and D2 molecules and
      the creation inside the crystalline structure of the core of
      covalent bonds (hydrides) between the H and D atoms with the
      metal. The electrostatic repulsion among the hydrogen atoms is
      screened by the excess of negative charge created by the free
      electrons of the metal. Therefore, the decrease of the
      electrostatic repulsion due to these bonds allows for the bonded
      atoms to approach one another more closely than is normally
      possible with free atoms in identical conditions.<br>
      <br>
      When the crowding of the H and D isotopes adsorbed on the metal in
      the proportion stated above is sufficiently high, for example with
      a numeric ratio of hydrogen isotopes to metal atoms greater than
      0.3, a strong reticular vibration, however created, can make the
      two systems Me+H and D+Me approach one another, so that atoms H
      and D come to be at a distance lesser than that in which the
      nuclear force enters into play.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Heating step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      According to the invention, only when the temperature of the
      active core 1 is raised to a value higher than Debye's constant of
      the material composing the core, of which the values of many
      metals are listed in table 1, is it possible to successfully carry
      out the startup of the fusion reaction. In fact, only above said
      temperature do the number of anharmonic oscillations of the
      crystal lattice, in which the hydrogen is adsorbed, become greater
      than the number of oscillations of harmonic type with following
      increase of the probability that the vibrational wave vectors add
      up one another.It is, however, necessary that, in order to
      successfully activate the reaction, Debye's constant be exceeded
      by several degrees to several tens of degrees according to the
      metal used for the core, so as to allow the "population" of
      anharmonic oscillations to sufficiently exceed that of the
      harmonic oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      The heating step can be carried out by means of any known system,
      for example thermoelectric heating, oxidation of combustibles or
      other exoenergetic chemical reactions, recombination of ions into
      polyatomic molecules, laser impulses and immersion in hot fluids.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Startup step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      At the points of the core on which the hydrogen has been adsorbed
      or, in other words, in proximity to the external surface of the
      core, a push-pull oscillation of the lattice can successfully
      cause two hydrogen isotopes, respectively hydrogen H and deuterium
      D, to approach one another more closely than the critical distance
      at which, as described above, the nuclear forces enter into play.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, it is possible, in the conditions
      described above and only in those conditions, to activate the
      localised nuclear reaction described above, producing a stress in
      the active core capable of producing the coherent addition of a
      great number of wave vectors thus obtaining a local gigantic
      vibrational impulse capable of sufficiently exciting the crystal
      lattice where the hydrogen isotopes are adsorbed. Local volume
      variations due to expansion of the active core surface have been
      measured which are 20 times greater than those measured in the non
      active portion of the core.<br>
      <br>
      Each H+D fusion produces He, freeing 5,5 MeV, which is sufficient
      energy to completely vaporise the area surrounding the point in
      which the reaction has occurred.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the complete H+D reaction would be H+D = 3He + 7 of
      5,5 MeV. However, in this case, no 7 photons or other particles
      are freed from the core, since the duration of covalent
      hydrogen-metal bonds is on the order of leo~15 - 10-16 seconds,
      whereas the nuclear interaction time is on the order of 10 18 -
      leo 21 seconds. Therefore, the energy freed from the fusion can
      dissipate through the lattice without emission of particles or 7
      photons. (See Max Born, Atomic Physics, ed. Blacky and Son,
      Glasgow; A.F.Davydov, Teoria del nucleo atomico, ed Zanichelli,
      Bologna; G.K. Werthaim, Mssbauer Effect)<br>
      <br>
      In more detail, after having exceeded the Debye's constant, the
      probability that the H+D reaction is activated is grater when the
      anharmonic terms of the interatomic displacement become important,
      and this can happen only when the temperature is sufficiently
      higher than Debye's constant, at a characteristic temperature for
      each material. Under these conditions, following the production of
      a sufficiently strong stimulus by means of an external action, the
      quanta of vibrational energy crossing the crystal lattice, instead
      of oscillating in a disorganised manner, coherently interact with
      following addition of the wave vectors tangentially to the surface
      of the active core and with consequent creation of amplified
      energy peaks in particular points (loci).The wave trains which
      move on the active material of the core, besides creating
      localised fusions, form a coherent multimodal system of stationary
      oscillations inside portions of the active material of the core,
      thus causing a negative change of entropy and consequent discharge
      of heat, which can be exploited by the generator according to the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, the stationary wave continues to maintain itself by
      means of the pump effect produced by the H+D reactions. In fact,
      because the configuration of the lattice is altered by the
      localised vaporisations caused by the individual H+D fusions
      displaced in said loci, the wave vectors add up again in other
      loci, close to the previous ones but where the lattice is still
      intact, and activate further H+D reactions. With repetition of the
      fusions, the core comes to have a surface with a plurality of
      substantially equidistant cavities separated by tracts of still
      intact lattice, and the mass of the active core becomes
      progressively smaller as a result of the successive localised
      vaporisations.<br>
      <br>
      A further, significant contribution to the maintenance of the
      stationary wave is provided by the interaction of the electrons
      with the lattice, especially in the presence of a variable
      electromagnetic field. In fact, every transition from one Fermi's
      state to another involves the emission of a particle of a given
      frequency and wave vector.(See Charles Kittel, Introduction to
      Solid<br>
      State Physics, John Willey &amp; Sons, New York)<br>
      <br>
      The startup step can be carried out by means of various known
      types of impulses, as long as the rise time is less than 10~1
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      In cases in which the active core is composed of pure metals or
      their compounds with other elements or substances, steels,
      stainless steels, alloys or metallic systems of single or multiple
      layer, the startup step can be carried out according to one of the
      following methods.<br>
      <br>
      - Thermic stress method obtained through pressure gradients:
      polyatomic gas such as H2, D HD, as 2' 2' D, HT, C2H4, 0, NH3, N2
      , O2, etc., is inserted in the generation chamber with negative
      enthalpic difference of physical adsorption (AH) and a
      corresponding pressure gradient comprised between 1 millibar and 4
      bar. As already known, the gas introduced generates thermic stress
      on the surface of the active core, due to a transitory
      dissociation of the gas molecules and further sudden exoenergetic
      reaction forming again the molecules and catalysed by the surface
      of the core itself. Such thermic stress causes the formation of
      wave trains of reaction and quick startup of the process of energy
      production through nuclear fusion between H and D, as described
      above.The embodiment of figure 1 is designed for exactly this type
      of startup in which the polyatomic gas is introduced through ducts
      6 shown in figure 1. During the reaction, by means of the passage
      of current through winding 9 placed along the entire length of the
      core 1, a constant magnetic field comprised between 0.2 and 1.5
      Tesla is maintained.<br>
      <br>
      - Method with mechanic impulse: a mechanical impulse of torsion,
      traction or compression is applied to the ends of the active core
      with an intensity and rise time, for example 10 seconds,
      sufficient to provoke a structural deformation which then
      activates the fusion process.<br>
      <br>
      - Method with electric striction: an electrical current impulse is
      applied to the ends of the active core with suitable peak values
      and rise times, for example 1000<br>
      Ampere for 30 nanoseconds, to provoke a structural deformation
      which then activates the fusion process. The embodiment of figure
      2 is designed also for this type of startup, wherein the alternate
      voltage impulse is produced by an electrode 25 connected to active
      core 1 and fed by means of cables 8.<br>
      <br>
      - Optoelectronic method: A laser beam impulse of high potency, for
      example 1MW, is engraved on the core and provokes a shock wave and
      temperature stress which, in turn, cause a sudden structural
      deformation which then activates the fusion process.<br>
      <br>
      - Radio-frequency method: An impulse of radiofrequency is applied
      to the active core having a frequency which corresponds either to
      the resonance frequency of the spins of the hydrogen isotopes or
      to the plasma frequency of the free electrons of the crystal
      lattice.<br>
      <br>
      - Ultrasonic vibration method: The active core is contained in a
      resonant cavity. An energy impulse of ultrasonic vibrations is
      applied to the active core, having an intensity and duration (for
      example 10-1 seconds) sufficient to provoke the reaction of
      fusion.<br>
      <br>
      In cases in which the material forming the active core is a type,
      such as a crystal, which subject to the piezoelectric effect, the
      startup step can be activated by means of a method with inverse
      piezoelectric effect, sending to the ends of the metallic core
      alternate voltage impulses with a frequency equal to that of the
      mechanic resonance of the core with peak values (for example
      greater than 5kV) sufficient to provoke a structural deformation
      which then activates the process of fusion.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of figure 2 is also designed for this type of
      startup, in which the alternate voltage impulse is produced by
      electrode 25 connected to active core 1 and fed through cables 8.<br>
      <br>
      If, finally, the material forming the active core is of a
      ferromagnetic type, the startup step can be activated by means of
      a magnetostrictive method which consists in the production, along
      the metallic core, of a magnetic field with peak values higher
      than the intensity of magnetic saturation and a rise time lower
      than 10~1 seconds. This type of startup can be carried out both
      with the generator of figure 1 and that of figure 2 by applying an
      electromagnetic impulse through winding 9.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 4) Heat exchange step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Subsequent to the startup, the reaction is maintained in
      stationary conditions by exchanging heat by means of a thermal
      carrier fluid made to circulate in the tube nest 5 crossing the
      generation chamber of figure 1 or through jacket 15 of figure 2.
      The removal of heat must not exceed a level where it makes the
      temperature of the active core fall below Debye's constant, in
      which case a slow shutdown of the reaction would occur.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the thermal power which can be obtained, the
      dimensions and form of the active core play an important ro. The
      active core can have the form of a rod, a lamina, separate and/or
      tangled wires, free or pressed powder, with or without binder. For
      example, in generation chamber 2 of figure 1, the active core can
      be composed, rather than of metal deposited on tubes 5, of a
      plurality of bars placed in various points of the chamber itself.
      Alternatively, chamber 2 can be filled with metallic powder.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, the temperature of core 1 which houses the reaction must
      remain well under the temperature of transition, above which the
      lattice looses its crystalline properties and passes to an
      amorphous state comparable to the vitreous state, and this happens
      at temperatures which are lower than the melting temperature of
      each metal. In said conditions, in fact, the core would have a
      response to the oscillations completely different from the
      behaviour which occurs when the state is crystalline, because the
      preferential direction on which the wave vectors add up would
      disappear, with absolutely no possibility of having the
      above-described reaction.<br>
      <br>
      It is also necessary that the steady functioning temperature to
      which the core is brought does not approach particular critical
      temperatures, which are well known for every metal and
      identifiable from experimentally obtained adsorption diagrams, at
      which the phenomenon of progressive expulsion of hydrogen from the
      lattice occurs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Shutdown step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The reaction can be interrupted by arresting the coherent
      multimodal system of stationary oscillations by simply producing a
      further vibrational stress which disorganises the system through a
      positive local production of entropy.<br>
      <br>
      This can, for example, be accomplished by creating a forced vacuum
      in the generation chamber (absolute pressure less than 0.1
      millibar) and introducing a jet of gas with positive AH of
      dissociation, for example H2. Because of the impact with the
      active surface, the molecules dissociate, and a rapid removal of
      the lattice's energy occurs, with consequent negative temperature
      stress. The sudden temperature decrease provokes the
      disorganisation of the active loci and the shutdown of the nuclear
      reaction among the hydrogen isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, even leaving the pressure of the gas inside the
      generation chamber unaltered, it is sufficient to exchange heat
      cooling the active core up to the point where the temperature of
      the core itself is brought below Debye's constant. The exchange of
      heat can, for example, be accomplished by making a fluid at a
      temperature well under Debye's constant circulate in the tube nest
      crossing the generation chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In order to provide an even more detailed description of the
      process according to the present invention, in the following,
      several practical examples will be set out relative to the
      application of the abovementioned steps to a metallic active core
      whose crystal lattice has adsorbed a certain quantity of natural
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      On a 90 mm long bar with a diameter of 5 mm, made of a metallic
      material (Clunil) formed by isometric crystals having Nickel and
      Chromium atoms in equal number and alternated, natural hydrogen
      (D/H = 1/6000) was made to adsorb following the introduction of H2
      at a pressure of 500 mbar and temperature of 2200C with
      contemporaneous immersion in a magnetic field of 1 Tesla obtained
      by means of coil 9 wound around the core itself. The generator
      utilised was the one illustrated in figure 1, with tube nest 5 not
      coated with metallic layer.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber containing the bar was then gradually brought to a
      temperature of 200 above Debye's constant, which for Clunil is
      1920C.<br>
      <br>
      The startup occurred with the thermoelectric method (by a thermic
      impulse produced by a current impulse passing through winding 9),
      with the core inserted at all times in the above-mentioned
      magnetic field and immersed in natural hydrogen at a pressure of
      500 millibar. More precisely, the startup was obtained with an
      impulse intensity of 1000A and a rise time of 30 nanoseconds.<br>
      <br>
      During the course of the reaction, a total net average heat of
      1.29 MJ was removed per day, for 58 days, after which the reaction
      was stopped with a shutdown accomplished by the introduction of
      H2, after having temporarily provoked a vacuum (0.1 mbar).<br>
      <br>
      While stopping the reaction, it was observed that during the
      course of the transient, radioactive isotopes were detected, that
      it is believed are due to the impact against the neighbouring
      nuclei of the nuclei of H, D, 3He which are accelerated by the
      energy of 7 photons (5,5 MeV) produced by the last reactions H+D
      and not given to the lattice for activating further reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 2</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      On a 200 mm long Nickel bar with a diameter of 3 mm, natural
      hydrogen (D/H = 1/6000) was made to adsorb with the method of
      immersion in gaseous environment at the critical temperature of
      1980C and contemporaneous application of a magnetic field of 1
      Tesla obtained by means of coil 9 wound around the core. The
      generator used was the one illustrated in figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber containing the bar was then brought to a temperature
      of 200 above Debye's constant, which, for Nickel, is 1670C. <br>
      <br>
      The startup occurred with the electric striction method, or, in
      other words, by applying to the core an electrode through which an
      impulse of piezoelectric nature was transmitted. More precisely,
      the startup was obtained with an impulse of at least 10kV and a
      rise time of 0.1 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      During the reaction, a net total average heat of 4.74 MJ was
      removed per day, for a period of 31 days, after which, the
      reaction was stopped with a slow shutdown.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      On a 90 mm long bar with a diameter of 5 mm, made of AISI 316
      steel which has been tempered at 4000C to eliminate internal
      stresses, natural hydrogen (D/H = about 1/6000) was made to adsorb
      with the method of immersion into acid solution and then both
      immersion in gaseous environment at the absolute pressure of 600
      mbar and application of a magnetic field of 1 Tesla obtained by
      means of coil 9 wound around the core.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber containing the bar was then brought to a above Debye's
      constant and precisely at 3140C.<br>
      <br>
      The startup was accomplished both with the thermo electric method
      and by the thermal stress method due to gaseous recombination.<br>
      <br>
      During the reaction, a net total average heat of 2.64 MJ was
      removed per day, for a period of 34 days, after which the reaction
      was stopped with a slow shutdown obtained with cooling below the
      critical temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 4</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In a generator like the one illustrated in figure 1, comprising a
      generation chamber crossed by a tube nest made of copper, on each
      tube a layer of 2mm of pure Nickel was electroplated, in which
      natural hydrogen (D/H = about 1/6000) was made to adsorb with the
      method of immersion in gaseous environment at the absolute
      pressure of 600 mbar and contemporaneous application of a magnetic
      field of 1<br>
      <br>
      Tesla obtained by means of a coil wound around the core and
      immersed in a ceramic matrix.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber containing the strip of tubes was then brought to a
      temperature of 2100C, 570 above Debye's constant.<br>
      <br>
      The startup was accomplished with the magnetostrictive method, or,
      in other words, by applying an electromagnetic impulse to the core
      through winding 9.<br>
      <br>
      More precisely, the startup was obtained with an impulse of 0.8
      Tesla and rise time of 0.1 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      During the reaction, by means of thermal carrier fluid crossing
      the strip of tubes, an net total average heat of 4.9 MJ was
      exchanged per day, for a period of 6 days, after which, the
      reaction was stopped with a slow shutdown obtained with cooling
      below the critical temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The industrial applicability of the generation process and of the
      generator which actuates said process is, therefore, evident,
      given that they allow for the production of energy in the form of
      heat by means of nuclear fusion at limited temperatures, without
      emission of radioactive or otherwise dangerous particles and for
      long periods. The materials used both for the active core and for
      the rest of the generator are inexpensive, thus providing
      considerable possibilities for economic exploitation.<br>
      <br>
      In cases in which the active core is formed in a material having a
      higher Debye's constant, such as Silicon (6400K), the temperature
      at which heat exchange takes place is higher than in the examples
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is possible to directly exploit the energy acquired
      by the thermal carrier fluid which crosses the generator, for
      example to move turbine blades or for similar applications.<br>
      <br>
      The creation of 3He, as a product of the reaction, is,
      furthermore, also industrially exploitable given the present high
      cost of this gas. <br>

      for production of thermal energy is based on the fusion of nuclei
      of deuterium, entrapped in the crystal lattice of a deuterisable
      material, used as material sensitive to the type of excitation
      selected. The thermo-optomagnetopiezo-electrode constitutes the
      lattice activation system for the trapping of D and H and for
      priming the fusion, and it represents the basic element of the
      process: the operation consists in the production of a sonic wave
      train, with frequency depending on the dimensions and the physical
      characteristics of the system, by thermal or thermoelectric or
      magnetomechanical or piezoelectric or presso-optical or
      presso-mechanical excitation, or generated by the shock wave of
      molecular or particle beams, ions, protons, deuterons, neutrons,
