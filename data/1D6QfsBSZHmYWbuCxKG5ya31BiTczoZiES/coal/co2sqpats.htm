      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> Method and apparatus for Scrubbing exhaust
        streams to approach Zero Emissions with utility in Coal Fired
        Electricity Generation. The Scrubbing "Ionized" Rainstorm Tunnel
        (S.I.R.T.) a.k.a. Natural State Hydrologic Cycle Emulator
        comprises a tunnel that sprays exhaust streams with "ionized"
        water, cost effectively scrubbing toxic constituents mimicking
        the atmospheric and hydrologic cycle. Various tunnel
        configurations greatly increase dwell times beyond that of other
        methods to any chosen scrubbing agent allowing for more complete
        absorption of all toxic emissions i.e. sulfates, nitrates, heavy
        metals and volatile organic compounds produced by combustion of
        coal or other dirty fuels. The design incorporates advantageous
        removal points for further micro and nano effluent treatment and
        simplified sequestration of Carbon Dioxide if desired. A Nozzle
        Automated Positioning and Retrieval System (NAPRS) allows for
        continuous operation of boilers or other processes as failed

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> A method is claimed for enabling storage of
        greater volumes of carbon dioxide for sequestration while
        simultaneously enhancing methane recovery from the coal bed. The
        process is implemented by injecting hydrogen into a coal bed,
        such as a depleted underground coal deposit, at a temperature
        below about 800 degrees Centigrade ( 10 ); extracting the
        hydrogen together with methane from the deposit ( 20 );
        separating the hydrogen from the methane ( 30 ); delivering the
        methane as a product of the process ( 40 ); reinjecting the
        separated hydrogen into the deposit to continue the process
        until sequestration of carbon dioxide is desired ( 50 );
        optionally producing hydrogen from methane ( 60 ) and optionally
        injecting carbon dioxide for sequestration. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A method and apparatus for separating gas
        mixtures containing synthesis gas (syngas) into separate streams
        of wet hydrogen containing significantly reduced amounts of CO2
        and CO, with the CO2 being "sequestration ready" and containing
        less than 1% fixed gases. In the preferred embodiment, a mixture
        of limestone and iron oxide circulates between two fluidized
        beds whereby one bed is fluidized with a gas containing syngas,
        while the other bed is fluidized with a gas containing steam and
        oxygen. As the fluidizing gas containing syngas passes through

        <b>Hydrocarbon combustion power generation system with CO2
          sequestration</b> </p>
      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> A low or no pollution engine is provided
        for delivering power for vehicles or other power applications.
        The engine has an air inlet which collects air from a
        surrounding environment. At least a portion of the nitrogen in
        the air is removed using a technique such as liquefaction,
        pressure swing adsorption or membrane based air separation. The
        remaining gas is primarily oxygen, which is then compressed and
        routed to a gas generator. The gas generator has an igniter and
        inputs for the high pressure oxygen and a high pressure
        hydrogen-containing fuel, such as hydrogen, methane or a light
        alcohol. The fuel and oxygen are combusted within the gas
        generator, forming water and carbon dioxide with carbon
        containing fuels. Water is also delivered into the gas generator
        to control the temperature of the combustion products. The
        combustion products are then expanded through a power generating
        device, such as a turbine or piston expander to deliver output
        power for operation of a vehicle or other power uses. The
        combustion products, steam and, with carbon containing fuels,
        carbon dioxide, are then passed through a condenser where the
        steam is condensed and the carbon dioxide is collected or
        discharged. A portion of the water is collected for further
        processing and use and the remainder is routed back to the gas
        generator. The carbon dioxide is compressed and cooled so that
        it is in a liquid phase or super critical state. The dense phase
        carbon dioxide is then further pressurized to a pressure
        matching a pressure, less hydrostatic head, existing deep within
        a porous geological formation, a deep aquifer, a deep ocean
        location or other terrestrial formation from which return of the
        CO2 into the atmosphere is inhibited. <br>

        <b>System for small particle and CO2 removal from flue gas using

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> A novel stack application for improved
        carbon dioxide and particle removal/collection from flue gases
        produced during coal power-generation processes. Flue gas
        tangential inlet velocity is increased to subject upward-flowing
        flue gas in a stack to a centrifugal force, thereby propelling
        entrained solid particles and CO2 in the flue gas to the stack
        wall for collection. Collection efficiency is further improved
        by a cascading water film or algae-laden water film on the
        inside of the stack wall and on surfaces of an optional
        internally mounted vortex generator to eliminate the
        re-entrainment of small particles and for ease of transporting
        the captured particles in a slurry. The stack can also be
        utilized as a photochemical or a biological reactor to promote a
        photosynthesis reaction between carbon dioxide and algae-laden
        water to form carbohydrate substrates for carbon dioxide
        sequestration and utilization. <br>

        <b>Method for reducing CO2, CO, NOX, and SOx emissions</b> </p>
      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> Industrial combustion facilities are
        integrated with greenhouse gas-solidifying fertilizer production
        reactions so that CO2, CO, NOx, and SOx emissions can be
        converted prior to emission into carbonate-containing
        fertilizers, mainly NH4HCO3 and/or (NH2)2CO, plus a small
        fraction of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4. The invention enhances
        sequestration of CO2 into soil and the earth subsurface, reduces
        N03- contamination of surface and groundwater, and stimulates
        photosynthetic fixation of CO2 from the atmosphere. The method
        for converting CO2, CO, NOx, and SOx emissions into fertilizers
        includes the step of collecting these materials from the
        emissions of industrial combustion facilities such as fossil
        fuel-powered energy sources and transporting the emissions to a
        reactor. In the reactor, the CO2, CO, N2, SOx, and/or NOx are
        converted into carbonate-containing fertilizers using H2, CH4,
        or NH3. The carbonate-containing fertilizers are then applied to
        soil and green plants to (1) sequester inorganic carbon into
        soil and subsoil earth layers by enhanced carbonation of
        groundwater and the earth minerals, (2) reduce the environmental
        problem of NO3-runoff by substituting for ammonium nitrate
        fertilizer, and (3) stimulate photosynthetic fixation of CO2
        from the atmosphere by the fertilization effect of the
        carbonate-containing fertilizers. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> A method of generating power with
        sequestration of carbon-dioxide emission includes compressing
        ambient air, separating substantially pure oxygen from the
        ambient air and then further compressing the substantially pure
        oxygen separated from the ambient air. After the oxygen has been
        further compressed, the oxygen is divided into a first oxygen
        stream and a second oxygen stream. The method includes
        introducing the first oxygen stream and a solid fuel, such as
        coal, into a solid-fuel gasifier for converting the first oxygen
        stream and the solid fuel into a combustible gas and combusting
        the gas in the presence of the second oxygen stream, the
        combusting step including the step of introducing water into the
        combustor during the combusting step for generating an exhaust
        stream of carbon dioxide and steam. The exhaust stream of carbon
        dioxide and steam is then passed through a turbine for driving
        the turbine and generating power. The exhaust stream is then
        cooled for producing carbon dioxide gas and water so that the
        carbon dioxide gas may be separated from the water and
        collected. Introducing water into the combustor during the
        combusting step increases the mass flow and the volume flow of
        the exhaust stream passing through the turbine, thereby
        elevating the amount of power generated by the turbine. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The present invention provides a method of
        sequestering carbon dioxide in aqueous environments. In a first
        step, an area is assessed to determine whether the area is
        capable of supporting the addition of organisms of higher
        trophic level (OHTL). Next, OHTL are added to the area in order
        to produce enough rapidly sinking and refractory particulate
        matter (PM) to sequester carbon dioxide above the level of
        carbon dioxide sequestration that exists before the addition of
        OHTL. Preferably, the PM produced by the OHTL sinks at rates
        significantly greater than and/or is significantly less
        biodegradable than that produced by other components of the

              Percent Of Carbon Dioxide From Smokestack Gases</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>ScienceDaily (May 20, 2008)  Researchers in Wyoming report
        development of a low-cost carbon filter that can remove 90
        percent of carbon dioxide gas from the smokestacks of electric
        power plants that burn coal and other fossil fuels. </p>
      <p>Maciej Radosz and colleagues at Wyoming's Soft Materials
        Laboratory cite the pressing need for simple, inexpensive new
        technologies to remove carbon dioxide from smokestack gases.
        Coal-burning electric power plants are major sources of the
        greenhouse gas, and control measures may be required in the
        future. </p>
      <p>The study describes a new carbon dioxide-capture process,
        called a Carbon Filter Process, designed to meet the need. It
        uses a simple, low-cost filter filled with porous carbonaceous
        sorbent that works at low pressures. Modeling data and
        laboratory tests suggest that the device works better than
        existing technologies at a fraction of their cost. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> </p>
      <p>A low-pressure Carbon Filter Process (patent pending) is
        proposed to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from flue gas. This
        filter is filled with a low-cost carbonaceous sorbent, such as
        activated carbon or charcoal, which has a high affinity (and,
        hence, high capacity) to CO2 but not to nitrogen (N2). This, in
        turn, leads to a high CO2/N2 selectivity, especially at low
        pressures. The Carbon Filter Process proposed in this work can
        recover at least 90% of flue-gas CO2 of 90%+ purity at a
        fraction of the cost normally associated with the conventional
        amine absorption process. The Carbon Filter Process requires
        neither expensive materials nor flue-gas compression or
        refrigeration, and it is easy to heat integrate with an existing
        or grassroots power plant without affecting the cost of the
        produced electricity too much. An abundant supply of low-cost
        CO2 from electricity producers is good news for enhanced oil
        recovery (EOR) and enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBMR)
        operators, because it will lead to higher oil and gas recovery
        rates in an environmentally sensitive manner. A CO2-rich mixture
        that contains some nitrogen is much less expensive to separate
        from flue-gas than pure CO2; therefore, mixed CO2/N2-EOR and
        CO2/N2-ECBMR methods are proposed to maximize the overall carbon
        capture and utilization efficiency. </p>

        <b>Abstract </b>--- Polymeric materials containing ionic
        groups, which can be used as membranes and sorbents for
        separating gas components, for example, separating CO2 from flue
        gas streams and from natural gas streams, and sorbents for
        storing gas components. Such separation materials are used for
        pre-combustion separations, post-combustion separations, and
        natural gas separations, and are alternatives to the
        conventional amine absorption process. </p>
