      <p><a name="yield"></a><b>Yields ~</b> </p>
      <p>There are such variations between individual processes and
        particularly
        between individual coals that it is difficult to make
        generalized
        statements
        on yields from low temperature carbonization. It is well to
        remember
        that
        no processing can increase the heat yield per ton of coal. Aside
        from a
        slightly better heat balance in the low temperature process, it
        must be
        remembered that individual processes differ only in the
        distribution of
        heat units between gas, tar and coke. Low temperature processes
        obtain
        more tar at the expense of less gas than the high temperature
        processes.
        Likewise, the lower temperature of the former yields less
        ammonia, and
        through the absence of cracking, a higher thermal value gas
        which
        naturally
        yields much light oil upon scrubbing. </p>
      <p>To present some general idea of the economics of operating a
        low
        temperature
        carbonization plant, assuming the use of a medium grade high
        volatile
        bituminous
        coal as the raw fuel, some representative yields of various
        types of
        plants
        may be set down as a basis of comparison. For convenience of
        study, we
        may classify low temperature carbonization processes into 3
        types as
        follows:
        Type 1, the average externally heated low temperature retort;
        Type 2,
        the
        average internally heated low temperature retort; and Type 3,
        the
        average
        low temperature process combined with complete gasification of
        the
        coke.
        Type 4, as hereafter given for comparison, represents average
        high
        temperature
        practice. The yields per net ton, given in Table 121, are based
        upon
        the
        various processes that have been proposed. </p>
      <p>The data in Table 121, for low temperature processes, have been
        tabulated
        from the results reported by about 15 full-scale plants, as
        collected
        by
        the author, and as gathered by Sinnatt (357). The yields from
        high
        temperature
        operation are those reported by Tryon and Bennit (358) as the
        average
        results
        from by-product coke oven operation in the US. The reasonability
        of the
        results given in Table 121 have been checked by the heat balance
        given
        hereafter in Table 122. The fact that the data for Type 1,
        externally
        heated
        process, as given in table 121, are not the same as those
        reported in
        table
        12 of Chapter I is not conflicting, for the former is an average
        result,
        while the latter is an individual case. This apparent difference
        illustrates
        what departures specific processes may take from the average
        yield. In
        this classification, it is assumed that the Type 2 plant obtains
        its
        heating
        medium by the introduction of air at the bottom of the retort to
        partially
        gasify enough of the fuel to distill the charge by the sensible
        heat of
        the producer gas thus generated, so that the 34,000 cubic feet
        of gas
        produced
        consist of a mixture of about 4,200 cu ft of low temperature
        coal gas
        and
        about 29,900 cu ft of producer gas. It is further assumed that
        in the
        Type
        3 plant the low temperature and producer gas are mixed in the
        proportion
        of 4,200 cu ft of the former to 107,800 cu ft of the latter. </p>
      <p>On the assumption of a 13,000 BTU/lb raw coal, the average
        calorific
        value of the semi-coke, in the case of Type 1, is about 12,850
        BTU/lb,
        while the solid residuum in Type 2 has a higher ash content, due
        to
        partial
        gasification, an hence a lower calorific value of about 12,350
        BTU/lb.
        These figures check with the results of a number of full-scale
        experiments.
        The average calorific value of low temperature tar ranges from
        15,000
        BTU
        to 16,500 BTU/lb. From these figures it is possible to construct
        a heat
        balance of the various types of carbonization processes, as
        given in
        Table
        122. There is very little doubt that Type 2 has the greatest
        thermal
        efficiency,
        compared with the others. This arises from the fact that the
        heat is
        generated
        where it is used, thus increasing the efficiency of heat
        transfer and
        reducing
        radiation losses. The externally heated low temperature process,
        or
        Type
        1, is next the most efficient, because in comparison to high
        temperature
        processes, the thermal gradient is lower with corresponding
        reduction
        in
        heat losses. Furthermore, less sensible heat is carried away by
        the
        solid
        and volatile products. </p>

      <p><a name="revenu"></a><b>Revenue From Operation ~</b> </p>
      <p>From the yields reported in Table 121 and known market prices
        for
        the
        products of Type 4, it is possible to construct a financial
        account for
        the other types of processes, which, barring prejudice, will
        represent
        a fair financial statement in the average case. But is must be
        borne in
        mind always that the average represents only a probable
        condition and a
        specific situation bears no relation to the average, whatever,
        but
        depends
        upon local market conditions and upon binding contracts for the
        delivery
        of large quantities of certain of the carbonization products.
        Take, for
        example, the Type 4 process of Table 121, which represents the
        average
        high temperature by-product coke oven. As reported by Tryon and
        Bennit
        (358), the average price received in the US during 1926 for
        by-product
        coke was $6.95/ton, while the same coke, when sold wholesale for
        domestic
        fuel, brought an average of $7.40/ton. The coke breeze, of which
        the
        total
        coke yield amount to about 6.5%, was disposed of at an average
        price of
        $3.50 per net ton. The average price in the US of by-product
        coke tar
        was
        $0.051/gal and 93.3% of it was used for fuel in boilers and in
        open
        hearth
        or other metallurgical furnaces. The average price of coke oven
        gas was
        $0.163 per thousand cu ft, but this average was composed of a
        wide
        variation
        of sale prices. Of the entire by-product of oven gas yielded in
        the US
        during 1926, 25.5% was sold for city gas at $0.335 per thousand
        cu ft,
        8.2% was sold as industrial fuel at $0.162 per thousand cu ft,
        62.5%
        was
        sold to steel mills at $0.112 per thousand cu ft, and the
        remaining
        6.6%
        was used as boiler fuel at $0.55 per thousand cu ft. Gentry
        (359) has
        also
        pointed out a specific case of this variation in price for a
        single
        by-product
        coke plant. </p>
      <p>On the basis of the average prices quoted above and of the
        average
        yields
        reported in Table 121, the author has estimated in Table 123 the
        average
        revenue to be expected in the US for Type 4 process. Type 4a is
        based
        upon
        the average known sale prices, while Type 4b is based upon the
        assumption
        that all the coke was sold at the average known price received
        for
        domestic
        coke and that all the surplus gas was sold at the known average
        price
        obtained
        for wholesale city supply. The average cost of raw gas coal at
        the
        ovens
        in the US during 1926 was $43.88 per net ton, according to Tryon
        and
        Bennit
        (358). It is possible to use, in low temperature carbonization
        processes,
        classes of high grade, high volatile, but yet cheaper coals,
        which are
        not suitable for use in high temperature ovens. It is
        reasonable,
        therefore,
        to value the raw coal for a Type 1 process at $3.25/net ton and
        that
        for
        Type and type 3 processes, which can satisfactorily use a lower
        grade
        of
        fuel, at $3.30/net ton. Figured conservatively, n a straight
        heat
        content
        basis from the average price of $0.335 per thousand cubic feet
        received
        for coke oven gas sold for city use, the Type 1 process gas is
        worth
        $0.54
        per thousand cubic feet. N a straight thermal basis, type 2 gas
        is
        worth
        $0.075 per thousand cubic feet and Type 3 gas should bring
        $0.055 per
        thousand
        cubic feet when calculated from the average price of $0.163
        obtained
        for
        coke oven gas in the US. This more conservative evaluation of
        the lower
        calorific gas is adopted because of the greater difficulty
        associated
        with
        its disposition. The price of $0.065/gal assigned to low
        temperature
        tar
        is half a cent higher than that given by Porter (360), is equal
        to a
        contract
        price reported by Runge (361), and is considerably below the
        value
        assigned
        to it by many other authorities. The light oil has been figured
        at
        $0.228,
        which is the average pric3 obtained for benzol in the US during
        1926.
        In
        all cases, the average ammonium sulfate sale price of $0.021/lb
        during
        the same year has been used. The value of Type 2 coke for
        domestic fuel
        is deemed equal to that of type 4b, while, all things being
        considered,
        that of Type 1 coke should be sold easily at the slightly
        enhanced
        price
        of $7.75/net ton. This figure is considerably lower than that
        given by
        Runge (361) and that known to the present author for individual
        sales. </p>
      <p>Since the market conditions in Europe are different from those
        in
        the
        US, and in particular since the operating costs, due largely to
        cheaper
        labor, are lower, one may expect lower gross revenue from a
        carbonization
        plant in operation abroad than from one in the US. The data in
        Table
        124
        are largely from full-scale plants existing in Great Britain.
        The
        figures
        for the Maclaurin plant are after Tupholme (248), those for
        Coalite are
        by Everard-Davies (362), those for the Tozer process were
        announced by
        the management (363), Tupholme (251) reported the data on the
        Nielsen
        process,
        Runge (361), those for the K.S.G. retort, and Sinnatt (357)
        secured the
        figures for the Pure Coal Briquet or Sutcliffe-Evans process
        from the
        management.
        The average gross revenue for these 6 plants is $3.60/ton, which
        is
        somewhat
        greater than the $2.16/ton computed by Pope (364) using ver6
        conservative
        yields, slightly greater than $3.14 given by Brooks (365), and
        considerably
        less than the $4.32 figured by Runge (366). </p>

      <p><a name="capop"></a><b>Capital &amp; Operating Costs ~</b> </p>
      <p>The capital expenditure required to erect a complete low
        temperature
        carbonization plant is difficult to ascertain; first, because
        there is
        such a variation between the many processes that have been
        devised and
        between the numerous coals treated; second, because there is a
        wide
        divergence
        in the cost of labor and material in various localities; and
        third,
        because
        little has been made public, or few records kept, of those
        large-scale
        plants which have been built. Even if such records were
        available,
        these
        plants were more or less experimental in nature and many
        expensive
        alterations,
        which would not have been necessary in another installation,
        were made.
        The by-product plant, however, is more or less standard, so that
        for
        these
        items in the capital cost, a fairly accurate estimate can be
        made. As
        far
        as the by-product condensing, the light oil scrubbing, and the
        ammonium
        sulfate are concerned, a very careful estimate, on a comparative
        basis,
        has been made from standard practice. Including everything
        except land,
        power plant, and gas-holders, the cost estimates for the various
        types
        of plants previously discussed are given in Table 125 on the
        basis of
        the
        investment required per net ton of daily coal throughput. Type
        1a
        refers
        to the average externally heated low temperature process which
        involves
        a large number of static units, while Type 1b refers to an
        average
        externally
        heated low temperature process which involves a large dynamic
        unit,
        such
        as a rotary retort. It is assumed that the plant capacity will
        be at
        least
        1000 tons of coal per day. </p>
      <p>The only point that can really be questioned in Table 125 is
        the
        item
        representing the cost of the various retorts and settings. In
        justification
        of these estimates, it may be said that many have been quoted at
        a
        higher
        and many at a lower figure, and in the absence of a more
        complete
        knowledge
        of costs, those estimated in the table are considered as close
        an
        approximation
        as one may expect. As a matte of fact, the present author has
        record of
        11 independent estimates of the total cost of 6 specific low
        temperature
        carbonization plants complete, including by-product equipment,
        the
        average
        of which is $1,495 per ton of daily throughput. This is
        considered an
        excellent
        check on the figures of Table 125, when it is noted that the
        average of
        the four types of processes is $1,540/ton of daily throughput.
        Four
        independent
        estimates of two Type 2 processes known to the author averaged
        $1,265
        and
        compare favorably with $1,290 given in the table. Likewise, 3
        independent
        estimates of two Type 1a processes known to the author averaged
        $1,635,
        which is in fair agreement with the figure tabulated. In special
        cases,
        it is not doubted that the investment given in Table 125 can be
        considerably
        reduced, even to the figure of $800/ton of daily throughput,
        quoted by
        Brooks (365) as being conservative, but hardly to $600, as given
        by
        some
        other writers unless, of course, radical omissions or departures
        are
        made
        from standard by-product equipment. </p>

      <p>Turning attention now to operating expenses and fixed charges,
        the
        essential
        items of cost, as distributed among various accounts, are
        estimated in
        Table 126, on the basis of cost per net ton of coal processed,
        assuming
        90% capacity factor for the plant. The supplies include, among
        other
        minor
        items, the sulfuric acid necessary in the manufacture of
        ammonium
        sulfate,
        the steam includes that admitted to the retort and that used in
        the
        by-product
        plant, while the power includes all the requirement for driving
        the
        retort
        mechanism, coal-handling devices, conveyers, pumps, etc. In
        justification
        of these figures, it may be said that the average of 5
        independent
        estimates
        and the records of total operating expenses for different low
        temperature
        plants known to the author was $1.39 per ton of coal treated,
        with a
        range
        extending from $1.58 to $1.20. This is in good agreement with
        the
        figures
        given in Table 126. The average cost of labor and supervision
        combined,
        as reported in 13 independent estimates known to the author on 6
        specific
        processes was $0.61 per ton of coal. Eight estimates of
        maintenance and
        repairs on 5 specific processes averaged $0.36 per ton of coal,
        while 5
        estimates of power and steam for 3 specific processes gave a
        mean
        figure
        of $0.22 per ton of coal. Consequently, the figures of Table 126
        are
        taken
        to agree with the concensus of expert opinion, both individually
        and as
        a whole, although they are somewhat higher than the $0.94 per
        ton given
        by Pope (364) for the total average operating expense in low
        temperature
        installations. It should be noted that no charge for heating the
        retorts
        or for the raw coal has been made in Table 126, as these
        expenses have
        already been charged off of the gross receipts in Table 123, the
        former,
        by computing the revenue only on surplus gas. It now remains to
        write
        off
        fixed charges, at the rate of 10% for depreciation, 8% for
        interest on
        investment, and 3% for taxes and insurance, to give the total
        operating
        and fixed charges per ton of coal treated. Subtraction of the
        total
        operating
        and fixed charges per ton of coal in Table 126 from the gross
        revenue
        per
        ton of coal in Table 123 gives the net revenue available for
        amortization
        of the investment, reserve funds, and dividends. </p>
      <p>Of all the items making up the cost of processing coal by
        carbonization
        at low temperatures, the fixed charges are the greatest, cost of
        labor
        is second, and maintenance and repairs are third. This indicates
        that
        economical
        primary carbonization requires, first, that the investment per
        unit
        throughput
        must be reduced to a minimum; second, that labor requirements
        must be
        kept
        as low as possible, by simplicity of operations and by the
        installation
        of labor-saving machinery; and third, that rugged construction
        and
        continuous
        operation with mass throughput should be encouraged, to gain the
        benefit
        of low repair and maintenance charges. Supervision and supplies
        are
        practically
        irreducible quantities. </p>
      <p><a name="econom"></a><b>Economics ~</b> </p>
      <p>So far as the economics of low temperature carbonization are
        concerned,
        the production of primary products is the only part of the
        problem
        which
        needs consideration, for upon these alone the industry must
        justify
        itself.
        The fractionation of low temperature tar into its many
        derivatives is
        another
        industry, that of tar refining, and it is not anticipated that
        the
        economics
        of primary oil distillation will be greatly different form those
        already
        obtaining in the petroleum and tar refining industries,
        notwithstanding
        certain plant changes as will be necessary to facilitate
        treatment of a
        different crude oil stock. </p>
      <p>The sale of low temperature tar and gas is a wholly new problem
        from
        that of the disposition of gas and tar from by-product coke
        ovens or
        from
        gas retorts, for they are distinctly different from the
        analogous
        products
        of high temperature distillation. The same may be said of low
        temperature
        coke. Nevertheless, there is bound to be a certain amount of
        indirect
        competition
        between them, to the extent that the price fluctuations of the
        products
        of the two different methods of coal processing can never be
        wholly
        unrelated. </p>
      <p><img src="127tab.gif" height="889" width="564"></p>
      <p>Table 127, illustrating the products of low temperature
        carbonization
        and their uses, as slightly modified by the author, was compiled
        by
        Ditto
        (367) and given later by Blauvelt (368). It shows very
        strikingly a few
        of the more important derivatives to be obtained from the
        primary
        products
        of coal and the manner in which they are absorbed by the
        industry. It
        will
        be readily appreciated that this table resembles in part a
        similar
        tabulation
        of the products and uses of high temperature by-product coking,
        of gas
        manufacture, and of petroleum distillation. A few of the
        products which
        occur in each of these industries are missing, and other
        products take
        their place. As a whole, however, the final uses are practically
        the
        same,
        a situation which demonstrates an ultimate relationship in the
        market
        fluctuations
        of high and low temperature carbonization products. The
        difference in
        the
        price levels of the two distinct classes of products must,
        therefore,
        be
        justified by their special values and the price movements of
        each will
        reflect, not only the conditions of supply and demand for
        products of
        its
        own class, but also for products of the other class. For this
        reason,
        no
        discussion of the economics of low temperature carbonization can
        avoid
        a study of the markets for high temperature products. A very
        excellent
        and comprehensive study of the problem of marketing the
        by-products
        from
        coal carbonization has been made by McBride (369). </p>
      <p>Practically all of the products of coal carbonization compete
        industrially
        with other materials. Thus tar, as a fuel, must compete with
        both
        anthracite
        and bituminous coal, as well as with petroleum, and coke must
        compete
        with
        anthracite both as a domestic fuel and a s a fuel for the
        generation of
        water gas. Coal gas and water gas compete for their place as
        domestic
        and
        industrial fuels. Light oil is used mostly as a motor fuel, and
        as such
        its price is determined by the market for petroleum and its
        refined
        products.
        Ammonia, used largely as a fertilizer, has its price determined
        by the
        availability and supply of other forms of fixed nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Aside from the prices for carbonization products determined by
        competitive
        markets, the rulings of public regulatory bodies further
        complicate the
        sale of by-products, particularly in the case of gas, which
        finds its
        most
        logical market in the city gas supply. In ordinary industrial
        enterprises,
        the margin of profit is determined by competition, but under the
        system
        of public utility regulation, the profits are limited by a
        public
        authority
        endowed with the power of establishing rates. Under such a
        system of
        regulation,
        the consumer of one or more of the products must bear the loss
        of
        income
        from other products. Consequently, a situation arise by virtue
        of this
        close relationship, whereby the price of one product can be
        almost
        entirely
        determined by the market conditions for another. </p>
      <p>While there are assuredly markets for coke, gas, and oils, they
        are
        not, at the present time, markets in which any special
        advantages of
        low
        temperature products are recognized. There is a difference in
        the
        quoted
        prices of foundry and of furnace coke by virtue of their special
        properties,
        but there can be no reflection of special value in the price of
        low
        temperature
        coke over coal as a domestic fuel until this special value is
        recognized
        by consumers. In the case of low temperature gas, the
        recognition is
        not
        hard to secure, but appreciation of the desirable nature of
        primary
        oils
        will be somewhat more difficult to obtain. It is an illogical
        proposition
        to expect an industry to pay the cost of treatment without being
        entitled
        to some financial return over the cost of preparing products
        which are
        ore desirable for particular purposes. As long as the
        fundamentals of
        such
        an industry are sound, the special value of the products will
        ultimately
        be reflected in their price. </p>
      <p>A good deal has been said at one time or another about the
        calorific
        value of semi-coke, relative t the raw coal from which it was
        made. As
        this is the characteristic of most importance in determining the
        value
        of low temperature coke, it is worthwhile to examine this point.
        Runge
        (366) has determined the thermal value of many semi-cokes
        produced from
        coals of the US and elsewhere, as compared with the calorific
        value of
        the raw coal before primary distillation. He found, as a general
        rule
        for
        high volatile low oxygen coals, that the thermal value of the
        coke was
        from 700 BTU/lb to 1000 BTU/lb less than that of the coal. With
        high
        volatile
        coals, the thermal values of the coal and coke were about the
        same, or
        the latter was slightly higher. This was particularly true of
        lignite,
        where, because of the high moisture content it was not unusual
        to find
        that the char had an increased calorific value of as much as
        2000
        BTU/lb
        over the raw material. </p>
      <p>Another point of view, in assessing the value of a fuel, is the
        consideration
        of what is known as form value or heat availability. A consumer
        will
        obviously
        pay more for a heat unit in the form of gas or of oil in the
        form of
        coal
        or of coke, by reason of the adaptability of these fuels to
        special
        purposes,
        where the heat of coal would not be available. The object of all
        coal
        processing
        is to increase its form value and all processing is accompanied
        by
        losses
        of material, incidental to handling, and of heat units,
        incidental to
        the
        production of power and heat for processing. Consequently, the
        output
        of
        heat units after processing will be materially les than before,
        but
        their
        form or availability will be increased To be economically sound,
        the
        conversion
        of the heat units from one form to another, must be such as to
        increase
        the value of the units sufficiently to make up for the
        conversion
        losses,
        pay the cost of processing, and yield a fair return on the
        capital
        investment.
        Doubtlessly, low temperature carbonization raises the form
        factor of
        the
        fuel and increases the availability of heat. </p>
      <p>The value of the carbonization products, other than the solid
        fuel,
        as seen from Table 123, represents approximately 40% of the
        total
        receipts
        for Type 1, externally heated processes; about 56% for type 2,
        internally
        heated processes; and 100% for Type 3, complete gasification
        processes.
        It is quite obvious from this that unless the cost of the raw
        material
        be unusually cheap, as in the case of shales and coal refuse,
        low
        temperature
        carbonization can never be commercially successful in externally
        heated
        processes for the sake of by-products alone, unless there is a
        great
        advance
        in the market price of these materials, relative to the raw
        coal. It is
        absolutely essential to the success of externally heated
        processes that
        the semi-coke be disposed of adequately, and almost
        correspondingly
        essential,
        in the case of internally heated processes by partial
        gasification,
        that
        the by-products be well marketed. Low grade slack coal is
        particularly
        adapted to low temperature carbonization processes. There are
        many
        mines
        in the US and abroad which are closed now but which are capable
        of
        producing
        large quantities of this material. The reopening of such
        workings to
        fulfill
        the demands of a new industry would not only be of mutual
        benefit, but
        of national economic importance. </p>
      <p>In considering the economics of carbonization, McBride (370)
        has
        pointed
        out that the counter-effect of fluctuations in the price of one
        by-product
        on the value of another by-product, or of a principal product,
        must not
        be overlooked. In the gas manufacturing industry, for example,
        it is
        well
        known that the price of gas is roughly the difference between
        the gross
        expenditure and the income derived from by-products.
        Consequently, the
        lowering of ammonium sulfate by as much as one cent a pound may
        mean a
        difference of as much as 5 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas.
        The
        gas
        and coke from any coal carbonization industry have to fluctuate
        inversely
        with the price of ammonium sulfate to bear the increased cost of
        production. </p>
      <p>Porter (360) has attempted to summarize the 3 phases of
        development
        that will give a great impetus to the progress of low
        temperature
        carbonization.
        Form the viewpoint of producing a smokeless fuel, these
        possibilities
        are:
        (1) to lower the cost of production below $1/ton; (2) to
        establish a
        sufficiently
        enhanced value for the semi-coke to enable it to bring a price
        equal to
        the coal from which it was made; and (3) to discover new uses
        for the
        primary
        tar and gases, such as will enhance their value above the
        by-product
        tar
        and gas of present commerce. Noteworthy advance in any of these
        fields
        will firmly establish the economics of low temperature
        carbonization,
        but
        all three phases will likely be solved in some measure of
        success. It
        is
        merely a question of raising the form value of the products and
        of
        lowering
        costs of conversion. </p>
      <p>The only economic justification for low temperature
        carbonization,
        or
        any other carbonization system for that matter, is its ability
        to show
        a satisfactory yield on the capital invested, through recovery
        and sale
        of by-products. In the case of low temperature carbonization
        integrated
        with another industry, such as the manufacture of city gas or
        the
        generation
        of electricity, the financial return need be only such as will
        show a
        reduction
        in the cost per unit of the final product, but in the case of
        manufacture
        of a solid fuel, to be merchandized to domestic and industrial
        consumers,
        the financial return must be such as to carry the additional
        costs of
        distribution. </p>
      <p>Unlike many European countries, low temperature carbonization
        cannot
        be justified in the US, at the present time, on the grounds of
        national
        defense. From a defense standpoint, the only products of
        importance are
        the oils and the fixed nitrogen. For oils, the US is now happily
        independent
        of other countries; for explosives, sufficient toluene and
        picric acid
        can be recovered in existing gasworks and by-product plants; and
        for
        nitrogen
        products, enough can be recovered from gasworks and coke plants,
        augmented
        by synthetic fixed nitrogen, to meet all emergency requirements.

      <p><a name="cokmkt"></a><b>The Coke Market ~</b> </p>
      <p>In order to avoid confusion, Gentry (371) has noted that it is
        necessary
        to distinguish between the production of 3 types of solid fuel:
        boiler
        char, smokeless fuel, and anthracite substitute. These 3 cases
        are
        rather
        clearly defined and the price which the semi-coke can command
        depends
        greatly
        upon which of the 3 forms of fuel is produced. The manufacture
        of an
        artificial
        anthracite by low temperature carbonization certainly requires
        the
        application
        of pressure at some stage during carbonization. In some
        processes, we
        have
        seen that this takes the form of briquetting, before, after, or
        between
        stages of distillation; in others, the necessary compression is
        obtained
        by the weight of the superincumbent charge or by the
        intumescence of
        the
        coal. A number of attempts have been made to effect the same
        result by
        introduction of pistons, or other mechanical devices, within the
        retort.
        Although it may be said, that the application of pressure to the
        semi-coke,
        either by briquetting or otherwise, increases greatly the cost
        of
        processing,
        the resultant artificial anthracite will command a higher price
        because
        of its strength and density. Anthracite substitutes can be sold
        considerably
        below the market price for anthracite with a substantial profit,
        but a
        smokeless fuel cannot sell much below the raw coal and realize
        sufficient
        return on the investment. After all is said and done, in a new
        industry
        where the advantages of a new fuel are not tremendously
        self-evident,
        the
        new fuel cannot command a price greater than that of the
        established
        competitive
        fuel. </p>
      <p>Of the several varieties of coke on the market, that is,
        beehive,
        by-product,
        gas coke, and semi-coke, the price and availability of anyone
        has its
        effect
        on the price of all the others, even though these classes of
        coke are
        not
        strictly competitive, since they are not always directly
        interchangeable.
        The first is used almost wholly for metallurgical purposes, the
        second
        is used for the manufacture of water gas and as a domestic fuel,
        as
        well
        as metallurgically, while the third s used almost exclusively
        for water
        gas manufacture, domestic fuel, and industrial heating. In no
        case is
        gas
        coke suitable for metallurgical purposes. As may be expected
        from this
        state of affairs, metallurgical coke plants often place their
        surplus
        coke
        on the market during slack seasons, thereby bringing about
        considerable
        price fluctuations and readjustments in the entire industry by a
        break
        in spot prices and a sag in the contract market. </p>
      <p>Aside from the manufactured gas industry and the metallurgical
        coke
        industry, as sources of coke for domestic fuel, there has come
        into
        existence
        the merchant by-product coke ovens. Since these plants are
        related to
        neither
        of the foregoing industries, their existence is justified by
        their
        ability
        to undertake or arrange for the complicated marketing of their
        coke and
        by-products. For them, the favorable support of the local fuel
        merchants
        is a very necessary factor for their success. </p>
      <p>Practically all by-product coke ovens use the breeze as a fuel,
        so
        that
        approximately 80% of it is used in this way. In both high
        temperature
        and
        low temperature practice, the breeze amounts, on the average, to
        about
        10% of the total coke yield. It makes a fairly satisfactory
        boiler
        fuel,
        generally being combusted on chain-grate stokers, since high
        temperature
        breeze is too abrasive to pulverize economically. The friability
        of
        semi-coke,
        however, makes it somewhat more desirable as a pulverized fuel,
        and
        while
        there is great variation from process to process in its
        abrasiveness,
        generally
        it is no more abrasive and requires no more power to grind than
        bituminous
        coal, and in fact, some experiments report even less. About the
        only
        other
        outlet for coke breeze is to briquet it for a domestic fuel, but
        the
        cost
        of the additional processing, together with the fact that the
        breeze is
        always high in ash, makes this procedure undesirable if the
        products
        can
        be directly consumed. </p>
      <p>Coke has been offered to the domestic market in sizes
        corresponding
        roughly to those familiar in the anthracite trade, that is, egg,
        stove,
        nut, pea, and breeze. It must, however, be as carefully sized as
        anthracite,
        for while stove or nut sizes can be used satisfactorily alone,
        if mixed
        indiscriminately with the other sizes, the tendency is for the
        fuel bed
        to pack, so that a satisfactory fire cannot be maintained. Since
        these
        sizes are smaller than the metallurgical sizes, the
        metallurgical coke
        industry stands a s a potential producer of domestic fuel, but
        they can
        never hope to compete seriously with a more satisfactory fuel,
        such as
        semi-coke, unless they are willing to undercut the latter
        considerably
        in price and are prepared to change their merchandizing policy,
        to the
        extent of assuring the domestic fuel market of an adequate
        supply at
        all
        times. As McBride (369) points out, there are many who believe
        the
        fluctuating
        demands of the metallurgical industry and the steady market for
        domestic
        fuel are too wholly incompatible phenomena and that is it
        utterly
        impossible
        to serve both ends at the same time. </p>
      <p>The establishment of coke as a permanent domestic fuel, be it
        low
        temperature
        coke, gas coke, or by-product coke, will require a long
        educational
        program
        to overcome the inertia of the public, which is loath to change
        from
        established
        practice. The principal inducement to its use is a price
        differential
        in
        its favor, but often its introduction must be accompanied by an
        assurance
        of instruction in the proper method of using it. </p>
      <p>Although coke is the best available substitute for anthracite,
        an
        is
        a potential substitute for bituminous coal, it has incurred
        great
        disfavor
        as a domestic fuel for two reasons; first, because of the
        uncertainty
        of
        the supply, due to the irregularity with which it is placed upon
        the
        domestic
        fuel market by the producers, and second, because of the
        inferior
        quality
        of the product diverted from metallurgical uses. Thus, much of
        the coke
        which has been placed in the domestic market, while suitable for
        metallurgical
        purposes, is wholly unsatisfactory for household use.
        Occasionally,
        coke
        containing excessive sulfur have been dumped on the domestic
        market by
        the manufacturers to the end that, while the ordinary domestic
        purchaser
        is little concerned with the chemical composition, the odor and
        corrosive
        fumes from such a high sulfur product are very objectionable and
        have,
        in consequence, injured the reputation of coke. For these
        reasons, any
        attempt to introduce low temperature coke extensively in some
        localities
        must be associated with an educational program which will
        eliminate the
        bad reputation that such indiscretions have aroused. </p>
      <p>Much of the difficulty that has been experienced by domestic
        consumers
        with the use of coke has been its incombustibility, a feature
        which
        semi-coke
        does not share with the high temperature by-product or gas coke.
        The
        low
        temperature coke contains 2 or 3 times more volatile matter than
        the
        others
        and, structurally, it is of a far more combustible form. In the
        past,
        much
        coke with a low fusion point ash has been put on the market,
        with the
        result
        that the average householder has been annoyed with clinker
        formation. </p>
      <p>Due to its greater bulk, weight for weight, coke requires more
        storage
        space than either anthracite or bituminous coal. Likewise, a
        greater
        furnace
        volume is necessary for the same frequency of firing. Some of
        the
        difficulties
        that have arisen from the use of coke may be attributed to the
        fact
        that
        too large sizes have been used in a furnace accustomed to
        anthracite,
        with
        the result that the fire burns out quickly and can be banked
        only with
        difficulty on account of the fuels' greater bulk. </p>
      <p>The value of semi-coke, as a domestic fuel, depends entirely
        upon
        its
        physical condition when delivered from the retort. There is no
        doubt
        that,
        for domestic use, the semi-coke will have to be in lumps or in
        briquets.
        In this form it possesses all the desirable properties of
        anthracite,
        except
        possibly its density. On the other hand, it will, for the most
        part,
        contain
        less ash than the grades of anthracite now found on the market.
        Runge
        (366)
        feels that, as a competitor of anthracite, semi-coke could be
        marketed
        as a household fuel at $1/ton less than the former. Since
        anthracite
        sells
        at $8.50 to $9/ton f.o.b. mines and retails for $13 to $15/ton
        within a
        radius of 100 miles of the mines, allowing $2 for delivery
        charges, the
        semi-coke should be sold at the plant, located near the center
        of
        consumption,
        at $10 to $12/ton from which must be deducted a further $2/ton
        for
        merchandizing
        costs. It is not generally desirable for the carbonization plant
        to
        undertake
        merchandizing its coke, but it is more logical to arrange with
        local
        fuel
        merchants to take care of its distribution to the consumer. From
        the
        standpoint
        of the dealer, this involves new problems, for coke requires
        greater
        storage
        space in is yards, large delivery trucks, and must be handled
        with
        greater
        care of its distribution to the consumer. These considerations,
        together
        with the inherent hesitation of people to enter new fields,
        makes it
        necessary
        to offer the merchant a liberal profit, sometimes as much as
        $3/ton, to
        induce him to handle the product. Gas coke is often merchandized
        directly
        by the producer, however, first, because of the narrow margin of
        profit,
        and second, because the strength of the product is such that it
        will
        not
        stand the extra handling and haulage of the middleman. </p>
      <p>Porter (360) has noted, in the matte of smoke abatement, that
        there
        is a great deal of human psychology involved. Despite the great
        economic
        loss to each individual in the form of expenditures for
        painting,
        laundry,
        etc., the consumer, when confronted with additional outlay to
        secure a
        smokeless fuel to reduce this atmospheric pollution, hesitates
        because
        the returns are intangible. Among the larger consumers, such as
        the
        railroads,
        utilities, and industrial manufacturing establishments, this
        hesitancy
        can be overcome by for of pubic opinion. To those, such as the
        domestic
        consumer and small manufacturer, who have to take close account
        of each
        outlay, the appeal to use smokeless fuels in place of cheaper
        competitive
        fuels is useless. Legislation to force smoke abatement upon the
        masses
        is as undesirable, as enforcement would be impracticable, so
        that the
        only
        rational solution is to provide a fuel that is smokeless at a
        price
        equal
        to or only slightly in advance of the raw fuels now available. </p>
      <p>Large quantities of coke are used in competition with
        anthracite
        for
        the generation of water gas. Although minor changes in the
        operation of
        the water gas plant are necessary to change from one to another
        of
        these
        fuels and although each has certain individual advantages, the
        chief
        consideration
        that determines which is used is solely one of price, as
        reflected in
        the
        cost of manufacture of a unit of gas. </p>
      <p>Another outlet for low temperature coke has been under
        experimentation
        both in the US and in Japan. It consists of associating low
        temperature
        carbonization with high temperature coke ovens to precarbonize
        part of
        the high temperature charge in order to furnish a low volatile
        material
        for blending with the remainder of the coal, thereby obtaining
        the
        strength
        and porosity required in the final metallurgical high
        temperature coke. </p>
      <p><a name="gasoil"></a><b>The Gas &amp; Light Oil Markets ~</b> </p>
      <p>McBride (369) has pointed out that the low average price for
        coke
        oven
        gas in the US arises partly from the fact that some of the
        largest
        producers
        in the country are affiliated with blast furnace or steel plants
        and
        the
        gas is carried on the books and reported to the government at a
        purely
        nominal value, which in no respect portrays its true worth, for
        it
        represents
        for real sale of the product in the open market. For this
        reason, great
        care must be exercised in applying average statistical values to
        specific
        cases. </p>
      <p>The serious problem in the disposition of gas is twofold; in
        the
        first
        place, it is bulky and the storage cost is great, so that it
        cannot be
        stored more than a few hours, at best not more than one day, and
        second,
        the cost of transportation requires a market within the
        immediate
        vicinity
        of the plant or such as can be reached by pipelines or gas
        mains. In
        this
        manner the gas differs from the other products of carbonization,
        which
        can be stored for long periods and shipped indefinite distances.
        The
        quantity
        of gas that can be sold at a reasonable profit often determines
        the
        size
        of carbonization plant to be erected and the location of this
        market
        often
        determines the plant location also. </p>
      <p>The sale of gas by a carbonization plant to a public utility
        becomes
        a matter of negotiation between the parties concerned. Such
        contracts,
        however, must usually be approved by the public authority
        charged with
        the regulation of public service corporations, so that, in a
        measure,
        the
        price which is received for the gas is determined by an
        independent
        group.
        As a rule, such a supervision offers little trouble, because the
        carbonization
        plant can usually offer the by-product gas profitably at a cost
        slightly
        below that at which it can be generates as a principal product,
        with
        the
        result that the regulating body will approve the contract as in
        the
        best
        interests of the public. Sometimes, however, even an attractive
        price
        for
        the gas will not induce a coke operator to enter into a contract
        to
        supply
        a public utility with gas for any extended period, preferring to
        sell
        his
        gas industrially at a much lower rate. The reason for this is
        quite
        apparent,
        for such a contract may require him to run his ovens at full
        capacity
        to
        meet the gas contract at a time when the market for his coke and
        other
        by-products is depressed, an eventuality which might cause him a
        good
        deal
        of embarrassment. </p>
      <p>The light oil is commonly refined at the coke plant, motor
        benzol
        being
        the chief product. Most of this refined motor fuel, and some of
        the
        crude
        benzol, is sold directly to petroleum refiners for blending with
        gasoline.
        The sale is usually by contract, so that the producer will not
        have to
        provide storage facilities and so that the petroleum refiner
        will be
        assured
        of a continuous supply of benzol. On the whole, spot benzol is
        distinctly
        lower than contract benzol and both follow rather closely the
        trend in
        gasoline prices, except that the fluctuations are not as great.
      </p>
      <p>The market can absorb readily all light oil that is obtained
        from
        coal
        carbonization, and even all that could be produced, if the
        entire
        annual
        production of bituminous coal were carbonized. According to
        McBride
        (369),
        even in such a contingency, the production of light oil would
        hardly
        exceed
        one-sixth of the requirements for motor fuel. Practically no
        light oil
        is produced by gasworks, as it is used to enrich the gas, but
        quantities
        of this product are marketed from by-product coke ovens. As
        pointed
        out,
        however, the potential demand is so unlimited that competition
        from low
        temperature light oil is unimportant. </p>
      <p>The chemical industries can use only limited quantities of
        light
        oil
        for commercial solvents, consequently by far the major
        proportion goes
        into blended motor fuel, which because of its various
        advantages, can
        command
        a slightly higher price than ordinary gasoline. Since one gallon
        of
        light
        oil can be used to enrich several gallons of gasoline, to make a
        blended
        motor fuel, it is see that the market price of light oil is
        determined
        by the gasoline market at a few cents per gallon above the
        gasoline
        price. </p>
      <p><a name="tarmkt"></a><b>The Tar Market ~</b> </p>
      <p>Weiss (372) states that there is more variation in quality
        among
        low
        temperature tars than among high temperature tars. Secondary tar
        is so
        cracked by the temperatures employed that all tars are more or
        less
        reduced
        to the same grade, but the absence of cracking makes the quality
        of
        primary
        tar more closely related to the coal from which it is extracted.
        Low
        temperature
        tars have been known to vary among processes from a content of
        7% tar
        acids
        to 50% tar acids, as has already been noted in Chapter III under
        the
        discussion
        of tar acids, and from 40% by volume distilled upon
        fractionation to a
        temperature of 300 F to 80% distilled to the same pitch.
        Consequently,
        in evaluating any low temperature tar, a careful assay is of the
        utmost
        importance. And likewise, because of this vast difference in
        tars, it
        is
        dangerous to make generalizations. </p>
      <p>While enormous quantities of raw tar are being burned as fuel,
        a
        great
        deal of creosote oil and other derivatives of tar are being
        imported
        into
        the US. The tar is thus debased solely because the producer
        receives
        greater
        economic benefit from it when so used. This leads to a study of
        the
        economics
        of coal tar distillation. Any attempt to refine tar for the
        purpose of
        providing creosote to take the place of importations, involves
        the
        simultaneous
        production of other tar derivatives. Besides creosote, the tar
        refiner
        must produce light oil and a carbonaceous residuum, which can
        take any
        of three forms: soft pitch, hard pitch, or still coke. Which of
        the
        latter
        is the most desirable to produce depends upon market conditions.
        The
        production
        of creosote is at a maximum when soft pitch is produced. In the
        past,
        there
        was no market whatsoever for still coke, and in recent years it
        has
        been
        somewhat limited. Since both the creosote oil and a good road
        tar
        contain
        some of the same constituents, it is obvious that the two cannot
        be
        manufactured
        at the same time. </p>
      <p>The reason so much tar is burned as a fuel at large coke ovens
        which
        are affiliated with metallurgical plants, according to McBride
        (369),
        is
        one of business and economics, rather than of technical
        consideration.
        The only cause for the existence of such coke ovens is to insure
        continuity
        of coke supply to the metallurgical department and the policy of
        most
        companies
        is not to encourage expansion into fields of chemical industry
        other
        than
        the smelting of iron and the manufacture of steel. If the tar
        were not
        burned, other fuel would have to be purchased for the open
        hearths, so
        that it is considered less of an annoyance to burn the tar in
        the open
        hearth furnaces or under boilers than to undertake the
        uncertainties of
        tar sales. Only a bookkeeping price need be assigned to the tar,
        in
        such
        instances, as a matter of record only, and this is a
        contributory cause
        of the low average value assigned to tar for the US as a whole.
        The net
        heating value of 166 gallons of tar is approximately equal to
        that of a
        short ton of 12,500 BTU/lb coal, which is to say, that when coal
        is
        worth
        $5 per net ton delivered, on a strictly calorific basis, tar is
        worth
        $0.03
        per gallon. On the other hand, tar has many practical advantages
        over
        coal
        that tend towards greater economy, so that a safe criterion is
        that the
        value of the tar as a fuel in cents per gallon is numerically
        equal to
        the price of coal in dollars per ton. </p>
      <p>Those plants which do not wish to burn their tar as a fuel
        endeavor
        to dispose of it with a minimum of effort on their part, with
        the
        result
        that most of the sales are made through a tar broker on a
        commission
        basis,
        or else are delivered directly to the tar distiller under
        contract.
        Practically
        all of the tar placed on the market is thus sold under long term
        agreements,
        so that there is really no such thing as a spot price for this
        by-product. </p>
      <p>Competitive bidding is entirely too inactive to advance the
        price
        of
        tar for refining. The situation is very similar to that of any
        commodity
        where the supply very greatly exceeds the demand. The refiners
        do not
        have
        to offer the producers a price very far exceeding its worth as a
        fuel
        to
        get all the good quality tar that they can handle. Furthermore,
        tar is
        of such low value that it cannot economically stand
        transportation for
        very great differences. In certain districts there are very few
        tar
        distillers
        and the producers in such localities are faced with accepting
        what is
        offered
        or with the consequence of having it left on their hands, as a
        result
        of
        their inability to reach other consumers. </p>
      <p>The complex specifications for tar products that are used in
        various
        trades, coupled with the difficult problem of merchandizing,
        have made
        it desirable, from the viewpoint of most coke oven and gas
        retort
        operators,
        to confine this business to a separate industry of tar
        distillation,
        but
        there are a few small operators who undertake their own tar
        refining.
        However,
        should consideration be given to the financial possibilities of
        refining
        low temperature tar, it would be found that about 60% would be
        yielded
        as oil and 40% as pitch, with a 300 F melting point. Runge
        (366)
        has
        discussed the economics of this procedure and concludes that the
        only
        assured
        outlet for the pitch, in large quantities, is that of a fuel,
        for which
        purpose it should bring $0.25 per ton of coal carbonized.
        Assuming a
        yield
        of 25 gallons of low temperature tar per ton of coal, three
        would
        remain
        about 15 gallons of low temperature oil which could be used
        principally
        in 3 ways: as a wood preservative, as a disinfectant, and as a
        flotation
        oil, without any regard for its possibilities as a diesel engine
        fuel,
        as crude stock for gasoline cracking, for the manufacture of
        artificial
        resins and other condensation products, or for many special
        uses. With
        creosote oil for wood preservation selling at about $0.17 per
        gallon
        wholesale
        and flotation oils at about $0.22 per gallon, an average value
        of $0.16
        per gallon would seem to be conservative for the distilled low
        temperature
        oil. At this value, it would bring a revenue of $2.40, plus the
        return
        from the pitch, or a total return of $2.65 per ton of coal
        carbonized.
        This is equivalent to over $0.08 per gallon for the raw tar,
        after
        deduction
        of $0.02 per gallon for distilling cost. </p>
      <p>The extent to which tar distillation can be carried out
        successfully
        essentially is bawd upon a well balanced demand for all of the
        products.
        Tar cannot be refined economically unless all of its derivatives
        can be
        sold within a reasonable time after production and at a price
        which
        represents
        a fair margin of profit above their allocated costs of crude
        stock and
        refining. The unbalanced condition in the market of tar products
        is
        responsible
        for the fluctuation in prices and it depends more upon the
        relation
        between
        supply and demand of specific products than upon any
        consideration of
        value
        or cost of production. As far as the light oil fraction is
        concerned,
        there
        is no limitation to its market, hence the quality of tar which
        is
        distilled
        depends entirely upon the outlets for the other products. While
        there
        are
        various uses in the chemical industries for tar derivatives, the
        requirements
        are small compared to the potential supply, and moreover, many
        of the
        desired
        compounds can be manufactured synthetically, a method which has
        an
        economic
        advantage over tar distillation in that it has only one final
        product
        to
        be sold. </p>
      <p>During distillation of the tar, the first volatile constituents
        to
        be
        removed are the light oils up to 170 C to 200 C, which
        contain
        a very small proportion of nitrogen bases and phenolic
        derivatives.
        When
        only the light oils and water are distilled from the crude
        stock, the
        heavy
        tar remaining is used in surfacing roads, painting of pipe, and
        for
        saturating
        roof felt and other porous materials. Removal of more of the
        volatile
        matter
        leaves a soft pitch suitable for the impregnation of paving
        blocks, for
        a road binder, for the manufacture of built-up roofing, and for
        other
        waterproofing
        requirements. If the distillation is carried to a point where
        all the
        volatile
        is removed, pitch or still coke remains. The pitch coke can be
        used for
        certain metallurgical requirements where a fuel of low ash and
        sulfur
        is
        desirable. Its strength, however, is such as to prohibit its use
        in
        furnaces
        where the fuel is required to carry a heavy burden. Most of the
        still
        coke
        is used as a fuel but it does not burn very readily on grates.
        The two
        most important characteristics of pitch, which determine its
        availability
        for various uses, are its hardness and its brittleness at
        ordinary
        temperatures.
        As a roofing material, it is obvious that a pitch which softens
        and
        becomes
        sticky during summer temperatures is quite as undesirable as one
        which
        cracks underfoot during the winter because of its brittleness. </p>
      <p>The acids are removed from crude tar through forming a
        water-soluble
        compound by treatment with caustic soda, after which the tar
        acids are
        recovered with sulfuric acid and are finally washed and
        redistilled.
        These
        tar acids, in the form of either crude or refined phenols and
        cresols,
        are used in the preparation of synthetic resins and other
        condensation
        products, a well as in the manufacture of insecticides and of
        disinfectants.
        Although formaldehyde condensation products of the bakelite type
        have
        been
        prepared from the creosote fractions of low temperature tars,
        Soule
        (373)
        has some doubt regarding the ability of this market to absorb
        any large
        quantities of low temperature tar products, but their extreme
        cheapness
        may stimulate their use in a variety of related ways. </p>
      <p>According to Soule (374), the tar distiller receives his
        largest
        financial
        return from creosote oil, which is used as a wood preservative.
        Coffin
        (375) ascribes the superiority of low temperature tars for wood
        preservation,
        first upon their high acid content, and second upon the
        oxygenation f
        the
        low temperature oil. This oxygenation converts the hydrocarbons
        from
        liquids
        to solids, in the surface layers of the impregnated material,
        and forms
        a permanent filler for the cell walls. Consequently, it is felt
        that
        low
        temperature oils are particularly adapted to what is known as
        the empty
        cell method of creosoting, regardless of its superiority from a
        toxic
        standpoint.
        While large amounts of tar are refined to produce creosote oil
        for the
        preservation of timbers which are placed in the ground or other
        damp
        places,
        it is by no means without competition in this field. Zinc
        chloride also
        is used extensively for impregnating mine timbers, posts,
        railroad
        ties,
        etc. The insolubility of creosote oil is distinctly an advantage
        in its
        favor. S far as resistance to decay is concerned, there is no
        doubt
        that
        creosote is superior to zinc chloride, but in many cases the
        timbers
        have
        to be removed because of mechanical wear long before they have
        decayed.
        In treating railroad ties for main lines, where the traffic is
        heavy,
        this
        consideration is of particular importance and results in
        selecting the
        cheaper preservative. </p>
      <p>The specifications for creosoting oils are now based
        principally
        upon
        the physical characteristics of the oil, such as the boiling
        point,
        viscosity,
        and specific gravity, instead of upon an analysis of the
        creosote
        content.
        The name of creosote oil is applied to this fraction of the tar
        because
        of the phenolic derivatives that are present which prevent the
        growth
        of
        fungi by their toxic action. According to Weiss (372), with a
        few
        exceptions,
        the primary oils are too low in specific gravity to meet the
        present
        standards
        of wood preservation, but this does not mean that they will not
        make
        good
        preservatives. The situation is somewhat analogous to water gas
        tar,
        which
        was pushed for over 10 years before it became acceptable for
        this
        purpose,
        and low temperature tars must face and overcome the same
        situation by
        demonstrating
        their usefulness and by requiring a change in obsolete
        standards. A
        number
        of railroad ties have been in service 8 years after being
        treated with
        low temperature creosote oil, and they are in substantially the
        same
        condition
        as those treated with creosote oil which met the specifications
        for
        wood
        preservation. </p>
      <p>There has been a good deal of discussion regarding the
        manufacture
        of
        lubricating oils from low temperature tar. It has been thought
        likely
        that
        the ready oxidation of the phenolic constituents would cause
        trouble.
        Practical
        tests, however, have shown that this difficulty is not great for
        lubrication
        in accessible places where the parts can be cleaned. A high
        grade
        lubricant
        can be produced, nevertheless, by removing the phenolic
        derivatives,
        but
        that somewhat increases the cost of production. Soule (373)
        states that
        the low temperature hydrocarbons below 326 C apparently have
        only
        slight value as lubricants, but the readiness with which these
        compounds
        polymerize suggest the possibility of treating them further with
        aluminum
        chloride as a polymerizing agent according to the method of
        Heusler
        (376),
        to convert them into lubricating oils. The value of unsaturated
        hydrocarbons
        in lubricants has often been brought out and it has been shown
        that the
        frictional resistance between rubbing surfaces bears a
        relationship to
        the amount of unsaturates present. Consequently, it is
        anticipated that
        low temperature oils above 300 C possess considerable
        lubricating
        value. </p>
      <p>This latter view has been substantiated by Nielsen and Baker
        (377,
        378)
        in tests by the British National Physical Laboratory on the
        lubricating
        properties of a refined low temperature oil from the Nielsen
        process.
        As
        compared with a well known English brand of mineral lubricating
        oil,
        both
        the density and the viscosity of the low temperature oil was
        greater.
        There
        was very little difference in the journal friction between the
        two
        samples,
        but the low temperature specimen apparently had a less abrupt
        seizing
        temperature
        and was a more satisfactory lubricant than the mineral oil at
        high
        loads.
        Nielsen and Baker reconcile the difference of opinion, expressed
        by
        many
        authorities, regarding the suitability of low temperature oil
        for
        lubrication,
        by the fact that these oils depend so much upon the process of
        production
        for their quality. Thus, redistillation and cracking of the oils
        in
        poorly
        designed externally or internally heated retorts greatly injures
        the
        value
        of the low temperature oil as a lubricant. </p>
      <p>For use as a paint, the thickening of low temperature tar in
        air,
        due
        to the oxidation of the phenols, is of practical value. Used
        alone, the
        tar gives a soft brown color, but this of course may be modified
        by the
        addition of pigments. In one test of low temperature tar as a
        coating
        for
        woodwork and ironwork, after two years of exposure, both the
        paint and
        the coated material are said to have been in good condition. </p>
      <p>Despite statements to the contrary, Runge (366) has pointed out
        that
        very little work has been done in ascertaining the nature of low
        temperature
        tar derivatives as applied to their use in the preparation of
        dyestuffs
        and pharmaceuticals and comparatively few of the tar
        derivatives, as
        now
        known, can be used for these purposes. </p>
      <p>The special properties of low temperature tars adapt them to
        certain
        applications where they should command a good price, provided
        they are
        not produced in excessive quantities, in which case they can
        find
        immediate
        consumption only as a fuel oil. Undoubtedly important industrial
        uses
        will
        be developed for the special constituents of low temperature
        tar, but
        it
        is inconceivable that any such markets could be of a scale
        comparable
        to
        a national use of semi-coke as a domestic and power fuel. These
        special
        uses may be sufficient to command a premium for low temperature
        tar as
        a raw material during the initial stages of development in the
        industry.
        But when the manufacture of low temperature coke assumes
        tremendous
        scale,
        the only assured price for primary tar is that of its use as raw
        stock
        for the manufacture of motor spirit, lubricants, and fuel oils,
        a price
        set largely by the petroleum industry at the present time. </p>

      <p>As far as ammonium sulfate is concerned, this by-product can be
        neglected,
        in most cases, when studying the economics of low temperature
        carbonization,
        because of the relatively small amounts that are recovered in
        the
        processes
        of the externally heated type, and because of the great cost of
        recovery
        apparatus of large capacity in processes of the internally
        heated type.
        The uncertainties of the nitrogen market and present price
        levels, with
        little hope for future betterment, strengthen the argument, so
        that
        about
        the best that can be said, in general, for the nitrogen products
        of low
        temperature carbonization is that they constitute a potential
        supply
        should
        the nature of the process and market conditions warrant
        recovery.
        However,
        because of the controversial mature on this point, the author
        included
        the revenue from ammonium sulfate in Table 123 and estimated the
        capital
        cost of the ammonium sulfate plant in Table 125, together with
        its
        operating
        costs and overhead in Table 126. To better clarify the reasons
        for this
        situation, it is necessary to study the fixed nitrogen market. </p>
      <p>Although the bulk of the fertilizer demands for nitrogen is met
        by
        saltpeter
        an ammonium sulfate, they must compete in a minor way with other
        plant
        foods which contain fixed nitrogen, such as tankage, cotton-seed
        meal,
        etc. For most agricultural purposes, the two principal nitrogen
        fertilizers
        are interchangeable, but both have special advantages under
        particular
        conditions. As a consequence, the trend of ammonium sulfate
        prices
        follows
        very closely that of Chilean nitrate. The price of the latter is
        fixed
        annually for each country in the world by the association of
        Chilean
        producers
        after consideration of the available supplies of fixed nitrogen
        throughout
        the world and the prospects for competition. This price having
        been
        fixed,
        the price of ammonium sulfate is adjusted accordingly and
        thereafter,
        throughout
        the year, the fluctuations of spot sulfate are determined wholly
        by the
        demand and available supply in each locality. </p>
      <p>By-product coke plants usually recover the ammonia as ammonium
        sulfate,
        while gasworks usually recover it as ammoniacal liquor. There is
        very
        little
        difference in the market price of these two nitrogen products
        per unit
        of ammonia. Since the liquor is much easier to make than the
        sulfate,
        even
        a very slight advance in the price of liquor, relative to
        sulfate, will
        stimulate the manufacture of the former to such an extent that
        there
        will
        be a recession in price. According to McBride (369), in 1920
        only about
        25% of the gasworks in the US recovered ammonia form their coal
        gas
        retorts,
        even though ammonia had to be scrubbed from the gas by a surplus
        of
        water
        to purify it, simply because the local market value was
        insufficient to
        pay the cost of its concentration. The marketing of ammoniacal
        liquor
        from
        the few very large plants which dispose of it is a very simple
        task,
        for
        long term contracts are usually made with ammonia companies to
        take the
        entire liquor output. The ammonia company then customarily
        arranges for
        a local concentrating plant so that the liquor can be
        concentrated to a
        strength that will make shipping economical. The problem of its
        ultimate
        disposition is thus left in the hands of an independent company.
      </p>
      <p>The market for liquid ammonia, including the demand of chemical
        industries
        and the refrigeration trade, is decidedly limited and is greatly
        exceeded
        by the potential production. In the past, these markets have
        been
        controlled
        by a few ammonia companies, which obtained their ammoniacal
        liquor from
        gasworks, but the advent of synthetic ammonia ha brought about
        serious
        competition in this field. The same may be said of the explosive
        industry,
        where in the past ammoniacal liquor concentrated to 25% ammonia
        content
        has been used in the manufacture of gunpowder. This requires the
        concentration
        of gasworks ammonia to a strength many times exceeding that at
        which it
        is produced, an operation far less convenient that dilution of
        anhydrous
        synthetic ammonia. The outcome of the entire situation s that,
        like all
        other ammonia products, the liquid ammonia price follows very
        closely
        the
        price of fertilizer. </p>
      <p>There is a general concensus of opinion that cheap fixed
        nitrogen
        is
        more likely to come from development of the direct synthetic
        processes
        than from any other source. According to Curtis (379), a number
        of
        estimates
        indicate that it can be produced at a price ranging near
        $0.07/lb of
        fixed
        nitrogen, or about $0.05/lb of ammonia, and present indications
        are
        that
        the market for anhydrous and aqua ammonia in the US will be
        saturated
        from
        this source. This is about one-half the price of ammonia in
        ammoniacal
        liquor and one-third the price of nitrogen in Chilean nitrate.
        It does
        not follow that, given cheap ammonia, there will be cheap
        fertilizer,
        for
        it must be combined with sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or
        otherwise,
        before it is available for this use. </p>
      <p>However, Curtis (380) says that the cost of producing a
        synthetic
        ammonium
        sulfate by any process now available is considerably in excess
        of the
        cost
        of producing ammonium sulfate in a by-product coke oven.
        Furthermore,
        before
        the gas can be used for most domestic and industrial uses, it
        must be
        purified
        and the ammonia removed either as the sulfate or otherwise,
        regardless
        of the market price of fixed nitrogen. Consequently, by-product
        ammonia
        is absorbed in the market before the synthetic stocks are drawn
        upon.
        By-product
        ammonium sulfate has never enjoyed a selling price determined by
        its
        cost
        of production. Before the advent of synthetic nitrogen products,
        the
        imports
        of Chilean nitrate set the market price. But even Chilean
        nitrate was
        not
        sold on a basis of production cost, but enjoyed a suspension of
        the
        usual
        laws of economics, in that it formed practically a world
        monopoly.
        Apparently,
        however, the cost of producing synthetic ammonia is now much
        below the
        selling price of Chilean nitrate in the past, so that for the
        first
        time
        that source of supply is facing serious competition. It is
        unlikely
        that
        the Chilean guano fields will ever again hold this dominating
        position
        over the world market for fixed nitrogen. Consequently, the
        outlook for
        the future is lower prices for fixed nitrogen and hence for
        by-product
        ammonium sulfate. Despite this forecast of reduced prices,
        however, the
        production of by-product ammonium sulfate will continue to
        increase for
        reasons already set forth. But even so, the relative place of
        coal as a
        source of nitrogenous fertilizer will become of less and less
        importance.
        Curtis (380) notes that a score of years ago a Chilean saltpeter
        was
        the
        principle source of supply for fertilizer, a decade ago
        by-product
        nitrogen
        was foremost, but today synthetic fixed nitrogen supplies more
        than all
        the rest combined. The relative importance of these 3 major
        sources as
        they now stand will probably never change again. </p>
      <p>Synthetic ammonia made by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen
        has
        become
        an active competitor of gasworks in the ammonia market, with the
        result
        that the larger gas plants have found it expedient to curtail
        their
        production
        of ammoniacal liquor and produce ammonium sulfate instead. But
        even in
        the fertilizer field, where ammonium sulfate competes with
        Chilean
        nitrate,
        synthetic ammonia plants stand as a potential source of these
        materials. </p>
      <p>Among other ammonium salts, ammonium chloride has a large
        potential
        market and present demands are largely met by importation. The
        price
        differential,
        however, is such that, whether or not a producer would undertake
        its
        production,
        depends entirely upon its market price relative to ammonium
        sulfate. If
        cheap phosphoric acid were made available, ammonium phosphate
        could be
        easily manufactured and would find a receptive fertilizer
        market. Such
        a compound would be an ideal fertilizer, as it contains two
        essential
        foods
        for plant life. </p>
      <p>Chilean nitrate and synthetic fixed nitrogen products can be
        sold
        at
        a market price fixed only by supply and demand and the cost of
        production,
        but ammonium sulfate from gasworks or by-product ovens is only
        one of
        several
        related products and there is no relation between its market
        price and
        its cost, such as must prevail in the case of the former
        materials. </p>
      <p>McBride (369) points out that approximately 90% of the ammonium
        sulfate
        produced in the US is marketed on a commission basis and
        practically
        all
        of the business is done under contract by a single selling
        agency,
        which
        maintains an elaborate organization in this country and abroad
        to keep
        in touch with market conditions. Very little of the exported
        ammonium
        sulfate
        is handled independently. The increased production of this
        chemical by
        foreign plants, however, has made serious inroads on this
        foreign
        trade,
        to such an extent that the export price is usually below the
        domestic
        price,
        which in turn is so low as to practically prohibit imports. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the domestic fertilizer business is the greatest
        potential
        field for the permanent disposition of ammonium sulfate, but for
        any
        great
        development in this line an educational campaign will be
        necessary for
        the benefit of the companies who manufacture fertilizers, as
        well as
        for
        the farmers who consume them. As a matter of national economics,
        as
        well
        as of national independence, it is desirable that much of the
        Chilean
        saltpeter
        that is annually imported for fertilizer in the US be replaced
        by
        domestically
        produced ammonium sulfate. In nitrogen equivalent, the ammonium
        sulfate
        that is exported from the US annually amounts to 35% or 50% of
        the
        nitrogen
        equivalent of imported nitrate from Chile. A further consequence
        of
        such
        a development would be the strengthening of the national defense
        by
        rendering
        the country independent of regular nitrate imports for the
        munitions of
        war. </p>
      <p>Curtis (379) notes that there has always been a great parity in
        the
        US between the prices of Chilean nitrate and those of ammonium
        sulfate,
        compared on the basis of nitrogen content. Until 1916, Chilean
        nitrate
        was always slightly below the price of ammonium sulfate, but
        after that
        date the ammonium sulfate has remained correspondingly cheaper.
        About
        1895,
        Chile supplied approximately 75% of the world's nitrogen
        requirements,
        but today that country supplies somewhat less than 40% of the
        world's
        demand,
        although both consumption and production have greatly increased.
        It
        would
        appear, therefore, that at present, Chilean nitrate would no
        longer
        control
        the nitrogen market, but such is not the case. By its very
        nature,
        nitrogen
        from by-product plants will be sold always at a price which will
        insure
        its sale, the balance of the market being taken by the Chilean
        nitrate. </p>
      <p>Bain (381) has estimated that Chilean nitrate can be profitably
        marketed
        in the US until the price of $35 per short ton is reached. Below
        that
        price,
        even the most improved methods of production, of transportation,
        and of
        marketing cannot maintain the full imports and the imports will
        fall
        off
        in proportion as the price falls below that figure. At
        approximately
        $28
        per short ton, it is estimated that there would be practically
        no
        offerings.
        These figures for nitrate correspond roughly to $46 per ton and
        $37 per
        ton, respectively, for ammonium sulfate, when computed on the
        nitrogen
        equivalent, and they may be taken as indication of the minimum
        prices
        that
        ammonium sulfate will attain unless synthetic fixed nitrogen can
        be
        produced
        in quantities more cheaply than this. As long as the above
        prices are
        maintained,
        it is assured that ammonium sulfate will continue to be produced
        by all
        by-product coke ovens, except the smaller less economical
        plants, whose
        shutdown would not materially affect the supply. The production
        of
        ammonium
        sulfate will depend, therefore, more upon the production of coke
        and
        gas
        than upon the market price of sulfate. </p>
      <p><a name="potential"></a><b>Potential Markets ~</b> </p>
      <p>It has been noted heretofore that essential to the economic
        success
        of any process for the treatment of high or low temperature
        medium
        grade
        fuels by low temperature carbonization is an adequate
        disposition of
        the
        solid residuum. A study of the consumption of solid fuel by
        industries
        will give, therefore, some indication of the markets in which
        semi-coke
        can compete and also some idea of the extent to which low
        temperature
        carbonization
        can be carried out when proper outlets develop for the
        by-products
        which
        would arise from future expansion. </p>
      <p>The last statistics for the consumption of coal by industries
        in
        the
        US were compiled for 1923 by the Dept. of Commerce (382) but,
        while
        there
        have been changes in the total fuel consumption, there is reason
        to
        believe
        that there was no essential change in the percentage consumption
        by
        each
        industry up to 1927. The figures are tabulated in Table 128. It
        will be
        observed from the table that the railroads are by far the
        largest
        consumers
        of coal in the US, accounting for 26.5% of the entire
        consumption.
        Next,
        in order of importance, comes the domestic and general
        industrial
        trades,
        each of which use approximately 19.5% of the entire amount. The
        various
        methods of coal carbonization that are already in existence,
        that is,
        gasworks,
        beehive ovens, and by-product ovens, all together account for
        approximately
        14% of the total consumption. Deducting that already carbonized,
        together
        with that consumed for miscellaneous purposes, we note that
        about 80%
        of
        the entire coal consumption of the US can be substituted by
        processed
        solid
        fuel. </p>
      <center><img src="128tab.gif" height="493" width="674"></center>
      <p>While it is quite true that the future will see increased use
        of
        gas
        by the domestic and industrial markets, such a substitution
        merely
        means
        a shifting of coal consumption from one industry to another and
        there
        is
        no basic reason why such an increase in the use of gas should
        not be
        met
        by carbonization at low temperatures. There is also a tendency
        towards
        electrification of railroads, mines, and other industries, a
        development
        which, in the future, will doubtlessly shift the coal
        consumption to
        large
        central electric stations. Such impending changes in coal
        utilization
        will
        increase the efficiency with which the fuel is consumed, thereby
        conserving
        the national fuel resources. On the other hand, the
        centralization of
        fuel
        utilization will make its processing an altogether more
        profitable
        enterprise. </p>
      <p>Of the estimated world's production of 117 million net tons of
        coke
        in 1925, the US produced 44%, according to the statistics
        gathered by
        Tryon
        and Bennit (383). The production of by-product coke has
        increased
        tremendously
        from 3,462,000 net tons in 1905 to 43,921,000 net tons in 1927,
        the
        production
        of beehive coke declining from 28,768,000 net tons in 1925 to
        7,004,000
        net tons in 1927. The coke imports to the US amount to less than
        0.5%,
        while the exports account for approximately 2% of that produced.
        During
        the decade from 1917 to 1926, inclusive, the total value of the
        products
        from by-product ovens in the US ranged from $8.86 to $13.55 per
        net ton
        of coal carbonized, the cost of the raw coal ranged from $3.88
        to $7.73
        per net ton, while the excess value of the carbonization
        products over
        the coal ranged from $2.38 to $5.82 per net ton of coal. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>From 77% to 83% of the coke produced in the US is consumed by
        blast
        furnaces, which, together with other metallurgical uses, leaves
        less
        than
        5% for consumption in the domestic market, and we have seen that
        this
        supply
        is very irregular, depending as it does upon depression in the
        steel
        industry.
        As interesting as these statistics may be, they do not have as
        much
        bearing
        upon the marketing of low temperature coke as do statistics
        gathered
        from
        the manufactured gas industry. McBride (369) investigated this
        subject
        and reported that in 1918 the manufactured gas industry of the
        US sold
        1,813,000 net tons of coke, representing roughly 60% of that
        produced,
        at an average price of $7.70 per net ton. In 1920, the sales
        amounted
        to
        1,378,000 net tons, or roughly 40% of that produced, and were
        disposed
        of at an average price of $8.44 per net ton. The reason for his
        decrease
        was attributed to the coal strike, which made it desirable to
        sue the
        coke
        at the plant in water gas manufacture. In general, the price
        received
        for
        coke is governed by local conditions and it usually retails at
        $1 to $2
        per ton less than anthracite. In 1918, the sale price ranged
        from $2.75
        to $19.13 per ton, while in 1920, it ranged from $1.00 to
        $15.17. These
        figures are all wholesale prices for domestic fuel, or to other
        countries
        for use in manufacturing water gas. According to Tryon and
        Bennit
        (383),
        1,125,000 net tons of by-product coke, valued at $7.92 per net
        ton,
        were
        produced in the manufacture of city gas during 1925. These
        authorities
        report a variation in the average value of the coke produced by
        the
        by-product
        ovens of the manufactured gas industry from $7.32 per net ton to
        $11.42
        per net ton over the period 1918 to 1925, inclusive. </p>
      <p>The receptiveness of the trade to a processed fuel is indicated
        by
        the
        fact that the production of fuel briquets in the US increased
        from
        581,000
        net tons in 1924 to 971,000 net tons in 1927 and the briquetting
        industry
        seems to have held its place after an abundance of anthracite
        was
        placed
        on the market, following the end of the coal stoppage. The
        possibilities
        of increase in this industry are recognized, when it is noted
        that
        Germany
        alone produced approximately 5,500,000 net tons of coal briquets
        and
        40,100,000
        net tons of brown coal briquets during 1927. </p>
      <p>In 1918 there were produced 263,300,000 gallons of coke oven
        tar
        in
        the S, of which 200,200,000 gallons, or 76%, were sold. The
        production
        increased to 529,500,000 gallons in 1926, while the sales
        increased to
        277,300,000 gallons, or only 52.3%. This great decrease in the
        percentage
        of tar that was sold shows the increasing extent to which coke
        oven tar
        has found consumption as fuel. Out of a total of 416.979,000
        gallons of
        tar, of all varieties, that were produced during 1918 in the US,
        the
        manufactured
        gas industry contributed 52,694,000 gallons of coal gas tar and
        100,985,000
        gallons of water and oil gas tar, the remainder being derived
        from coke
        ovens, as above. While the total tar production had increased to
        549,775,000
        gallons in 1923, the increase occurred mainly in coke oven tar,
        which
        accounted
        for 440,907,000 gallons, coal gas tar from the manufactured gas
        industry
        increasing only slightly to 58,877,000 gallons. McBride (369)
        reported
        that during 1920 about 51,000,000 gallons of tar were produced
        by the
        manufactured
        gas industry, of which approximately 90% was sold and 6% was
        burned.
        The
        average price received in that year for coal gas tar by 316
        plants in
        the
        US was $0.043 per gallon, although 72 plants received over $0.06
        per
        gallon
        and 21 plants obtained $0.10 per gallon, or more. </p>
      <p>In 1920, the total amount of crude light oil produced by all
        sources
        in the US was 123,333,000 gallons, of which 106,564,000 gallons
        were
        refined
        on the premises and the remainder sold as crude stock. Of this
        total,
        109,710,000
        gallons were recovered by coke ovens, 2,906,000 gallons by water
        gas
        plants,
        and 10,717,000 gallons came form manufactured coal gas plants.
        In 1926,
        the total production had increased to 164,060,000 gallons, of
        which
        159,590,000
        gallons were refined on the premises, yielding benzol as the
        principal
        product. The total production of benzol in the US, including
        both the
        crude
        and refined, as well as motor benzol, was 83,371,000 gallons in
        1920,
        of
        which 72,995,000 gallons were sold at an average price of $0.239
        per
        gallon.
        The total production increased to 112,489,000 gallons in 1926,
        of which
        111,489,000 gallons were sold at an average price of $0.191 per
        gallon. </p>
      <p>The total production of motor fuel in the US during 1918
        amounted
        to
        3,901,000,000 gallons, of which 3,570,000,000 gallons came from
        refining
        petroleum, 283,000,000 gallons were extracted from natural gas,
        45,000,000
        gallons came from coke ovens, and 3,000,000 gallons were
        distilled at
        tar
        refineries. The total production had increased to 12,135,000,000
        gallons
        in 1925, of which 10,903,000,000 gallons came from petroleum,
        1,128,000,000
        gallons came from natural gas, 104,000,000 gallons came from
        coke
        ovens,
        and only 742,000 gallons came from tar refineries. Regarding the
        other
        products of petroleum, gas and fuel oil production amounted to
        9,660,000,000
        gallons in 1921, increasing to 15,340,000,000 gallons in 1926,
        while
        lubricating
        oils were produced to the extent of 876,000,000 gallons in 1921
        and
        1,355,000,000
        gallons in 1926. </p>
      <p>The shale oil industry of the US (384), while not large, is
        making
        progress.
        In 1923, approximately 10.300 net tons of shale were carbonized
        to
        yield
        392,000 gallons of oil and in 1924 about 23,400 net tons of oil
        shale
        were
        distilled to recover 600,000 gallons of oil. Some of this oil
        was sold
        for fuel, while a large part was refined for its by-products. </p>
      <p>Coffin (375) states that from 6 to 12 pounds of creosote oil
        per
        cubic
        feet of timber are used in wood preservation, depending upon
        whether
        the
        vacuum or the pressure process of treating is employed. In other
        words,
        form 2.5 to 5 gallons of oil are consumed in creosoting each
        railroad
        tie
        that is so treated. In addition to the treatment of railroad
        ties,
        there
        is a vast outlet for creosote oil in treating poles, posts,
        piles, mine
        props, shingles, and other forms of lumber. The domestic
        production of
        creosote oil increased from 59,100,000 gallons in 1919 to
        90,300,000
        gallons
        in 1926, while imports to the US, mainly from England and
        Germany,
        increased
        from 6,500,000 gallons to 95,400,000 gallons in the same years.
        There
        is
        no real difficulty, therefore, in disposing of the creosote
        fractions
        of
        either low temperature or high temperature tar, as far as the
        market is
        concerned. Incidentally, it might be mentioned that a good deal
        of low
        temperature oil from the Maclaurin process has actually been
        imported
        to
        the US, where it has been sold as creosote oil and is said to
        have been
        of better quality than that ordinarily found in the local
        market. </p>
      <p>The real difficulty in the tar distilling industry has been the
        burden
        of pitch disposal. The use of the residual tar and petroleum
        distillates
        has grown tremendously in the past decade, until today the
        demand for
        road
        material constitutes on of the largest single fields for tar
        products.
        In 1925, there were consumed in the US about 100,000,000 gallons
        of
        road
        bitumen, of all types, and this figure is increasing at the rate
        of
        about
        8% per annum. Soule (385) states that, while the market for
        creosote
        oil
        is increasing, the market for pitch is rapidly decreasing, due
        to
        competition
        from petroleum asphalt, as a roofing material, and from
        petroleum
        asphalt
        and concrete as a paving material. The tendency, therefore, is
        for the
        tar refiners to distill more and more of the tar to a hard
        pitch.
        Consequently,
        the outlook for the pitch is only its value as a fuel, in which
        field
        it
        can command about $0.03 per gallon. For this reason, the tar,
        which
        contains
        the greatest amount of creosote oil and the least amount of
        pitch, as
        does
        primary tar, is worth the most to the distiller and hence will
        doubtlessly
        command a higher price in the future than high temperature tar.
      </p>
      <p>Another outlet for low temperature oil is that of gas oil for
        carbureting
        water gas, a use for which tests have demonstrated its
        suitability.
        Since
        743,000,000 gallons of gas oil were used in 1920, according to
        McBride
        (386), it is estimated that upwards of one billion gallons were
        consumed
        in the US during 1927. </p>
      <p>In the past, disposal of pitch has been a difficult problem, as
        it
        has
        faced a highly competitive market from bitumen from other
        sources, such
        as the petroleum industry. At times, it could not even be sold
        at any
        price
        and the accumulated surplus itself became a burden. Ultimately,
        it was
        found that this pitch could be coked in abandoned beehive ovens
        to
        yield
        a material useful for special purposes. Beehive pitch coke is
        very
        hard,
        and because of its freedom from ash and sulfur, it has been
        found to be
        particularly suitable for certain phases of the metallurgical
        industry,
        to the extent that its price is considerably greater than that
        of
        by-product
        coke. The pitch coke market is not yet saturated and Weiss (372)
        states
        that some 300,000 net tons have been disposed of in the US from
        1921 to
        1926. </p>
      <p>It is generally conceded that the trend is for lower
        manufactured
        gas
        prices in the future, especially if any great expansion takes
        place,
        through
        increased consumption for domestic heating and increased
        production
        through
        a general adoption of low temperature carbonization, either for
        the
        preparation
        of a domestic fuel or a boiler fuel. On the other hand,
        depletion of
        the
        natural gas supply is likely to increase the price of this fuel
        to a
        point
        more compatible with the value per thermal unit that has been
        enjoyed
        by
        other gaseous fuels. While coke oven gas has been gradually
        replacing
        natural
        gas for a number of years, the general trend is yet too
        indefinite to
        determine
        the extent of this substitution. The replacement of natural gas
        by coke
        oven gas for city distribution is the normal outcome of
        depletion of
        the
        natural gas fields. There are also additional factors which
        affect the
        situation, among them the relative prices of anthracite and gas
        oil,
        both
        of which are used in the production of manufactured gas. </p>
      <p>According to Tryon and Bennit (383), the total gas sales of the
        US
        increased
        form 895 billion cu ft in 1915 to 1.834 trillion cu ft in 1925.
        Of the
        total in 1915, surplus coke oven gas represented 9.4%, or 34
        billion cu
        ft; manufactured coal and water gas, 20.3%, or 182 billion cu
        ft; and
        natural
        gas 70.3%, or 629 billion cu ft. Of the total in 1925, surplus
        coke
        oven
        gas represented 19.7%, or 362 billion cu ft; and natural gas,
        64.9%, or
        1.189 trillion cu ft. The production of natural gas in the US
        has been
        irregular in trend (387), increasing from 582 billion cu ft in
        1913 to
        795 billion cu ft in 1917, after which it decreased, through
        exhaustion
        of the known fields, to 662 billion cu ft in 1921, rising again
        to
        1.164
        trillion cu ft in 1925 with the discovery of new supplies. </p>
      <p>Statistics gathered by Curtis (379) show a regularly increasing
        trend
        of sodium nitrate importations from Chile, rising from 656,000
        net tons
        in 1910 to a maximum of 2,199,000 net tons in 1919. Thereafter
        the
        importations
        have had erratic fluctuations, rising to 1,282,000 net tons in
        1920,
        falling
        to only 121,000 net tons in 1921, and again climbing to
        1,266,000 net
        tons
        in 1925. </p>
      <p>The ammonium sulfate produced in by-product coke ovens of the
        US,
        according
        to
        Curtis (379), increased from 35,000 net tons in 1915 to 348,000
        net
        tons
        in 1922 and the total ammonium sulfate equivalent, including
        what might
        have been manufactured from the ammoniacal liquor which was
        recovered,
        increased from 81,000 net tons to 449,000 net tons over the same
        period.
        The amount of nitrogen that was recovered from the manufactured
        gas
        industry
        was far less and the trend of production indicated a decrease of
        recovery.
        The total ammonium sulfate equivalent, obtained from coal gas
        plants in
        the US, decreased from 54,000 net tons in 1912 to 30,000 tons in
        1922. </p>
      <p>An analysis of the nitrogen supply of the US, made by McBride
        (369),
        shows an increase from 76,000 net tons of nitrogen in 1919 to
        117,000
        net
        tons in 1924, exclusive of Chilean nitrate, but including all
        other
        nitrogenous
        forms. Of the 1924 supply, 91.5% was recovered from coke ovens,
        4.7%
        came
        from gas works, 3% was produced from atmospheric fixation, and
        0.8% was
        imported as ammonium sulfate. The production of synthetic
        ammonia has
        increased
        substantially since these statistics were gathered. Of these
        supplies,
        38,5% was consumed in mixed fertilizer, 23.1% was exported,
        15.9% was
        sold
        as aqua ammonia, and 11.5% as anhydrous ammonia, the remainder
        being
        used
        in the manufacture of chemicals and explosives or consumed
        directly as
        unmixed fertilizer. </p>
      <p>Orrok (388) has noted that the entire fixed inorganic nitrogen
        supply
        of the US in 1926 amounted to 282,000 net tons of nitrogen
        content, of
        which roughly 38% was represented by ammonium sulfate, obtained
        from
        the
        distillation of coal; 56% was imported from Chile as saltpeter;
        2%
        consisted
        of other nitrogenous imports; while the remaining 4% was
        furnished by
        the
        synthetic fixed nitrogen industry. This supply was consumed to
        the
        extent
        of 36% as domestic fertilizer, 24% for export, 28% was used as
        ammonia,
        principally as a refrigerant, and 12% found its way into the
        chemical
        and
        explosive industries. </p>
      <p><a name="central"></a><b>Central Station By-Product Recovery ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the greatest fields for low temperature carbonization is
        in
        the
        preparation of a boiler fuel with simultaneous by-product
        recovery. In
        this instance, the smokeless characteristic of semi-coke loses
        its
        significance,
        where large power stations, equipped with modern high-efficiency
        combustion
        equipment, are concerned. The application of low temperature
        carbonization
        to such plants, therefore, must be largely justified by the
        economies
        which
        it effects in the cost of power, through the recovery and sale
        of
        by-products,
        rather than upon consideration of the civic interests of the
        community.
        Economically, the most favorable situation for the integration
        of low
        temperature
        carbonization with central electric stations is obviously where
        the
        electric
        company is affiliated with a city gas company. In such cases,
        the
        natural
        growth of gas load can be met by gas from the carbonization
        plants,
        built
        to provide a processed fuel for a new steam generating capacity,
        installed
        to meet the growth in the electric load. Furthermore, such an
        affiliation
        provides an assured and adequate outlet for the most difficult
        of all
        by-products
        of carbonization to market. </p>
      <p>Brownlie (389), in discussing the application of low
        temperature
        carbonization
        to by-product recovery in central electric stations, classifies
        the
        processes
        into 3 general methods: first, those in which the coal is
        carbonized in
        the slack or crushed condition and is fed to the furnace on
        stokers;
        second,
        those in which the coal is distilled while in the powdered form,
        in
        which
        case the semi-coke is fired to the furnace in a pulverized form;
        and,
        third,
        those in which the solid fuel is completely gasified and the gas
        is
        burned
        under boilers or is used as a fuel for internal combustion
        engines. He
        further divides the first class into two types: those in which
        the
        solid
        fuel is completely gasified and the gas is burned under boilers
        or is
        used
        as a fuel for internal combustion engines. He further divides
        the first
        class into two types: those which are primarily intended to be
        used in
        conjunction with a boiler furnace, and those which are
        segregated from
        and may be operated entirely independently of a boiler furnace.
        In the
        last category, practically all low temperature processes may be
        included. </p>
      <p>Some full-scale experimental work has been carried on in
        England
        (390)
        on the use of low temperature gas from an internally heated
        partial
        gasification
        process as a fuel for internal combustion engines. The scheme
        has been
        quite successful, when using a low grade refuse fuel as the raw
        material.
        In the US, however, the use of gas fuel in internal combustion
        engines
        has never made great headway and it is unlikely that the advent
        of low
        temperature carbonization will materially change the situation
        in
        America,
        except possibly for small local power supplies which are remote
        from
        markets
        for the gas. Notwithstanding the successful development of the
        gas
        turbine,
        any extensive expansion of low temperature carbonization, as
        applied to
        power generation, is more likely to develop along the lines of
        preparing
        a boiler fuel for use in the generation of steam to supply high
        efficiency,
        high capacity turbines. </p>
      <p>A number of different low temperature processes have been tried
        experimentally
        in the preparation of boiler fuel. Among these the McEwen-Runge
        process
        for pulverized coal, installed at the Lakeside station in
        Milwaukee,
        and
        the Piron-Caracristi lead bath process, formerly installed at
        the River
        Rouge, Michigan, and at the Walkerville, Ontario, plants of the
        Ford
        Motor
        Company, have already been described fully in Chapter VI and
        need not
        be
        further discussed here. A short description of some of the other
        installations,
        not heretofore described, are pertinent at this point, however.
      </p>
      <p>The Pintsch process (391) involves the use of a short vertical
        retort,
        located immediately above the front end of the chain-grate
        stoker of a
        boiler furnace. The raw coal, being fed to the boiler, is thus
        carbonized
        by internal heating with a portion of the hot products of
        combustion
        withdrawn
        from the furnace. The semi-coke is delivered from the bottom of
        the
        retort
        directly upon the chain-grate stoker and fed hot to the
        combustion
        chamber.
        The gases, after removal of the volatile products, are returned
        to the
        boiler and burned. Approximately 35,000 cu ft to 45,000 cu ft of
        the
        combustion
        gas at 1200 F is withdrawn from the furnace for carbonization
        purposes
        and subsequently leaves the furnace at about 250 F. This
        process
        is
        used in Germany for non-coking and brown coals. The first
        installation
        was at the Municipal Electricity Station of Lichtenberg, near
        Berlin,
        in
        1919, but more than 12 plants are said to have been installed in
        Germany
        and Sweden since that date. </p>
      <p>Practically all of the processes invented by Merz and McLelan
        (392)
        involve the use of internal carbonization by superheated steam.
        The
        various
        systems also employ a vertical retort, but their chief novelty
        lies in
        the scheme for steam extraction and return of heat to
        heat-exchangers.
        These processes have been used experimentally at the Dunstan
        station,
        Newcastle-on-Tyne,
        England. Steam is bled from the turbine at a pressure of about
        one psi
        and is superheated to about 950 F in a separate superheater.
        This
        superheated steam is then admitted to the bottom of the retort
        and, as
        it rises, it distills the descending charge. The mixture of
        steam and
        volatile
        products then passes to a heat exchanger, wherein the heat is
        extracted
        and returned as low pressure steam to the lower stages of the
        turbine. </p>
      <p>The Wisner (393) process, otherwise known as the Carbocite
        process,
        is a 2-stage method carried out in rotary retorts. It has been
        under
        experimental
        investigation for the preparation of boiler fuel at the Philo,
        Ohio,
        station.
        The coal is treated in the first or upper retort by partial
        oxidation
        to
        destroy its agglutinating properties. Thereafter, the coal
        descends at
        a temperature of about 600 F to the second stage, consisting of
        two
        parallel retorts, located immediately below. The carbonizing
        cylinders
        are heated externally. </p>
      <p>The Hanl process (391), used at the Bismark mine in Upper
        Silesia,
        Germany,
        consists of a vertical cast-iron retort which contains an
        agitator
        provided
        for the purpose of stirring the charge vigorously during its
        descent.
        The
        retort is heated internally by the introduction of a regulated
        amount
        of
        air to effect partial gasification. The heating medium,
        generated by a
        small amount of partial gasification, is augmented by the
        withdrawal of
        a portion of the combusted gas from the furnace. The hot
        semi-coke
        discharges
        directly upon a mechanical stoker. </p>
      <p>The Salerni process (394), otherwise known as the Salerno
        process,
        has
        been established experimentally at the Langerbrugge station at
        Ghent,
        Belgium
        This is an externally heated process provided wit a number of
        long
        narrow
        semi-cylindrical cast-iron troughs, each fitted with a paddle
        agitator.
        The crushed charge flows along progressively from one trough to
        another
        during carbonization. </p>
      <p>In recent years, central electric stations have shown a
        tendency
        to
        adopt pulverized fuel, in which certain advantages have been
        seen. If
        the
        present trend continues, consideration must be given to the
        production
        of semi-coke suitable for firing as a pulverized fuel. There are
        3
        possible
        cases: pulverization of the fuel after low temperature
        carbonization,
        pulverization
        between primary and secondary carbonization, and pulverization
        before
        carbonization.
        Practically all processes can more or less lay claim to the
        first
        method. </p>
      <p>Soule (385) has suggested that between two powdered materials
        as a
        pulverized
        fuel at the same cost per thermal unit, the cost of generating
        steam
        will
        be the least in that (1) which burns faster, (2) which liberates
        more
        of
        its heat in an available form, and (3) which is adapted the more
        readily
        to automatic control. The faster a fuel burns, the smaller the
        furnace
        volume required to combust a given amount of fuel and also the
        higher
        the
        furnace temperature and the greater is the steam generating
        capacity
        for
        a given area of heating surface. The heat losses in the
        combustion of
        bituminous
        coal are distributed among several items, of which about 4.2% is
        in the
        latent heat of water vapor, formed from the combustion of
        hydrogen in
        the
        raw coal; 4% is lost as sensible heat in the flue gas;1% as
        radiation;
        0.5% as unburned combustible in the ash; and 0.3% is lost the
        evaporation
        of free moisture in the coal. The first and last of these offer
        the
        greatest
        promise of reduction. Concerning the third point, it is quite
        obvious
        that
        the fuel which involves the lowest firing cost is the one which
        can be
        fed to the furnace with the least difficulty under automatic
        control. </p>
      <p>As compared with pulverized coal, powdered semi-coke has no
        tendency
        to fuse and agglomerate upon admittance to the furnace, which
        together
        with its greater reactivity makes it considerably more
        combustible. In
        the second place, removal of practically all the moisture and
        nearly
        all
        the hydrogen during carbonization increases the fuel efficiency
        of
        semi-coke
        4% to 5%, as compared with the raw coal. Finally, as compared
        with
        pulverized
        coal, the flowing qualities of semi-coke are said to be vastly
        superior,
        thereby resulting in greater ease of transport and permitting
        more
        success
        in automatic control. On the other hand, semi-coke will have a
        greater
        ash content than the coal from which it was made, and its
        calorific
        value
        per pound may be more or less than the raw coal, depending upon
        the
        type
        of fuel originally carbonized. Taking all these matters into
        consideration,
        but without regard to other advantages, such as smokelessness,
        high
        combustion
        rate, etc., Soule (385) concluded that as a pulverized boiler
        fuel,
        semi-coke
        was worth on the whole, pound for pound, as much as the
        pulverized coal
        from which it was made, a conclusion reached independently from
        similar
        considerations by the present author, under the discussion of
        power
        char
        in Chapter IV. </p>
      <p>Some actual tests of a pulverized fuel boiler of the Woodeson
        type,
        using semi-coke form the Nielsen process, have been reported
        (395). The
        particular boiler had 5,200 sq ft of heating surface and 2,400
        sq ft of
        economizer surface. It was rated at a capacity of 40,000 to
        50,000
        pounds
        of steam evaporated per hour at a pressure of 250 psi. The test
        was
        highly
        successful. The calorific value of the fuel was 10,670 BTU/lb
        and the
        combusted
        gas contained 16.5% carbon dioxide with a flue temperature of
        390
        F. The feed-water temperature was 112 F and the average steam
        pressure
        was 218 psi, superheated to 537 F. The equivalent evaporation
        was
        69,300 lb of steam per hour from and at 212 F, which amounted
        to
        an
        evaporation of 9.2 lb of steam from and at 212 F per lb of
        semi-coke.
        Each gross ton of the raw coke yielded, aside from the
        production of
        72.5%
        of its weight as semi-coke, 23.5 gallons of crude oil, of which
        25% was
        a good lubricant, and 7,000 cu ft of gas with a thermal value of
        485
        BTU/cu
        ft. </p>
      <p>The direct burning of fuel in the generation of electric power
        with
        modern large turbo-generators, efficient boilers, and improved
        methods
        of firing, requires the minimum capital expenditure, and
        consumes less
        fuel in the production of a kilowatt-hour of electricity than
        does any
        other method. It does not follow, however, since that procedure
        does
        not
        recover the by-products of the fuel, that it is the cheapest
        means of
        electrical
        generation. The degree to which this is so is contingent upon
        the cost,
        capital and operating, of extracting the by-products and upon
        the
        condition
        of the markets for their disposition. As far as conservation of
        national
        resources is concerned, while indeed the burning of raw coal
        constitutes
        a waste of by-products, the extraction of by-products involves
        the
        consumption
        of more coal. From that standpoint, it is merely a question of
        which is
        the more important nationally, conservation of by-products or
        conservation
        of coal. </p>
      <p>All by-product recovery schemes in central electric stations,
        as
        compared
        with direct coal firing, require a larger outlay of capital,
        increased
        cost of operation, and a larger fuel consumption, to provide for
        a
        given
        power demand and to generate a given quantity of electricity. An
        essential
        factor in the financial stability of a by-product recovery
        scheme, in
        conjunction
        with a power plant, is a sustained market for the by-products,
        fluctuations
        in the market value of which would be reflected in the cost of
        power
        generation.
        Thus, not only would the cost of a unit of electricity depend
        upon the
        cost of coal, but also upon the selling price of the tar, gas,
        light
        oil,
        and ammonium sulfate, if it is recovered. From the standpoint of
        power
        plant operation, there are many drawbacks to incorporation of a
        carbonizing
        plant, such as the increased transportation charges through
        handling a
        greater amount of coal, larger employment of labor, and a
        generally
        greater
        complexity in plant operation and coordination. If the
        production of a
        boiler fuel is coupled with the manufacture and sale of a
        certain
        amount
        of the coke as a domestic fuel, then the financial aspects of
        carbonization,
        as an adjunct to central stations, changes completely, for a
        portion of
        the solid fuel is thereby treated as a by-product. It is
        anticipated,
        however,
        that central power stations would be loathe to complicate their
        business
        by expansion into the domestic fuel processing field. </p>
      <p>Porter (260) feels that an integration of coal carbonization
        and
        power
        generation does not offer great promise of financial success, at
        the
        present
        time, because he believes that the overall efficiency from raw
        coal to
        steam by direct burning is too great in modern furnaces with
        modern
        combustion
        equipment to be counter-balanced by the recovery and sale of
        by-products,
        through introduction of a less thermally efficient system from
        coal to
        steam. From this argument, he concludes that the possibilities
        of such
        an integration rest solely on an increased efficiency of the
        carbonization
        process, or on the development of some system, such as low
        temperature
        carbonization, wherein the by-products are of a character which
        will
        yield
        sufficient returns to reduce the net cost of available heat in
        the
        solid
        fuel. </p>
      <p>Wellington and Cooper (89) studied the economics of low
        temperature
        carbonization, as applied to English central electric stations,
        in a
        number
        of different forms, including direct firing of the semi-coke,
        complete
        gasification of the residual fuel, and various other
        combinations. They
        concluded that the method of complete gasification cannot
        receive
        serious
        consideration, as compared with direct coal firing of boilers,
        but that
        the best solution of low temperature carbonization applied to a
        boiler
        plant is that in which the semi-coke is directly fired to the
        furnace,
        along with the surplus gas. In this case, they concluded that
        the cost
        of generating a kilowatt-hour of electricity was below that of
        direct
        coal
        firing, but they pointed out that there were certain
        fluctuations in
        the
        market value of the residuals, which would be reflected as a
        fluctuation
        in the cost of generating power. It is obviously non-essential
        that the
        gas be combusted in the boiler, if it can be profitably disposed
        of
        otherwise. </p>
      <p>As a matter of record, in connection with the economics of the
        preparation
        of boiler fuel by low temperature carbonization, Savage (296)
        has
        called
        attention to a case in the Western US where 65,000 net tons of
        raw
        coal,
        costing $3.05 per net ton delivered, are annually burned as fuel
        for a
        large power station. The peculiar market conditions in the
        vicinity of
        the plant were such that it was estimated that the entire fuel
        requirements
        of the station could be met by carbonizing 93,000 net tons of
        coal
        annually,
        at a net revenue of $1.47 per net ton of raw coal, over and
        above the
        cost
        of the fuel, when the carbonized fuel was charged to the boilers
        at a
        price
        equivalent to the raw coal, weight for weight. </p>
      <p>Soule (385) has studied the economics of pulverized coal
        carbonization
        in power plants. According to this authority, the investment in
        such a
        carbonization plant is less than $1,000 per net ton of raw coal
        daily
        throughput,
        including cost of the by-product plant. He figured the fixed
        charges,
        at
        80% capacity factor, to be $0.50 per ton and the operating
        expense to
        be
        $0.70 per ton, giving a total carbonizing cost of $1.20 per net
        ton of
        coal. With the sale of tar at $0.055 per gallon, motor fuel at
        $0.15
        per
        gallon, and gas at $0.30 per thousand cubic feet, he calculated
        the
        revenue
        from by-products at $3.60 per net ton, which cost $4.50
        delivered. On a
        yield of 73.8% semi-coke, this places the net cost of one net
        ton of
        power
        char at $2.85, as compared with $4.50 per net ton of raw coal. </p>
      <p>Orrok (388, 397), quoting Junkersfeld (398), has demonstrated
        rather
        convincingly how rapidly a new turbine, or central electric
        station, is
        superseded by more efficient equipment, which in its turn
        assumes the
        burden
        of carrying the base load of a particular electric supply system
        and he
        concluded, with Klingenberg (399), that the economical 100%
        capacity
        operation
        of a coal processing plant is difficult to reconcile with the
        variable
        output and 50% or lower capacity of a central electric station.
        The
        validity
        of such an argument, however, loses force when it is recognized
        as
        non-essential
        that the sensible heat of the coke be utilized. In reality, the
        heat
        lost
        on this item amounts to comparatively little and a large part of
        this
        can
        be recovered by rational cooling or dry quenching. Consequently,
        there
        is no good reason why the carbonization plant cannot be operated
        at
        full
        load, storing processed fuel for use on the peak demands of the
        system.
        And in 5 years, when obsolescence shall have reduced the station
        load
        factor
        from 50% to 35%, the carbonization plant will yet be operating
        at 70%
        capacity
        factor. </p>
      <p><a name="plantloc"></a><b>Plant Location ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is customary for a carbonization plant, located near the
        market,
        to carry from one to two months' coal supply in storage, thus
        assuring
        the plant against any coal stoppages of short duration, either
        because
        of mine shutdown or because of transportation curtailments.
        Furthermore,
        the location of coke plants at large transportation centers
        permits
        them
        to draw upon a number of different sources for their fuel supply
        or to
        route their raw material by a number of different transportation
        lines.
        For this reason, a carbonization plant located near the point of
        consumption
        is more independent of conditions beyond its control than one
        located
        at
        the mines and dependent upon a single source for its raw fuel
        and a
        single
        carrier for its transportation facilities. Location of the
        carbonization
        plant adjacent to the mine has the distinct advantage of
        permitting the
        use of low grade fuels, which cannot be economically transported
        very
        great
        distances, because of their large proportion of incombustible
        material.
        Mine-mouth carbonization plants, however, suffer the
        disadvantage of
        necessitating
        transportation of the distillation products, of which the gas
        becomes
        particularly
        burdensome, unless high pressure transmission can be effected or
        unless
        there is a nearby market. </p>
      <p>Lander (400) is convinced that the proper location for low
        temperature
        carbonization is at the mine pit, as far as the use of waste and
        other
        low grade fuels is concerned, and he is equally convinced that,
        for
        other
        materials, the gasworks is the proper place for primary
        carbonization,
        for there only can the full value be secured for the gas. The
        value of
        the gas at the gasworks is roughly 5 times that of the gas for
        heating
        purposes at the mine mouth. Lander (400) has also pointed out
        that it
        makes
        little difference where the coke is made, for the freight rate
        over a
        given
        distance is approximately the same for the coke produced from a
        ton of
        coal as it is for the ton of raw coal itself. While the weight
        of coke
        that must be transported is roughly 70% of the weight of the
        coal, the
        volume of the coke produced is approximately the same as that of
        the
        raw
        coal. </p>
      <p>Christie (401) has noted that, while in general the low
        temperature
        carbonization plant is best located near the market for its
        products,
        there
        are exceptions to this rule. The impending exhaustion of natural
        gas
        from
        districts where coal deposits exist make low temperature
        carbonization
        a possibility in such cases, for then the existing natural gas
        pipelines
        can be used for its transportation. </p>
      <p>In addition to the question of proper location of the
        carbonization
        plant, consideration must be given to the best location for the
        tar
        refinery,
        if the two industries are to be integrated under one
        organization.
        While
        in the past there may have been some justification for shipping
        tar
        from
        the producer to a distant point for distillation, because of
        insufficient
        quantities to warrant an individual refinery, this is no longer
        the
        case
        when tar is produced in large quantities. Soule (385) says that,
        by
        distilling
        the tar at the point of production, from $0.02 to $0.03 per
        gallon can
        be saved in freight and only the high value oil need be shipped.
        The
        still
        coke can then be mixed with the coal and coked to a solid fuel.
      </p>
      <p>Examination of the freight tariffs on bituminous coal for
        approximately
        a hundred different sets of origins and destination shows a
        great
        diversity
        (402, 403). While there is much variation from the mean, the
        average
        rate
        increases from about $1.80 per net ton, for a 100-mile haul, to
        about
        $3.80
        per net ton for a 500-mile haul. Individual tariffs may vary
        above or
        below
        these figures by as much as 25%. </p>
      <p>The freight rates on solid fuels depend quite as much on their
        volume
        as upon their weight, so that the specific weights of the
        different
        materials
        give some idea of the relative costs of transportation. The
        freight
        tariff,
        for a given distance and a given weight, varies approximately
        inversely
        as the weight of the material per cubic feet. The specific
        weight of
        anthracite
        varies from 53 to 60 lb/cu ft, with an average of about 55 lb/cu
        ft,
        depending
        upon its source and size. The specific weight of bituminous coal
        varies
        from 43 to 67 lb/cu ft, with an average of 49 lb/cu ft. The
        specific
        weight
        of by-product coke varies from 29 to 32 lb/cu ft, with an
        average of 30
        lb/cu ft. </p>
      <p>Although the coke weighs approximately 70% less than the coal
        from
        which
        it was made, weight for weight, it is bulkier. Consequently, the
        coke
        produced
        form a ton of coal occupies approximately the same volume as the
        original
        coal. This means that approximately as many freight cars are
        required
        to
        haul the coke as to transport the raw coal. For this reason,
        added to
        the
        greater value of the coke per ton, freight rtes on coke are
        distinctly
        higher than on coal. McBride (369) states that formerly freight
        rates
        were
        based on beehive coke, which was manufactured near the mines and
        had to
        be transported to the markets, but with the present tendency to
        locate
        by-product ovens at the point of consumption, together with the
        impending
        competition of coke with anthracite as a domestic fuel, there
        are
        indications
        of freight readjustments, but for the present, the freight
        tariff on
        coke
        is very complicated. There is also a complicated relationship
        between
        coke
        tariffs and those on bituminous coal. If the rate on coke is
        relatively
        the higher, the situation favors location of the plant at the
        point of
        consumption, and if it is relatively low, the tendency is to
        locate
        near
        the mines. Finally, the establishment of railroad tariffs is in
        the
        hands
        of a public authority, which may have many consequences to
        consider in
        rate fixation. </p>
      <p>The freight rate on coke varies form about $2.50 per net ton,
        for
        a
        distance of 100 miles, to about $4.50 per net ton for a 400-mile
        haul.
        Chatfield (404) reported the tariff, established by the
        Interstate
        Commerce
        Commission on fuel oil and gas oil in tank cars, as increasing
        from
        about
        $0.19 per 100 lb for a 200-mile haul to about $0.36 per 100 lb
        for a
        700-mile
        haul. The tariff for gasoline was fixed at about 25% higher than
        the
        rate
        for fuel oil and gas oil. Individual tariffs may vary form these
        figures
        by as much as 15%. Coke oven tar takes essentially the same
        freight
        rate
        as fuel oil. The tariff on ammonium sulfate increases from about
        $0.20
        per 100 lb for a distance of 100 miles to about $0.30 per 100 lb
        for a
        distance of 400 miles. </p>
      <p>According to Wagner (405), natural gas gasoline has been
        successfully
        transmitted through a 3-inch pipe for a distance of
        approximately 15
        miles
        at the rate of 50,000 gal/day. In this case, however, the
        terrain was
        almost
        flat with a gentle downgrade slope, so that this success sets no
        precedent
        for transmission over an irregular topography, where gas
        accumulation
        at
        the apex of high points in the pipeline may be a serious
        difficulty. </p>
      <p>If low temperature tar could be transported by pipeline and if
        the
        quantities
        were sufficient to warrant laying the pipe, quite a saving could
        be
        effected
        over the cost of its transportation by rail in tank cars. While
        the
        viscosity
        of most low temperature tars is high, there is no reason why
        they could
        not be treated in much the same way as the heavy crude
        petroleums of
        the
        Western US are handled, that is, by warming the fluid between
        pumping
        stations
        to increase its fluidity and by the use of rifled pipe. </p>
      <p>The main petroleum trunk lines of the US are 8-inch pipe, but a
        few
        6-inch and 10-inch pipes are in existence, Diesel engines are
        usually
        employed
        to drive the pressure pumps, which are used for forcing the oil
        through
        the pipes. These pumping stations are located at intervals of
        from 10
        to
        35 miles, depending upon the topography of the country, the
        viscosity
        of
        the oil, and the prevailing temperatures in the region. When a
        very
        viscous
        oil is transported, it is often necessary to heat it at the
        pumping
        stations
        to increase its fluidity. Up to 1920, the longest petroleum
        pipeline
        was
        1,610 miles. According to Rathburn (406, 407), roughly 95% of
        the crude
        petroleum in the US is moved by pipeline at a cost estimated to
        be
        approximately
        65% of the cost of transportation by rail. </p>
      <p>The feasibility of transmitting large quantities of gas by
        pipeline
        to the consumption centers depends primarily upon the
        utilization of
        this
        gas for the base load, the peaks of the distribution system
        being taken
        by gas which is generated locally. Experience with the
        transmission of
        natural gas and coke oven gas by pipeline indicates that the
        technical
        aspects of the problem is wholly one of economics. </p>
      <p>There are two pipelines over 300 miles long for the
        transmission
        of
        natural gas from West Virginia to Ohio. These lines are composed
        of
        20-inch
        and 16-inch welded steel pipe. A similar line 450 miles long,
        operating
        at 450 psi initial pressure, maintained at intervals by 7
        compressor
        stations.
        Driven by gas engines supplied with fuel from the line, has been
        contemplated.
        In the Ruhr district of Germany, coke oven gas is transmitted 63
        miles
        by pipeline and consideration has been given to the high
        pressure
        distribution
        of coke oven gas from this district over a maximum distance of
        450
        miles.
        In the US coke oven gas is transmitted by pipeline from South
        Bethlehem,
        PA to the Philadelphia district, and similar projects involving
        transmission
        of coke oven gas over distances up to 40 miles have been under
        consideration. </p>
      <p>A low temperature plant, treating 1000 tons of coal per day and
        selling
        all the high calorific value low temperature gas, using producer
        gas
        for
        heating the retorts, would generate about 200,000 cu ft of gas
        per hour
        by the externally heated method. According to a study made by
        Crowell
        (408),
        a 12-inch pipeline, operating at an initial pressure of 90 psi,
        would
        deliver
        this gas at a terminal pressure of 20 psi at a distance of 100
        miles.
        He
        figures the total cost of delivery, including all carrying and
        operating
        charges at $0.28 per 100 cu ft of gas, when gas engine
        compressors are
        used. The present author, however, believes that by raising the
        initial
        pressure to 400 psi and using a correspondingly smaller welded
        pipe,
        the
        cost of delivering the gas 100 miles could be reduced to $0.12
        per 1000
        cu ft, or less. In any event, these figures illustrate how
        essential it
        is to transmit the gas at as high a pressure and for as short a
        distance
        as is feasible to reach the market. </p>
      <p><a name="fuelres"></a><b>Fuel Resources ~</b> </p>
      <p>Redmayne (409) has estimated the coal reserves of the world in
        1924
        at approximately8.3 trillion tons, of which the US had about
        half. A
        tabulation
        of the reserves by countries is given in Table 129. The reserve
        given
        by
        Redmayne for the US is somewhat larger than the
        3,419,300,000,000 tons
        reported by Cambell (410), at of the end of 1925, but in this
        latter
        the
        resources of Alaska and certain deep deposits are apparently not
        included.
        Only about two-thirds of this is recoverable, however, for the
        mining
        losses
        amount to about 35% by the present methods of mining. </p>
      <p>The sub-bituminous coals and lignites of the Western US
        constitute
        about
        half of this country's supply and a large proportion of these
        reserves
        are of low heating value and contain a large amount of moisture.
        As the
        Eastern fuel reserves become exhausted and the cost of power for
        manufacturing
        becomes correspondingly greater, the migration of the center of
        industry
        westward will draw upon the fuel reserves nearest the market and
        there
        will arise a need for processing these low grade fuels to
        appreciate
        their
        market vale and to increase the efficiency of their utilization.
        Even
        now,
        if the Dakota lignites could be treated by low temperature
        carbonization,
        or otherwise, to raise their form value sufficiently to meet the
        local
        fuel needs, an enormous expenditure for freight on hauling
        bituminous
        coal
        from the Eastern fields would be saved annually. </p>

      <p>Statistics gathered by the US Bureau of Mines and shown in
        table
        130
        give the world's production of coal by countries for various
        years. The
        US is by far the greatest producer, having supplied from 38 to
        46% of
        the
        entire world's supply for the 15 years preceding 1926. Next in
        order of
        importance comes Germany, great Britain, and France. The figures
        given
        in Table 130 include anthracite, semi-anthracite, bituminous,
        semi-bituminous,
        lignite, and brown coals. About half of the German production
        and about
        13% of the entire world output consists of sub-bituminous coals.

      <p>White (411) estimated the proved world's petroleum resources,
        as
        of
        1928, at 43,100,000,000 barrels, which are recoverable by
        present
        methods.
        This estimated was increased to 60 billion barrels as the
        world's total
        resources, proved and prospective, Outside of the US, the most
        important
        petroleum deposits are believed to be in Mexico, Venezuala,
        Columbia,
        Bolivia,
        Argentina, Russia, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Indies, China,
        Siberia,
        Japan,
        India, and probably Northern Africa. </p>
      <p>A careful examination of the oil reserves of the US, both
        developed
        and prospective, was made in 1922 by a joint committee of the US
        Geological
        Survey and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in
        collaboration
        with many consulting geologists who were familiar with the
        stratigraphy
        and geologic structure of given localities. According to White
        (411),
        they
        concluded that the oil reserve of the US at that time wa
        9,150,000,000
        barrels recoverable by present methods, about half of which
        belongs to
        the heavy grade of fuel oil petroleum. As approximately 55
        billion
        barrels
        of oil had been produced in the US at the end of 1922, the
        original oil
        reserve must have been about 15 billion barrels, of which
        roughly half
        had been removed from the ground at the end of 1926. The reserve
        thus
        left
        is less than 15 years supply for the US at the present rate of
        consumption
        and by present means of recovery. However, all the oil deposits
        cannot
        be located in that period of time, so that in all probability
        the wells
        will keep producing a constantly decreasing amount of petroleum
        for
        perhaps
        75 years to come. </p>
      <p>The world's production of crude petroleum by countries,
        according
        to
        statistics by the US Bureau of Mines (382), is given in Table
        131. It
        will
        be observed that the US is by far the world's largest producer,
        accounting
        for 65% of the entire amount in 1922 and 71% in 1926, and even
        then, it
        was necessary to import large quantities of petroleum to meet
        the
        national
        requirements. </p>
      <p>Oil shales are found in Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland,
        Canada,
        Australia,
        new Zealand, Africa, France, Jugoslavia, Sweden, Bulgaria,
        Germany,
        Italy,
        Switzerland, Estonia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, China,
        Arabia,
        Syria, and Russia. Vast deposits of oil shale are found in the
        US,
        notably
        in Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana,
        New
        York,
        Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, California, and West
        Virginia.
        There has been practically no increase in the world's production
        of oil
        shale from 3,435,000 net tons in 1920 to 3,540,000 net tons in
        1924 and
        about 93% of the entire output came from Scotland alone. The
        only
        country
        which has shown any appreciable growth is Estonia, which
        increased from
        1.5% of the world's production to 7.4% in 1924. Even though the
        present
        development of oil shale distillation throughout the world
        appears to
        be
        practically at a standstill the vastness of the world's deposits
        remains
        as a potential source of motor fuel and of lubricants. </p>

      <p><a name="onclus"></a><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>As the products of carbonization pass from crude to more highly
        refined
        and specialized materials, they pass form industry to industry,
        each
        step
        adding an increment t their economic worth. Unfortunately, the
        demand
        for
        the highly refined products is at present limited, and
        consequently
        much
        of the by-product material is used to an inferior economic
        advantage.
        Thus,
        McBride (369) notes that about half of the total tar produced in
        the
        US,
        at the present time, is burned as a fuel instead of being
        separated
        into
        its more valuable constituents. The industrial absorption of all
        the
        possible
        tar derivatives will require many years of study to ascertain
        their
        full
        possibilities, but the time will doubtlessly arrive when no coal
        will
        be
        burned in its raw condition. Such an enlightened epoch may yet
        remain
        distantly
        in the future, but reasonable advances may be expected year by
        year.
        However,
        the practical attainment of this larger vision must rely upon
        the joint
        efforts of the various branches of the carbonization industry,
        of which
        primary distillation is one, and must rest for its realization
        upon
        such
        sound technical, economic, and business principles, as the
        present
        author
        has endeavored to outline. </p>
      <p>In regard to the national problem of coal carbonization, be it
        either
        by high or low temperature methods, Porter (260) concludes that
        it
        should
        and will be carbonized only to the extent that the economic
        demand for
        the special products thus derived creates a price which will
        justify
        their
        extraction. Furthermore, there is neither economy not
        conservation in
        the
        transformation of energy from the form of coal to those of coke,
        tar,
        and
        gas if in those forms it is generally less useful, as indicated
        by the
        market values of these products relative to the raw coal. </p>
      <p>There is a certain rivalry between high temperature and low
        temperature
        carbonization systems, inasmuch as the former is based upon
        years of
        experimentation
        and practice and has behind it a wealth of data and experience.
        The
        high
        temperature carbonization advocates are apt to judge low
        temperature
        carbonization
        in the light of this specialized experience, with its criteria
        and
        dogma
        and without a true appreciation of the methods underlying the
        art, its
        raison d'etre, or the characteristics of its products. Each
        system
        fills
        a distinct field in regard to the markets for its principal
        products.
        Runge
        (412) points out that there is really no ground for fear of
        serious
        competition
        between high temperature and low temperature carbonization,
        because the
        solid residuums do not fall in the same sphere of usefulness,
        due to
        their
        difference in physical and chemical properties; the tars are
        entirely
        distinct
        in composition and should find different markets; the low
        temperature
        gas
        should be supplemental to, rather than competitive with, high
        temperature
        gas; and finally, the only really common field for the two is
        sound in
        the use of light oil as motor fuel. </p>
      <p>According to the same authority, low temperature carbonization
        has
        suffered
        because of adverse criticism, arising from 3 sources: failure of
        a
        number
        of full-scale processes, exploitation of untried processes that
        have
        been
        based on ridiculous assertions, and the unfortunate prolific
        writing of
        those not familiar with the art. This unfavorable atmosphere,
        while
        discouraging,
        has not prevented progress by those who recognize its
        possibilities. </p>
      <p>Coming now to a conclusion of this presentation of the
        technology
        of
        low temperature carbonization the author has endeavored to
        fulfill the
        task which he undertook at the outset, namely to coordinate the
        experimental
        researches of many workers and the expert opinion of many
        authorities
        in
        such a way as to establish to art upon firm technical
        foundations and
        thereby
        overcome the empiricism which heretofore has hindered its
        progress. An
        earnest effort has been made to present all phases of the
        subject in an
        unbiased manner, giving the pros and cons of all controversial
        subjects.
        Finally, in denouement, the author can do no better than to
        quote
        Slosson
        (413) in the words with which he addressed the representatives
        of 13
        nations
        assembled in convention to discuss the world's problems of fuel
        and
        fuel
        processing: </p>
      <p>"There is no world organization that can exercise the right of
        eminent
        domain over natural resources and compel a country to stop
        wasting it
        coal
        and oil, or to employ its unused land and water power. But all
        the
        same,
        and all the more, we should rejoice when anyone discovers how to
        make a
        profit out of a waste product or how to make a process more
        efficient.
        When a way is found to convert a low grade lignite into a high
        class
        motor
        fuel, or to clean the air of our industrial towns, or to raise
        the
        efficiency
        of a fuel by low temperature carbonization, he has thereby
        benefited
        the
        human race, living and to come." </p>
