      <p><a name="hilo"></a><b>High &amp; Low Temperature Coke ~</b> </p>
      <p>Agitation for a smokeless fuel, which would eradicate the civil
        nuisance of smoke, together with the shortage of oil in some
        countries of the world have been largely responsible for the
        development of low temperature carbonization. Added to this
        incentive was the shortage of hard coals during the Great War
        and the possibility of obtaining a substitute in the form of an
        easily burning coke. Although some small amount of information
        was in hand at that time, it was soon realized that insufficient
        data were available for undertaking large-scale operations in
        coking at low temperatures. Research was the obvious remedy and,
        in recent years, a great many investigations have been made in
        this field both in the USA and abroad. </p>
      <p>In high temperature coking such as occurs in the metallurgical
        and gas industries, only a very small percentage of volatile
        matter remains in the coal after carbonization, so that from 64%
        to 74% by weight of the charge is converted into coke. Low
        temperature distillation, on the other hand, does not entirely
        remove the volatile constituents from the coal, and therefore
        the percentage yield by weight of coke may be expected to be
        somewhat larger than in the case of gas and metallurgical cokes.
        Low temperature ovens yield about 66% to 76% of the charge as
        coke. The proximate and ultimate analyses of the three types of
        coke given in Table 73 furnish an excellent basis for
        comparison. </p>
      <p>The outstanding peculiarity of the low temperature
        carbonization residuum, from a chemical standpoint, is the large
        proportion of volatile matter remaining in the coke. To this
        fact must be attributed many, though not all, of the desirable
        properties of this material as a fuel. As a consequence of the
        high volatile content, we find a somewhat greater thermal value
        in the coke which has been subjected to less extreme measures of
        carbonization. The semi-coke, or low-temperature coke, whose
        analysis is given in Table 73, represents the average of that
        obtained from 6 full-scale retorts. The large percentage of
        hydrogen recorded for the semi-coke, as compared with the cokes
        from other sources, is present in the form of volatile
        hydrocarbons. Low temperature coke also is characterized by the
        presence of considerable oxygen. The experimenters make no
        comment on this peculiarity in their reports, but doubtlessly it
        arises form the existence of volatile oxygenated hydrocarbons
        such as the organic alcohols and possibly the aldehydes and
        ketones in small quantities. It might be pointed out at this
        time that the nitrogen content of low temperature coke is
        greater than that of the high temperature varieties. This fact
        will be taken up under the subject of ammonia and nitrogen
        recovery. How nearly the problem of anthracizing bituminous coal
        is solved by the low temperature process of carbonization is
        demonstrated by comparing Table 1 and Table 2 with Table 73. It
        will be seen that semi-coke has a proximate analysis almost
        identical with that of anthracite and that the ultimate analyses
        are not greatly at variance. </p>

      <p><a name="semi"></a><b>Semi-Coke ~</b> </p>
      <p>In their experiments on the coking of Illinois coal, Parr and
        Olin (31) obtained a coke yield of 77.5% for 3-hour periods of
        distillation and 72.5% for 6-hour periods. This represents 1,550
        pounds and 1450 pounds of semi-coke per net ton of coal,
        respectively. By recalling that at a given temperature of
        carbonization the volume of gas evolved is a function of the
        duration of distillation, as shown in Figure 14, it will be seen
        that the decrease in coke yield, resulting from extension of the
        retorting period arises from the removal of more of the volatile
        matter. </p>
      <p>Pennsylvania coke, coked by Davis and Parry (97), produced an
        average of 72.2% ash, or 1,444 pounds, of semi-coke per net ton
        of coal. Their yields ranged from 70.4% to 74.8%. On the other
        hand, Parr and Layng (101), from 12 experiments on Utah coals,
        similar in analysis to that of bituminous coal given in Table 1
        and Table 2, obtained an average of 61.2%, or 1,223 pounds of
        semi-coke per net ton of charge. For the average yield of
        semi-coke, however, this figure is exceedingly low. </p>
      <p>Table 74 gives the average proximate analyses of semi-cokes
        obtained from various bituminous coals of the USA. While it is
        recognized that these tests are for different coals, certain
        deductions can be made with regard to the influence of
        temperature. It will be observed that the percentage of fixed
        carbon, for example, increases as the temperature of
        distillation advances. Such a change is to be expected since the
        higher the temperature, the less volatile matte remains in the
        residuum. Monett (100) also distilled Utah coals at 550° C. His
        yields of coke ranged from 1464 pounds to 1250 pounds per net
        ton, representing from 73.2% of the charge to 62.5%. The
        semi-coke had a thermal value ranging from 13,56 BTU to 12,227
        BTU per pound and it contained from 0.86% to 1.93% moisture;
        19.84% to 10.46% volatile matter; 81.67% to 64.35% fixed carbon;
        14.81% to 5.94% ash; and 0.40% to 1.09% sulfur. Analyses of
        these Utah coals have been given in Table 15 and Table 16, while
        the composition of the low temperature gas obtained from them
        was discussed under the subject of American coals in Chapter II.

      <p>Table 75 shows the temperature variation of the constituents of
        Farmville NC coal which originally contained 37.08% volatile
        matter, 52.95% fixed carbon, 9.03% ash, and which had a heating
        value of 14,336 BTU/lb as determined by Giles and Vilbrandt
        (99). We have already seen in Figure 12 the manner in which
        temperature influences the composition of gas evolved from this
        coal and in Table 58 its influence on the volatility of the low
        temperature tar. It must be said that this particular coal is an
        exception and the percentage of volatiles remaining in the coke
        at a given temperature is of the order of that to be found in an
        average semi-coke at approximately 200° C higher temperature.
        There is a decided change at 540° C, accompanied by a voluminous
        evolution of gas. Below that temperature, the change in the coke
        structure is uniform but slight, while above 540° C to as far as
        660° C there is little apparent change in the residuum. The
        heating value of the coke is high. It has been pointed out that
        Farmville NC coal decomposes very easily, so that only 8.95%
        volatile matter is left at 300° C. Above 540° C, where the major
        decomposition occurs, less than 1% volatile matter remains in
        the coke. </p>
      <p>In Table 29 and Table 59, the composition of the gas and the
        volatility of the tar from Washington lignite have already been
        discussed. Benson and Canfield (108) also determined in Table 76
        the effect of temperature variation on the proximate analysis of
        the char. Originally the air-dried lignite contained 39.4%
        volatile matter, which was reduced to 4.1% at 600° C. The
        percentage ash varies inversely as the percentage of volatile
        matter remaining within the residuum. Up to 500° C, the lignite
        char was dull black and it more or less retained its original
        form. From 500° C to 600° C the lumps had a metallic luster and
        swelled slightly larger than the initial size. </p>

      <p>It has been pointed out before that the Fuel Research Board
        (106) carbonized peat in vertical retorts, obtaining gas of the
        composition shown in Table 27 and tar of the character given in
        Table 60. Both proximate and ultimate analyses of the peat char,
        obtained from these experiments, are given in Table 77. The
        principal point to be noted in the carbonization of peat is the
        increase in calorific value by removal of the large amount of
        moisture present. North and Garbe (121) report a test on
        carbonizing Shetland peat at 500° C in Tozer retorts. The raw
        peat contained initially 21.4% moisture and 73.8% volatile
        matter, yielding on distillation char to the extent of 33.6% of
        the original charge and containing 18.6% volatile matter, 71.4%
        fixed carbon, and 9.9% ash. </p>
      <p>In Table 78 are given the analyses of 6 cokes form full-scale
        low temperature processes. The experiments of the Fuel Research
        Board (114) were carried out in their horizontal retorts, while
        those on Coalite (187) were in that company's vertical retorts.
        Coke from the Maclaurin (188) retort was carbonized by internal
        heating through the agency of the sensible heat of producer gas.
        Carbocoal (189) was produced through primary distillation,
        briquetting, and subsequent secondary carbonization in an
        inclined retort. The semi-coke from the Nielsen (19) process was
        produced by carbonizing the coal in a rotary retort by means of
        the sensible heat from producer gas. The Tozer (190) process
        utilized a static cast-iron vertical retort. </p>
      <p><a name="poros"></a><b>Porosity ~</b> </p>
      <p>A great deal of the ease in combustibility of semi-coke depends
        on its high volatile content, but the coke structure also has a
        great influence. One of the main factors, from a physical
        viewpoint, is the area available for oxidation. Some of the
        desirable features, however, of low temperature coke can be
        attained only by allowing a certain proportion of the volatile
        matter to remain; notable among these is a low ignition
        temperature. </p>
      <p>When coal is coked, it first reaches a fusion temperature and
        becomes plastic. Then, as the temperature is raised, gases are
        evolved and form bubbles throughout the mass until it becomes a
        foam. These bubbles then break, allowing the gases to escape.
        Rigidity finally sets in upon cooling and leaves the cellular
        structure of the coke. If the plastic material is not confined
        by walls, the bubbles swell the mass and cause it to become
        light and porous. But the pressure developed against retaining
        walls compresses the material to form a dense coke. Upon
        consideration of combustibility, it would appear that the more
        numerous and hence the smaller the pores, the greater is the
        area exposed for oxidation, and therefore the more easily the
        coke should burn. A point is reached, however, where the outside
        surface of the lump exposed to oxidation is so reduced by the
        pores as to neutralize the result. Consequently a point of
        apparent porosity is reached where there is maximum
        combustibility. We shall see later that combustibility depends
        more on the microscopic cells of the coke than on the large
        pores. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="79atab.gif" height="95" width="306"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Table 79 shows that different temperatures of carbonization
        produce coke of different porosities. The determinations were
        made by Cobb and Greenwood (191), who used a coal with 1.27
        initial specific gravity. From this table, it is evident that
        low temperature coke is less porous than either gasworks or coke
        oven coke. We shall see later that nevertheless, semi-coke is
        far more reactive and combustible than either of the others for
        several reasons, but primarily because of a microscopic cellular
        structure. </p>
      <p><a name="coher"></a><b>Coherency ~</b> </p>
      <p>Coherency depends upon the presence of sufficient resinous
        bodies to act as binding material. In their absence, various
        methods have been resorted to in order to secure a coherent
        carbonization residuum. One method of frequent use is the
        blending of coking and non-coking coals so that the resins
        present in the former will serve to bind the entire mass.
        Non-coking bituminous coals give a coke which is very friable
        and unsuitable for transportation, while coking coals cause
        trouble in the design of low temperature retorts. A blended
        charge yields a residuum upon distillation that is sufficiently
        strong, from the mechanical standpoint, and in a large part free
        of the retort design annoyances. It occasionally happens that a
        good coke is obtained without blending, solely by using the
        product of the seam as a whole, but as this situation is not a
        common occurrence, efforts have been made to provide means for
        coking the non-coking coals without resort to binding, in order
        to save transportation charges. </p>
      <p>No indication whatever of a coal's coking qualities can be
        determined from its proximate analysis, for it depends entirely
        on the proportion of resinous material present. There are two
        types of coals, the swelling and the non-swelling, depending on
        whether or not the volume of the resultant coke is greater than
        or equal to the initial volume of the coal. The coke residuum of
        non-swelling coals is usually non-coherent and friable, while
        the swelling coals form a good coke upon carbonization. For this
        reason, these two classes of coals are often classed as
        non-coking and coking. </p>
      <p>If the resins are in excess, other difficulties arise in the
        possibility of foaming, and here again a number of remedies have
        been proposed. Cruickshanks in 1841 is said to have been the
        first to propose the blending of coking and non-coking coals, so
        that the resinous deficiencies of the one can be balanced
        against the excesses of the other. This method is successful,
        but suffers the economic disadvantage of transportation. To
        avoid this objection, Roberts (192) suggested that coke breeze
        be blended with the retort charge. This proposal, however,
        reduces the quantity of virgin coal that is carbonized, and
        hence the output of the plant. </p>
      <p>Parr and Olin (31) found that the texture of the coke could be
        altered by means of exerting pressure during carbonization. When
        pistons were used for this purpose, however, the outer layers of
        the charge, which had undergone fusion, hardened and formed a
        shell surrounding the inner mass, which later became excessively
        porous due to the inability of the gases to escape. Efforts to
        overcome this by use of additional pressure resulted in fracture
        of the hardened shell and the coke was withdrawn from the retort
        in small broken pieces, They then resorted to ramming the charge
        into the retort and applying the pressure entirely before
        carbonization with decidedly more success. The semi-coke thus
        produced has a very good crushing strength and fine texture. </p>
      <p>Taylor and Porter (96) found that bituminous coal, which gave a
        friable coke at atmospheric pressures, even when slowly heated,
        gave a dense coke when carbonized in vacuo at a pressure of
        about 3 cm Hg. This is probably due to the fact that the gases
        evolved are sucked away before large bubbles can form in the
        fused mass. </p>
      <p><a name="swell"></a><b>Swelling ~</b> </p>
      <p>When coals contain a large proportion of resinous bodies,
        swelling occurs during coking. When first heated, these coals
        slightly contract. This probably results from the melting of
        certain constituents between 350° C and 450° C. A secondary
        contraction usually develops later at much higher temperatures,
        during coking proper. This is attributed to the liberation of
        gaseous products. Between the two contraction periods, the coke
        expands as the result of entrapped bubbles in the plastic mass.
        Expansion is rather slow at first until the center of the charge
        reaches a given temperature, at which point expansion increases
        enormously. This swelling is usually greater than the initial
        contraction and develops a pressure which is liable to injure
        the retort, or at least to render discharge difficult. A great
        many of the past failures encountered in low temperature retorts
        may be attributed directly or indirectly to this phenomenon. </p>
      <p>Audibert and Delmas (193) studied the intumescence of coal
        under various conditions of time, temperature, and rate of
        heating. Their method of determination was to place the finely
        ground coal in a heated metal cylinder equipped with a
        counterpoised piston to transmit expansion and contraction of
        the charge to an indicating pointer. Figure 31 shows the
        swelling of Loire coal as a function of the time of heating, for
        various constant temperatures. This is a most interesting
        diagram. It discloses that at such low temperatures as 390° C
        there is no swelling of the charge at all, but an actual
        shrinkage amounting to about 11%. At 400° C there is an initial
        contraction during fusion, amounting to as much as 20%, at the
        end of 35 minutes heating, after which the coal expands and
        finally, after 75 minutes heating, reaches a steady volume about
        6% greater than its initial condition. As the temperature
        advances, the initial contraction, which always takes place at
        fusion, reaches a maximum at some temperature which is
        characteristic of the given coal. In the case of Loire coal, the
        initial contraction amounts to only about 6% at the end of
        approximately 10 minutes, after which the coal swells rapidly to
        an increase of 75% over its initial volume in 25 minutes,
        thereafter continuing to swell at a very slow rate. In this
        particular coal the swelling amounted to 95% at the end of 150
        minutes. </p>
      <p>Figure 32 shows for Bethume coal the variations of swelling as
        a function of temperature for several different rates of
        heating. It is interesting to note how rapidly the swelling
        increases with the rate of heating when the same final
        temperatures are attained. This family of curves has a common
        characteristic, in that there is an initial period of
        contraction during fusion amounting to as much as 20% of the
        original volume at 400° C to 425° C, following which there is a
        rapid expansion at 425° C to 450° C which ceases rather abruptly
        and leaves the charge at constant volume. The final swelling of
        Bethume coal amounts to about 47% at 440° C, when heated at 0.5°
        C per minute; 95% at 440° C, when heated at 1° C per minute;
        150% at 475° C when heated at 2° C per minute; and about 225% at
        475° C when heated at the rate of 3° C per minute. Audibert and
        Delmas (193) concluded that for each coal there existed a rate
        of heating below which intumescence is not observed, whatever
        the final temperature reached may be. However, the rate of
        heating may be so low as to render it impractical in practice to
        sue this means of avoiding excessive swelling. Swelling is
        observed only at rates of heating in which fusion of the coal
        particles is complete, i.e., when the coal becomes fused into a
        homogenous mass, and intumescence never occurs when the rate of
        heating is so low that the charge retains the heterogenous
        structure of coal particles in juxtaposition. </p>
      <p>Figure 33 shows the loss of weight of the charge, due to the
        evolution of volatile matter at various temperatures for a
        Durham coal, together with the intumescence at the same
        temperature. It is quite apparent that swelling, at the same
        rate of heating, always occurs at a higher temperature than that
        of initial softening and initial evolution of volatile matter.
        The presence of microscopic cavities in the charge after heating
        led Audibert and Delmas (193) to conclude that swelling was only
        an apparent change and one which arose, not through changes in
        the condition of the solid material, but through the
        imprisonment of bubbles of volatile matter trapped within the
        plastic mass during thermal decomposition. </p>

      <p>Some coals, which in their neutral state will not coke, can be
        made to do so by special thermal treatment to remove some of
        their volatile matter, according to Charpy and Godchot (194).
        That is, by subjecting the coal to preliminary distillation at
        450° C and by subsequent carbonization at 700° C, it can be made
        to coke. These experiments were made on Durham coal, which would
        not coke in its natural state under ordinary conditions. From
        Table 80, it is seen that a good coke was obtained after 2 hours
        of preliminary carbonization at 450° C when the volatile matter
        of the coke had been reduced to 18%. Primary distillation, as a
        means of inducing coking, has also been studied by Illingworth
        (195), whose results confirm what has already been said. </p>

      <p>Audibert and Delmas (193) investigated the effect of preheating
        and partial oxidation on intumescence in coal during
        carbonization. Figure 34 shows the swelling of Varennes coal as
        a function of the temperature for various periods of preheating
        in vacuo at 350° C, and when finally heated to the required
        temperature at the rate of 1° C per minute. This temperature of
        preheating is within 15° C of the softening temperature of this
        coal at the particular rate of heating used. In every case, no
        matter how long the preheating, the initial contraction of the
        charge during fusion apparently remains. Varennes coal, when
        untreated, swelled about 65% at 465° C, but when heated for 4
        hours in vacuo the swelling property was entirely destroyed and
        the residuum at 525° C had practically the same volume as the
        original coal. When preheating was prolonged to 4.5 hours, there
        was a resultant contraction of about 22% at the final
        temperature. The influence of preheating is attributed to the
        fact that, even at temperatures below the fusion point,
        carbonization reactions must have an appreciable velocity and
        that such chemical changes as occur within the coal, upon
        preheating under the above conditions, are not usually
        accompanied by loss in weight to any extent. </p>
      <p>Destruction of a portion of the excess resin by oxidation is
        another means which may be employed to effect coking in certain
        coals. Bone (195) showed that the resins could be completely
        destroyed by prolonged oxygenation, even at as low a temperature
        as 108° C. Roberts (196) found that by heating a non-coking coal
        for a very long time at this temperature it could be made to
        coke. Here it is not clear whether the effect is one of
        oxidation or evolution of the undesirable constituents. At any
        rate, this method does not promise great commercial favor
        because of the length of time required in the operation, unless
        carried out at higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>Figure 35 shows the swelling, according to Audibert and Delmas
        (193) in Varennes coal as a function of the temperature for
        various periods of oxidation. The oxidation was carried out at
        120° C in air and subsequently heated to the required
        temperature at the rate of 1 C per minute. Preoxidation, even
        for short periods, exerts a considerable effect. The swelling at
        500° C is reduced from about 65% in the unoxidized coal to 50%
        after 10 minutes oxidation, and to about 10% after 40 minutes
        oxidation. Oxidation for 4 hours causes a contraction to the
        extent of about 38%, while 5 hours oxidation entirely destroys
        the fusing property of the coal. The influence of oxidation on
        the intumescence of coal is attributed to the fact that oxygen
        fixation transforms some of the coal constituents into more
        refractory substances. </p>

      <p>Parr (87) separated the lignitic and bituminic portions of the
        coal by extracting the latter with xylene and then heated both
        the fresh and oxidized materials at various temperatures to
        determine the volume and character of the gas yield. In Figure
        36 is shown the volume of carbon dioxide evolved from both the
        fresh and the oxidized lignitic residuum when heated at various
        temperatures up to 350° C. the same data for the bituminic
        extract are given in Figure 37. Table 81 gives the composition
        for all four gases collected up to 300° C. A study of this
        table, in connection with the two preceding diagrams, shows the
        striking difference between the behavior of the fresh and the
        oxidized lignitic material, as compared with the fresh and
        oxidized bituminic material, when all are heated to the same
        temperature. Up to 350° C, little carbon dioxide is ordinarily
        evolved from the fresh lignitic residuum, but this amount is
        increased over 6-fold when the material has been oxidized. On
        the other hand, oxidation has very little effect on the quantity
        of carbon dioxide evolved from the bituminic extract up to 350°
        C. The gas analyses show a reduction in hydrogen content after
        oxidation of the material in both cases, but a much greater
        reduction in the case of the lignitic residuum than in the
        sample of a bituminic extract. The same observation applies also
        to methane. It is quite evident from these experiments that the
        reduction of coking power by oxidation can be attributed
        primarily to changes in the constitution of the lignitic
        material of the coal. </p>

      <p><a name="react"></a><b>Coke Reactivity ~</b> </p>
      <p>A number of different experimenters have sought to devise a
        means for measuring the reactivity of coke, thus Koppers (197,
        198) sought to measure its reactivity by the rate at which a
        particular coke reduced carbon dioxide to the monoxide; Bunte
        (199, 200) assumed coke reactivity to be proportional to the
        temperature at which it begins to react with oxygen; Fischer,
        Breuer, and Broche (201) considered the reactivity to be
        inversely proportional to the temperature at which the coke
        begins to reduce dioxide to the monoxide of carbon; while Bahr
        (202) determined the reactivity of coke by measuring both the
        kindling point of the coke and temperature of reduction in an
        atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Bahr (202) observed that the
        kindling temperature of carbonaceous materials ranged from 230°
        C, with low temperature coke, to 140° C with electrode carbon;
        that the reaction temperature varied from 480° C with charcoal
        to 820° C with graphite; and that the reactivity ranged from 99%
        for charcoal to 4.4% with graphite. The addition of 3% iron
        oxide was found to increase the reactivity of 950° C coke from
        17.5% to 58.4%, at the same time affecting neither the kindling
        temperature nor the reaction temperature to any extent. </p>
      <p>Davis and Greene (203) investigated the reactivity of
        pulverized cokes in air, carbon dioxide, and water vapor at 950°
        C. Table 82 gives analyses of the cokes which were tested,
        together with the experimental determinations. The low
        temperature coke was made by heating coal for 30 minutes at 750°
        C with superheated steam. The beehive coke was dense and hard in
        structure, whereas the low temperature coke was soft and porous.
        Before submitting the coke samples to test, the specimens were
        crushed and sized to pass a 10 mesh and to remain on a 20 mesh
        sieve. In Table 82 the coke reactivity in air is expressed as
        the percentage of the theoretical maximum amount of carbon
        gasified, the reactivity in carbon dioxide is reported as the
        percentage of carbon dioxide reduced to the monoxide, and the
        reactivity in steam is given as the sum of the percentages of
        hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The kindling temperature was taken
        as that at which carbon dioxide was first formed. The results
        indicate that the kindling temperature of low temperature coke
        is less than half of that of the other cokes, that the
        reactivity of low temperature coke is 11% to 14% greater than
        the other cokes in an atmosphere of air, nearly 950% greater in
        carbon dioxide, and finally 110% to 190% greater in water vapor.

      <p><a name="combust"></a><b>Coke Combustibility ~</b> </p>
      <p>Coke may burn either from the external surface or externally
        and partially internally, depending on its structure. Semi-coke,
        obtained from horizontal retorts at 600° C, burns on the surface
        and for some distance into the interior and makes a very
        attractive fire. On the other hand, low temperature coke made by
        fusion, briquetting, and secondary carbonization burns mainly at
        the surface and deposits thereon a fine ash which must be
        brushed away frequently to maintain a nice looking fire. These
        are factors to be considered when semi-coke is used as a
        domestic fuel. </p>
      <p>Kreisinger, Ovitz, and Augustine (204) investigated the
        combustibility of various fuels in hand-fired furnaces when
        burned at approximately 25 lb/sq ft/hr, by determining the mean
        percentages of carbon monoxide and of free oxygen for various
        distances above the grate. Some of their results are shown in
        Figure 38, from which it is apparent that metallurgical coke is
        the least combustible and lignite char the most combustible of
        the fuels studied. Low temperature coke strongly resembles
        lignite char, from which we may conclude that its combustibility
        in furnaces will greatly exceed that of bituminous coal and in
        no way resemble the behavior of ordinary cokes. </p>
      <p>Thau (205) has pointed out the common error of assuming that
        combustibility increases with porosity, having in mind
        principally those pores which are visible to the naked eye and
        not those of microscopic character, which have been shown
        elsewhere to contribute greatly to combustion. Combustibility
        depends on two characteristics of the coke, structure and
        volatile matter. While in ordinary coking practice it is true,
        within limits, that the denser coke is the more combustible, at
        the same time, when judging the reactivity of a coke on this
        property, its purity must also be considered. The ash content of
        the coke plays a much greater part in reducing combustibility
        than is ordinarily believed. It is quite impossible to judge a
        coke by its structural density without a knowledge of its
        chemical composition. It is common experience that often a
        spongy coke is less combustible despite its apparent porosity,
        than a more consolidated sample; the reason for this peculiar
        situation being that combustion is a surface phenomenon and it
        is the reactivity of the multitude of microscopic cells that is
        of importance rather than the large pores. </p>
      <p>Thau (205) also points out that the general belief that silvery
        appearance of coke, caused by a graphitic deposit, is wholly a
        desirable condition is erroneous. While the graphitic deposit
        adds greater strength to the coke, when used for some purposes
        where it has to sustain a great burden, at the same time the
        vitreous carbon coating is less reactive in two ways, first by
        its own inactivity, and second because it plugs the highly
        reactive surface cells. Thau (205) is quite convinced that the
        combustibility of low temperature coke is wholly due to its cell
        structure, which is maintained by the presence of a small amount
        of volatile, which volatile is driven off as combustion proceeds
        to leave additional minute cells which are free from vitreous
        carbon and are highly reactive. The volatile matter present in
        low temperature coke serves principally to reduce the coke's
        ignition temperature. </p>
      <p>On account of its high combustibility, should it be possible to
        strengthen low temperature coke in some manner, so that it could
        withstand the burden in metallurgical operations, it would be of
        great industrial importance. A number of attempts have been made
        to do this, with more or less indifferent success, by applying
        pressure to the charge during or after carbonization. </p>

      <p><a name="strenght"></a><b>Coke Strength ~</b> </p>
      <p>The strength required of a coke varies greatly with the purpose
        for which it is produced. For use in blast furnaces and cupolas,
        where the weight of the burden which it must sustain is
        tremendous, a high crushing strength is necessary. The strength
        of a coke depends upon its structure and a strong structure
        usually requires high temperatures with the resultant deposition
        of graphitic carbon. Thus, despite the greater reactivity of low
        temperature coke, the superior strength of the high temperature
        product gives the latter favor in metallurgical processes. </p>
      <p>A variety of different schemes have been tried to increase the
        strength of semi-coke, all of which are variations or
        combinations of three methods, application of pressure, blending
        of the charge, and temperature regulation. In the use of
        pressure to this end, recourse has been made to its application
        during carbonization by mechanical means or by the weight of the
        supernatant charge, and to briquetting before, after, or between
        stages of carbonization. Some little success has been attained
        by blending different coals to reduce foaming in the fusing
        stage, but a more fruitful effort has been made in blending a
        certain amount of coke breeze with the raw coal, Record has been
        made of a case where the crushing load on a piece of coke, less
        than one square inch in cross-section, was increased from 250 lb
        when 20% coke breeze was mixed, to 425 lb when 35% coke breeze
        was blended. The addition of breeze, however, is open to the
        objection that it reduces the daily throughput of raw coal. </p>
      <p>Audibert and Delmas (193) determined the influence of rate of
        heating on the crushing strength of coke produced from a number
        of different coals, the data regarding two of them being
        reproduced in Figure 39. These cokes were made at 900° C.
        Experiments by Audibert and Delmas (103) indicated that all
        coals examined by them attained a maximum strength at a given
        rate of heating, rising rapidly to this maximum as the rate of
        heating increases and declining slowly from the maximum as the
        rate of heating is further increased. </p>

      <p><a name="temper"></a><b>Temperature Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>Davis and Parry (97) found that the introduction of steam
        during carbonization at 550° C has no appreciable influence on
        the coke yield. They obtained 70.7% of the coal as coke when it
        was dry distilled and 70.8% when large quantities of steam were
        admitted. Variation of temperature, however, under steam
        distillation does have considerable influence on the amount of
        coke obtained. Figure 40 shows the coke yield obtained from
        steam carbonization at various temperatures, together with the
        proximate analyses of the cokes produced from Pennsylvania coal
        of the Freeport bed. The ultimate analyses and calorific value
        of this low temperature coke, carbonized at three different
        temperatures, are given in Table 83. The yield of coke gradually
        decreases with rise of temperature for two reasons. In the first
        place, a greater percentage of the volatile constituents is
        removed, which reduces the weight of the yield. This is
        confirmed by the decrease in the proportion of volatile matter
        remaining in the coke. In the second place, it has been pointed
        out that steam reacts with the coal to form the dioxide of
        carbon at approximately 550° C. Consequently, the yield of coke
        would be decreased by the percentage of carbon dioxide
        generated. That this is a factor in reducing the amount of coke
        obtained is verified by the fact that the percentage fixed
        carbon in the coke attains a maximum at about 550° C, after
        which it decreases on account of gasification. </p>
      <p>From Table 83, temperature is seen to have no great effect on
        the ultimate analysis of the coke, other than its influence on
        the percentage of carbon. The reduction in oxygen and hydrogen
        content is due to removal of the phenolic derivatives and
        volatile hydrocarbons. The coke produced under steam
        distillation at 475° C was black and spongy. Considerable
        swelling had occurred and the residuum was filled with
        blowholes. The carbonized product from distillation at 550° C
        was of much denser structure. The layer next to the retort wall
        was rather porous, but of a grayish color, indicating more
        complete carbonization. The action of the steam was evidently
        responsible for the external porosity. The coke obtained at 650°
        C was practically the same as that produced at 550° C, except
        that it was slightly lighter in color. </p>

        Bureau of Mines (101) indicate that it is adapted to the usual
        screening and sizing processes for preparation as a domestic
        fuel. The coke produced, however, varies very greatly with the
        raw coal used, but there is no doubt that a few of the low
        temperature carbonization residuums are suitable for
        metallurgical purposes. The high percentage of volatile
        hydrocarbons remaining in the low temperature coke supplies a
        free-burning constituent, which is readily ignited and which
        will maintain fire without special attention. In this respect,
        the semi-coke is superior to anthracite. The percentage of
        smoke-producing elements, consisting of tar and heavy
        hydrocarbons, which can be removed from American coals at
        various temperatures of carbonization, as determined by Porter
        and Ovitz (96), is given in Table 84. It has been pointed out
        that one of the purposes of low temperature processes was to
        produce a smokeless fuel, and how nearly this purpose has been
        attained is made evident by the table. The semi-coke obtained as
        a carbonization residuum is an ideal smokeless fuel. </p>

      <p>Parr and Olin (31) conducted some experiments on semi-coke
        gasification using a small Otto gas producer equipped with a wet
        scrubber, the results of which are given in Table 85. This
        producer was designed to operate on pea size anthracite coal.
        Using anthracite, the normal capacity was 4500 cubic feet of gas
        per hour. The semi-coke which they used as a fuel was obtained
        from carbonizing of Illinois coal at 550° C. It was light and
        porous and showed no tendency to pack on the fuel bed. Analysis
        showed it to contain 18% volatile matter and 71% fixed carbon.
        The residuary gases evolved from the secondary carbonization of
        this primary coke were remarkably free from heavy condensation
        products. This suggested that producer gas made by the
        gasification of semi-coke would be sufficiently free from tar to
        render it suitable as a fuel for internal combustion engines.
        For comparative purposes, data obtained from the operation of
        the same producer, using a Pennsylvania anthracite, as
        determined by Garland and Kratz (206) are also given in Table
        85. </p>

      <p>The great increase in efficiency attending the use of low
        temperature coke as a gas producer fuel is the notable feature
        of Table 85. The higher terminal value of the gas from semi-coke
        is shown by the analysis to be the result of a low percentage of
        diluents, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen, in the
        gas. Little tar was produced during the operation of the
        producer with semi-coke as a fuel. As a whole, the tests were
        entirely successful and little attention was required during the
        runs. The lightness of the low temperature coke and its slight
        tendency to arch made it necessary to poke the charge about once
        an hour and, in this respect, it required somewhat more
        attention than anthracite. However, this semi-coke contained
        more volatile matter than the usual product, which fully
        accounts for such minor difficulties as were experienced. There
        was remarkable freedom from ash and clinker trouble. </p>
      <p>Lander and McKay (186) reported some tests conducted at the
        Fuel Research Station in a small gas producer to determine the
        suitability of low temperature coke for complete gasification,
        as compared with high temperature coke from vertical retorts.
        Since the tar has, for the most part, been removed from the
        semi-coke, it is reasonable to anticipate the success of using
        this fuel as a charge for gas producers. The low temperature
        coke gave 23% higher consumption of carbon than the high
        temperature product and yielded under the same conditions twice
        the percentage of carbon monoxide and less dioxide than the high
        temperature gas coke. The high velocity of consumption is
        indicative of high reaction velocity, which accounts for the
        increase of 25% in temperature of the producer hot zone. </p>
      <p><a name="domest"></a><b>Domestic Fuel ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the greatest potential markets for low temperature coke
        is that of a household fuel. Semi-coke is ideal for this purpose
        since it is clean, ignites easily, and burns readily with little
        attention. Fireplaces and other domestic heating appliances emit
        a large portion of their heat by radiation. Fishenden (207) has
        investigated the radiation efficiency of low temperature coke,
        as compared with coal ordinarily used. Three tests were made on
        various types of open grates. In the first test, a radiation
        efficiency of 19.7% was obtained for low temperature coke, as
        compared with 17.3% for bituminous coal; the second test showed
        the semi-coke to have a radiation efficiency of 24% and the
        bituminous coal 19.5%. The third test gave corresponding figures
        of 30.8% and 24.2%. This shows that in open grates the radiation
        efficiency of low temperature coke is 20% to 25% greater than
        that of bituminous coal. </p>
      <p>In kitchen boilers, Fishenden (207) also found low temperature
        coke to be more effective than bituminous coal. Three different
        tested were conducted likewise. In the first test, the radiation
        efficiency of semi-coke was 17.3%, as compared with 13.1% for
        bituminous coal; the corresponding figures for the second test
        were 20.7% and 14.5%; while in the third trial the low
        temperature coke gave 41% radiation efficiency and the
        bituminous coal 31%. In ordinary kitchen ovens, however, the
        coke does not show any increase in efficiency over coal, but
        probably in an oven designed to take better advantage of the
        increased radiation this could be improved. The advantage of low
        temperature coke over coal, aside from its smokeless quality,
        lies in its superior radiation, which is most apparent when the
        distance from fuel bed to boiler or oven is small. When they are
        far apart, the advantage of the coke diminishes and the longer
        luminous flame of coal gives better results. </p>

      <p>An ideal fuel for pulverization should contain about 10%
        volatile matte and be easy to grind. One of the principal
        difficulties in installations utilizing powdered fuel is the
        wear on the pulverization mills. Coke residuum from the low
        temperature process is comparatively easy to crush and prepare
        for the furnace. For these reasons, low temperature coke is
        peculiarly suitable for pulverized fuel. Gentry (208) has
        stressed the importance of semi-coke as a pulverized fuel for
        central electric stations and pointed out that the fuel can be
        prepared by grinding before or after carbonization or between
        operations of a multi-stage process. A number of methods have
        been devised, notably by McEwen and Runge, in which the coal is
        carbonized in finely divided particles, thus entirely
        eliminating or reducing the pulverization ordinarily required
        after distillation. </p>
      <p>It is well to consider the specific case of a bituminous coal
        which contains 32.2% volatile matter, 57.8% fixed carbon, 2.8%
        moisture, and 7.2% ash, with a heating value of 13,800 BTU/lb.
        Such a coal ordinarily contains about 5.4% hydrogen, which
        causes a loss on combustion of 628 BTU/lb. Before pulverization,
        it is considered expedient to dry the coal to a moisture content
        of about 1.7% water in order to reduce the power required for
        grinding. The 1.7% moisture in the fuel after drying causes a
        further loss of 22 BTU/lb on burning. These losses reduce the
        heat available in the boiler furnace to 13,150 BTU/lb. A modern
        large pulverized fuel boiler has an overall efficiency of about
        88%, calculated on the gross heating value of the coal, or
        92.4%, figured on the net heating value as delivered to the
        furnace. A year's operating experience on the Columbia Power
        Station (209) showed that on the average 0.94% of the coal was
        required to dry the fuel, with 3.9% average initial moisture, to
        an average of 1.7% moisture before grinding. Proportioned for a
        coal with 2.8% initial moisture, 65 BTU/lb must be deducted for
        drying. At the same power plant 162 kwh/ton were required to
        operate the mills which, since the plant operated on 12,495
        BTU/kwh, amounts to 102 BTU/lb required for pulverization. These
        additional deductions for preparation of the fuel give a new
        figure of 12.007 BTU/lb, or 87% of the calorific value of the
        raw fuel, usefully absorbed by the boiler. </p>
      <p>An average externally heated low temperature coke made from the
        bituminous coal considered above will have a thermal value of
        13,400 BTU/lb. Such a semi-coke will contain no moisture, as
        discharged from the retorts, but may absorb as much as 1% upon
        standing, thereby causing a combustion loss of 13 BTU/lb. The
        residual hydrogen in the low temperature coke amounts to about
        2%, which represents a combustion loss of 233 BTU/lb. Deduction
        of the hydrogen and moisture losses gives 12,168 BTU/lb,
        available in the furnace when the same boiler efficiency as used
        for the raw coal is applied. Semi-coke needs no drying before
        pulverization, so that no deduction need be made for that item,
        while the heat required for carbonizing the coal will be charged
        to the cost of processing for by-products. The consensus of
        opinion of those who have had experience in grinding semi-coke
        is that it will require 20% less power for pulverization than
        the raw coal. On this basis a deduction of 81 BTU/lb must be
        made for grinding, giving finally 12,087 BTU/lb usefully
        absorbed in the boiler. This amounts to 87.6% of the heat in the
        semi-coke usefully absorbed, as compared with 87% for the coal
        from which the semi-coke was made. Similar calculations made for
        a semi-coke obtained from an average partial gasification low
        temperature process, with 13,200 BTU/lb calorific value and 1.5%
        hydrogen, show about the same results. It may be concluded,
        therefore, that low temperature coke, pound for pound, has a
        furnace efficiency in the pulverized form slightly exceeding
        that of the raw coal from which it was made. </p>
      <p>Moreover, there are further economies that may be expected from
        the use of pulverized low temperature coke as a boiler fuel,
        which may be of importance exceeding that of importance
        exceeding that of its increased furnace efficiency. In the first
        place, semi-coke can be stored indefinitely in the powdered form
        without danger of spontaneous combustion, so that mill house
        operating costs can be reduced somewhat by allowing the mills to
        run at a much better load factor. Furthermore, the friability
        and softness of semi-coke will require less mill maintenance
        than raw coal. Here record must be made of the fact, commonly
        misunderstood, that low temperature coke is in no way comparable
        to high temperature coke, which is known to be brittle and
        excessively abrasive. The firing of pulverized coal in boilers
        requires an excessively large furnace volume to secure complete
        combustion, because of the long flame. The length of a
        pulverized coal flame depends solely depends upon rate of
        combustion, which in turn depends on three things, temperature
        of the furnace, turbulence to bring fresh air for oxidation, and
        combustibility of the fuel. The high combustibility of low
        temperature coke has already been pointed out, so that it is
        quite apparent that, for given furnace temperatures and given
        conditions of mixing, the rate of combustion of semi-coke is
        greater than raw coal and its pulverized fuel flame
        correspondingly shorter. In fact, certain experiments have shown
        that the flame of pulverized semi-coke was so short that it was
        necessary to ix a certain proportion of raw coal to lengthen the
        flame in boilers designed with large furnace volume. These
        results demonstrate that by using pulverized semi-coke in place
        of the raw coal, considerably smaller furnaces can be used for
        boilers of the same capacity, or vice versa, for a given furnace
        volume, increased combustion rates will permit the boilers to be
        designed for greater capacity. Either increased capacity for a
        given furnace size or reduction in furnace size for a given
        boiler capacity will effect material savings in capital
        expenditure, which will ultimately be reflected in the cost of
        power. A further discussion of this subject will be given in
        Chapter VIII under the subject of by-product recovery in central
        stations. </p>
      <p>The safety with which powdered semi-coke can be stored without
        fear of explosion is of importance in marine power plants. The
        limited space on shipboard and on locomotives also makes the
        short flame of low temperature pulverized coke and its
        associated small furnace volume of considerable importance to
        the transportation industry. </p>
      <p>Low temperature coke briquets, made by the Carbocoal process,
        have been tested as a fuel in both locomotives and marine
        installations. It was demonstrated that the fuel was smokeless
        and that it evaporated from 8.5 to 12.8 pounds of water per
        pound of fuel per hour, from and at 212° F, when fired at rates
        ranging from 100 pounds to 27 pounds of fuel per hour per square
        foot of grate surface, respectively. A maximum rate of 166
        pounds of low temperature briquets per square foot of grate
        surface per hour was fired for short periods with no greater
        draft than was required by ordinary bituminous coal. </p>
