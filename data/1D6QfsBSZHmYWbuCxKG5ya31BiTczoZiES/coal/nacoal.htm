        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><i>BEIJING,
            April 27 </i>-- After five years of efforts to promote an
          energy-saving invention in East China's Anhui Province, Na
          Xuefang seems close to realizing his dream. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">He has found a
          big client in neighbouring Jiangsu Province for his powder, an
          additive to coal that helps it burn more efficiently. Na needs
          his product to be a success because by the end of last year,
          all the money he put into the project was spent. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Na had to give
          up his office in Hefei, Anhui's capital, and move into a small
          room in a suburb for a rent of 100 yuan (US$12.5) per month,
          where he continued to promote his invention. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"I hope the
          newly-released long-term scientific plan, which prioritizes
          energy-saving technology, will serve as a turning point for my
          invention," Na said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">A nationwide
          call to turn China into a resource-saving country has sparked
          the zeal to make energy-saving technological advances. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">But some
          environmental experts say that innovations alone are not
          enough and that the government needs to set the proper
          foundation to take advantage of them through establishing the
          right laws and policies. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">In the National
          Guideline on the Medium- and Long-Term Programme for Science
          and Technology Development (2006-20), issued by the State
          Council in February, developing energy-saving technology is a
          high priority. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">In his report to
          the National People's Congress last month, Premier Wen Jiabao
          called on the nation to cut energy use per unit of gross
          domestic product (GDP) by 20 per cent by 2010 from the 2005
          level. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">China's high
          consumption of energy has raised widespread concern. According
          to a national guideline released in 2004 by the National
          Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's energy
          consumption was 3.1 times the world's average per unit of GDP
          in 2002. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">To reach the
          energy-saving goal, policies are being drafted, including
          establishing an index to evaluate how local governments have
          cut energy consumption in relation to GDP growth. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">The policy to
          encourage energy saving promotes researchers seeking new
          approaches. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><i>Ceaseless
            efforts</i> </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Na was one of
          them. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Since 1991, Na,
          who was trained in chemistry, has been engaged in developing a
          way to make coal burn more efficiently. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"I often saw
          after burning that much unburnt coal was left. This was a
          great waste," Na said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"In coal mining
          areas of Henan Province, people pour salt onto high-sulphur
          coal to make it burn more fully. That caused me to think about
          finding other chemical additives." </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">In nine years of
          experiments, Na found that some chemicals would lower the
          temperature for coal to start burning, and that others produce
          oxygen in the stove. The two chemicals, when combined,
          resulted in more efficient burning. He also mixed some
          chemicals into his additive to dissolve sulphur dioxide, a
          major pollutant from high-sulphur coal. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">In the late
          1990s, Na eventually succeeded in making the additive.
          According to Tang Hanyong, deputy director of the
          government-backed Anhui Technological Promotion Centre, Na's
          powder can make coal burn up to 20 per cent more efficiently
          and reduce the emission of sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide
          and carbon monoxide. It obtained an invention patent from the
          State Intellectual Property Office in 2000. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"Considering the
          price of the additive, coal users will still save at least 12
          per cent on their coal costs," Na said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">However, he used
          up much of his money and could not get his invention into
          production. "Many investors are interested in my project, but
          all of them set conditions unacceptable to me," Na said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Returning to his
          hometown, Wuwei County in Anhui, in late 2000, Na hoped his
          product could win the favour of power stations and other major
          coal users in his hometown. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">But not one
          company in Anhui has committed to use Na's powder so far. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"Once Na had
          earned some money, he spent it to have samples of his powder
          made and then took it to electricity generation factories or
          major coal users for a demonstration," Tang said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"Each time the
          expected effect was achieved, but still no one would use it."
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Na said the next
          step should be taken by the government. "Although State policy
          has stressed energy-saving, no punitive taxes have been waived
          to encourage people to truly reduce energy use," he said. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"For private
          entrepreneurs, it makes sense even if the powder can reduce
          just 5 per cent of their costs." ... </p>
