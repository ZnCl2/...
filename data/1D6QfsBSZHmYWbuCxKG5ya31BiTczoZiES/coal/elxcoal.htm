        Ultrasonic activation of several coal cleaning processes in all

        to processing efficiencies and/or capital equipment savings.
        Specifically, in the chlorinolysis process, pyritic S was
        removed 23 times faster w/ ultrasonics than w/o it. In NaOCl
        leaching, the total S extraction rate was 3 times faster w/

        Review of methods used in 8 Euro countries &amp; USA: chamber,

        Electrocarbonization (EC) involves drilling boreholes,
        installing steel pipe, pre-heating, electro-linking (~ 30 min),
        EC (3-4 hrs), electro-gasification (w/ air/steam injection)
        yields producer gas, 120-300 BTU. Electro-carbonization takes
        place in a dumb-bell-shaped elliptical zone, the long axis being
        fixed by the electrodes. Fire channel fractures form, and
        considerable fusion occurs. </p>

        to another. Oil &amp; gas are produced by low-wattage electrical
        heating of shale and tar sand; the path of carbonization is used
