      <p><a name="educ"></a><b>Eduction of Primary Tar ~</b> </p>
      <p>Designation of the condensable products from low temperature
        carbonization,
        taken collectively, as a tar is most unfortunate, for they more
        nearly
        resemble oils or petroleums than they do tars. Since it has
        become well
        established by prior usage, the name tar will be retained in
        this
        volume
        and the term primary tar will be used synonymously with low
        temperature
        oil. This confusion in terminology has caused a great deal of
        misunderstanding
        and many persons have thereby been led to evaluate low
        temperature
        crude
        oil in terms of high temperature coal tar, to which it bears
        very
        little
        relation. </p>
      <p>Like any industry in the early stages of its development, the
        products
        of low temperature carbonization have had no established market
        in the
        past. This applies in particular to the primary oil. The chief
        assured
        industrial uses of low temperature tar, at present, is as a
        crude stock
        for the preparation of creosote oil and as a liquid fuel. While
        the
        valuable
        by-products, which may be obtained by fractionation of the tar
        will
        doubtlessly
        find industrial favor eventually, no such outlets can at this
        time
        (1928)
        be guaranteed. There are but few plants operating on a large
        scale, and
        consequently no standard method of industrial analysis has been
        developed,
        despite the quality and quantity of work that has been done in
        the
        study
        of low temperature tar by numerous investigators. For the most
        part,
        these
        workers were interested more from the chemical than from the
        engineering
        standpoint, and therefore planned their investigations more from
        the
        standpoint
        of science than of technology. </p>
      <p>The attitude of the tar distillers, in regard to low
        temperature
        tar
        at the present time (1928), appears to be that its refinement
        will
        require
        extensive alterations in their plants, due to the manner in
        which
        primary
        tar differs from the high temperature tar, which they are
        accustomed to
        handle. The absence of regularly operating large scale low
        temperature
        carbonization plants of sufficient capacity to assure them of
        dependable
        quantities of raw material has thus far rendered the necessary
        changes
        impractical. This situation is rapidly being remedied and will
        be
        overcome
        in proportion as sources of raw material increase and as markets
        for
        the
        refined products develop. </p>
      <p>According to Parrish (117), whatever coal may be used in the
        same
        high
        temperature coke oven, the resultant tars resemble each other to
        a
        great
        extent. Primary tar, on the other hand, is much more closely
        allied to
        the coal from which it originated and variations in the
        composition and
        quantity of the tar yielded follow more closely variations in
        the
        character
        of the coal from which it was produced. It will be observed
        later that,
        in general, the younger the coal and the greater its oxygen
        content,
        the
        greater is the quantity of low temperature tar yielded per unit
        of
        weight. </p>
      <p>The influence of the conditions of carbonization can almost
        wholly
        be
        attributed to the action of heat upon the tar vapors. The effect
        of
        these
        conditions on the low temperature tar has already been alluded
        to in
        the
        definition of low temperature carbonization. Aside from the
        bearing
        which
        the chemical nature of the coal and the conditions of retorting
        have
        upon
        the character of the tar, there remain certain influences,
        resulting
        from
        the physical properties of the coal. If the coal is a readily
        fusing
        one,
        the formation of a plastic layer may so retard the passage of
        the
        primary
        tar vapor from the carbonization chamber as to cause it to
        remain for a
        comparatively long time in contact with hot surfaces. The effect
        of hot
        surfaces in catalyzing secondary decomposition has already been
        demonstrated. </p>
      <p>Low temperature tars differ materially from high temperature
        tars.
        The
        former are brownish black, fluid at ordinary temperatures, and
        more
        viscous
        than crude Pennsylvania petroleum. In general, the low
        temperature tars
        consist of hydrocarbons of the alipathic series, a few
        aromatics, and a
        high proportion of the tar acids. This tar is not greatly
        different
        from
        shale oil and crude petroleum, and for that reason some of the
        methods
        used in the petroleum industry may be applied to the evaluation
        of low
        temperature tar. </p>
      <p>Table 44 gives a representative comparison of the fractions
        obtained
        from high and low temperature tars. The high temperature tar
        yields are
        the average of 6 coke oven tars of the United States, while the
        low
        temperature
        yields are the average of 8 British experiments at 600° C. In
        the
        high
        temperature product, only about 25% of the tar is volatile up to
        315°
        C, while low temperature tar yields nearly 55% of its weight in
        oils.
        High
        temperature pitch is almost three-quarters of the entire yield
        of tar
        and
        contains a high percentage of free carbon, whereas the primary
        tar is
        characterized
        by less than 50% pitch of a low free carbon content. The
        decrease in
        the
        yield of oils at high temperatures is complementary to the high
        gas
        yield.
        It has been demonstrated that, in this case, the primary
        volatile
        products
        are cracked and decomposed at higher temperatures, with the
        formation
        of
        gas and the deposition of carbon. </p>

      <p>Experiments conducted in England, in especially constructed
        cast-iron
        retorts, on 5 high class Barnsley coals whose proximate analyses
        were
        almost
        identical with that of Pennsylvania bituminous coal, showed that
        in low
        temperature carbonization the average yield of tar was 23.5
        gallons per
        net ton of coal. The average of 6 Pennsylvania coals distilled
        at
        550°
        C by Davis and Parry (97) gave 27.8 gallons of dehydrated tar,
        with a
        specific
        gravity of 1.039, per net ton of coal carbonized. This is
        equivalent to
        12.2% of the coal by weight. The Fuel Research Board, in
        large-scale
        horizontal
        retorts, obtained a tar yield of from 17.9 gallons to 19.6
        gallons per
        net ton. They recommend, as a result of their extensive
        investigations,
        that 19 gallons of tar per net ton is the average yield to be
        counted
        upon
        in low temperature distillation. The present author, however,
        believes
        this figure to be unduly low for other processes and for high
        volatile
        American coals. The fuel value of this primary tar is very high,
        the
        average
        of 8 British experiments giving 16,630 BTU/lb. </p>
      <p>Porter and Ovitz (96) in their investigation on the volatile
        matter
        of coals of the United States, obtained from 12.4 gallons to
        21.2
        gallons
        of tar per net ton of coal in small-scale experiments, depending
        to a
        great
        extent on the geologic age of the coal examined. The experiments
        were
        conducted
        over a period of one hour in a furnace adjusted so that the
        interior of
        the charge remained at 800° C. Monett (100) observed, from a
        study
        of 11 Utah coals, that the tar yield ranged from 16.1 gallons to
        29.4
        gallons
        per net ton. It is interesting to note in Table 45 the general
        decrease
        in yield of tar accompanying the consolidation of the fuel. </p>
      <p>The results of Table 45 have been observed also by Berry (118),
        who
        found a distinct relation between the amount of tar distilled
        and the
        geologic
        formation of the coal, or more specifically of the
        carbon-hydrogen
        ration
        of the fuel. The curve in Figure 18 is due to him. According to
        this
        curve,
        the maximum amount of thick tar is to be expected from fuels
        having a
        carbon-hydrogen
        ration ranging from 13.5 to 18.0. </p>
      <p>Berry (118) investigated the tar-forming temperatures of
        American
        coals
        and found that the first trace of tar appeared, in all the coals
        examined
        by him, at about 300° C and the last traces disappeared at about
        550°
        C, although in a few instances tar formation did not cease until
        over
        600°
        C was reached. Tar was formed in quantities in the temperature
        range
        from
        375° C to 475° C. he found no evident relation between the
        volatile
        matter in the coal and the amount of tar evolved. He also
        concluded
        that
        neither geologic age, carbon-hydrogen ration, nor percentage
        volatile
        matter
        in the coal had any relation to the temperature of tar
        evolution. </p>
      <p>Burgess and Wheeler (57), in examining Welsh coals, found
        certain
        variations
        in the yield of tarry matter when the temperature of
        carbonization
        ranged
        form below 500° C to above 1000° C. Their data are plotted in
        Figure
        19, where it is seen that the yield of tar per gross ton of coal
        rises
        to a maximum at about 700° C. The experiments of Burgess and
        Wheeler
        (57) are not in agreement with the figures given by Lewes (17),
        whose
        maximum
        yield occurred about 300° C lower. No information was given by
        the
        latter authority regarding the composition of the coal used to
        secure
        his
        data, so that the disagreement cannot be explained. The specific
        gravity
        of the tar gradually increases with the temperature increase.
        This is
        to
        be expected, since the lighter hydrocarbons are destroyed
        through
        decomposition
        at the higher temperatures to form fixed gas, leaving the
        heavier,
        higher-boiling
        hydrocarbons and the carbon freed in the cracking. </p>
      <p>Porter and Ovitz (96) investigated the tar distilled at various
        temperatures
        from several coals of the United States. Their figures, computed
        from a
        percentage basis to gallons of tar per net ton, are plotted in
        Figure
        20.
        Comparison of this illustration with Figure 19 will disclose
        that,
        qualitatively,
        the data are in agreement with the results obtained by Burgess
        and
        Wheeler
        (57) on Welsh coals. In Figure 20 it appears that, from the
        standpoint
        of securing maximum tar yield, the optimum temperature of
        carbonization
        is in the neighborhood of 800° C, although in commercial plants
        this
        figure appears somewhat high. Too much confidence cannot be
        placed in
        the
        quantitative value of these curves for they seem low for high
        volatile
        coals. </p>

      <p>According to Fischer (119), the solid paraffins in primary tar
        represent
        1% or 2% of the tar and in this respect we find one striking
        difference
        between the tar obtained from brown coals and that obtained from
        bituminous
        coals. Fischer (120) found the tar from Saxon brown coal to
        contain as
        much as 29% solid paraffins, while the tar from Rhenish brown
        coal
        yielded
        13%. In other respects, the two primary tars are quite similar.

      <p>Garbe (121) distilled a Shetland peat containing 21.4% moisture
        and
        73.8% volatile matter, at 500° C in a Tozer retort and obtained
        a
        yield
        per gross ton of 33.6% peat char, 4500 cu ft of 500 BTU/cu ft
        gas, 1.44
        gallons of 0.7885 specific gravity motor spirit, 23.4 gallons of
        crude
        oil, and 13.6 lb of ammonium sulfate. The peat tar contained
        35.2%
        moisture,
        2.2% light oil up to 170 C, 19.8% medium oil in the fraction
        170° C
        to 230° C, and 37.8% residuum above 230° C. The middle oil
        contained
        22% tar acids. </p>
      <p>Garvin (112) reports that, on the average, distillation of
        Scottish
        shale yields 24.5 gallon of 0.860 sp gr tar, 9800 cu ft of 270
        BTU/cu
        ft
        gas, 35.7 lb of ammonium sulfate, and 1550 lb of waste spent
        shale from
        each ton of raw material. Oil shales of the United States have
        tested
        all
        the way from less than 7.5 gal of tar/ton, in the case of a
        Nevada
        sample,
        to over 60 gal/ton for a specimen from Colorado. The specific
        gravity
        of
        these tars varies also from 0.881 to 0.924. The average test
        yield of
        tar
        from 11 US shales from 6 states was 37.1 gal/ton. </p>

      <p><a name="time"></a><b>Time Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>The time element deserves important consideration in regard to
        the
        tar
        as well as with respect to the gas. If the distillation is slow
        and the
        tar vapors are removed slowly, secondary decomposition may occur
        with a
        corresponding decrease in the yield of oils and increase in the
        evolution
        of gas. But the tar yield is not the only outcome of slow
        carbonization.
        The structure of the tar is vastly changed. A tar produced in
        slow
        distillation
        contains a larger proportion of the aromatic derivatives and
        fewer
        members
        of the alipathic series. The curve of tar yield against time is
        somewhat
        similar to that of gas evolution, shown in Figure 14. We know,
        of
        course,
        from the differential calculus, that the derivative of this
        curve is
        the
        curve of the rate of yield of tar. Inspection of the slope shows
        that
        the
        rate of yield in gallons/minute, as plotted against time, should
        reach
        a maximum and then gradually fall off until a point may be
        reached
        where
        it will be uneconomical to prolong the process for the tar
        alone. In
        other
        words, the rate of yield curve for tar has been found by
        experiment to
        be similar to that for gas shown in Figure 17. It should not be
        overlooked
        that, although the production of tar after a certain period may
        not be
        sufficient to warrant continuation of carbonization, the gas
        evolved
        may
        entirely justify prolongation. </p>
      <p>The effect of bringing the charge up to maximum temperature in
        5
        hours,
        as compared with attaining the same temperature within a
        fraction of an
        hour, is shown by the results of Table 46, after Taylor and
        Porter
        (98).
        These experiments were conducted on Pennsylvania coal. It is
        seen that
        in every case the yield changed from about 16.0 gal/gross ton of
        coal
        to
        about 20.5 gal/gross ton when the period of attaining the
        maximum
        carbonization
        temperature was decreased from 5 hours to a much shorter period.

      <p><a name="press"></a><b>Pressure &amp; Vacuum Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>Some 30 years ago, Dewar and Redwood patented the distillation
        of
        petroleum
        under pressure to crack the heavy distillates into low-boiling
        and more
        valuable fractions. In 1910, Burton developed the pressure
        cracking
        system
        and now it is a well-established industry. Attempts have been
        made to
        reduce
        the deposition of carbon by the introduction of catalyzers and
        Bergius
        has proposed the hydrogenation of the hydrocarbons by
        carbonization
        under
        pressure in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Cracking, however, in low
        temperature
        carbonization process, is ordinarily avoided in order to
        preserve the
        primary
        products of distillation. Hence, the retorts are usually
        operated at
        atmospheric
        pressure under slight vacuum, of hardly more than 2 inches of
        water, to
        overcome the resistance of the piping system. A discussion of
        the
        possibility
        of increasing the yield of lighter hydrocarbons, suitable as a
        fuel for
        internal combustion engines, by cracking the primary tar will be
        taken
        up under the subject of motor spirit. </p>
      <p>A vacuum system assists in the removal of the vapors and
        prevents
        condensation
        of the heavy tars in the retort. It also removed the air which
        is
        present,
        thus preventing oxidation, and preserves the primary tar by
        avoiding
        cracking.
        In 1905 an 1906, Simpson obtained patents which were afterwards
        incorporated
        in the Tozer retort for distilling in partial and complete
        vacuum.
        Little
        work has been done by way of investigation in this field, but
        Taylor
        and
        Porter (98) have examined certain coals of the US when distilled
        at
        pressures
        below 4 cm Hg. A comparison of the tar yields from atmospheric
        and
        vacuum
        carbonization is instructive. The atmospheric distillation in
        Table 47
        was carried out at 475° C. The figures, for convenience, have
        been
        converted from a percentage basis to gallons per gross ton. </p>
      <p>The effect of temperature on the yield of vacuum tar also was
        investigated
        by the same authorities. In this case, different periods of
        distillation
        were used at different temperatures, so that the data are not
        strictly
        comparable, but they are given in Figure 21 because no other
        similar
        figures
        are available. The data are computed to gallons per gross ton.
        It will
        be noted that the yields in this illustration are higher than
        those
        indicated
        by Table 47. This is due, doubtlessly, to the systematic error
        pointed
        out above, as well as to an additional cause. In this case, the
        percentage
        tar obtained was determined by subtraction, rather than by
        direct
        observation,
        and consequently the cumulative errors of analyses fall entirely
        on the
        tar content. Figure 21 should be compared with Figure 20, where
        the
        corresponding
        results of atmospheric distillation are shown. The main
        difference in
        the
        characteristic temperature versus yield curves of atmospheric
        and
        vacuum
        carbonization lies in the absence of a maximum on the vacuum
        system.
        The
        yield of tar, in the latter case, quickly rises until about 450°
        C
        is reached, when little change in the quantity of tar produced
        is
        noticed
        during the next 150° C temperature increase. Thereafter, the
        yield
        of tar increases with temperature rise even up to 1050° C. </p>

      <p><a name="atmos"></a><b>Atmospheric &amp; Moisture Effect ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taylor and Porter (98) investigated the effect of inert
        atmospheres
        on the quantity of tar produced. The presence of coal gas or
        nitrogen
        did
        not exert any decided influence on the yield. Thus, over a
        5-hour
        period
        of distillation, 17.1 gallons of tar per gross ton were obtained
        in an
        atmosphere of coal gas at 950° C and 16.0 gallons when pure
        nitrogen
        was introduced into the retort during carbonization at 1040° C.
      </p>
      <p>Weathering of the coal before coking appears to have an effect
        on
        the
        quantity of tar evolved in carbonization. Thus, it was found
        that a
        Wyoming
        coal yielded 9.1% of its weight as tar, when distilled as
        received, but
        only 6.2% after air-drying. It is a well known fact that
        weathering
        reduces
        the volatile content of the coal, both through escape of the
        occluded
        gases
        and through oxidation. It is not surprising, therefore, to find
        a
        larger
        evolution of tar immediately upon reception of the sample than
        after
        the
        coal has been exposed to the action of the air. </p>
      <p>The moisture content of the coal does not have any influence on
        the
        amount of tar produced, when computed upon a dry coal basis,
        according
        to Porter and Ovitz. (96). Thus the yield of tar from a dry
        Pennsylvania
        coal, containing but 1.2% moisture, as compared with another
        sample
        containing
        9.6% moisture, is given in Table 48. The decrease in tar, when
        figured
        as a percentage of the coal as charged, is a fictitious decrease
        only,
        arising entirely from the selection of a base for computation
        which
        contains
        a smaller quantity of the tar-producing element. </p>

      <p>Davis and Parry (97), it will be recalled, conducted
        experiments
        to
        determine the effect of superheated steam upon the carbonization
        products.
        It has been shown that probably the temperature is not
        sufficiently
        high
        in the low temperature distillation process to cause any
        interaction
        between
        the steam and the primary volatile products, and consequently
        the
        principal
        effect of steam will be in preventing secondary decomposition by
        assisting
        the quick removal of the products. With Pennsylvania coal from
        the
        Upper
        Freeport bed, Davis and Parry (97) found that 33.0 gallons of
        tar per
        gross
        ton were obtained without the use of steam, whereas the
        following
        yields
        were obtained when 88% steam was passed through the retort: 30.8
        gal/gross
        ton at 475° C, 33.3 gal/gross ton at 550° C, and 50.9 gal/gross
        ton at 650° C. At 550° C, which is the only temperature at
        which
        experiments were made on the same coal without the use of steam,
        apparently
        there was little effect on the yield. It is evident that an
        enormous
        quantity
        of tar was evolved under steam distillation at 650° C.
        Unfortunately,
        no information is at hand to determine whether this large yield
        is due
        to the presence of steam or is a peculiarity of the coal. </p>
      <p>The tar produced in steam distillation at low temperatures is a
        little
        more viscous but otherwise it does not appear essentially
        different
        from
        the tar obtained without the use of steam. Its fractionation,
        however,
        shows it to have a marked difference in volatile content. It
        contains a
        smaller percentage of light oils, but more of the heavier
        hydrocarbons.
        This topic will be taken up again under a discussion of the
        fractionation
        of low temperature tar. </p>
      <p><a name="constit"></a><b>Constitution of Primary Tar ~</b> </p>
      <p>Although low temperature tar obtained from lignite and brown
        coal
        may
        be solid at ordinary temperatures, due to a large proportion of
        solid
        paraffins,
        primary tar, in general, is lighter and more fluid than that
        from high
        temperature processes. The specific gravity of primary tar
        usually
        ranges
        from 0.95 to 1.06, as compared with 1.2 sp gr for high
        temperature
        tars,
        according to Fischer (119). The comparatively low density is due
        mainly
        to the presence of large proportions of liquid hydrocarbons and
        phenols.
        Low temperature tar usually has a strong odor of phenols and of
        hydrogen
        sulfide, but it never has the naphthalene odor of secondary
        tars. In
        transparent
        layers, its color ranges from orange to red. Fischer and Gluud
        (60)
        have
        pointed out another way in which low temperature tar resembles
        petroleum
        and differs from high temperature aromatic tars. They found that
        some
        of
        the hydrocarbons from primary tar exhibit a small but distinct
        optical
        activity. In a tar from Lohberg coal, freed of phenols, the
        optical
        rotation
        with sodium light through a 20 cm tube varied from +0.05 for the
        fraction
        175° C to 185° C, to the value +0.30 for the fraction from
        225°
        C to 235° C. Low temperature tars are usually soluble in the
        ordinary
        organic solvents, such as benzene, ether, acetone, chloroform,
        carbon
        tetrachloride,
        and petroleum ether, but its solution is usually accompanied by
        precipitation
        of resins. </p>

      </center>
      <p>It has been shown conclusively that distillations of the
        primary
        tar,
        during analytical procedures, distinctly alters its composition,
        especially
        that of the higher boiling compounds. Fischer (49) states that
        primary
        tar cannot be distilled without the part above 300° C
        decomposing,
        the viscous lubricating oils suffering the greatest
        decomposition and
        the
        higher phenols being affected to a lesser degree. A specific
        case of
        this
        for low temperature brown coal tar has been given by Fischer
        (85) and
        is
        reproduced in Table 49. The distillation was carried out slowly
        for 8
        hours,
        yielding 85.6% oil, 4.7% gas, 9.2% coke, and a small amount of
        water.
        It
        will be observed that distillation so altered the constitution
        of the
        fraction
        from 70° C to 250° C as to increase its proportion from 18.5%
        to
        31.7% of the original tar. The proportion of acids was
        simultaneously
        greatly
        decreased. Schneider (122) confirmed these results with tar from
        a
        bituminous
        coal. </p>
      <p>Decomposition of primary tar during distillation is further
        indicated
        by the evolution of gas. Windel (123) found that gas first was
        evolved
        at 270° C, reaching a maximum at about 335° C. The gas
        contained
        7% hydrogen sulfide, 4% carbon dioxide, about 75% methane and
        its
        homologues,
        and about 10% ethylene and acetylene hydrocarbons. Edwards
        (124), and
        also
        Brittain, Rowe, and Sinnatt (125) detected the evolution of
        sulfur
        dioxide
        at the beginning of distillation and hydrogen sulfide at 170° C,
        when
        studying tar from the Coalite process. </p>
      <p>It is quite evident that the evaluation of low temperature tars
        is
        a
        difficult task and that the method of separation by solvents
        must be
        used
        to avoid distillation as much as possible, but even this method
        of
        approach
        is not without its difficulty of solvent reaction. These
        troubles are
        augmented
        by the fact that most low temperature tars change color and
        character
        on
        standing. This has been attributed by Jaeger (126) to oxidation
        by the
        atmosphere through the action of light, but the presence of
        bases are
        important
        factors. Parr and Olin (37) found, also, that the viscosity of
        the tar
        increased with standing, apparently the result of oxidation, for
        Brittain,
        Rowe, and Sinnatt (125) found no change when the tar was kept in
        darkness
        and out of contact with air. </p>
      <p>As early as 1862, Williams (127) and Schorlemmer (128) seem to
        have
        made the first chemical examination of low temperature tar
        obtained
        from
        cannel coal. The latter of these investigators identified
        paraffin
        hydrocarbons.
        However, the first noteworthy research was conducted by
        Bornstein (95)
        in 1904. He fractionated primary tar from Westphalian coals,
        from
        50°
        C to 450° C, and found it conspicuously different from high
        temperature
        tar, being a thin liquid with little free carbon and containing
        no
        naphthalene
        or anthracene, but quantities of phenols and up to 2% solid
        paraffins.
        With another Westphalian low temperature tar he found no solid
        paraffins,
        but something less than half of one percent methylanthracene. </p>
      <p>Pictet and Bouvier (51, 129, 130 &amp; 131), and also Pictet,
        Kaiser,
        and Labouchere (52) conducted a series of investigations,
        beginning in
        1913, on primary tar obtained from vacuum distillation of a
        French
        bituminous
        coal containing about 11% ash, 70% fixed carbon, and 19%
        volatile
        matter.
        The fresh tar was composed of 68% unsaturated hydrocarbons, 30%
        saturated
        hydrocarbons, 2% alcohols and 0.2% bases. They found no phenols
        in the
        fresh tar, but detected some after the tar had remained standing
        a long
        time. As other investigators have found over 15% phenols in
        fresh tar
        examined
        by them, it appears that Pictet and Bouvier must have had an
        exceptionally
        true primary tar. They established the presence of toluidine,
        pentamethylphenol,
        tetramethylphenol, xylenol, hydroguinoline, and isoquinoline. </p>
      <p>Jones and Wheeler (42) examined the tar obtained from a
        Scottish
        and
        a Durham coal, distilled at 450° C in vacuo. In the oils below
        300°
        C, they found about 40% unsaturated hydrocarbons, about 7%
        aromatic
        compounds,
        probably homologues of naphthalene, about 12% phenols, chiefly
        cresols
        and xylenols, traces of pyridine bases, and a small amount of
        solid
        paraffins. </p>
      <p><a name="ident"></a><b>Identification of Compounds ~</b> </p>
      <p>Regarding particular chemical compounds that are found in low
        temperature
        tars, some quantitative determinations by Schultz and Buschmann
        (34,
        35)
        and also by Fieldner (36) have been given under the chemistry of
        low
        temperature
        carbonization, discussed in Chapter I and compiled in Table 5
        and Table
        6 respectively. A qualitative list of compounds, actually
        identified in
        low temperature products, was given in Table 7, accompanied by
        references
        to the authorities who isolated them. </p>
      <p>Among the aromatic hydrocarbons, Whitaker and Crowell (132,
        134),
        when
        investigating a Pennsylvania coal, observed that benzene first
        formed
        at
        500° C and toluene at 400° C, but that maximum yields were not
        obtained until 800° C for benzene, 700° C for toluene, and
        600°
        C for xylene. Traces of benzene have been found by a number of
        observers,
        but most investigators have been unable to detect it in primary
        tars
        examined
        by them. Parr and Olin (37) found benzene, as well as toluene,
        xylene,
        and possibly mesitylene, in Illinois low temperature tar.
        Schultz (43)
        is the only authority who has reported considerable quantities
        of
        benzene
        hydrocarbons. He examined a tar obtained by distillation of
        Furst-Hardenberg
        coal in a rotary retort at about 480° C. Broche (53), however,
        examined
        tar from the same coal and found less that 0.4% benzene, from
        which he
        concluded that the tar examined by Schultz was abnormal. Fischer
        and
        Gluud
        (39) detected a very small amount of benzene in tar from one
        coal
        examined
        by them. </p>
      <p>Besides Parr and Olin, toluene in minute quantities was found
        by
        Jones
        and Wheeler (42) and its presence was confirmed by Frank and
        Arnold
        (133).
        The latter observers also found three xylenes in the tar
        fraction from
        120° C to 180° C. Klein (135) found that both toluene and
        xylene
        in the light oil from a large rotary retort, while Weissberger
        and
        Moehrle
        (46), and also Kruber (136) and Kaffer (137), found the higher
        homologues
        of benzene, of which pseudocumene, durene, and a few others have
        been
        identified. </p>
      <p>Less than 1% naphthalene seems to be present in low temperature
        tars,
        as compared with 4% or 5% in aromatic tars. According to
        Ruhemann
        (138),
        brown coal low temperature tar contains some naphthalene.
        Brittain,
        Rowe,
        and Sinnatt (125), Morgan and Soule (45, 48), as well as
        Weissberger
        and
        Moehrle (46), found it in tar from full-scale low temperature
        plants,
        while
        Parrish and Rowe (139) found small quantities in tar carefully
        distilled
        from coal at 600° C. Anthracene is present in even smaller
        proportions
        than naphthalene, but it has been reported as present by
        Britain, Rowe
        and Sinnatt (125) and by Weissberger and Moehrle (46), the last
        of
        which
        also established the presence of naphthalene homologues such as
        the
        methylnapthalenes,
        confirming the observations of Fischer, Schroeder, and Zerbe
        (47). </p>
      <p>Among the saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, Fischer and
        Gluud
        (39) found pentane, hexane, many of their homologues, and
        possible
        terpenes,
        among the low-boiling fractions of primary tar. Schultz,
        Buschmann, and
        Wissebach (38) established the presence of ethylene, propylene,
        butylenes,
        pentene, butadiene, and cyclopentadiene in the light oils, most
        of
        which
        were also found by Fieldner (36) in certain American low
        temperature
        tars,
        as shown in Table 6. Klein (135) also detected octylene and
        nonylene in
        large-scale primary tar. </p>
      <p>Among the oxygenated compounds, acetone has been observed by
        Frank
        and
        Arnold (133), by Schultz (140), and by Broche (53). Acetaldehyde
        and
        indications
        of ketones were obtained by Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125),
        while
        Schultz
        (140) also identified acetaldehyde as well as methylethylketone
        and
        acetonitrile. </p>
      <p>Free sulfur is probably present to a small extent in low
        temperature
        tar, although its presence is undesirable, but it cannot be
        avoided if
        the raw coal is one of large sulfur content. Schultz (43)
        detected
        methylmercaptan
        and dimethylsulfide, in addition to the simple sulfur compounds
        hitherto
        mentioned. Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) found over 1.5%
        combined
        sulfur
        in the crude full-scale low temperature tars examined by them. </p>
      <p><a name="tarac"></a><b>Tar Acids ~</b> </p>
      <p>Heretofore it has been pointed out that one of the outstanding
        peculiarities
        of low temperature tar is its high acid content. These acids do
        not
        consist
        so much of phenol itself as of homologues of the series, such as
        the
        cresols,
        xylenols, and more complex phenol derivatives. </p>
      <p>There has been a great variation in the amount of acids present
        in
        the
        tars examined by various authorities. Thus, Jones and Wheeler
        (42)
        found
        about 7%; tests on the Toser retort gave 10.2%; Edwards (124)
        reported
        10.8% to 15%; Morgan and Soule (48) determined 14.7%; Davis and
        Gallway
        (141) found from 12% to 19%; the Fuel Research Board reported
        17.8%;
        Morgan
        and Meigham (142) 17.5%; Davis and Parry (97) 18.2%; tests on
        the
        Nielsen
        retort yielded 20%; Parr and Olin (37) 27.9%; and Church and
        Weiss
        (143)
        as much as 50%. </p>
      <p>The work of Morgan and Soule was conducted on tar from the
        Carbocoal
        process; Jones and Wheeler used vacuum tar; Church examined a
        tar from
        an Illinois coal of high oxygen content; Parr and Olin used
        Illinois
        coal;
        Davis and Parry used tar derived from Pennsylvania coal; Edwards
        used
        English
        coals. The high yield obtained by Church does not seem
        extraordinary,
        when
        it is recalled that he used a coal of high oxygen content and
        that the
        phenolic compounds contain combined oxygen. In fact, it seems
        permissible
        to predict that, in general, coals which are highly oxygenated
        may be
        expected
        to give a larger quantity of the tar acids upon carbonization.
        The same
        may be said, perhaps, of coals which have been weathered through
        exposure
        to the atmosphere or retorted in the presence of a considerable
        amount
        of oxygen. Unfortunately, no experimental data are at hand to
        substantiate
        this belief. </p>
      <p>The bulk of low temperature tar phenols consist of complex
        hydrogenated
        and alkalated derivatives or ordinary high temperature tar
        phenols.
        They
        are largely saturated compounds. Morgan (144) states that on
        account of
        their long side chains the primary tar phenols are less soluble
        in
        water
        than those derived from aromatic tars. </p>
      <p>Phenol itself usually is present in amounts of less than 0.5%
        of
        the
        tar, as compared with twice that amount for high temperature
        tars. Its
        presence
        in small quantities has been established by Fischer and Breuer
        (145),
        by
        Brittain, Rowe, and Sinnatt (125), by Morgan and Soule (48), by
        Parrish
        and Rowe (139), and by Frank and Arnold (133). Schultz (43) and
        his
        coworkers
        (38) are the only investigators reporting as much as 1.35%
        phenol I the
        crude tar. Pictet, who examined an exceptionally true primary
        tar,
        found
        no phenol but up to 2% methylcyclohexanol, an unstable alcohol
        which
        decomposed
        into phenol upon standing. </p>
      <p>All three cresols have been identified, but there seems to be
        no
        uniformity
        in the way in which they predominate. Gluud and Breuer (50)
        found that
        m-cresol predominated; Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) found
        about 46%
        of-cresol, about 37% m-cresol, and about 16% p-cresol; while
        Morgan and
        Soule (48) found 54% p-cresol, 27% of-cresol, and 19% m-cresol.
        Schultz,
        Buschmann, and Wissebach (38) have identified 4 of the zylenols,
        while
        Avenarius (147) has isolated a fifth. </p>
      <p>Catechol was detected qualitatively by Morgan and Soule (48),
        by
        Edwards
        (124), and by Parrish and Rowe (139). Bornstein (95) also
        detected it,
        while Gluud (148) estimated the quantity of this compound in the
        tar
        from
        Lohberg coal, examined by him, to amount to 0.02% of the coal.
        Brittain,
        Rowe, and Sinnatt (125) found catechol present in tar from the
        Coalite
        process. </p>
      <p>Among the higher-boiling phenols, Morgan and Soule (48)
        reported
        the
        presence of napthols, while Weindel (123) observed beta-napthol,
        and
        Edwards
        (124) reported both alpha- and beta-napthol. Gluud and Breuer
        (50)
        found
        trimethylphenols, the presence of which was confirmed by the
        researches
        of Fromm and Eckard (40) and of Pictet, Kaiser, and Labouchere
        (52).
        The
        latter experimenters also identified tetramehtylphenol and
        pentamethylphenol.
        Marcusso and Picard (149) recorded the presence of solid phenols
        in
        primary
        tar from Upper Silesian coal, but Tropsch (150), who examined
        the low
        temperature
        tar of a coal from the same region, was unable to confirm this.
      </p>
      <p>Among the sulfonated phenols, Schultz, Buschmann, and Wissebach
        (38)
        reported appreciable quantities of mercaptans and Avenarius
        (147)
        concluded
        that thiophenols were present. Parrish and Rowe (139) found
        0.73%
        sulfur
        in their crude phenols, while Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125)
        estimated
        the sulfur content of the crude phenols from Coalite tar to be
        less
        than
        1%. </p>
      <p>Some idea of the distribution of the various constituents may
        be
        gained
        from a rough separation of the phenols made by Fischer and
        others. They
        found from 1% to 6% cresols, bout the same proportion of
        xylenols, 5%
        to
        25% higher phenols, and 8% to 15% acid resins. The tar from the
        Fuel
        Research
        Board horizontal retorts yielded about half the acid content
        reported
        by
        Fischer, about 5% cresols, 11% xylenols, and the remainder was
        composed
        of the heavier derivatives of phenol. Parrish (117) has compiled
        a
        list,
        shown in Table 50, which gives the distribution of phenols among
        the
        tar
        acids in low temperature carbonization. </p>

      <p>According to the results of Davis and Parry (97), introduction
        of
        steam
        into the retort during distillation of the coal considerably
        alters the
        quantity of tar acids produced in each fraction of the tar.
        Their data
        are given in Table 51 as percentages of the fraction. The tar
        examined
        was obtained in both cases by carbonization of Pennsylvania coal
        from
        the
        Freeport bed at 550° C. The yield is equivalent to 4.76 gallons
        of
        tar acids per net ton of coal, or 14.5% of the crude tar, for
        dry
        distillation
        and 4.04 gallons per net ton, or 12.2% of the crude tar, under
        steam
        distillation.
        The average yield per net ton from 5 Pennsylvania coals, tested
        by
        Davis
        and Parry (97) was 5.45 gallons. The specific gravities of the
        acids
        separated
        from the various fractions of tar were 1.021, 1.028, and 1.051
        for the
        light, middle, and heavy oil cuts, respectively. The middle oil
        contained
        a preponderance of cresols and xylenols. </p>
      <p>Tar from the same coal, carbonized at different temperatures,
        was
        examined
        by the same investigators with a view of determining the effect
        of
        temperature
        variation on the production of tar acids. The results are
        reproduced in
        Table 52, which shows conclusively that increase of the
        temperature
        from
        475° C to 650° C does not influence the yield to any extent. It
        is apparent that the acids are stable up to beyond 650° C and
        that
        no decomposition occurred at that temperature. This experiment
        was
        carried
        out in the presence of steam, which to a great extent reduced
        the
        susceptibility
        to thermal decomposition. </p>
      <p>Figure 22 shows the variation of the percentage of tar acids,
        as a
        function
        of the average boiling point of the fraction, for low
        temperature tar
        from
        Pennsylvania coal, as determined by Davis and Parry (97), when
        compared
        with the same determinations on tar from the Carbocoal process,
        as
        found
        by Morgan and Soule (151). In the illustration, it will be noted
        that
        the
        maximum yield of tar acids occurs in the fraction whose average
        boiling
        point is 200° C, in the Freeport tar, whereas in the Carbocoal
        tar
        this maximum occurs 60° C higher. </p>
      <p><a name="tarbas"></a><b>Tar Bases ~</b> </p>
      <p>The nitrogen bases are characterized usually by absence of the
        simpler
        members, although pyridine and the simple alipathic amines have
        been
        detected
        in small quantities. The tar bases consist mostly of secondary
        and
        tertiary
        compounds and others of unknown origin. </p>
      <p>Davis and Parry (97) found 1.23% nitrogen bases in the low
        temperature
        tar from Pennsylvania coal; Davis and Galloway (141) found 2.8%
        to 5.7%
        in the tar distillate up to 275° C, representing 1.1% to 2.3% of
        the
        total tar; Edwards 124) found from 2.9% to 5.8% in the
        distillate up to
        311° C, amounting to 1.3% and 2.5% respectively of the total
        tar;
        Jones
        and Wheeler (42) found less than 1%; Parr and Olin (31) found
        0.9%;
        Pictet,
        Kaiser, and Labouchere (52) found as little as 0.2%; Fischer and
        Gluud
        (152) found 0.46%; Parrish and Rowe (139) found 2.7%; Morgan and
        Soule
        (48) found 0.6% in Carbocoal tar; and Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt
        (125)
        found from 2.45% to 4.1% in the total tar from the Coalite
        process.
        These
        figures, however, can be misleading, as most of the
        determinations were
        made on fractions representing as little as 30% of the total tar
        and
        the
        quantity of bases present in those distillates computed back on
        a total
        tar basis, whereas it is quite apparent that a large percentage
        of the
        bases remains in the tar residuum above 300° C. Indications are
        that
        the tar bases amount to from 3% to 5% of the total tar. </p>
      <p>Gollmer (146) found among the primary amines in low temperature
        tar,
        analine, the toluidines, and the xylidines; the primary amines
        all
        amounting
        to 4.5% of the tar bases. Schultz, Buschmann, and Wissebach (38)
        confirmed
        the findings of Gollmer. Other investigators, however, found no
        primary
        amines, but Morgan and Soule (48) found 20% secondary and 80%
        tertiary
        amines; Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) fund 56% secondary and
        44%
        tertiary
        amines; While Parrish and Rowe (149) found 15% secondary and 85%
        tertiary
        amines. </p>
      <p>It has been observed generally that a large proportion of
        unsaturated
        compounds are found in the tar bases. Traces of pyridine have
        been
        observed
        by Gollmer (146), by Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) in the tar
        liquor,
        by Fromm and Eckard (40), by Schultz, Buschmann, and Wissbach
        (38), and
        by Morgan and Soule (48). Among the homologues of pyridine,
        Schultz and
        his coworkers found methylpyridines, dimethylpyridines, and
        trimethylpyridines;
        the presence of the latter being confirmed by Gollmer (146),
        while
        Morgan
        and Soule (48) found ethylpyridine and its hydrogenated
        derivatives.
        Brittain
        and Soule (48) found ethylpyridine and its hydrogenated
        derivatives.
        Brittain,
        Rowe and Sinnatt (125) also found small amount of diethylamine
        and
        triethylamine
        in the tar liquor. Schultz (38) and his associates established
        the
        presence
        of quinoline and its derivative, methylquinoline, whiel Pictet
        and his
        coworkers found a number of dihydroquinolines present. </p>
      <p>The distribution of nitrogen bases in the fractions of low
        temperature
        tar, as determined by Davis and Parry (97), is given in Figure
        23,
        where
        the percentage yield is plotted against the average boiling
        point of
        the
        fraction. The determinations were made by washing the oil
        fractions,
        after
        removal of the tar acids, with 20% sulfuric acid to remove the
        bases.
        The
        results shown in this curve agree with the fact discovered by
        Morgan
        and
        Soule (48), namely, that the pitch contains a larger proportion
        of
        bases
        than the lighter oil fractions. </p>
      <p>Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) fractionated two samples of
        Coalite
        tar under atmospheric and under reduced pressures and determined
        the
        percentage
        of nitrogen bases present in each fraction. The results are
        given in
        Table
        53. It will be observed that the quantity of bases, present in
        the
        various
        fractions, is considerably greater than that shown in Figure 23,
        but
        the
        general trend to large proportion of bases as the boiling point
        of the
        fraction increases is in agreement with other experimenters. It
        is
        quite
        apparent that the proportion of bases in a given fraction is
        more than
        doubled by vacuum distillation. </p>

      <p><a name="tarsol"></a><b>Tar Solids, Sulfur, and Liquor ~</b> </p>
      <p>Many low temperature tars have been observed easily to form
        emulsions
        with the tar liquor, thereby entailing a great deal of trouble
        in
        bringing
        about demulsification. This tendency to emulsify has ordinarily
        been
        attributed
        to the low specific gravity of primary tar and to dust and other
        mineral
        matter carried over with the tar during distillation. In the
        course of
        their investigations, Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) isolated
        a brown
        amorphous powder, precipitated from the tar fractions by various
        organic
        solvents. After removal of this solid powder, which amounted to
        as much
        as 0.94% of the tar in one sample and 9.9% of the tar in
        another, it
        was
        observed that emulsification of the samples did not take place.
        It was
        concluded that this solid material, present in the tar either as
        suspended
        powder or partly in solution, was a contributing factor in
        emulsification.
        The existence of such a brown powder was confirmed by Edwards
        (124),
        who
        attributed its formation to changes in the tar vapor prior to
        condensation
        or to changes in the tar itself during storage, rather than to
        primary
        decomposition of the coal during carbonization. </p>
      <p>Ruhemann (138) distilled low temperature tar from lignite and
        found
        sulfur in the various fractions to the amount of 3.5% in the
        lower cuts
        and 1.9% in the higher cuts. The neutral oil of the primary tar,
        examined
        by Marcusson and Picard (149), contained from 5.4% to 6.3%
        sulfur.
        Avenarius
        (147) and Schultz, Buschmann, and Wissebach (38) found sulfur in
        their
        tar acids. The nature of these sulfur compounds has already been
        discussed
        and need not be repeated here. Parrish (117) has compiled a
        table from
        the experiments of Brittain, Rowe and Sinnatt (125) and of
        Parrish and
        Rowe (139) to show the distribution of sulfur in low temperature
        tars
        which
        were examined by them. This compilation is given in Table 54.
        The
        notably
        high sulfur contents of the tar solids suggests that it plays an
        important
        part in these substances. </p>
      <p>The aqueous distillate from low temperature tar is usually
        straw
        yellow
        in color and has an acid reaction. According to Jones and
        Wheeler (42),
        the tar liquor contains both hydrochloric acid and ammonium
        chloride.
        Brittain,
        Rowe and Sinnatt (125) made a careful examination of the tar
        liquor
        from
        distillate of Coalite tars, and established the presence of
        acetic
        acid,
        formic acid, acetaldehyde, and certain ketones which could not
        be
        identified.
        They also found traces of diethylamines, triethylamines,
        pyridine, and
        methylpyridine, while phenol, cresol and xylenols were isolated.
      </p>
      <p><a name="primary"></a><b>Primary Tar Distillation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Following the procedure adopted in the evaluation of petroleum,
        a
        rough
        separation of the constituents of low temperature tar can be
        obtained
        by
        preliminary fractionation. Thus, the tar obtained from the
        distillation
        of 5 high grade Barnsley coals has been separated into 3
        qualities of
        oil,
        according to the boiling points. The first cut, up to 170° C, is
        given
        as light oil, the second cut, from 170° C to 245° C, is called
        middle oil, and the last cut, from 245° C to 315° C, is
        designated
        as heavy oil. The viscous residuum is mostly pitch. The results
        of the
        fractionation are given in Table 55. On the average 6.9% of the
        tar by
        volume is light oil, 30.5% middle oil, and 18.4% heavy oil. The
        proximate
        analyses of the coal, whose tar yield is given in Table 55, from
        tests
        by Lewes as reported by Wellington and Cooper (89), was very
        similar to
        that of Pennsylvania coal containing about 60% fixed carbon and
        about
        32%
        volatile matter. </p>
      <p>A Warwickshire coal, containing 10.3% moisture, 35.3% volatile
        matter,
        40.8% fixed carbon, and 13.5% ash, was distilled at 600° C in
        vertical
        retorts at the Fuel Research Station. The tar form this
        experiment had
        a specific gravity at 15° C of 1.029, contained less than 1%
        mineral
        matter and 2.29% water. It was fractionated by Parrish and Rowe
        (139)
        with
        the results shown in Table 56. The percentage acids and bases
        are also
        shown. </p>
      <p>In regard to experiments made upon coals of the United States,
        Parr
        and Olin (37) obtained a dark brown tar which had a specific
        gravity of
        1.069, from Illinois bituminous coal. Crude fractionation gave
        the
        following
        results: 17.2% light oil up to 210° C, with a specific gravity
        of
        0.966;
        52.7% heavy oil from 210° C to 325° C, with a specific gravity
        of 1.032; and 30.1% pitch over 325° C, with a specific gravity
        of
        1.270.
        These fractions were refined and the yield between certain
        points
        computed
        as a percentage of the tar with the results shown in Table 57. </p>

      <p>Low temperature tars obtained from the Pittsburgh and Upper
        Kittanning
        beds of Pennsylvania at 550° C to 650° C have been fractionated
        by Davis and Parry (97). A comparison of the boiling ranges of
        low
        temperature
        tar, crude shale oil, and petroleum is given in Figure 24.
        Examination
        of these curves discloses that below 250 C none of the low
        temperature
        tars is as volatile as petroleum and that below 200° C shale oil
        contains
        a larger percentage of volatile constituents than the tar. Above
        200°
        C, the percentage by volume of the tar which distills exceeds
        that of
        the
        shale oil and, at a slightly higher temperature, even that of
        petroleum.
        The low temperature tar obtained from the Carbocoal process
        contains
        higher-boiling
        hydrocarbons than the other tars, as demonstrated by the
        position of
        the
        curve in the illustration. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Figure 25, after Davis and Parry (97), shows the distillation
        range
        of tar from 5 Pennsylvania coals. All of these tars had about
        the same
        volatility, except Pittsburgh rooster coal, which contained more
        of the
        lighter oils with boiling points below 150° C. This particular
        tar
        gave a low percentage of phenol and unsaturated compounds than
        the
        other
        samples. The specific gravity of these tar fractions increased
        from
        0.882
        at 175° C to 0.992 at 275° C. </p>
      <p>Parr and Layng (102) distilled low temperature tar from Utah
        coal
        and
        found that 4.02% distilled from 0° C to 170° C; 37.1% from
        170°
        C to 300° C; 34.7% from 300° C to 3260° C, leaving 22.8%
        pitch
        and loss. The fraction from 170° C to 300° C was composed of
        28.6%
        tar acids, 4.6% amines, and 22.4% paraffins. </p>
      <p>Giles and Villebrandt (99) made a careful study of the low
        temperature
        carbonization products obtained at various temperatures from
        Farmville,
        NC coal. The effect of temperature upon the composition of the
        gas from
        this coal has already been seen in Figure 12. The influence of
        temperature
        of carbonization on the volatility of the tar is nicely
        illustrated in
        Table 58. It will be observed that when the temperature of
        distillation
        is advanced from 300° C to 660° C, the proportion of the lower
        fractions as a percentage of the entire tar undergoes a decided
        decrease,
        while the proportion of the heavier fractions have a
        corresponding
        increase.
        Between the distillation temperatures of 300° C and 660° C, the
        percentage of the fraction 70° C to 170° C is reduced at the
        higher
        temperature to almost one-fourth of its initial value; the
        percentage
        of
        the fraction from 170° C to 230° C is reduced to about
        one-third
        of its former amount; and the fraction 230° C to 270° C suffers
        a reduction to about three-fifths of its value at the lowest
        temperature.
        On the other hand, increase of the carbonization temperature
        from
        200°
        C to 660° C causes the amount of the fraction from 315° C to
        355°
        C to about double, while the residuum above 355° C is increased
        from
        7.5% of the total tar to 54.9%. It is quite evident that the
        higher the
        temperature of carbonization, the less is the proportion of
        light oil
        and
        the greater is the proportion of heavy oil and pitch in the tar.

      <p>We have already seen in Table 29 the effect of the temperature
        of
        carbonization
        on the composition of the gas evolved from distillation of
        Washington
        lignite.
        Benson and Canfield (108) also fractionated the tar condensed
        from
        these
        experiments. The results are given in Table 59. The findings in
        this
        case
        agree with those of Table 58, except that here the decrease in
        light
        oil
        fractions with increasing temperature of carbonization is
        compensated
        by
        an increased proportion of coke. With Washington lignite, the
        specific
        gravity of the light oil fraction advanced from 0.807, when
        obtained at
        250° C, to 0.821, when the coal was distilled at 600° C. The
        specific
        gravity of the middle oil fraction advanced from 0.905 to 0.955
        at the
        same temperatures, while that of the heavy or paraffin oil
        changed from
        0.939 to 0.985. </p>
      <p>In Table 27 there was shown the composition of gas obtained
        from
        carbonizing
        peat in vertical retorts, as determined in an investigation
        conducted
        by
        the Fuel Research Board (106), under conditions of temperature
        somewhat
        exceeding the limits ordinarily construed to fall within the
        category
        of
        low temperature distillation, but which will be reproduced here,
        as
        data
        on peat tar are decidedly lacking in the technical literature.
        The
        results
        of these tests, as applied to the tar, are given in Table 60. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="60tab.gif" height="380" width="508"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The tar from peat was a thick and semi-solid mass which
        contained
        a
        high proportion of paraffin wax and only a small amount of
        ammoniacal
        liquor.
        The tar from the 843° C test contained about 6.5% paraffin wax
        which
        melted at about 52° C. The first fraction contained about 13.2%
        bases
        and unsaturated compounds and 40.5% tar acids, while the second
        fraction
        was composed of about 54% bases and unsaturated hydrocarbons and
        8% tar
        acids. The last two fractions were solid at 10° C and contained
        practically
        all the paraffin wax. A separate proportion of the 843° C tar
        was
        submitted
        to vacuum distillation with the result that 0.45 gallons of
        purified
        and
        refined light motor spirit was obtained per gross ton of peat.
        The
        total
        peat tar, which was produced, represented about 20 gallons per
        gross
        ton.
        From a study of the effects of temperature on the proportion of
        the tar
        fractions, as demonstrated in Table 58 and Table 59, it would
        appear
        that
        under true low temperature distillation, peat tar would
        fractionate to
        about 7% in the cut up to 170° C, about 31% in the cut from
        170°
        C to 230° C, about 12% in the cut from 230° C to 270° C,
        and
        about 24% in the cut from 270° C to 335° C, with about 26%
        pitch
        and loss. </p>
      <p>According to Garvin (112), to whom the data in Table 61 are
        due,
        shale
        oils of the USA are less volatile than Pennsylvania crude
        petroleum and
        somewhat more volatile than Scottish shale oil. Up to 270° C,
        nearly
        53% of Pennsylvania petroleum distills over, as compared with
        about 48%
        for Indiana shale oil, 40% for Utah shale oil, and 39% for
        Colorado
        shale
        oil. It is well to compare the results of Table 61 with those of
        Figure
        24, where it is quite evident that low temperature tars from
        bituminous
        coals are closely related to shale oil. </p>

      </center>
      The data in Figure 26 are plotted from figures reported by Garvin
      (112).
      The illustration gives a distillation analysis of the various
      fractions
      of Scottish shale oil and two distillation analyses of American
      gasolines
      for comparison. It is seen from the illustration that light oil
      fractionated
      from crude shale oil is considerably more volatile than ordinary
      gasoline,
      while the naptha cut has a characteristic distillation curve very
      nearly
      resembling that of gasoline, except that it has a slight
      deficiency in
      oils boiling below 100° C and contains slightly more of the oils
      boiling
      between 120° C and 220° C, The lubricating oils, fractionated
      from
      shale oil, contain only about 25% oils boiling below 340° C.
      <p><a name="steam"></a><b>Steam Distilled Tar ~</b> </p>
      <p>It has been pointed out that, although the presence of steam in
        the
        retort during low temperature carbonization appears to have
        little
        effect
        on the quantity of tar produced, there is a decided change in
        the
        constitution
        of the product, as indicated by its fractionation. It has also
        been
        shown
        that the major function of steam is the prevention of secondary
        reactions
        by rapid removal of the products of distillation from the
        carbonization
        chamber. Steam distilled tar should, therefore, contain more of
        the
        primary
        products of coal. The curves in Figure 27, after Davis and Parry
        (97),
        compare the distillation range of steam distilled tars at
        various
        temperatures
        with that obtained in atmospheric distillation at 550° C. The
        low
        temperature
        tar was distilled from Pennsylvania coal. The volatility curve
        for
        atmospheric
        tar obtained at 550° C lies entirely below the curve for steam
        distillation
        beyond fractions with a boiling point of 150° C. This indicates
        that
        steam carbonization at low temperatures yields a tar with a
        larger
        percentage
        of higher-boiling constituents than the ordinary product. It
        will be
        noted
        that under steam distillation the proportion by volume of
        lighter oils
        in the tar increases with temperature rise in carbonization, due
        no
        doubt
        to cracking effects. </p>

      <p>Variations of the pressure under which fractionation is
        accomplished
        is a factor in determining the percentage of tar distilled at a
        given
        temperature,
        Figure 28, after Davis and Parry (97), shows the effect of
        fractionation
        under 4 cm of mercury pressure, when working with low
        temperature tar
        from
        Pennsylvania coal. In the first place, it will be seen that the
        steam
        tar
        is far more volatile than ordinary tar obtained at the same
        temperature.
        This is the reverse of the case when fractionation is carried on
        under
        atmospheric pressure, as shown in Figure 27. Furthermore, above
        275°
        C, the proportion of the steam tar distilled increases far more
        rapidly
        than does ordinary low temperature tar. The volatility of both
        steam
        and
        regular low temperature tars, when fractionated in vacuo, is
        decidedly
        less than when the distillation is carried out under ordinary
        pressures.
        At first thought, this would not be anticipated, because it
        might be
        supposed
        that reduction of pressure would lower the boiling point and
        consequently
        increase the volume of oil distilled at a given temperature.
        This
        would,
        of course, be the case if the constituents of the tar existed in
        the
        same
        form in both the crude and the redistilled state. By comparing
        Figure
        27
        and Figure 28 it will be seen, however, that at 225° C only
        about
        2%
        of the tar is distilled in vacuum fractionation, whereas about
        6% is
        obtained
        at the same temperature under ordinary distillation. This
        behavior
        finds
        easy explanation in the fact that temperatures even as low as
        225°
        C cause transformation of the tar constituents from primary to
        secondary
        compounds. </p>
      <p>The unsaturated hydrocarbons which are present in the tar must
        be
        accounted
        part of the refining loss, judging from the present standards of
        the
        petroleum
        industry. Pennsylvania low temperature tar contains about 42%
        unsaturated
        material in the light oil, 45% in the middle oil, and 63% in the
        heavy
        oil. This is of importance from the standpoint of motor fuel,
        because
        the
        unsaturated compounds must be removed before the oil is
        considered
        satisfactory
        for use in internal combustion engines, according to present
        standards
        [1928]. Therefore, a low percentage of unsaturated material in
        the low
        boiling fraction will greatly increase the yield of motor
        spirit. </p>
      <p>Low temperature tar is usually examined by determining the
        percent
        of
        each crude fraction soluble in 10% sodium hydroxide, which
        represents
        the
        amount of tar acids present in the cut. Then the tar is treated
        with
        95%
        sulfuric acid, which removes the unsaturated hydrocarbons. The
        residuum
        consists of the saturated compounds which are present in the
        fraction.
        The Pennsylvania coals, studied by Davis and Parry (97), have
        been
        examined
        in this manner. Using a tar obtained at 550° C, they found for
        ordinary
        low temperature tar the following percentages of saturated
        compounds in
        the various fractions: 50.5% from 0° C to 175° C; 30% from
        175°
        C to 225%; and 26% from 225° C to 275° C. With steam distilled
        tar the quantity of saturated hydrocarbons in the various
        fractions was
        53.1%, 37%, and 30.3% respectively, showing a slight increase.
        The
        percentage
        of unsaturated compounds in the corresponding fractions of the
        same
        tars
        was 35%, 25%, and 44% respectively for the ordinary tar and
        38.5%, 23%,
        and 43.4% respectively for the steam-distilled tar. We see that
        no
        great
        change occurred in the proportion of unsaturated material in the
        fractions
        of low temperature tar by virtue of the presence of steam. Under
        the
        discussion
        of tar acids, it was shown that the small increase in saturated
        compounds,
        noted above in the case of steam tar, is accounted form not
        through any
        change in the amount of unsaturated material present, but
        through a
        reduction
        in the percentage of tar acids evolved in steam distillation. </p>
      <p>The results of Davis and Parry (97) on the examination of low
        temperature
        tar from Pennsylvania coal carbonized at 550° C showed that a
        larger
        amount of oil up to 275° C was present in ordinary low
        temperature
        tar than in tar obtained by carbonization in the presence of
        steam.
        This
        higher yield of oil up to 275° C is doubtlessly the result of
        some
        secondary reactions, prevented by the introduction of steam, as
        indicated
        by the presence of considerably more pitch in the ordinary tar
        than in
        the steam tar. </p>
      <p><a name="full"></a><b>Full-Scale Retort Tar ~</b> </p>
      <p>Many additional factors enter into the situation when
        large-scale
        operations
        are carried out, so that only rough estimation of commercial
        retorts
        can
        be drawn from comparatively small laboratory experiments it is
        important,
        therefore, to study the products of large-scale carbonization
        processes
        when such data are available. In this connection, it should be
        pointed
        out that so much depends upon the coal used that it is important
        that
        some
        method of small-scale distillation be devised so that by the
        application
        of certain factors of proportionality a fair idea may be gained
        as to
        what
        might be expected in large-size retorts. A discussion of several
        laboratory
        devices for this purpose has already been given in Chapter I
        under the
        subject of assay. A more detailed examination of low temperature
        tars
        will
        be undertaken in the discussion of individual processes, but for
        the
        present
        purposes a comparison of the low temperature tars, obtained by
        several
        different processes, will suffice. This comparison is given in
        Table
        62.
        The various retorts, given in the table, represent different
        types. All
        are eternally heated, except for the Nielsen retort, which is a
        rotary
        kiln wherein the coal is carbonized by the sensible heat of
        producer
        gas.
        The Fuel Research board and Tozer processes are horizontal and
        vertical
        static retorts, respectively. The Carbocoal system is a
        two-stage
        process
        involving primary carbonization in a horizontal internally
        agitated
        retort,
        briquetting, and finally secondary carbonization in an inclined
        oven. </p>

      <p>The Fuel Research Board (114) experiments were made with Dalton
        Main
        #2 coal as the charge. It will be seen that not only is there a
        variation
        between the small- and large-scale products, but also among the
        large-scale
        processes themselves. Especial attention is called to the low
        yield of
        the cut, 270° C to pitch, obtained in the Fuel Research Board
        experiments,
        as compared with that obtained in other processes. Furthermore,
        the
        large
        amount of pitch obtained and the generally higher yield of
        lighter
        hydrocarbons
        are all indicative of cracking and secondary reactions in the
        Fuel
        Research
        Board horizontal retorts. The fractions of tar obtained from
        Dalton
        Main
        #2 coal in the Fuel Research Board horizontal retorts can be
        classified
        according to their use in the trade. The classification in Table
        63
        gives
        in gallons per gross tone the quantity of oil that may be
        expected in
        these
        cuts. In addition to the yields reported in the table there was
        a
        refinery
        loss of 4.09 gallons per gross ton, a yield of 2.54 gallons per
        gross
        ton
        of tar acids, and a residuum of 67.5 pounds of pitch per gross
        ton. The
        temperature of carbonization was 600° C. </p>
      <p>Four British coals, carbonized at low temperatures by the Fuel
        Research
        Board (114) in horizontal retorts, averaged 20.7 gallons of
        crude oil
        per
        gross ton of dry coal retorted. This yield of crude oil was
        reduced to
        5.8 gallons per gross ton upon washing and refining, or a loss
        of about
        44% in the refinement process. It has been shown that low
        temperature
        tar
        contains 35% to 40% unsaturated hydrocarbons which must be
        removed from
        the oils to render them of commercial value according to the
        present
        standards
        of the petroleum industry, which is the chief competitor of low
        temperature
        carbonization as a source of liquid fuels. Thus, the unsaturated
        material
        becomes the major portion of the refining loss. Table 64 gives
        the
        original
        fractional yields in gallons of dry tar per gross ton, as well
        as the
        yields
        of washed and refined oils. The reduction in refining values
        varies
        from
        about 25% in the first fraction to about 50% in the last. </p>

      <p>Low temperature tar has a high fuel value, ranging from 16,000
        BTU
        to16,500
        BTU per pound, but it has a low flash point. Attempts to remedy
        this
        fault
        have been made through removal of the light oils, but so far
        this
        procedure
        has rendered the tar too viscous for use. The question of mixing
        low
        temperature
        tar with mineral oils for use as a fuel has been raised. In a
        number of
        instances this has been found impractical because of their
        immiscibility.
        Thus, with American petroleums and shale oils, low temperature
        tar has
        been found to be quite immiscible in all proportions, their
        mixtures
        causing
        a separation of a thick black gummy fluid. Burmese oil formed a
        stable
        mixture up to 25% tar and Mexican oil did not give a separation
        until
        more
        than 50% low temperature tar was present. Trinidad was the only
        petroleum
        which was miscible in all proportions and then only upon heating
        during
        the mixing process. Table 65 shows the results made on this
        problem by
        the Fuel Research Board (114). </p>
      <p>A method of overcoming the immiscibility of low temperature tar
        with
        crude petroleum has been proposed by Lessing (153). The tar is
        mixed
        with
        petroleum, which causes a separation of the pitch, and the
        mixture is
        then
        subjected to steam distillation, which gives a sharp separation
        of the
        pitch and the oil. The distillate is finally fractionated into
        liquor,
        neutral oil, tar acids, bases and pitch. The crude oil is
        approximately
        81% of the mixture and yields on distillation: 56.1% neutral
        oil, 24.4%
        tar acids, 0.2% tar bases, and 16.9% pitch. </p>
      <p><a name="tarcr"></a><b>Tar Cracking ~</b> </p>
      <p>Dalton (154) apparently made the first investigation of the
        pyrogenic
        decomposition of hydrocarbons, but no systematic effort was made
        to
        study
        this phenomenon until Berthelot (155, 156, 157) published the
        results
        of
        his researches, in which he found that methane, ethane, and
        ethylene
        decomposed
        into acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The polymerization of
        acetylene
        to form aromatic hydrocarbons has been discussed in Chapter I
        under the
        subject of chemistry. </p>
      <p>According to Williams-Gardner (158), the views of Berthelot,
        that
        acetylene
        plays an important part in the formation of cyclic compounds,
        are
        obsolete
        and the mechanism of the formation of aromatics must be modified
        to
        include
        either the momentary existence of unsaturated residuums, which
        may by
        transformed
        by polymerization, or broken down into carbon and hydrogen, or
        else the
        direct formation of olefins and methane, with or without the
        liberation
        of hydrogen and without the necessity of forming acetylene. The
        opinion
        of Williams-Gardner is substantiated by his own experiments, by
        the
        work
        of Auschutz (159), who obtained aromatic compounds, ranging from
        benzene
        to anthracene, from Russian oil residuums by condensation of the
        complex
        hydrocarbons without elimination of hydrogen, and by Haber
        (160), who
        found
        that n-heptane decomposed between 600° C and 700° C to form
        methane
        and the next lowest olefin, that is, amylene, without the
        formation of
        acetylene. This is also in agreement with the results of Thorpe
        and
        Young
        (161), who distilled solid paraffins under pressure and obtained
        amylene,
        pentane, hexylene, hexane, heptylene, heptane, octylene, octane,
        nonylene,
        nonane, undecylene, and undecane, all boiling below 200° C. The
        latter
        experimenters concluded, with others, that the decomposition
        gives rise
        to olefin and lower paraffins with or without the evolution of
        hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Jones (162) observed, from his study of the influence of
        temperature
        in cracking low temperature tars, that the mechanism of the
        napthalenes,
        paraffins, and unsaturated hydrocarbons to form olefins, which
        condense
        at higher temperatures to form aromatic compounds. He found the
        proportion
        of higher olefins, which appear in the gas from cracking,
        reached a
        maximum
        at 350° C and almost disappeared at 750° C. At the latter
        temperature,
        naphthalene appeared in the gas and shortly afterwards there was
        a
        rapid
        increase in hydrogen evolution. </p>
      <p>The effect of heat on the various constituents of primary tar
        was
        studied
        by Fischer (49), who concluded that the amount of phenol and its
        lower
        homologues, initially present in the tar, is augmented by
        decomposition
        of the higher members of the series at temperatures below 700°
        C,
        aromatic
        hydrocarbons of the benzene series being formed from the phenols
        above
        700° C. According to Parrish (117) also, below 700° C the
        effect
        of heat upon primary tar is to cause decomposition of the higher
        boiling
        constituents into lower boiling compounds of a similar type. The
        higher
        phenols in particular are sensitive to this cracking effect. In
        general,
        the higher the temperature, the greater is the proportion of
        lower
        members
        of a given series of compounds. Decomposition becomes more
        radical
        above
        700° C, producing aromatic compounds, especially benzene,
        naphthalene,
        anthracene, phenol, and pyridine. Most of the higher phenols are
        entirely
        cracked into phenol, cresols, and xylenols. The tar bases also
        decompose
        to form pyridine and quinoline together with their homologues
        and
        derivatives. </p>

      <p>The light and middle oils reported in Table 70 as fractionated
        from
        Pennsylvania low temperature tar by Davis and Parry (97) were
        vaporized
        in a retort and passed through a cracking chamber which was
        heated to
        various
        temperatures at atmospheric pressure. The raw stock constituted
        the
        neutral
        fraction from 175° C to 275° C. Table 66 shows the amount of
        motor
        spirit obtained from the cracked distillate and scrubbed from
        the
        cracked
        gas. A maximum yield of hydrocarbons boiling below 175° C was
        obtained
        from the neutral oil at a cracking temperature of 750° C. the
        refining
        loss, due to the presence of unsaturated material and tar acids
        in the
        fraction, amounted to 56%. Analysis of the fraction showed the
        presence
        of aromatic hydrocarbons, principally in the form of benzene. </p>
      <p>The curves in Figure 29, after Davis and Parry (97), shows that
        the
        amount of oil recovered after cracking is almost exactly
        inversely
        proportional
        to the temperature and that the yield of light oil and gas
        increased
        with
        temperature rise, but at a decreasing rate. Comparison of Table
        66 and
        Figure 29 points out that, although the percentage of motor
        spirit
        contained
        in the cracked oil reaches a maximum at 750° C, the yield of
        motor
        spirit in the gas has no such maximum, but continues to increase
        with
        the
        temperature. </p>

        Table
        70 was subjected to similar cracking reactions at 800° C and
        atmospheric
        pressure, about 50% of the cracked oil was recovered, yielding
        per net
        ton of coal 0.12 gallons of crude light oil boiling below 175°
        C.
        This
        was no increase from that obtained in the Hempel distillation of
        the
        anthracene
        oil before cracking, so that in cuts up to 200° C, at least, it
        may
        be said that little secondary decomposition took place in the
        anthracene
        oil fraction. About 47 cu ft of gas per gallon were evolved
        during the
        heating at 800° C and this yielded upon scrubbing 2.2% of the
        fraction,
        or 0.09 gallons of crude light oil per net ton of coal. </p>
      <p>Curtis and Beekhuis (163) conducted a number of cracking tests
        on
        the
        neutral oil of low temperature tar from the McIntire process and
        made
        from
        West Virginia coal containing 3% moisture, 36% volatile, 50%
        fixed
        carbon,
        and 10.5% ash. The coal was carbonized at 620° C. Pressures
        varying
        from 100 pounds to 500 pounds per square inch were used inc
        racking.
        They
        found that decomposition was slow below 400° C, but that above
        450°
        C the formation of coke, accompanied by high gas yield, was
        rapid.
        Within
        the range of their observations, the effect of pressure
        variation of
        the
        rapidity and character of the cracking was slight. By cracking
        the
        kerosene
        fraction of the neutral oil, they found that the yield of oil
        boiling
        below
        210° C could be increased from 20% of the neutral oil initially
        present
        to about 35%. </p>
      <p>Morrel and Egloff (164) cracked a typical low temperature tar
        from
        a
        West Virginia bituminous coal, which yielded about 25 gallons of
        crude
        tar per net ton. The crude tar, with a specific gravity of
        1.074, was
        cracked
        at 100 pounds per square inch pressure and 452° C temperature to
        yield
        40% cracked distillate with 0.8927 sp gr. The gasoline
        fractionated
        from
        the cracked distillate amounted to 18.1% of the initial crude
        tar, and
        had a specific gravity of 0.8299. The straight distillate from
        this low
        temperature tar analyzed 26.4% tar acids, 3.3% tar bases, 44.3%
        unsaturated
        hydrocarbons, 9.5% aromatic hydrocarbons, and 16.4% napthenes
        and
        paraffin
        hydrocarbons, while the cracked distillate from the straight
        distillate
        contained 21.3% tar acids, 4.3% tar bases, 27% unsaturated
        hydrocarbons,
        20.3% aromatic hydrocarbons, and 27.3% napthalenes and paraffin
        hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>The neutral oil from this same low temperature tar, having a
        specific
        gravity of 0.9484, when cracked at 175 pounds per square inch
        and
        427°
        C, yielded 50% cracked distillate of 0.8514 sp gr, which
        fractionated
        to
        give 31.9% of the initial crude tar as gasoline of 0.8090 sp gr.
        Analysis
        of the neutral oil before cracking showed it to be composed of
        2.7% tar
        acids, 4.5% tar bases, 60.6% unsaturated hydrocarbons, 9.4%
        aromatic
        hydrocarbons,
        and 22.8% napthene and paraffin hydrocarbons, while the cracked
        distillate
        analyzed 4.8%, 4.8% tar bases, 38.4% unsaturated hydrocarbons,
        19.4%
        aromatic
        hydrocarbons, and 32.7% napthalenes and paraffin hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>These data show a decided decrease upon cracking in the
        unsaturated
        compounds and a small increase in the aromatic hydrocarbons. The
        tar
        acids
        in the cracked distillate appear to be mainly cresols. No
        naphthalene
        was
        present, either in the initial crude tar or in the cracked
        distillate.
        While only a trace of anthracene was found in the original low
        temperature
        tar, considerable quantities were found after cracking. This was
        thought
        remarkable inasmuch as the temperature of cracking was only 452°
        C,
        whereas anthracene heretofore had been regarded as a high
        temperature
        product. </p>
      <p>Egloff and Morell (165) also cracked the low temperature tar
        from
        an
        Ohio-Indiana bituminous coal at 100 pounds per square inch and
        426°
        C. The crude tar has a specific gravity of 1.0794 and yielded
        upon
        fractionation
        29% neutral oil, 27.5% tar acids, and 1.6% bases. When cracked,
        this
        crude
        low temperature tar yielded 33.9% gasoline containing 35% tar
        acids, or
        an acid-free yield of 22% gasoline. The neutral oil from this
        same
        crude
        stock was cracked at 200 pounds per square inch and 455° C to
        yield
        over 50% high grade antiknock motor fuel. </p>
      <p>Shale oils from the USA, Australia, and France were cracked by
        Morrell
        and Egloff (166) under pressures ranging from 120 pounds per
        square
        inch
        and at temperatures ranging from 398° C to 433° C to produce
        over
        50% of the raw stock as gasoline. This cracked gasoline was
        declared to
        be a motor fuel of high antiknock value. The results of the
        cracking
        tests
        on shale oil are given in Table 67. </p>

      <p><a name="cracked"></a><b>Cracked Tar Gas ~</b> </p>
      <p>The fixed gas evolved during cracking is of an entirely
        different
        nature
        from the gas which is evolved during carbonization of the coal.
        The
        latter
        is the result of destructive distillation, or primary
        modification of
        the
        fuel constituents, while the former is the outcome of secondary
        decomposition
        induced through the medium of heat. An analytical study of the
        fixed
        gas
        from the neutral oil fraction from 175° C to 275° C at various
        cracking temperatures was made by Davis and Parry (97). This is
        the
        same
        oil fraction from Pennsylvania coal already referred to in Table
        66 and
        Figure 29, and which will be further discussed in Table 70.
        Analyses of
        the fixed gas which was evolved from cracking the neutral oil at
        various
        temperatures are given in Table 68. </p>
      <p>The permanent gas, obtained from cracking the anthracene oil
        fraction
        from 275° C to 350° C at 800° C was almost identical in
        composition
        with that liberated by the neutral oil when cracked at 820° C.
        The
        large percentage of hydrogen is indicative of much unsaturated
        material
        in the cracked oil and this was shown to be the case. The
        proportion of
        ethylene and of ethane decreased with rise in the cracking
        temperature,
        while the percentage of methane greatly increased. The small
        percentage
        of the oxides of carbon which was produced is worthy of notice,
        especially
        in comparison with the compositions of the gas from
        carbonization, as
        shown
        in Table 23 and in Figure 10. </p>
      <p>If low temperature neutral oil is essentially the same as
        petroleum
        gas oil, there is a possibility of finding a commercial outlet
        in that
        market. A great deal of information is thrown on that matter by
        an
        examination
        of the fixed gas obtained in the cracking of petroleum gas oil.
        Such an
        experiment has been conducted by Davis and Parry (97), the
        results of
        which
        are given in Table 69. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The gas, evolved in cracking petroleum gas oil, has about the
        same
        thermal
        value as that obtained from the low temperature tar neutral oil,
        but a
        somewhat larger quantity of gas is produced. Far less hydrogen
        and
        methane
        is evolved from the former, but a very large percentage of
        nitrogen. It
        might be said, in general, that the two oils are not greatly
        different
        and that low temperature tar neutral oil is comparable with the
        petroleum
        gas fraction. </p>
      <p><a name="hydrog"></a><b>Hydrogenation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Upon consideration of the facts hitherto presented, it appears
        that
        primary tar normally consists of alipathic hydrocarbons and
        phenolic
        compounds.
        Whatever small percentage of light aromatic compounds that is
        found to
        be present in the tar must be derived from reduction of these
        phenolic
        substances. This suggests the possibility of entirely reducing
        the tar
        acids to low-boiling oils for use as a motor fuel. This problem
        has
        been
        studied by Fischer (167) and by Fischer and Schroeder (168), who
        passed
        elementary hydrogen together with a mixture of phenols and
        hydrocarbons
        through a tube heated to 750° C. A great deal was found to
        depend
        upon
        the nature of the reaction tube, but they discovered that a
        tinned iron
        tube was suitable for commercial processing and avoided the
        excessive
        deposition
        of carbon that sometimes plugged the tube. The deposition of
        carbon was
        apparently accelerated by iron. However, if water gas was used
        as a
        source
        of hydrogen for hydrogenation, the tinned coating peeled away,
        as a
        result
        no doubt of the action of carbon monoxide in the gas. An iron
        reaction
        tube, coated internally with iron sulfide, was finally adopted
        by
        Fischer
        and Zerbe (169) to overcome this last difficulty. With the
        improved
        form
        of hydrogenating tube, little separation of carbon occurred and
        the
        phenols
        were reduced to benzene homologues. With cresols and xylenols,
        the
        conversion
        to motor fuel was up to 99% and 72%, respectively, of the
        theoretical. </p>
      <p>Whether or not hydrogenation at high pressures and high
        temperatures,
        according to the Bergius process (170, 171, 172), is applicable
        to low
        temperature tar acids has not yet been demonstrated. According
        to
        Fischer
        (173), at the temperature of 400° C, employed in such
        circumstances,
        hydrogenation could be successful only at hydrogen pressures
        exceeding
        the dissociation pressure of hydrogen in the compounds to be
        produced.
        At lower temperatures of 200° C, the reaction velocity would be
        entirely
        too slow. The introduction of a catalyst to accelerate the
        reaction
        rate
        at lower temperatures necessitates excessive and expensive
        purification
        of the reaction gases to eliminate sulfur and avoid poisoning
        the
        catalyst.
        Fischer and Schroeder (174) obtained the conversion of the
        phenolic
        portion
        of primary tar into oils under pressure at 400° C with nascent
        hydrogen
        derived from sodium formate and from carbon monoxide and steam.
      </p>
      <p>Sabatier and Senderens (175) showed that naphthalene vapor
        mixed
        with
        and excess of hydrogen could be passed over finely divided
        nickel at
        175°
        C to produce decahydronapthalene with a boiling point of 187° C,
        and
        at 200° C to from tetrahydronapthalene with a boiling point of
        205°
        C. Fischer (176, 177) obtained the partial liquefaction of
        naphthalene
        to the extent of 35% by treating it for about half an hour at
        150 lb/sq
        in pressure in the presence of aluminum chloride. From these
        experiments,
        it is apparent that naphthalene can be considered as a raw
        material for
        the manufacture of motor fuel. On account of the limited amount
        of
        naphthalene
        present in primary tar, however, it is doubtful if this process
        is
        important
        from the standpoint of low temperature carbonization, unless it
        be in
        the
        secondary treatment of cracked tar products. </p>
      <p>For the most part, cracked motor fuel contains a high
        proportion
        of
        unsaturated compounds which, according to present standards, are
        more
        or
        less undesirable, due principally to unpleasant odors and
        darkening of
        the distillate. The method of hydrogenation, developed by
        Bergius (172)
        and commonly known as berginization, in which the distillate is
        cracked
        at the required temperature under a high pressure of elementary
        hydrogen,
        largely overcomes this difficulty and yields a distillate
        containing
        only
        a small percentage of unsaturates. Figure 30, after Kling (178),
        shows
        the pressure developed in berginization and in cracking the same
        oil.
        It
        is obvious that, as the heating period is prolonged, the
        pressure of
        the
        cracked vapor becomes greater and greater. During berginization,
        however,
        there is a rapid increase of pressure during initial heating but
        finally,
        when equilibrium has been reached, the pressure decreases at
        constant
        temperature,
        thereby indicating hydrogenation. Berginization appears to
        require
        close
        pressure and temperature control, as indicated by the negative
        experiments
        of Waterman and Perquin (179), who were unable to effect
        hydrogenation
        of paraffin wax at 435° C and initial pressured of 600 psi, and
        of
        Skinner and Graham (180), who were unable to secure hydrogen
        absorption
        by low temperature tar obtained at 600° C from Fifeshire cannel
        coal
        and redistilled at 450° C, when the tar was treated under 1560
        psi
        hydrogen pressure at 411° C for 4 hours. Bergius used initial
        pressured
        of as much as 1500 psi which rose in some cases to above 3000
        psi when
        the autoclave was heated to the required temperature. </p>

      <p>Motor fuel is obtained directly from two sources in low
        temperature
        carbonization, the tar and the gas, and it can be obtained from
        three
        subordinate
        sources by special processing, such as cracking of the heavy tar
        fraction,
        hydrogenation of the tar acids, and liquefaction of the gas by
        high
        pressures
        and low temperatures. </p>
      <p>The entire fraction up to 200° C, when freed of the tar acids,
        bases,
        and unsaturated material, may be sued as an internal combustion
        engine
        fuel. This fraction consists mostly of higher paraffins,
        unsaturated
        hydrocarbons,
        and in some cases a small quantity of benzene and toluene. This
        cut may
        yield anywhere from one to 3 gallons of refined motor spirit per
        ton of
        coal. Davis and Parry (97), in their work on the low temperature
        carbonization
        of Pennsylvania coals paid special attention to the yield of
        products
        valuable
        as motor fuel. Using the tar obtained from retorting Freeport
        coal at
        550°
        C in a stationary vertical retort, they examined the light oil
        fraction
        obtained from the tar and the possibility of cracking the
        higher-boiling
        hydrocarbons. The fractionation of this tar is given in Table 70
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>The entire fraction boiling under 175° C was considered a
        crude
        light oil suitable as a motor fuel. It was found that 42% of
        this cut
        consisted
        of unsaturated hydrocarbons and 17% of tar acids, which must be
        removed
        in refinement before the oil could be sold to the trade. This
        means
        that
        the crude yield of 2.8 gallons must be reduced 59% to 1.15
        gallons of
        refined
        motor spirit obtained from this fraction. </p>
      <p>The recovery of light oils in the gas is not a simple process.
        It
        can
        be accomplished by condensation, scrubbing, or adsorption.
        Fischer and
        Gluud (181) recovered the motor spirit from the low temperature
        gas in
        their experiments by scrubbing with paraffin oil and subsequent
        rectification.
        They obtained a yield of 3.8 gallons to 2.0 gallons per net ton
        of coal
        carbonized, representing 1.23% and 0.67% of the coal,
        respectively. The
        Fuel Research Board (114) also carried out scrubbing experiments
        on the
        gas from low temperature carbonization in horizontal retorts, as
        shown
        in Table 71. They recovered 1.68 gallons of refined spirit per
        gross
        ton
        of coal. It has a specific gravity of 0.731 at 15° C. Dalton

        coal, which gave 3200 cu ft of gas at the temperature of
        distillation,
        was used in the work of the Fuel Research Board. The duration of
        the
        scrubbing,
        as well as the rte of washing, was varied in order to dtermine
        the
        influence
        of these factors on the quantity of light oil recovered. </p>

      <p>The refining loss of motor spirit, obtained from low
        temperature
        gas,
        is less than that occurring in the light fraction of the tar,
        Scrubbing
        greatly reduces the percentage of hydrocarbons present in the
        gas and
        it
        has been pointed out, notably in Figure 13 and elsewhere, that
        low
        temperature
        gas is in part characterized by a low proportion of unsaturated
        hydrocarbons.
        Consequently, it is anticipated that there should be a low
        refining
        loss
        in the light oils scrubbed from the gas. The rate of scrubbing
        with
        wash
        oil does not appear to have as great an effect on the amount of
        spirit
        recovered as the quantity of wash oil used per cubic foot of gas
        scrubbed. </p>
      <p>Engelhardt (182) investigated the recovery of light oil from
        illuminating
        gas by activated charcoal, the condensed vapors being
        subsequently
        liberated
        by treatment with superheated steam. This same process was used
        by
        Davis
        and Parry (97) in the recovery of light oils from the gas
        evolved in
        the
        low temperature carbonization of Pennsylvania coals. They found
        that
        the
        efficiency of the charcoal was greatly reduced in the presence
        of
        hydrogen
        sulfide and water vapor. Thus, while up to 3 gallons of crude
        light oil
        per net ton of coal were recovered in ordinary distillation,
        only one
        gallon
        was obtained under steam distillation. By this method they
        recovered an
        average of 2.75 gallons of crude motor spirit per net ton of
        coal from
        6 different coals. This light oil had a specific gravity of
        0.740 and
        represented
        0.838% of the coal charged. It contained 23% unsaturated
        hydrocarbons,
        so that the net yield of refined spirit was reduced to 2.23
        gallons. A
        recent development utilizing this same principle of adsorption
        has been
        the introduction of silica gel in place of activated charcoal. </p>
      <p>Table 72 shows the yield of light oils reported by a number of
        different
        investigators in low temperature carbonization. All of these
        experiments
        were made in externally heated retorts, except those of Gluud
        (23) and
        a few runs by Parr and Olin (37), in which cases internal
        heating was
        used.
        Lewis (17) used a gas coal; Runge (183) used a by-product coal;
        Parr
        and
        Olin (37) used Illinois coal; Davis and Berger (184) used
        Freeport
        coal;
        Morgan and Soule (48) used Pittsburgh Terminal coal; Davis and
        Parry
        (97)
        used coal from the Freeport bed; and the Fuel Research Board
        (114) used
        Dalton Main #2. Attention must be called to the fact that the
        yields in
        Table 72 are crude light oil and large reductions occur in
        refining, as
        has been pointed out, so that the yield of refined motor spirit
        will be
        considerably less. It is interesting to note the wide variation
        in the
        yields reported and caution must be sounded that some observers
        report
        their tar yields before hydrogenation and their crude tar yields
        are
        swelled
        by moisture content. The high yields of Parr and Olin, and also
        of
        Gluud,
        are due in part to the fact that they included higher boiling
        hydrocarbons
        in their light oil fraction. The figure given by Davis and Parry
        includes
        the light oil obtained from both the tar and the gas. </p>
      <p>The explosive range of low temperature motor spirit is over 20%
        greater
        than that of petrol, while a mixture of equal parts of motor
        spirit and
        petrol has an explosive range 30% greater than petrol alone and
        35%
        greater
        than benzol, according to the Fuel Research Board (114). The
        explosive
        range, expressed as cubic centimeters per cubic foot of air at
        15°
        C, was 2.7 to 6.7 for benzol of 0.881 sp gr; 2.5 to 7.3 for
        petrol of
        0.723
        sp gr; 2.3 to 9.5 for low temperature motor spirit of 0.731 sp
        gr; and
        2.5 to 10.5 for a mixture of equal parts of petrol and motor
        spirit. </p>
      <p>The motor spirit obtained from low temperature distillation of
        coal
        is miscible in all proportions with benzol and petrol for use as
        a fuel
        in internal combustion engines. With the growing use of alcohol
        in the
        field of motor fuels, something should be said concerning the
        miscibility
        of low temperature motor spirit with alcohol. The amount of low
        temperature
        motor spirit held in solution by alcohol depends largely upon
        the
        strength
        of the latter; thus at 10° C the Fuel Research Board (114) found
        95%
        alcohol held as much as 74.2% motor spirit in solution, while
        90%
        alcohol
        held but 16.3% and 85% alcohol retained only 7.1%. With a
        mixture of
        benzol
        and 95% alcohol, in equal proportions, low temperature motor
        spirit is
        dissolved up to 60% at 10° C. Even with refined spirit, there is
        a
        slight tendency for resinous matter to deposit on standing, thus
        darkening
        the fuel, but alcohol prevents deposit by dissolving the resins
        which
        separate. </p>
      <p>It has been pointed out that Davis and Parry (97) recovered
        1.15
        gallons
        per net ton of refined motor spirit from the light oil fraction
        of low
        temperature tar which they obtained from Pennsylvania coal and
        2.23
        gallons
        per net ton of refined motor fuel from the low temperature gas,
        netting
        3.38 gallons per net ton which were obtained directly without
        additional
        processing. It has also been pointed out that they obtained an
        additional
        0.66 gallons per net ton by cracking the higher-boiling tar
        fractions.
        We have already seen that other Pennsylvania coals yielded 5.45
        gallons
        per net ton of tar acids, 56.5% of which can be converted to
        motor fuel
        by hydrogenation at an efficiency of 72% to 99% of the
        theoretical
        maximum
        conversion, which ranges from 64% to 87% depending on the
        initial and
        final
        products. On this basis, an additional 1.5 gallons to 2.5
        gallons of
        motor
        fuel per net ton could be obtained. By employing these
        additional
        means,
        there appears the possibility of increasing the total motor fuel
        yield
        to 5.5 gallons or 7.5 gallons or even more per net ton of coal.
        The
        desirability
        of associating hydrogenation with low temperature carbonization,
        to
        effect
        an increase of motor fuel by hydrogenating the tar acids, has
        been
        stressed
        by Gentry (185), but Egloff and Morrell (165) see no reason at
        all why
        the tar acids should be removed from the motor fuel, as demanded
        by
        present
        standards. </p>
      <p><a name="fueloil"></a><b>Fuel Oil ~</b> </p>
      <p>Crude low temperature tar has a viscosity quite suitable for
        fuel
        oil,
        but according to Lander and McKay (186) its flash point is far
        too low.
        On the other hand, if sufficient low volatile constituents are
        removed
        by distillation to increase its flash point, the crude tar
        becomes too
        viscous for use as a motor fuel. However, the tar may be
        fractionated
        in
        such a way as to obtain a distillate which meets all the
        requirements
        of
        a fuel oil, both from the standpoints of flash point and of
        viscosity.
        Furthermore, there is no evident reason why the fuel oil, if too
        viscous,
        cannot be heated before firing to increase its fluidity. The
        immiscibility
        of low temperature tar with other fuel oils has already been
        dealt
        with. </p>
