      <p><a name="evol"></a><b>Evolution of Gas ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is worthwhile to examine the behavior of the lower types of
        carbonaceous
        fuels under destructive distillation as a preliminary to the
        discussion
        of the gaseous products evolved from coal under the influence of
        temperature.
        Bornstein (95) carefully examined the composition of gas evolved
        from
        distillation
        at various temperatures of a peat and a lignite, whose ash-free
        analyses
        approximated those shown in Table 2, and a wood whose ultimate
        analysis
        showed 4.8% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, 40.8% oxygen, 0.63% nitrogen,
        3.2%
        water,
        0.10% ash, and 0.08% sulfur. These data have been compiled in
        Table 13.
        It should be observed that, in the case of wood, hydrogen is
        rapidly
        evolved
        at comparatively low temperatures and, as a matter of fact, it
        will be
        shown that the temperature of hydrogen evolution progresses with
        the
        geologic
        aging of the fuel. The percentage of carbon dioxide increases
        steadily,
        at any given temperature, with the position of the fuel in
        historical
        reckoning. </p>
      <p>Lewes (17) carbonized bituminous coal at temperatures ranging
        from
        400°
        C to 900° C and measured the volume of gas liberated at the
        respective
        temperatures. He found that the volume of gas liberated
        increased
        approximately
        1,200 cubic feet per gross ton of coal for each 100° C rise in
        temperature
        throughout the range. A glance at Table 14 will show that,
        within the
        temperature
        interval 400° C to 900° C, the volume of gas liberated
        increases
        over 100% from the lower to the higher temperature. At the same
        time,
        the
        percentage composition of the gas undergoes a considerable
        change. The
        percentage of saturated and of unsaturated hydrocarbons each
        decreases
        about half. The amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the gas is
        small,
        compared to the other constituents. </p>

      <p>Studies of the gas obtained in the destructive distillation of
        coals
        found in the United States have been made by a number of
        experimenters.
        Particular mention should be made of the work of Porter and
        Ovitz (96),
        who used coals from Pennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia, and
        Wyoming;
        Davis and Parry 97) who examined coal from Pittsburgh and Upper
        Kittanning
        beds of Pennsylvania; and Taylor and Porter (98), who
        investigated the
        coals of Pennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
        Representative
        analysis of the coals studied are given in Table 15 and Table
        16.
        Comparison
        of these data with Table 1 and Table 2 seems to classify the
        West
        Virginia
        and Virginia coals as semi-bituminous, and the Illinois, Utah
        and
        Wyoming
        coals as sub-bituminous. </p>

      <p>Tables 17, 18 and 19 give the quantity of gas evolved and its
        composition
        at three different temperatures of distillation for Virginia,
        West
        Virginia
        and Wyoming coals, respectively. In these three tables the
        Virginia
        coal
        is the oldest coal, the Wyoming coal the youngest, while the
        West
        Virginia
        coal occupies an intervening position historically. As a matter
        of
        fact,
        we shall see later that the geologic age of the coal has a
        direct
        bearing
        on the composition of the gas yielded at a given temperature. </p>
      <p>Porter and Ovitz made a careful determination of the gas
        evolved
        at
        different temperatures with Pennsylvania and Illinois coals. The
        results
        of their determinations are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11. It
        is
        plain
        from an examination of these diagrams that below 500° C there is
        practically
        no decomposition of the hydrocarbons, as evidenced by the
        absence of
        hydrogen,
        except for insignificant quantities. After a temperature of 600°
        C
        is reached, however, the decomposition of the hydrocarbons
        becomes
        exceedingly
        great. </p>

      <p>Giles and Vilbrandt (99) made a study of the gas distilled from
        Farmville,
        NC, coal at somewhat lower temperatures, the results of which
        are shown
        in Figure 12. This particular coal has the reputation of
        producing
        excessive
        smoke and of disintegrating when exposed to the atmosphere.
        These
        characteristics
        give disfavor to this fuel for domestic and industrial purposes.
        Reference
        to the illustration shows the large quantities of oxygen and
        nitrogen
        driven
        off in the initial stages of heating which, together with the
        small
        quantity
        of hydrocarbons evolved, demonstrates the reason for the ease
        with
        which
        which this coal disintegrates. From 200° C to 650° C, the
        proportion
        of ethane formed from this coal remains about constant. The
        formation
        of
        heavy hydrocarbons reaches a maximum at the very low temperature
        of
        300°
        C, after which their formation gradually decreases to a second
        critical
        point just below 600° C, thereafter only a fraction of a percent
        being
        produced. Ti is an interesting fact that no hydrogen was formed
        up to
        600°
        C, which shows that the volatile products were educed in their
        primary
        condition. It is to be expected, however, from the drop in the
        hydrocarbon
        curve at 600° C, that from that temperature onward hydrogen will
        be
        produced in quantities. Any decomposition of the heavy
        hydrocarbons
        below
        660° C in this case evidently goes to form methane, for the
        percentage
        of this constituent of the gas has a striking inverse
        relationship to
        that
        of the heavy hydrocarbons. Although not shown in the
        illustration,
        carbon
        monoxide to the extent of 0.40% appeared at 420° C and remained
        constant
        throughout, while carbon dioxide to the extent of 0.65% appeared
        at
        300°
        C and gradually increased in amount to 1.55% at 660° C. Ethylene
        and
        other unsaturated hydrocarbons, amounting to 0.74%, were
        produced at
        200°
        C, but gradually decreased to 0.12% at 660° C. At 360° C the
        specific
        gravity of the total gas referred to air was 1.167, as compared
        with
        0.952
        specific gravity at 600° C. The laboratory gas yields of Porter
        and
        Ovitz and of Giles and Vilbrandt, as a function of the
        carbonization
        temperature,
        have been computed to a gross tonnage basis in Table 20. </p>
      <p>Monett (100) examined 17 Utah coals under maximum carbonization
        temperatures
        of 1000° F, 12 of which were deemed worthy of further study. The
        average
        composition of the gas from these coals was: 6.7% carbon
        dioxide, 7.6%
        carbon monoxide, 28.8% hydrogen, 2.7 nitrogen, 39.6 methane,
        7.1%
        ethane,
        and 6.7 illuminants. This agrees with the results of Parr and
        Layng
        (101),
        who also used Utah coals at maximum distillation temperatures of
        1450°
        F and obtained a gas composition of 8.3% carbon dioxide, 8.9%
        carbon
        monoxide,
        37.6% hydrogen, 3.9% nitrogen, 30.7% methane, 5.1% ethane, and
        4.8%
        illuminants. </p>

      </center>
      <p>These data can be correlated to show the variation of the
        composition
        of low temperature gas with the age of the coal. While no
        definite
        facts
        are available, it has been pointed out that probably Virginia
        coal is
        the
        oldest and Wyoming the youngest of the 5 coals examined. Table
        21 gives
        the comparative analyses of the gas obtained from the retort at
        700°
        C. It is plainly evident that there is little change in the
        volume of
        gas
        evolved, that the percentage of the oxides of carbon contained
        in the
        gas
        greatly increases in the younger coals and that there is a
        corresponding
        decrease in the proportion of hydrocarbons and hydrogen
        liberated from
        the less consolidated fuels. The illuminants remain about
        constants.
        They
        consist of heavy hydrocarbons, which deposit soot at the
        temperature of
        the flame, thus providing minute incandescent particles which
        give
        illuminating
        properties to the flame. </p>
      <p><a name="brit"></a><b>British Coals ~</b> </p>
      <p>Burgess and Wheeler (57) carried on an extensive investigation
        of
        Welsh
        coals to determine their behavior throughout the temperature
        range from
        450° C to 100° C. The average ultimate analysis of the coals
        used
        in their experiments was as follows: 89.9% carbon, 4.7%
        hydrogen, 5.1%
        oxygen, 1.6% nitrogen, 1.4% sulfur, and 5.14% ash. Comparison
        with
        Table
        2 shows that these coals have an ultimate analysis almost
        identical
        with
        that of the semi-bituminous coals of the United States. </p>
      <p>In 2-hour distillation experiments, they observed that the
        percentage
        of total gas evolved during the first 10 minutes increased
        rapidly with
        the temperature. Thus, at 600° C, 59.7% of the total gas
        produced
        in
        2 hours was educed in 10 minutes; 64.6% at 700° C; 75.1% at
        800°
        C; 88.9% at 900° C; 94.4% at 1000° C; and 94.3% at 1100° C.
        the commercial application of low temperature carbonization is
        confronted
        with an obstacle of first importance in the shape of retorting
        period,
        due to the low thermal conductivity of coal. The difference
        between the
        maximum and the minimum yields of various coals, examined by
        Burgess
        and
        Wheeler (57) is as much as 300% up to 700° C, after which the
        two
        values
        approach equality until at 1100° C the difference is les than
        20%.
        Table 22 shows the range of yields obtained at various
        temperatures in
        the course of their experiments. </p>

      <p>Burgess and Wheeler (57, 102, 103) also made a careful study of
        the
        rate of gaseous evolution and of gaseous compositions as a
        function of
        the temperature of carbonization, with Altofts Silkstone coal,
        the
        results
        of which are shown in Tables 23 and 24. These are very
        interesting
        data.
        It should be noted that there is an initial large evolution of
        carbon
        dioxide,
        but that this constituent decreases as the temperature rises. At
        the
        same
        time, the percentage of carbon monoxide increases. It will be
        pointed
        out
        later that this is probably caused by the reduction of the
        dioxide to
        the
        monoxide at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. This
        same coal
        was distilled under reduced pressure and the gas collected in
        vacuo
        with
        the results shown in Table 24. </p>
      <p>Carbonization in vacuo completely alters the character of the
        gas.
        The
        volume of gas evolved increases enormously above 300° C, at
        which
        temperature
        both the oxides of carbon reach their maximum proportions. In
        contrast
        to normal pressure distillation, small quantities of oxygen,
        probably
        occluded,
        are liberated. The gas obtained in vacuo has about the same
        hydrogen
        content
        at 400° C as normal pressure low temperature gas has at 700° C.
        Burgess and Wheeler (104) studied the decomposition of
        Lancashire coal
        under heat and vacuum. Table 25 shows that the results of their
        investigation
        on this fuel agree with the findings of Table 24. <br>

      </center>
      <p>The succession of events, as the temperature of the coal is
        advances
        during exhaustion, can be grouped into 5 stages. First, occluded
        gases,
        which cannot be removed under atmospheric conditions, are driven
        off up
        to about 150° C. These gases are largely paraffin hydrocarbons,
        principally
        belonging to the higher series. Second, a copious evolution of
        water
        appears
        at about 200° C and continues up to 450° C. this is evidently
        water
        of constitution and its evolution is accompanied with the
        formation of
        a large percentage of the oxides of carbon. Third, between 200°
        C
        and
        300° C, organic sulfur compounds begin to decompose, as is
        manifest
        by the appearance of hydrogen sulfide. The hydrogen sulfide
        begins at
        about
        270° C and practically ceases at 300° C. Within this stage,
        higher
        olefins begin to appear in the volatile products, but their
        evolution
        does
        not fall off until 350° C has been reached. Fourth, at 310° C,
        a reddish-brown oil is driven off and thereafter liquids other
        than
        water
        are produced. As this evolution of oil is not accompanied by a
        marked
        evolution,
        apparently oil is not necessarily to be considered a
        decomposition of
        the
        coal conglomerate. Fifth, at about 350° C, there is a rapid
        evolution
        of gas, accompanied by the formation of viscid oil, indicating a
        major
        decomposition stage, after which chemical transformations
        increase
        rapidly
        with the temperature rise. </p>
      <p>It has been mentioned that the composition of the gas issuing
        from
        an
        internally heated retort is vastly different from that obtained
        in
        closed
        retort operation. Carbonization is effected in the Maclaurin
        retort by
        the sensible heat of producer gas. The gas obtained from a
        Maclaurin
        retort
        at 700° C by Burgess and Wheeler (105) and in an externally
        heated
        horizontal retort of the Fuel Research Board (114) at 600° C are
        compared
        in Table 26. The samples were taken from large-scale apparatus.
        The
        vast
        difference in the volume and calorific value of the gas obtained
        in the
        two processes is seen at once. The nitrogen and carbon monoxide
        are
        enormously
        increased by partial gasification, the former coming from the
        atmosphere
        and the latter from combustion of carbon in the manufacture of
        the
        producer
        gas. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The gas from low temperature coking can be passed through
        scrubbers
        and washed with certain solvents to extract the light oils,
        which may
        then
        be combined with the low-boiling cut from the tar fractionation
        to
        increase
        the yield of motor spirit. Scubbing with creosote oil removes
        certain
        of
        the hydrocarbons so that after washing, a low temperature coal
        gas
        contains
        about 4% carbon dioxide, 8% carbon monoxide, 35% nitrogen, 46%
        methane,
        and 4% other hydrocarbons. Unfortunately, no data are available
        on the
        composition of this particular gas before scrubbing, so that the
        conclusions
        drawn must be limited. By comparison, however, with the 700° C
        in
        Table
        23, it will be seen that the amount of saturated and unsaturated
        higher
        hydrocarbons has been greatly reduced by the treatment. </p>
      <p><a name="peat"></a><b>Peat &amp; Lignite ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board (106) conducted a series of experiments
        on
        the
        winning of peat by carbonization in standard vertical retorts
        with the
        introduction of about 6% steam. This work was carried on at
        moderate
        temperatures
        of about 900° C in the heating flues, which for these retorts
        approximated
        low temperature conditions within the charge. The sample of peat
        tested
        had an ultimate analysis approximating that shown in table 2,
        but it
        had
        been air-dried to a moisture content of about 20%. The volatile
        matter
        present amounted to 49.5%, with 26.8% fixed carbon and 3.4% ash.
        As
        charged,
        the peat had a heating value of about 7,675 BTU/pound. The yield
        of
        products
        shown in Table 27 was obtained. The peat gas was very dense,
        owing to
        its
        high carbon dioxide content, but despite this, it burned with a
        satisfactory
        flame of slight luminosity. It was difficult to obtain scrub
        light oil
        from this gas because of the large amount of carbon dioxide
        present. </p>

      <p>Trenkler (107) has reported some tests by Muller on the coking
        of
        German
        brown coals at or below 500° C, which are reproduced in Table 28
        to
        give some idea of the results to be expected from treatment of
        this
        class
        of fuel. A further consideration of brown coals will be given
        under the
        name of certain processes particularly designed for this
        purpose. </p>
      <p>Benson and Canfield (108) investigated the possibility of
        winning
        Newcastle
        lignite, from the state of Washington, by low temperature
        distillation.
        This material, although of sufficient size for fuel, is
        generally
        considered
        too dirty to be worked. It contains about 12% moisture, 37%
        volatile
        matter,
        41% fixed carbon, 10% ash, 1.4% nitrogen, and 0.34% sulfur. It
        has a
        calorific
        value of about 10,400 BTU/pound. The yield and composition of
        gas
        obtained
        from this lignite when distilled at various temperatures is
        shown in
        Table
        29. The decomposition of the lignite became marked between 300°
        C
        and
        400° C, as indicated by a large increase in the production of
        gas
        as
        well as by an increase in the proportion of hydrogen present
        within
        this
        temperature range. </p>
      <p>The American lignites differ greatly from German brown coals in
        that
        it is impossible to form a stable and satisfactory briquette
        from them
        by the simple procedure of drying and pressing into shape under
        heat
        and
        pressure. The reason for this is that the former contains
        insufficient
        binder to consolidate and waterproof the mass. On the other
        hand,
        lignite
        char, when briquetted, forms quite a satisfactory fuel and, if
        by-products
        can be recovered from its carbonization, the cost of its
        production may
        be materially lessened. Further results of experience in the
        carbonization
        of lignite and other low-grade fuels will be given in connection
        with
        the
        discussion of the various processes with which experiments have
        been
        conducted
        and reported. </p>

      <p><a name="shale"></a><b>Shale ~</b> </p>
      <p>The distillation of oil shale has been carried on for many
        years
        in
        Scotland and in France, but the two industries are of
        independent
        origin.
        James Young, according to Redwood (109), while engaged in oil
        refining
        seems to have conceived the idea that oil originated from coal
        by
        distillation,
        due to subterranean heat. Young (110) tested a number of
        low-grade
        fuels,
        which resulted in the patent on his first oil shale retort.
        Since that
        time, the industry has become well established in Scotland,
        although
        the
        financial status of the many companies engaged in this
        enterprise did
        not
        generally become satisfactory until 1900. In 1919, however,
        changing
        economic
        conditions practically caused a shutdown of the Scottish shale
        oil
        plants,
        but some recovery has since taken place. </p>
      <p>Naturally, the yield and composition of shale gas depends upon
        the
        composition
        of the shale and the conditions of retorting. Gas is evolved
        long
        before
        the first indications of oil appear and it continues for a long
        time
        after
        the eduction of oil ceases. However, the evolution of gas drops
        off
        rapidly
        after oil is no longer produced. According to Mills (111),
        Scottish
        shales
        have an average ultimate analysis of 25.3% carbon, 3.7%
        hydrogen, 5.7%
        oxygen, 1.1% nitrogen, 0.5% sulfur, and 63.8% ash. Most American
        oil
        shales
        contain from 1.5% to 6% hydrogen sulfide, the greater part of
        which is
        evolved in the early stages of distillation. Garvin (112) has
        reported
        the composition of shale gas from Scottish and American
        practice. The
        gases
        in Table 30 from the Colorado and Utah shales were obtained
        under
        conditions
        of dry distillation, whereas that from the Scottish shale was
        obtained
        from steaming the retorts. It will be observed later that the
        admission
        of steam during carbonization introduces several desirable
        complications
        into the process, among which is a partial formation of water
        gas,
        thereby
        accounting for the production of a large quantity of low thermal
        value
        gas. </p>
      <p>Finley and Bauer (113), in distilling some American oil shales
        at
        1000°
        F, found considerable effect in the analysis of the gas caused
        by
        oxidation
        of the shale before carbonization. It will be seen in table 31
        that
        pre-oxidation
        reduced the oil output 55%, increased the amount of carbon
        dioxide in
        the
        gas 120%, and decreased the amount of hydrogen 37%, as well a
        causing
        an
        increase in the proportion of methane and a decrease in the
        proportion
        of ethane and illuminants. </p>

      <p><a name="time"></a><b>Time Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>In any industrial process, the time required for the necessary
        operations
        is of primary importance. The overhead charges demand the
        maximum
        output
        per unit of investment and this can be attained only through
        reduction
        of the time interval between raw material and finished product.
        In
        their
        work on the volatile products of coal carbonization, Taylor and
        Porter
        (98) made some important observations on the yield and
        composition of
        low
        temperature gas, as a function of the time of distillation.
        Tables 32
        and
        33 and Figures 13 and 14 have been compiled and plotted from
        their
        data,
        converted for convenience to units per gross ton of coal. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Table 32 admirably illustrates what a large part of the gas is
        composed
        of saturated hydrocarbons, a compared with the other
        constituents. The
        yields of the oxides of carbon, of hydrogen, and of hydrogen
        sulfide
        are
        not greatly increased beyond 25 hours of carbonization at 350° C
        with
        Pennsylvania coal. The unsaturated hydrocarbons increase but
        little
        beyond
        the 50 hour period, but the saturated compounds continue to be
        evolved
        in large quantities, although at a constantly decreasing rate,
        even to
        beyond 10 days. </p>
      <p>The results with Wyoming coal are shown in Figure 13.
        Contrasted
        with
        the harder Pennsylvania coal, we find that carbon dioxide has
        moved
        from
        one of the minor to the chief constituent of the gas, and that
        carbon
        monoxide
        too has become a major constituent. With Wyoming coal, heated at
        350°
        C over a long period, the amount of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide,
        and
        unsaturated
        hydrocarbons evolved increases only slightly beyond 25 hours of
        retorting.
        Hydrogen has a steady increase, but even after 10 days remains
        the
        smallest
        proportion of the gas. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="13fig.gif" height="351" width="431"></p>

      </center>
      <p>Even after prolonged heating of 240 hours at 350° C, the
        entire
        volatile matter of coal is not removed. Subsequent treatment of
        the
        residuum
        at higher temperatures will yield further and even more
        voluminous
        products.
        The residuum from Pennsylvania coal, discussed in Table 32, was
        submitted
        to such an experiment and the composition of the gas is
        indicated in
        Table
        33. By comparison of the two tables, it is seen that the yield
        of
        hydrogen
        becomes second in importance when the coke is subsequently
        heated at
        450°
        C, after preliminary carbonization at 350° C. the saturated
        hydrocarbons
        are still the major components of the gas, while the other
        constituents
        remain of minor importance as before. </p>
      <p>Figure 14 shows the total gas evolved from Pennsylvania and
        Wyoming
        coals and from the residuum of Pennsylvania coal, previously
        heated for
        240 hours at 350° C. It will be seen that almost 500% more gas
        is
        evolved
        from the coke residuum than from the original coal, when the
        temperature
        is advanced but 100° C. </p>

      </center>
      <p>During the first few hours after charging in coke ovens
        operating
        at
        1000° C, the gas evolved approximates the composition of low
        temperature
        gas. The layers of coal a short distance from the retort wall do
        not
        reach
        the higher temperatures until the lapse of considerable time.
        The
        illustration
        in Figure 15 shows the change in composition of the gas from an
        Otto
        coke
        oven operating at 1000° C as a function of the time after
        charging
        (89). </p>
      <p>Examination of Figure 15 makes it evident that, during the
        first 2
        or
        3 hours after charging, the gas has all the characteristics of
        the low
        temperature product, that is, high calorific value, exceeding
        800
        BTU/cu
        ft; high percentage of saturated hydrocarbons, represented in
        this case
        by methane; relatively low hydrogen content; and minor
        percentages of
        carbon
        monoxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons. As the period of
        carbonization
        is
        extended, the interior of the mass of coal reaches the higher
        temperature
        and the composition of the gas alters accordingly. Finally,
        after 20
        hours
        of retorting, the thermal value of the gas falls to about 400
        BTU/cu ft
        and hydrogen becomes the main constituent. As the time proceeds
        and the
        average temperature rises, the percentage of carbon monoxide
        remains
        about
        constant, while the proportions of both the saturated and
        unsaturated
        hydrocarbons
        constantly decrease. The unsaturated compounds are represented
        mainly
        by
        ethylene. It is interesting to note, in the illustration, the
        parallelism
        existing between the percentage of methane present and the
        thermal
        value
        of the gas. This is easily understood when it is recalled that
        the
        calorific
        value of methane at constant pressure is 1072 BTU/cu ft, while
        that of
        hydrogen is but 347 BTU/cu ft, so that the resultant heat value
        of the
        has is largely dependent on the percentage of saturated
        hydrocarbons
        present. </p>
      <p>No data are available on the initial gas evolution and the
        temperature
        adjustments when raw coal is introduced to a heated retort, but
        Taylor
        and Porter (98) have made experiments on small quantities of
        Pennsylvania
        coal plunged into a tube heated to 1000° C. The curves of Figure
        16
        show how the coal absorbs heat from the walls of the retort with
        a
        corresponding
        reduction in their temperature. As the charge absorbs heat, the
        wall
        temperature
        falls until at the end of about 30 seconds the layer of coal
        next to
        the
        wall has reached the equilibrium temperature, then the whole
        mass
        gradually
        absorbs heat and rises in temperature. Over 30% of the volatile
        matter
        was evolved during the first 30 seconds of heating and
        thereafter the
        increase
        in gaseous evolution was comparatively slow. </p>

      <p>The Fuel Research Board (114) has investigated the effect of
        the
        time
        element in the low temperature carbonization of 5 British coals
        in
        horizontal
        retorts. These experiments were conducted on a large scale at
        600°
        C. The average results are represented graphically in Figure 17.
        The
        initial
        evolution of gas during the first 40 minutes, as shown in the
        illustration,
        consisted mostly of carbon dioxide and some air expansion. After
        reaching
        a minimum, the rate of gas evolution attained a maximum after
        about 2
        hours
        of retorting. At this point, the charge yielded gas at the rate
        of over
        1.1 cu ft/minute/100 lb of coal. Thereafter, the rate of
        evolution
        gradually
        fell to less than 0.20 cu ft/minute/100 lb after 5 hours of
        carbonization.
        The calorific value of the gas had a rapid rise to a maximum of
        1200
        BTU/cu
        ft slightly before the rate of evolution reached its highest
        point. It
        then fell rapidly and flattened out after 3 hours at a thermal
        value
        above
        600 BTU/cu ft. </p>
      <p>Taylor and Porter (98) found that the rapidity with which the
        coal
        is
        heated has little effect upon the composition of the gaseous
        products,
        when the gas evolved is immediately removed from the
        carbonization
        chamber.
        When Pennsylvania coal was carbonized at a maximum temperature
        of
        1050°
        C over a period of 270 minutes and compared with another sample
        brought
        to the same temperature in 6.5 minutes, it was found that the
        only
        appreciable
        change in the composition of the gas was a slight increase in
        the
        percentage
        of hydrocarbons present and a corresponding decrease in the
        proportion
        of hydrogen. Thus, in the first case, the hydrocarbons made up
        21.3%
        and
        the hydrogen 69.1% of the gas, while in the second case, they
        composed
        26.7% and 63.1% respectively. The other components of the gas
        remained
        practically unchanged in their proportions. </p>
      <p><a name="vac"></a><b>Vacuum Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>The destructive distillation of US coals in vacuo at
        temperatures
        ranging
        from 250° C to about 1000° C, has also been investigated by
        Taylor
        and Porter (98). Due to the different periods of carbonization
        which
        they
        selected, no comparative data can be drawn, except for two
        temperatures,
        but these wills serve to show the effect of vacuum distillation
        at both
        high and low temperatures. The duration of carbonization was 6
        hours at
        600° C and one hour at 1050° C. We have already seen in Tables
        24 and 25 the effect of vacuum distillation on two British coals
        at
        somewhat
        lower temperatures. </p>
      <p>Table 34 affords another excellent example of the effect of the
        consolidation
        of the coal on the quality of the gas yielded, as pointed out in
        Table
        21. Like the Welsh coals, vacuum distillation of US coals
        increases the
        hydrogen content of the gas evolved and decreases the percentage
        of
        hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>A critical comparison of Tables 34 and 35 shows that increasing
        the
        temperature of distillation in vacuo of American coals from 600°
        C
        to 1050° C almost doubles the amount of hydrogen present in the
        gas
        and approximately decreases by half the proportion of saturated
        hydrocarbons
        present. Very little change in the amount of unsaturated
        hydrocarbons
        and
        oxides of carbon was observed. </p>

      <p><a name="secdec"></a><b>Secondary Decomposition ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that the fundamental purpose of low temperature
        carbonization
        is to obtain primary decomposition products from coal and its
        related
        solid
        fuels. Superimposed upon this task is the equally difficult
        problem of
        preventing secondary decomposition of the volatile products
        after they
        have been educed from the charge, thus entirely defeating the
        purpose
        for
        which this special branch of destructive distillation was
        designed. If,
        after liberation, the volatile matter is allowed to become
        superheated
        or to come in contact with incandescent surfaces, secondary
        reactions
        set
        in and the composition of the products is changed accordingly.
        In
        continuing
        their research, Taylor and Pryor (98) made an investigation of
        this
        phenomenon.
        Table 36 gives some quantitative results obtained by
        superheating low
        temperature
        gas secured from the carbonization of Illinois coal at 450° C. </p>
      <p>Superheating tends to crack the heavier saturated hydrocarbons,
        with
        the formation of hydrogen and unsaturated compounds. Similar
        observations
        were made on Pennsylvania coal gas obtained at 475° C, except
        that
        the area of heated surface to which the gas was exposed was
        considerably
        altered. In the first case, the heated area was reduced in size
        and
        increased
        in temperature by passing the gas over a glowing wire and, in
        the
        second
        case, the area was increased by the presence of a column of
        broken
        firebrick.
        The catalytic effect of even small incandescent surfaces is
        really
        interesting.
        In Table 37 we see that the saturated hydrocarbons have been
        dehydrogenated,
        as evidenced by the decrease of the percentage of saturated
        compounds
        present
        and by an increase of almost 30% in the proportions of hydrogen
        and
        unsaturated
        hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>Table 38 shows that the temperature at which cracking manifests
        itself,
        in the case of Pennsylvania coal, is fully 150° C lower than in
        the
        case of Illinois coal, discussed in table 36. It is unlikely
        that this
        difference in cracking temperature arises from the nature of the
        coal
        carbonized,
        but it is probably the result of the increased catalytic surface
        presented
        by the brick column. This investigation was extended to the case
        of
        reduced
        pressure, both with and without the presence of broken brick. It
        was
        found
        that, with a pressure below 4 cm Hg, the cracking temperature
        rose from
        650° C to about 800° C in both cases, the only effect of the
        brick
        column being to increase the total volume of gas and the
        percentage of
        hydrogen. </p>

      <p><a name="gasatm"></a><b>Gaseous Atmospheres ~</b> </p>
      <p>The effect of various atmospheres on the modification of
        Illinois
        coal
        by low temperature distillation has been investigated by Parr
        and
        Francis
        (30). They carbonized coal in atmospheres of oxygen, nitrogen
        and
        steam,
        and studied the character of the coke and gas under these
        conditions.
        Table
        39 shows the result when Illinois coal was coked at various
        temperatures
        in an atmosphere of nitrogen. This table, as well as Table 40,
        has been
        computed to a nitrogen and oxygen-free basis. As may be
        expected, less
        carbon dioxide and more hydrogen was present in this case, than
        when an
        atmosphere of oxygen was used, as indicated by Table 40. The
        greatest
        effect
        on the composition of the gas evolved under nitrogenous
        atmospheres
        seems
        to be in the illuminants. The proportion of these heavy
        hydrocarbons
        was
        greatly increased, as may be seen by comparing Table 39 with
        Figure 11. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="39tab.gif" height="234" width="457"><br>
          <img src="40tab.gif" height="225" width="457"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Table 40 shows the effect of carbonizing Illinois coal for 4
        hours
        in
        an atmosphere of oxygen. The most important point to be noted
        here is
        the
        high percentage of carbon dioxide present which, coupled with
        the fact
        that temperature variations occurred which were wholly
        independent of
        the
        external heating, is positive evidence that oxidation of the
        charge has
        taken place. This should be compared with Figure 11, where it is
        seen
        that,
        in ordinary conditions, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the
        gas
        normally
        decreases with the temperature rise. No hydrogen was evolved up
        to
        380°
        C. </p>
      <p><a name="steam"></a><b>Steaming ~</b> </p>
      <p>It has been pointed out that superheating the primary gaseous
        products
        introduces secondary reactions and that large moderately heated
        surfaces,
        as well as small incandescent surfaces, catalyze the cracking of
        the
        saturated
        hydrocarbons. The primary object of steam distillation in the
        carbonization
        of coal is to remove quickly the volatile products, so as to
        prevent
        their
        coming in contact with the hot retort walls. By suitably
        regulating the
        flow of fresh steam, the gases and vapors can be swept clear of
        the
        retort
        and the cracking effect largely reduced. Of secondary
        importance, and
        sometime
        of undesirable consequence, is the reaction between the steam
        and coal
        which tends to increase the gas evolved at the expense of the
        coke
        yield.
        The physical chemistry, determining the extent to which this
        action
        occurs,
        will be discussed later. </p>
      <p>In low temperature carbonization, only a small amount of
        decomposition
        takes place when steam is introduced into the retorts and, if
        any
        reaction
        with the charge does occur, the dioxide, rather than the
        monoxide of
        carbon,
        is more likely to be formed. This will cause a decrease, rather
        than an
        increase, in the total calorific value of the gas. Therefore,
        any value
        that steaming may be found to have in low temperature methods
        must be
        of
        a physical rather than of a chemical nature. Thus, the steam
        absorbs
        heat
        in the hot bed near the bottom of the retort and distributes it
        through
        the cooler portions of the fuel bed near the top, thereby
        assisting in
        the transfer of heat throughout the charge. The function has
        been
        adequately
        illustrated in Figure 9. </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board (115) as a result of their experiments
        on
        the
        steaming of coal during coking, recommend that high temperature
        vertical
        retorts should never be used with less than 5% of steam. This
        was found
        to increase greatly the heating quality of the gas and the yield
        of
        ammonia.
        Steaming has not proved practical in horizontal retorts in
        experiments
        so far conducted. The effect of various percentages of steam on
        high
        temperature
        gas, as determined by the Fuel Research Board using Arley coal,
        is
        shown
        in Table 41. The carbonization was carried on at 1170° C. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="41tab.gif" height="281" width="458"></p>
        <p><img src="42tab.gif" height="320" width="473"></p>
        <p><img src="43tab.gif" height="263" width="465"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As the percentage of steam increases, the volume of gas becomes
        greater
        and the thermal value decreases. It will be shown later that in
        this
        case
        the temperature is too great to favor the formation of carbon
        dioxide
        in
        the presence of steam, but that there should be an increase in
        the
        carbon
        monoxide present. That this is the case, may be seen by
        reference to
        the
        table. The percentage of methane slightly decreases, and
        doubtlessly
        this
        in part accounts for the lower heating value of the gas. Carbon
        monoxide
        has a calorific value of only 341 BTU/cu ft as compared with
        1072
        BTU/cu
        ft for methane, so that the increase in the percentage of
        monoxide
        cannot
        be expected to compensate, from a calorific standpoint, for the
        decrease
        in the proportion of methane. The other constituents of the gas
        are not
        greatly influenced by the presence of steam. </p>
      <p>Investigations, on a laboratory scale, of the effect of steam
        in
        low
        temperature carbonization were made by Davis and Parry (97), who
        studied
        Pennsylvania coal. In large-scale experiments of the Fuel
        Research
        Board,
        shown in Table 43, only up to 20% steam was admitted, while in
        this
        case
        up to 88% steam was passed through the retort to sweep the
        chamber
        clean
        of gas 5 to 7 times a minute. While the greatest possible effect
        would
        be obtained by agitating the coke, stirring of the charge was
        avoided
        in
        order not to introduce another variable and nullify the
        comparative
        value
        of the data. There are so many variables in low temperature
        carbonization
        that it is best to reduce these to a minimum for simplicity of
        interpretation. </p>
      <p>The effect of steam in this case is plainly evident. Comparing
        the
        distillation
        with and without steam at corresponding temperatures, it will be
        observed
        that the percentage of carbon dioxide just about doubles in the
        presence
        of steam, while the carbon monoxide is only slightly increased
        at 650 C
        and remains practically unchanged at 550° C. This, together with
        the
        increase of hydrogen content, is indicative of the following
        reactions: </p>
      <p>[12] H<sub>2</sub>O + C =&gt; CO + H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>[13] 2H<sub>2</sub>0 + C =&gt; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>
      </p>
      <p>The data in Table 42 show that the first reaction, represented
        by
        the
        foregoing chemical equation, is hardly apparent at all at 550°
        C,
        but
        takes place to a minor extent at 650° C. On the other hand, the
        second
        reaction occurs to a considerable degree even below 500° C. </p>
      <p>The experiments of the Fuel Research Board (92) on the effect
        of
        steam
        in low temperature carbonization were carried on in Glover-West
        vertical
        retorts, using a blend of 60% Mitchell Main, a coking coal, and
        40%
        Ellistown
        Main, a non-coking coal. The temperature of distillation ranged
        from
        850°
        C at the bottom of the retort to 700° C at the top. Examination
        of
        Table 43 discloses that the introduction of steam has little
        effect on
        the percentage of carbon monoxide, but that there is a slight
        increase
        in the proportions of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It may be
        concluded,
        therefore, that there was a slight reaction between the steam
        and coal
        and that this took place in accordance with the principles
        deduced and
        in agreement with the data derived from the work of Davis and
        Parry. </p>
      <p>It cannot be concluded that steam has any effect on the
        remaining
        components
        of the gas, but it will be observed later that, under certain
        conditions
        and in certain processes the introduction of steam during
        carbonization
        has a beneficial effect on the removal of sulfur from the coke.

      <p>From the standpoint of physical chemistry, it is necessary to
        consider
        four reactions when steam is passed into a hot coal bed. Of
        these, two
        are primary reactions, represented by Equation (12) and Equation
        (13),
        previously mentioned, and two are secondary reactions, indicated
        as
        follows: </p>
      <p>[14]&nbsp; C + CO<sub>2</sub> &lt;=&gt; 2CO </p>
      <p>[15] H<sub>2</sub>0 + CO =&gt; H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>With reference to Equation (15), we have by the law of mass
        action, </p>
      <p>[16] (H<sub>2</sub>O) x (CO) / (H<sub>2</sub>) x (CO<sub>2</sub>)
        = <i>K</i> </p>
      <p>In other words, the product of the concentrations of the
        reagents
        divided
        by the product of the concentrations of the products is a
        constant at
        any
        given temperature of the products is a constant at any given
        temperature,
        regardless of the proportion of the components present at the
        beginning
        of the reaction. The constant K, however, is a function of
        temperature,
        as expressed by Van't Hoff's equation: </p>
      <p>[17]&nbsp; <i>d</i> log<sub>e</sub><i>K</i> / <i>d T</i> = <i>Q</i>
        / <i>RT</i><sup>2</sup> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Where T is the absolute temperature; Q, the heat involved in
        the
        reaction,
        and R, the universal gas constant (1.985 calories per degree).

      <p>[18]&nbsp;<img src="18form.gif" height="45" width="127"> </p>

      <p>Equation [15] is a first order reaction, and in such a case the
        rate
        of formation of the product is proportional to its own
        concentration
        and
        to a coefficient known as the specific reaction time, that is: </p>
      <p>[19] <i>d</i> (CO) / <i>dt</i> = <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> (CO) </p>
      <p>As the equilibrium is a dynamic one, the reverse reaction must
        be
        considered
        also: </p>
      <p>[20] <i>d</i> (CO<sub>2</sub>) / <i>dt</i> = <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>
        (CO<sub>2</sub>) </p>
      <p>This too is a first order reaction, because in the
        carbonization
        of
        coal, sufficient hydrogen is liberated to cause no appreciable
        decrease
        in its concentration. The resultant rate at which the monoxide
        is
        formed,
        therefore, is the difference between these two equations: </p>
      <p>[21] [<i>d</i> (CO / <i>dt</i>] <i>r</i> = <i>d</i> (CO / <i>dt</i>
        - <i>d</i> (CO<sub>2</sub>) / <i>dt</i> = <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>
        (CO)
        - <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>
        (CO<sub>2</sub>) </p>
      <p>Now the equilibrium constant K is equal to the ration of the
        specific
        reaction rates of the direct and reverse reaction, K = k<sub>1 </sub>/
        k<sub>2</sub>, from which it will be seen that, if the value of
        the
        equilibrium
        constant is greater than unity, the rate of formation of the
        monoxide,
        in accordance with Equation 15, is positive, and if K&lt;1, then
        the
        rate
        of formation is negative. In other words, it becomes possible at
        any
        temperature
        to determine the extent to which the reaction occurs. In the
        simultaneous
        occurrence of reactions [12] to [15], therefore, it may be
        determined,
        with sufficient data available, which reaction dominates. At any
        given
        temperature, it depends merely upon the rate at which
        equilibrium is
        established. </p>
      <p>At temperatures below 700° C, reactions [13] and [15]
        predominate,
        so that the steam reacts with the coal to produce the dioxide
        and any
        monoxide
        that is formed is oxidized to the higher compound. The reaction
        velocity
        of Equation [14] is slow in any case, so that its effect is
        negligible.
        Above 700° C reaction [15] is very rapid, while beyond 1000° C
        reaction [12] becomes of first importance. These theoretical
        deductions
        are substantiated by the data given in Tables 41 and 42. </p>
