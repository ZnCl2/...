      <p>Lander conceives the successful development of a commercial
        carbonization
        process as passing through four distinct stages first,
        laboratory
        investigation
        of the method under close control and with accurate measurement;
        second,
        work on an intermediate scale in a plant able to deal with
        several
        hundred
        pounds of raw material daily; third, erection of a full-scale
        unit with
        a daily capacity of not less than 5 tons, which will allow
        multiplication
        in number; and fourth, a commercial battery which consists of a
        number
        of full-scale units erected in a locality which will test its
        economic
        possibilities. </p>
      <p>In the foregoing chapters, we have dealt at length with the
        phenomena
        accompanying the transition of coal under application of heat,
        so that
        the principles to be noted during the first and second stages of
        development
        have been laid down. The successful solution of any low
        temperature
        process
        depends upon the utmost attention to and thoughtful working out
        of
        details.
        While a knowledge of the physico-chemical reactions accompanying
        the
        thermal
        breaking down of the coal conglomerate is the sine quo non of
        any
        successful
        process, of quite as much importance is a knowledge of the
        properties
        of
        the materials of construction, of the difficulties of operation,
        of the
        principles of design, and of the economies which justify its
        existence.
        It is the purpose of this and the next chapter to consider these
        phases
        of the subject which are of particular interest during the third
        and
        fourth
        stages of commercial development. </p>
      <p><a name="operation"></a><b>Operation of Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>Caracristi (256) has given a very frank discussion of the
        operating
        difficulties of low temperature carbonization, as has Curtis
        (213) and
        his associates). To preserve the primary character of the low
        temperature
        products, it is necessary to avoid localized heating, which
        causes
        decomposition
        of the hydrocarbons and adversely affects the process, both by
        virtue
        of
        loss of valuable products and by the deposition of amorphous
        carbon,
        which
        is detrimental to the continuous operation of the plant. The
        deposition
        of amorphous carbon, sufficiently hard to disrupt the driving
        mechanism,
        was experienced in the Carbocoal primary retort, resulting in
        the
        adaption
        of a cutting blade to the paddles, as illustrated in the
        McIntire
        modification. </p>
      <p>Temperature regulation is of great importance for a number of
        different
        reasons, principally among which is the sensitivity of the
        quality of
        the
        low temperature products to the temperature of distillation and
        the
        danger
        of exceeding a temperature which will injure the retort, if it
        be
        constructed
        of metal. Of course, the lower the temperature consistent with
        complete
        carbonization, the greater is the thermal efficiency of the
        process.
        Great
        care must be taken to prevent infiltration of air, either to the
        combustion
        chamber or to the carbonization chamber, in order to maintain
        close
        temperature
        regulation, in the first case, and to prevent destruction of the
        hydrocarbons,
        in the second. </p>
      <p>Tempering of the semi-coke to prevent spontaneous combustion is
        a
        serious
        matter. Of course, this can be effected by water-quenching the
        material,
        as is done in some instances, but this is not good practice, for
        it
        breaks
        up the lumps, producing excess breeze, and lowers the net value
        of the
        fuel by virtue of its moisture content. Furthermore, it is
        desirable to
        recover the sensible heat of the coke, as far as is possible, in
        order
        to increase the thermal efficiency of the process. This can be
        accomplished
        by means of heat recuperators of by dry quenching. The
        spontaneous
        combustion
        of semi-coke can be prevented easily by crushing and pulverizing
        it,
        provided
        it can be sued in this form, for the finely divided material
        permits
        the
        absorption of sufficient oxygen to prevent further spontaneous
        oxidation. </p>
      <p>It is common experience for low temperature processes to
        encounter
        the
        building up of a thick layer of carbon on the inner wall of the
        retort
        shell, due partly to cracking of hydrocarbons and partly to the
        sticking
        of fusing coals. This is a serious condition, to be avoided in
        all
        events,
        for aside from its interference with the operation of moving
        parts, it
        greatly reduces heat transfer because of its thermal insulating
        character,
        and increases the likelihood of injuring a metallic retort
        through
        overheating
        in an effort to attain the necessary heat transfer to carbonize
        the
        coal
        properly. The carbon layer bakes harder with age and is
        difficult to
        remove. </p>
      <p>It seems that a great deal of trouble has been found in
        handling
        fusing
        coals in a rotary retort, because they stick to the walls and
        build up
        a thick heat-insulating layer. To avoid this difficulty,
        recourse has
        been
        had to various mechanical and chemical devices. Thus, Hutchins
        introduced
        a star-shaped breaker into his Fusion process to chip the coke
        from the
        inner walls, while the K.S.G. process destroys the sticking
        quality by
        preheating the coal before carbonization. No serious mechanical
        difficulties
        are encountered in carbonizing non-coking materials when in
        motion, but
        because of the absence of binding resins, the residuum after
        distillation
        is pulverent in nature and of little value as fuel, unless
        further
        processed
        by briquetting or by pulverization. </p>
      <p>Another source of trouble in practice is the clogging of the
        raw
        coal
        feed pipes. This arises from the condensation of hydrocarbons or
        water
        vapor on the cool incoming coal to form a sticky paste. The
        Piron-Caracristi
        process partially remedied this difficulty by admission of steam
        with
        the
        coal, but finally completely avoided it by projecting the feed
        pipe
        into
        the hot oven. This expedient was adopted also in the
        McEwen-Runge
        process,
        where the pulverized coal is introduced through pipes extending
        several
        feet into the carbonization shaft. </p>
      <p>In those processes in which molten lead is used as the heating
        medium,
        Caracristi (256) reports that there is no difficulty in holding
        the
        bath
        of lead in a refractory structure. Except for mechanical
        defects, such
        as cracks, bricks, which had been in use over a period of
        several
        months,
        shoed no indication of lead infiltration upon examination.
        Furthermore,
        the loss of lead may be effectively prevented by a judicious
        location
        of
        traps and cooling pipes. </p>
      <p>Moving metallic parts, especially those made of cast-iron,
        which
        are
        subjected to high temperature, such as chain conveyers, are
        subject to
        growth. This subject will be treated more fully later, but it
        should be
        pointed out that some provision must be made for taking up the
        slack or
        bringing the moving parts into register. </p>
      <p>McEwen and Runge depend upon convection to transfer the heat
        from
        their
        recirculated hot gas to the pulverized coal particle. Gentry
        (208) has
        pointed out that the transfer of heat by convection in such
        circumstances
        is a function of a power of the relative velocity of the fluid
        and the
        particle. The laws of falling bodies in non-vortical fluids are
        well
        known
        and it is safe to conclude from them, even for a case of
        turbulent
        flow,
        that there are certain definite limits to heat transfer between
        a
        particle
        and a gaseous fluid in motion at certain gas velocities, due to
        the
        reduction
        to zero of the relative velocity of particle and fluid. This
        sets a
        maximum
        limiting velocity of gas circulation, which depends, among other
        things,
        on the size of the particles, density of the gas, etc., beyond
        which
        the
        efficiency of heat transfer is reduced and beyond which
        difficulties
        will
        be encountered with the gas carrying the pulverized coal out of
        the
        retort.
        One very important aspect of low temperature carbonization in
        pulverized
        form is found in the fact that, both by convection and
        radiation, heat
        transfer depends directly upon the area of the absorbing body.
        Consequently,
        carbonization of small particles should and does effect an
        enormous
        reduction
        in the tie of distillation. </p>
      <p>In the early days of low temperature carbonization, the first
        attempts
        to develop a continuous process naturally led to an internal
        spiral
        conveyer.
        Most of these efforts utterly failed, because the inventors
        could not
        prevent
        the charge from plugging in the retort. The Greene-Laucks
        process seems
        to have successfully surmounted this difficulty, and probably
        the
        provision
        for heating the inner surface of the screw has a great deal to
        do with
        the elimination of this trouble. In the Marshall-Easton process,
        which
        also uses internal spiral conveyors, the problem has been solved
        in an
        ingenious mechanical way by providing a nest of interlocking
        spirals,
        so
        that no rotary motion whatever is imparted to the charge, which
        moves
        only
        vertically through the retort. </p>
      <p>Rotary retorts have received a good deal of attention in
        Germany,
        where
        several large-scale plants have been in operation for a number
        of
        years.
        Rotary retorts, heated externally or internally, have certain
        well
        known
        advantages. In the first place, they are continuous processes
        and avoid
        high maintenance, inevitably associated with a discontinuous
        process,
        where
        the retort is periodically heated and cooled. Furthermore, the
        rotary
        retort
        permits bulk treatment of the charge, which requires less
        handling and
        correspondingly lowers the cost of processing per unit of
        throughput.
        The
        constant tumbling of the charge during carbonization assists
        heat
        transfer
        enormously by presenting fresh surfaces to the hot wall, in the
        case of
        external heating, and to the hot gas in the case of internal
        heating.
        As
        a consequence of this stirring up of the coke, heating is very
        uniform
        and likewise the volatile content of the semi-coke. On the other
        hand,
        there is a great diversity in the size of the lumps of semi-coke
        produced.
        Some pieces are very large and must be broken, others are just
        right
        for
        domestic use, and there is a relatively large amount of breeze,
        which
        must
        be briquetted for the market. Many experimenters with rotary
        retorts,
        however,
        have had a god deal of trouble with dust raised in the retort by
        the
        tumbling
        charge and carried over into the tar main by the gas. This
        reduces
        greatly
        the value of the tar and causes much trouble in the by-product
        plant.
        In
        certain instances, even after the installation of special
        dust-catchers,
        2% dust was carried over into the tar. </p>
      <p><a name="deesign"></a><b>Design of Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>Despite the basic simplicity of the low temperature
        carbonization
        process,
        reduction to practice in commercial installations introduces a
        number
        of
        complications of a serious nature. Caracristi (256) summarizes
        them as
        follows: </p>
      <p>(1) The necessity for large tonnage throughput, per unit of
        time
        and
        cost. </p>
      <p>(2) Low heat conductivity of coal in mass. </p>
      <p>(3) The difficulty of constructing an apparatus in which heat
        losses
        are minimized to a point where heat input is not prohibitive. </p>
      <p>(4) The formation of gases which condense even at relatively
        high
        temperatures
        into sticky resins or tars. </p>
      <p>The use of any structures similar in design to those employed
        in
        high
        temperature distillation is entirely precluded in primary
        carbonization
        by the first two difficulties listed above. It is necessary to
        design
        the
        structure in such a manner that the evolved gases pass from
        their point
        of origin to a region no higher in temperature than that at
        which the
        gases
        were evolved, in order to prevent cracking them. At the same
        time, it
        is
        equally important to prevent their passage into regions which
        are cool
        enough to cause their condensation, a condition which injures
        the oils
        through redistillation, as they trickle again into the hot
        zones, and a
        condition which tends to block the operation of the retort by
        the
        formation
        of a pasty mass. </p>
      <p>Caracristi (256) apparently believes that the third factor
        listed
        above
        is the dominating problem in low temperature carbonization.
        Unless due
        effort is made to reduce heat losses, their cost may reach a
        value
        which
        will entirely outweigh the gain in value of the recovered
        by-products.
        Reduction of heat loss can be accomplished by proper thermal
        insulation
        or by an increase in plant throughput at a given temperature.
        The only
        effective heat is that which goes into the charge and a large
        part of
        this
        is carried away as sensible heat of the products. </p>
      <p>The fourth consideration, that of the formation of sticky
        resins,
        creates
        an operating situation which is difficult to overcome in
        commercial
        practice.
        The sticky property of coals, of course, disappears with the
        volatile
        content,
        so that the trouble from this source decreases in a given coal
        as
        coking
        proceeds. </p>
      <p>We have witnessed in Chapter VI the variety of structure of
        widely
        different
        design in which low temperature carbonization has been effected.
        These
        structural differences arise from an understanding of the
        fundamentals
        of the coking process and form ingenious solutions of its
        various
        problems,
        particularly those of dealing with fusing coals, of securing the
        necessary
        heat transfer, and of obtaining a high throughput. The first of
        these
        problems
        has been discussed already under the subject of operation of
        retorts.
        The
        question of heat transfer has more or less resolved itself into
        the
        principle
        of external heating in thin layers, the principle of internal
        heating,
        or the principle of stirring the charge. These problems have
        been
        discussed
        at various times, particularly under the subject of heating and
        resolves
        itself into multiplication of small units, in the case of
        heating
        externally
        by the principle of carbonization in thin layers, or mass
        distillation,
        in the case of internally heated or of rotary retorts. </p>
      <p>Mass throughput requires continuous operation. As pointed out
        before,
        so long as the fuel is shale or other non-coking material, no
        trouble
        is
        experienced with moving parts, but the swelling and sticking of
        caking
        fuels renders the retort inoperative and is a difficult property
        of
        coal
        to surmount. Since the production of a domestic fuel requires
        the
        manufacture
        of a coherent product, this type of fuel is the class most
        usually met
        in practice. According to Simpkin (257), continuity of operation
        has
        been
        effected in low temperature carbonization processes in the
        following
        manners: </p>
      <p>(1) Retorts constructed upon the principle of the tunnel kiln
        with
        provision
        to transport the coal through the carbonization chamber in
        suitable
        containers. </p>
      <p>(2) The vertical shaft retort in which the charge is
        transported
        through
        the carbonization chamber under its own weight. </p>
      <p>(3) Retorts in which the charge is transported by rotation of
        the
        structure
        itself. </p>
      <p>(4) Retorts in which the fuel is transported by agitation from
        internal
        mechanical devices. </p>
      <p>Intermittent working is severe on metal retorts, which grow hot
        when
        empty and thereafter cool rapidly when filled by the incoming
        charge. A
        semi-intermittent operation, accomplished by dropping the charge
        of
        vertical
        retorts a few feet at a time, such as was adopted in the Fuel
        Research
        Board narrow vertical retorts, apparently provides a
        satisfactory
        compromise. </p>
      <p>It has been observed that much enterprise and ingenuity has
        been
        expended
        by those responsible for the development of the various low
        temperature
        processes and naturally the question arises as to which method
        is the
        most
        satisfactory. Due consideration must be given to a number of
        factors in
        reaching such a decision, as outlined by Simpkin (257): </p>
      <p>(1) The character of the material to be processed. </p>
      <p>(2) The relative importance attached to the products of
        carbonization. </p>
      <p>(3) Efficiency, reliability, and simplicity of the method. </p>
      <p>(4) The initial and operating costs per unit of throughput. </p>
      <p>In consideration of the potential fuel resources residing in
        the
        great
        variety of carbonaceous materials, ranging all the way from mine
        refuse
        and shales to high grade bituminous coal, designers of low
        temperature
        retorts have been justified in constructing certain retorts with
        the
        intent
        of treating only one variety of material. At the same time
        others have
        set for themselves the more ambitious task of designing a retort
        of
        greater
        flexibility in the type of materials which it can treat. </p>
      <p>The solid residuum from the distillation of shales is
        practically
        worthless,
        while that from colliery waste is of doubtful value. In certain
        circumstances
        the residuum from carbonization of the latter might be used as a
        producer
        fuel. With such materials as these, the best process is one
        which gives
        special attention to the production of tar and gas. On the other
        hand,
        when the object in view is to process better grades of fuel to
        extract
        their by-products or to modify the nature of the solid material,
        the
        selection
        of the best process would rest upon the special character
        ascribed to
        the
        various products, means at hand for their disposition, and
        finally the
        market condition for by-products in that locality. Obviously, if
        the
        primary
        object is the production of a domestic fuel, no process can be
        considered
        which delivers the semi-coke for the most part in a finely
        divided
        form.
        On the other hand, if the purpose of carbonization is the
        production of
        a power char, less discrimination can be made in the selection
        of the
        raw
        fuel for distillation and the delivery of the finished product
        in a
        finely
        divided state may be more of an asset than a deterrent to the
        process.
        If the solid product is desired in a firm or lumpy condition,
        there is
        little doubt that the oven type of retort is the best, but if
        throughput
        of material is the first consideration, without regard to the
        conditions
        of the semi-coke, either the vertical shaft or rotary retort
        should be
        given preference. It has already been pointed out in Chapter VI,
        under
        the subject of adaptability of processes, that no single retort
        will
        yield
        a maximum of even two of the most important products. The
        production of
        large yields of oil is ordinarily accomplished by a friable
        coke, and
        likewise,
        if a large volume of gas is wanted, the coke is somewhat less
        desirable
        and the oils are low both in quantity and quality. </p>
      <p>The economic efficiency of a retort resides not alone in its
        thermal
        efficiency. The most desirable process for the treatment of a
        given
        fuel
        to yield predetermined products of known relative importance is
        that
        which
        delivers the semi-coke, tar, and gas at the minimum cost per
        unit.
        Thermal
        efficiency is, of course, a factor in the attainment of this
        end, but
        of
        even greater importance is the reduction of overhead and
        operating
        costs.
        Simplicity of design will usually contribute not only to a
        minimum
        initial
        expenditure, but to reduction of operating expense, through
        elimination
        of maintenance and attention that is required in more
        complicated
        operations.
        On the other hand, the extra capital requirements to effect
        continuity
        and automation will often be more than offset by savings in the
        cost of
        labor. </p>
      <p>Evans (84) conducted a comprehensive series of experiments to
        determine
        the nature of the carbonization of coal at high temperatures in
        vertical
        retorts. His work is of equal interest in low temperature
        carbonization,
        because particular attention was given to the inward movement of
        the
        plastic
        layer and its effect on the path of travel of the gases. We have
        already
        seen in Chapter I, under the subject of plastic layer, that
        coking
        coals
        fuse somewhere in the vicinity of 400° C and form a plastic zone
        which
        progresses towards the center of the retort as coking proceeds.
        It was
        demonstrated that this plastic layer was approximately one inch
        thick
        and
        that its resistance to the flow of gas was of an order several
        thousand
        times that of raw crushed coal and several hundred times that of
        medium
        temperature coke. Evans found that the maximum pressure
        developed
        shortly
        after the passage of the plastic layer, at a temperature of
        roughly
        425°
        C, and that the coke solidified shortly thereafter at
        approximately
        440°
        C. </p>
      <p>According to Evans (84), the difference in pressure across the
        plastic
        layer is dependent upon the percentage of voids in the charge
        and
        therefore
        upon the size to which the coal is crushed. Thus, he found a
        difference
        in pressure equal to 60 inches of water when using an unscreened
        coal
        with
        a small percentage of voids was used. He made the remarkable
        observation
        that the resistance of gas was dependent upon its direction.
        Thus the
        pressure
        difference between two points about 5 inches apart was 30 inches
        of
        water,
        when the gas flowed across the plastic zone toward the core of
        the
        retort,
        and 40 inches of water when the direction of flow was toward the
        retort
        wall. This shows that the plastic layer is more resistant to gas
        flow
        when
        backed by coke than when backed by green coal. </p>
      <p>While in the past there has been a good deal of difference of
        opinion
        as to the relative quantities of the volatile products which
        pass
        upward
        inside and outside of the fusion zone, this question seems to
        have been
        pretty well established by Evans' experiments (84). Since it is
        evident
        that the flow of gas will follow the path of least resistance,
        due
        consideration
        must be given to the character of the original coal in
        determining
        whether
        the gas passes through the cold core of green coal or through
        the hot
        ring
        of semi-coke. Obviously, the coarser the raw coal and the
        greater the
        voids,
        the greater will be the proportion of the volatile products
        which pass
        upward through the core. In high temperature carbonization Evans
        estimates
        that roughly 90% of the gas is evolved after passage of the
        plastic
        condition.
        In low temperature carbonization, probably 25% of the gas is
        evolved
        inside
        of the plastic envelope and 75% outside. In addition to the
        amount of
        gas
        liberated in the respective regions, the quantity which is
        removed by
        the
        different passages depends on their relative resistance. At the
        beginning
        of distillation, the area within the plastic envelope is large
        and the
        area of the annular passage through the semi-coke is small, so
        that the
        resistance to gas flow is roughly inversely proportional to the
        area of
        the passages. Consequently, some of the gas liberated outside
        the
        plastic
        envelope breaks through the fusion zone and escapes through the
        core.
        As
        carbonization progresses, the inner passage becomes smaller and
        the
        outer
        passage correspondingly larger, so that a smaller and smaller
        percentage
        of the gas flows through the plastic zone and out through the
        core
        passage.
        During the first 3 hours of high temperature carbonization,
        Evans (84)
        found that approximately equal quantities of the volatile
        products
        passed
        outward through the raw coal and outward through the coke, but
        after
        that
        period, flow through the interior practically ceased. In low
        temperature
        externally heated vertical retorts, it is estimated that
        approximately
        half of the gas takes each passage. As the fused layer migrates
        inward,
        the region of maximum pressure, which is always outside of the
        plastic
        envelope, follows, but the distance between the two regions
        constantly
        becomes smaller. In general, the maximum pressure decreases in
        value as
        it moves towards the core and finally drops rapidly when the
        plastic
        envelope
        reaches the center and disappears. </p>
      <p>In vertical retorts, a certain taper is necessary to facilitate
        discharge
        of the coke. Evans (84) has pointed out the very interesting
        fact that,
        for a retort of given area and given taper, there is a given
        rate of
        heating
        which will permit the plastic layer to reach the center of the
        retort
        at
        the bottom before it does so at the top. If this rate if heating
        is
        exceeded,
        the fusion layer will close first at the top of the retort and
        trap all
        volatile products inside of the plastic envelop at the bottom.
        This
        causes
        enough pressure to build up to force the gas through the fusion
        zone
        into
        the free passage outward through the hot coke. It might also be
        pointed
        out that the resistance to flow of gas along the retort walls,
        as
        compared
        to that through the core, is greater at the bottom of the a
        vertical
        retort
        than at the top. As a consequence, a larger percentage of the
        volatile
        products which are evolved at the bottom of the retort will flow
        through
        the core, than is the case for those evolved at the top. </p>
      <p>In the design of low temperature retorts, it is well to bear in
        mind
        the various stages in which carbonization proceeds. These have
        been
        outlined
        by Fulweiler (258) as follows: </p>
      <p>(1) A preliminary decomposition which begins as soon as the
        coal
        has
        acquired a certain fairly definite temperature. As this stage is
        quite
        strongly endothermic and approaches a fusion, the temperature
        remains
        fairly
        constant until completion. </p>
      <p>(2) The products from the first stage, consisting principally
        of
        higher
        members of the alipathic hydrocarbons, suffer considerable
        molecular
        rearrangement.
        In general, compounds containing less than 3 atoms of carbon are
        formed.
        This stage may be regarded as a continuation of the
        simplification in
        which
        every distillation results. </p>
      <p>(3) The gaseous vapors, resulting from the second stage, when
        evolved
        from the protecting influence of the actual coal particles, are
        acted
        upon
        by the conducted and radiant heat of the more highly heated
        portions of
        the charge proper, of the sides of the retort, and of the
        superheated
        regions
        above the coal. </p>
      <p>The first two stages take place more or less simultaneously
        within
        the
        charge itself. The reactions which take place in the third stage
        are
        very
        complicated, depending as they do upon the time of exposure and
        upon
        the
        temperature. We have seen in the foregoing chapters that the
        mechanism
        of the third stage consists of the spitting up and breaking down
        of the
        alipathic hydrocarbons and their reunion into complex
        carbo-cyclic
        compounds.
        The benzene hydrocarbons may be further decomposed with the
        liberation
        of hydrogen and carbon and the formation of still higher cyclic
        derivatives.
        It is the third stage of distillation that is tremendously
        affected by
        the method of carbonization, and therefore by the conditions
        under
        which
        it occurs. </p>
      <p>Fulweiler (258) also has listed the 6 factors which influence
        carbonization.
        These general conditions are: </p>
      <p>(1) Size of the coal particles. </p>
      <p>(2) Moisture content of the coal. </p>
      <p>(3) Temperature of carbonization. </p>
      <p>(4) Volume ratio of charge to retort. </p>
      <p>(5) Time of carbonization. </p>
      <p>(6) Pressure permitted during carbonization. </p>
      <p>All of these conditions can be simplified into 3 effects of
        time,
        temperature
        and pressure by tracing them back to their origin. In the
        foregoing
        chapters,
        each of these factors has been treated at length, as have others
        indirectly
        derived from them. </p>
      <p><a name="material"></a><b>Materials of Construction ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is of historic interest to note that the gas industry was
        born
        in
        a metallic retort, for Murdock's first efforts were confined to
        the use
        of a cylindrical iron pipe. Since gas was the primary product in
        the
        early
        days of the carbonization industry, progress in the art
        naturally led
        to
        higher and higher temperatures until the shortcoming of metallic
        retorts
        became so conspicuous that they were entirely superceded by
        those made
        of refractory materials. As regards the preference of refractory
        or of
        cast-iron retorts, Lander and McKay (186) see no basis of
        superiority
        of
        one above the other, all things being taken into consideration.
        However,
        two particular advantages can be associated with a metallic
        retort:
        first,
        its excellent heat conductivity and high thermal diffusivity,
        thus
        giving
        better thermal efficiency to the process and reducing the period
        of
        carbonization
        by virtue of the high rate of heat transfer; and second, the
        facility
        with
        which the system can be kept gas-tight. Its one drawback is the
        ease
        with
        which a metallic retort can be injured by overheating. The
        advent of
        low
        temperature carbonization again made their use a possibility and
        brought
        into prominence the great advantages of metallic retorts, as
        compared
        with
        those built of refractory. Of course, this applies only to
        externally
        heated
        processes and it cannot be said for internally heated processes
        that
        metal
        has any superiority over refractory as a material for the
        construction
        of carbonization chambers, aside from the consideration of
        leakage. </p>
      <p>As a criterion by which to judge the speed of heat transfer
        through
        the retort, the thermal diffusivity is more important than the
        thermal
        conductivity in low temperature carbonization, where the periods
        of
        heating
        are relatively short. This is especially true in the case of
        intermittent
        processes. The truth of this fact can be made clear by the
        following
        considerations.
        The general case of simple linear propagation of a thermal
        disturbance
        is represented by Fourier's law of linear diffusion: </p>
      <p>[26]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>dT / dt = k ( d<sub>2</sub>T<sub>2</sub>
          / dx )</i> </p>
      <p>where k is the diffusivity of the substance, T the temperature,
        t
        the
        time, and x the distance within the material. In general, this
        equation
        cannot be solved for any but the simplest cases, so that the
        solution
        for
        such a complex shape as a retort is quite beyond possibility for
        practical
        application. Fourier's law of diffusion is worthy of
        consideration,
        however,
        from the standpoint of heat transfer, because it demonstrates
        that the
        diffusivity of the material is the physical constant which is of
        importance
        during the process of heating up the retort, rather than the
        thermal
        conductivity,
        which is the limiting factor only after the steady state of heat
        transfer
        has been attained. Of course, the diffusivity is itself related
        to the
        thermal conductivity in the following way: </p>
      <p>[27]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>k = k / cp</i> </p>
      <p>where <i>k</i> is the thermal conductivity, <i>c</i> is the
        specific
        heat of the material, and <i>p</i> is its density. When,
        however, the
        steady
        state of heat transmission has been reached, then <i>dT / dt =
          0</i>,
        which
        is to say, that the temperature gradient within the retort wall
        is
        uniform.
        Under this condition, Fourier's diffusion equation can be solved
        to
        give
        the well known equation for the quantity of heat, <i>Q</i>,
        flowing
        between
        two parallel isothermals at temperatures <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
        and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>,
        respectively: </p>
      <p>[28]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q = k ( T<sub>2</sub> - T<sub>1</sub>
        )
        A t / x </p>
      <p>where <i>A</i> is the area considered perpendicular to the
        direction
        of heat flow, and <i>x</i> is the distance between the two
        isothermals.
        It will be recognized that this is the integrated form of
        Newton's law
        given in Chapter I, equation [11], under the subject of heat
        transfer. </p>
      <p>We can now summarize with the statement that, in the transient
        thermal
        condition, the greater the diffusivity of the material, the
        faster is
        the
        propagation of temperature by conduction, and in the steady
        state, the
        greater the thermal conductivity of the material, the higher is
        the
        heat
        transfer. The diffusivity of cast-iron is roughly 40 times
        greater than
        that of fireclay. The thermal conductivity, and hence the
        diffusivity,
        is constant only in a limited sense. It has long been known that
        both
        of
        these properties are functions of the temperature, as will be
        shown
        later. </p>
      <p>Aside from such materials as carborundum, which is occasionally
        employed
        for special purposes in the construction of carbonization
        plants, the
        refractories
        ordinarily used fall into 3 classes: fireclay brick, which
        contains not
        more than 75% silica; siliceous brick, which contains 80 to 92%
        silica,
        and silica brick, which contains over 92% silica. Their
        respective
        properties
        differ materially. The fireclay or aluminous retorts are usually
        made
        from
        a mixture of plastic fireclay, flint fireclay, and "bats", while
        siliceous
        retorts are composed of a ganister with clay as a binding agent.
        All
        refractories
        should be fired at a temperature higher than will be reached in
        practice,
        so that there will no be excessive shrinkage or expansion with
        use.
        This
        is a point which requires little attention in low temperature
        carbonization,
        so long as the bricks are well fired for high temperature work.
      </p>
      <p>Refractory retorts may be of several types: the one-piece
        hand-molded,
        machine-molded cast retorts, and segmented retorts. The molded
        retorts
        are usually built of fireclay, while the segmented retorts may
        be built
        of shapes made of aluminous fireclay, of siliceous, or of silica
        material.
        Their thickness varies generally from 2.5 to 4 inches. They
        should be
        able
        to withstand abrasion, as the deposits of carbon and ash which
        accumulate
        are usually removed by scraping an scurfing the refractory.
        Fireclay
        has
        the disadvantage, compared to the other materials, of being
        especially
        susceptible to the corrosive action of salt in the coal. </p>
      <p>According to Cole (259), molded retorts tend to crack after
        they
        have
        been in use a short time, due to the absence of joints to
        relieve heat
        strains which have been set up. On the other hand, the joints
        which are
        provided in segmented retorts permit full adjustment to the
        temperature
        conditions and prevent distortion. If the shapes are properly
        jointed
        and
        cemented, it cannot be said that the segmented retorts are
        subject to
        any
        greater leakage than molded retorts. The gas-tightness of the
        joint is
        further improved by the deposition of carbon by the cracked
        hydrocarbons.
        The segmented shapes should be designed to give maximum strength
        to the
        wall structure. Porter (260) has noted that joints in the retort
        wall
        offer
        a relatively high resistance to heat transfer, to such extent
        that
        considerations
        of thermal conductivity of different retort materials become of
        lesser
        importance when joints are present. </p>
      <p>The requirements for a refractory cement, as established by
        Gill
        (261),
        are that it must be highly refractory, non-contracting,
        chemically
        inert
        at the working temperature, and must be capable of maintaining
        gas-tight
        joints. In addition to these qualities, it should have good
        adhesive
        and
        plastic properties. Generally, the more nearly alike are the
        brick and
        the cement, with respect to both their chemical and physical
        properties,
        the more satisfactory will be the result. </p>
      <p>American silica bricks contain as much as 98% silica, which is
        somewhat
        higher than that found in European samples. Silica brick has a
        considerably
        higher thermal conductivity and diffusivity than most other
        refractory
        materials, as will be shown later, although this question has
        been one
        subject to controversy in the past. It is usual to attribute the
        greater
        average coking rate and throughput per oven in American high
        temperature
        practice to this property of silica refractories, which are so
        extensively
        used in the United States. However, Porter (260) feels that this
        is due
        more to the low degree of distortion and thermal expansion of
        this
        material,
        which allows ovens to be operated at a higher temperature, than
        to the
        higher rate at which it transmits heat. As far as low
        temperature
        carbonization
        is concerned, it will be presently seen that the high
        diffusivity if
        silica
        brick gives it a great advantage over most other refractories
        and its
        comparatively
        great strength gives an additional advantage in permitting the
        use of
        thinner
        walls, These advantages, however, are in part offset by the
        tendency of
        this material to spall when subjected to frequent temperature
        changes,
        especially those at low temperatures. </p>
      <p>Cole (259) points out that when steam is introduced into
        vertical
        retorts,
        erosion occurs in both fireclay and quartzite or siliceous
        retorts, but
        not in those constructed of silica material. The action is
        similar to
        spalling,
        which is generally considered to be the cause of the failure,
        although
        some authorities attribute it to a chemical reaction. </p>
      <p>In addition to their use in the retort proper, refractories
        play
        an
        important part in thermally insulating the retort setting to
        prevent
        heat
        losses. The heating gas, consumed in carbonization, is conserved
        in
        proportion
        as the losses by radiation and convection are reduced. Aside
        from the
        increased
        thermal efficiency gained thereby, working conditions are made
        more
        comfortable
        for the men employed in operating the plant. Brick if a porous
        non-conducting
        nature, or diatomaceous earth, either in the form of bricks or
        powder,
        are usually employed for purposes of insulation. The use of
        refractories
        is also extensive in the construction of regenerators,
        combustion
        chambers,
        and other elements of the heating system, but this subject will
        be
        treated
        later under the discussion of heating of retorts. </p>
      <p><a name="refract"></a><b>Refractory Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>Chief among the characteristics of refractories, which are used
        in
        the
        construction of ovens, should be immunity to injury from sudden
        fluctuations
        in temperature and freedom from volumetric changes. For general
        purposes,
        grog bricks, composed of a mixture of fireclay and grog, or
        silica
        bricks
        of moderate porosity and high refractoriness, which have been
        well
        burnt
        to prevent excessive expansion when in use, are perhaps the most
        suitable.
        Siliceous refractories have an advantage over fireclay material
        for
        combustion
        chamber construction, in that higher temperatures can be used.
        With
        bricks
        of this type, temperatures of 1350° C can be worked
        continuously.
        With
        few
        exceptions, firebricks will show signs of squatting at 1325° C
        and
        siliceous bricks at 1400° C, when loaded to 50 psi. In actual
        practice,
        however, the load on the refractory will seldom exceed 30 psi.
        Silica
        bricks
        can be used continuously at 1450° C or even higher. As far as
        internally
        heated low temperature carbonization processes are concerned,
        these are
        consideration of great importance, but the temperatures are so
        low in
        externally
        heated retorts that no particular weight need by attached to
        questions
        of refractoriness, except in certain parts of the combustion
        chamber
        which
        are likely to become excessively heated. </p>

        <p><img src="116tab.gif" height="258" width="538"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Some of the physical properties of the refractories which are
        commonly
        used in the construction of coke ovens are summarized in Table
        116,
        after
        Gardner (262). Except in the instance of silica brick, it should
        be
        observed
        that the difference in refractoriness of the various bricks
        under their
        own weight and under a load of 50 psi is very great, approaching
        as
        much
        as 300° C. Consequently, the test of a material for
        refractoriness,
        unless it be made under loaded conditions, is of little value
        when used
        for the purpose of design. The high rigidity of silica is due in
        part
        at
        least to the purity of the rock used in its manufacture. </p>
      <p>Searle (263) admits that it is controversial whether fireclay
        or
        silica
        materials are to be preferred in the construction of coke ovens.
        Their
        relative advantages and disadvantages are numerous. Unless
        exceedingly
        well burnt, fireclay refractories contract in use and are liable
        to
        crack,
        while silica refractories, on the contrary, tend to expand and
        must be
        very carefully heated during the initial stages of starting up,
        as well
        as during any subsequent temperature fluctuations below 600° C.
        On
        the other hand, silica materials are less likely to fail from
        overheating
        than those of fireclay, because they do not soften until very
        near the
        fusion point. In addition, the former are less subject to the
        corrosive
        action of salt and ash in the coal. In the past, there has been
        some
        question
        as to whether silica refractories have better thermal properties
        than
        those
        of fireclay. Later, it will be shown that, while at low
        temperatures
        there
        is in reality not a great difference, at higher temperatures the
        thermal
        conductivity and diffusivity of silica brick are considerably
        greater. </p>
      <p>Gardner (262) states that aluminous, siliceous and silica
        refractories
        are all capable of withstanding the rapid fluctuations in
        temperature
        which
        are occasioned by the introduction fo wet coal into a hot
        retort. In
        silica
        materials there is a certain range of temperatures whose upper
        critical
        point is in the vicinity of 600° C where there is a great
        expansion
        for a relatively small increase in temperature. Below this
        critical
        point,
        which is well within the limits of low temperature carbonization
        by
        external
        heating, silica refrractories are liable to suffer severely from
        spalling.
        For that reason they are not recommended for use in retorts
        operated
        intermittently
        at temperatures below 600° C. When the temperature is maintained
        as
        high as 1000° C, however, sufficient heat is stored in the
        material
        to prevent its temperature falling to the critical contraction
        point
        when
        the retort is charged. In any event, the material should be well
        burnt
        and its porosity should be such as to give god mechanical
        strength.
        Silica
        brick, which are soft-burnt and which contain a high percentage
        of
        quartz
        and a poorly developed bond, spall less readily than hard-burnt
        bricks.
        When sued at high temperature, however, or when accidentally
        overheated,
        soft-burnt silica bricks expand greatly and distort the
        structure. For
        that reason, it is better to use a well burnt refractory and
        choose a
        material
        less subject to spalling. </p>
      <p>Harvey and McGee (264) investigated the problem of abrasion in
        silica
        brick. Where the product of only one manufacturer was concerned,
        they
        found
        that the resistance to abrasion was inversely related to the
        porosity
        of
        the sample. However, for silica brick in general, they were able
        to
        find
        no particular connection between any characteristic property of
        the
        brick
        and its resistance to abrasion, but they concluded that it was
        influenced
        by any or all of the following factors: porosity, degree of
        burn,
        quality
        of ganister used as a raw material, percentage of lime used a s
        a bond,
        and workmanship. </p>
      <p>The action of salt is commonly regarded as one of the causes of
        trouble
        with refractories. This is not of importance in low temperature
        carbonization
        when externally heated retorts are used because the sodium
        chloride
        present
        in coals, often to the extent of 0.5%, does not begin to
        volatilize
        until
        about 800° C is reached. However, in internally heated processes
        by
        the method of partial gasification, as in the Maclaurin process,
        where
        the coal passes through an incandescent zone, this may be a
        matter of
        consequence. </p>
      <p>An explanation of salt erosion, as given by Gardner (262), is
        that
        the
        volatilized sodium chloride mixes with the as in the retort and
        is
        further
        decomposed, at least partially, into sodium carbonate and
        hydrochloric
        acid by reaction with carbon dioxide and water vapor. This
        reaction has
        already been discussed in Chapter V under the subject of ammonia
        decomposition.
        These vapors do not attack the surface of the brick, but
        penetrate the
        material to some extent and the corrosive vapors are deposited
        in the
        pores.
        The depth at which the reaction takes place depends upon the
        temperature
        within the refractory. The sodium carbonate fumes react with the
        alumina
        and silica to form sodium aluminum silicate. This compound has a
        low
        melting
        point and tends to convert the refractory to a porous and
        friable mass
        which disintegrates rapidly if the salt action is serious. In
        turn, the
        hydrochloric acid reacts with the iron in the coal ash to form
        ferric
        chloride,
        which also penetrates the refractory and decomposes to deposit
        iron
        oxide
        within the pores. The iron oxide tends to increase the fluxing
        action
        by
        combining with the sodium aluminum silicate. In the case of
        operation
        at
        low temperatures, the alkali fumes cause the refractory surfaces
        to
        become
        crazed after several years of work, but this action rarely
        interferes
        with
        the operation of the retort until decomposition begins to occur.
      </p>
      <p>A large amount of finely divided ash is carried over into the
        combustion
        chamber from the gas producer which is used to furnish gas for
        heating
        the retort. This hot ash exhibits a high affinity for
        refractories
        which
        contain more than a small percentage of alumina. At high
        temperature,
        this
        causes rapid slagging, especially if the material is one of a
        porous
        nature.
        As far as the retort itself is concerned, this slagging action
        of
        molten
        ash is not of great importance in low temperature plants,
        because the
        temperatures
        are kept at a minimum. In certain parts of the combustion
        chamber,
        however,
        the refractories are exposed to injury from this source. This is
        also
        true,
        in particular, for those low temperature processes in which
        heating by
        partial gasification is adopted, for here the fine particles of
        hot ash
        come in direct contact with the brick lining of the
        carbonization
        shaft.
        The extent to which ash slagging of the refractory takes place
        depends
        greatly upon the nature and composition of the material. In this
        respect,
        silica brick seems to stand up better than other types of
        refractories.
        Apparently, the absence of alumina, iron, and alkalies in this
        material,
        together with the large size of the silica grains, renders the
        attack
        of
        the ash much less severe. </p>
      <p>Quite a lot has been published on the disintegrating effect of
        carbon
        monoxide on brick containing iron oxide. This is of particular
        importance
        in low temperature processes involving partial gasification.
        Booze
        (265)
        has pointed out two obvious solutions of this problem: first,
        the use
        of
        brick free form iron oxide and second, the use of refractory
        that has
        been
        sufficiently hard-burnt to effect the union of iron with the
        slag to
        from
        silicate. It has been demonstrated, in the latter case, that
        disintegration
        does not take place, due either to the fact that the bricks are
        structurally
        stronger and able to withstand the disintegrating action or to
        the fact
        that iron in the form of a silicate is no longer able to
        function as a
        catalyst for the action of the carbon monoxide. While it has
        been
        objected
        that refractories, which are burnt sufficiently to effect
        formation of
        iron silicate, are so brittle that they spall readily, it has
        also been
        maintained that this is not necessarily the case and, even if
        they do
        spall,
        the injury is not so serious as the disintegrating effect of
        carbon
        monoxide. </p>
      <p>Aside from aluminous, siliceous, and silica materials, there
        are
        many
        other refractories which are available for retort and setting
        construction,
        but their cost or other peculiarities usually eliminate them
        from
        consideration.
        Carborundum bricks or shapes have many special advantages,
        particularly
        in the form of high thermal diffusivity and mechanical strength,
        but
        their
        initial cost is many times above that of fireclay products.
        Magnesite
        bricks,
        although highly desirable from the standpoint of their thermal
        properties,
        have not been satisfactory in coke ovens because of their
        tendency to
        spall.
        The practical question of cost is also a deterrent to the use of
        refractories
        made of this and such other materials as chromite and zircon. </p>
      <p>It is not good practice to use a single refractory throughout
        in
        setting
        construction, or even in the retort itself. By a prudent
        selection of
        materials,
        the contraction of one can be matched against the expansion of
        another,
        which with proper arrangement of expansion joints will prevent
        thermal
        distortion of the structure. It is best to segregate various
        section of
        the structure and consider the requirements for the refractory
        in each
        location with respect to temperature, load, heat transfer,
        expansion
        and
        contraction, abrasion, spalling, and salt and ash erosion. </p>
      <p>Leakage in refractory retorts is far more serious in low
        temperature
        than in high temperature carbonization practice for two reason:
        first,
        because the temperature control is more important in the former
        and
        high
        calorific gas, permeating into the combustion chamber, will
        render
        proper
        temperature regulation impossible, and second, because of the
        relatively
        small gas yield in primary distillation, escaping gas represents
        a far
        greater percentage loss. The size of the pores greatly affects
        the
        permeability
        of gas through refractories. There is a double advantage,
        therefore, in
        selecting material with fine pores, for not only does such a
        refractory
        have the minimum gas leakage, but also the maximum structural
        strength. </p>
      <p><a name="properties"></a><b>Properties of Refractories ~</b> </p>
      <p>Data on the thermal conductivity of refractories, and therefore
        on
        their
        thermal diffusivity are very scarce, and such as are available
        are in
        great
        disagreement among the authorities. Wologdine (266) made some
        measurements
        which are often quoted, but they were not or a rage of specific
        temperatures
        and were made on under-burnt refractories. For these reasons,
        they are
        open to such criticism that they will not be repeated here. Not
        only
        with
        regard to the absolute values of thermal conductivity is there
        great
        uncertainty,
        but much confusion also exists as to the relative heat
        conductivity of
        fireclay, of siliceous, and of silica refractories. Summarizing
        the
        situation,
        Gardner (262) concluded that, at moderate temperatures, there
        was
        probably
        very little difference between any of them, but at high
        temperatures,
        silica
        was undoubtedly superior to either fireclay or siliceous bricks.
        He
        attributes
        the high thermal conductivity of silica to a property of the
        material
        itself,
        though probably assisted by radiant heat transmission through
        the
        relatively
        numerous and large pores of that material. </p>
      <p>The measurements by Dudley (267), as well as those by Dougill,
        Hodsman,
        and Cobbs (268), apparently sustain the view taken by Gardner
        (262)
        that
        the thermal conductivity of silica is greater at high
        temperatures than
        that of other common refractories. In CGS units, Dudley reports
        the
        following
        conductivities at 100° C: fireclay 0.0016, quartzite 0.0020, and
        silica
        0.0022; which increased at 1000° C to: fireclay 0.0034,
        quartzite
        0.0034,
        and silica 0.0043. He also gave the mean thermal conductivity of
        magnesite,
        between 445° C and 830° C, as 0.013. Analysis of the fireclay
        showed
        it to contain 52.9% silica and 42.7% alumina. The quartzite
        brick
        analyzed
        73.9% silica and 22.9% alumina. Formerly this brick was
        frequently used
        in by-product oven construction. The silica brick, which
        contained
        95.9%
        silica, is extensively used in by-product oven construction. The
        magnesite
        brick was dead-burnt material, containing 86.5% magnesite and 7%
        ferric
        oxide. </p>
      <p>Hersey and Butzler (269) examined a Georgia fireclay brick and
        reported
        a true thermal conductivity of 0.00187 at 370° C and 0.00263 at
        910°
        C. Dougill, Hodsman and Cobb (268) measured the mean specific
        conductivity
        of a number of materials over the range extending approximately
        from
        350°
        C to 1350° C. The average of their results gave 0.0034 for
        fireclay,
        0.0025 for siliceous, 0.0036 for silica, and 0.0124 for
        magnesite
        brick.
        They reported the true thermal conductivity of magnesite to be
        0.0194
        at
        250° C, 0.0138 at 500° C, 0.0107 at 750° C, and 0.0092 at
        1000°
        C, thus showing a decrease in conductivity for this material as
        the
        temperature
        rises. The same authors found the true thermal conductivity for
        fireclay
        to be 0.0020 at 250° C, extending linearly to 0.0040 at 1000°
        C.
        Dougill, Hodsman, and Cobb quote some data by Heyn and Bauer,
        which are
        approximately in agreement with their measurements. These
        determinations
        at 500° C were: 0.0028 for fireclay, 0.0024 for silica, and
        0.014
        for
        magnesite; and at 1000° C they were: 0.0040 for fireclay, 0.0046
        for
        silica, and 0.0085 for magnesite. </p>
      <p>The disagreements of the measurements by Dudley (267), by
        Dougill,
        Hodsman,
        and Cobb (268), by Hern and Bauer, and by Hersey and Butzler
        (269) may
        not be looked upon as serious, considering the difficult nature
        of the
        experiments, but the results of this group of experimenters
        depart so
        much
        from the measurements obtained by Wologdine (266) and by Green,
        as
        hereinafter
        described, that all data on the thermal conductivity and
        diffusivity of
        refractories at high temperatures must be accepted with caution.
      </p>
      <p>By far the most extensive data on thermal conductivity have
        been
        gathered
        by Green (270-273). The curves in Figure 73 have been plotted
        from his
        figures, which should be used with care since they are lower
        than those
        quoted above by other authorities. As the thermal conductivity
        depends
        greatly upon the texture of the material, a short description of
        each
        sample
        will be given. Sample 1 and 2 were magnesite bricks of very
        close
        texture.
        Sample 1 had an apparent specific gravity of 2.56 and a true sp
        gr of
        3.38,
        while those of Sample 2 were 2.63 and 3.29, respectively. Sample
        3 and
        4 were of fireclay retort material. Sample 3 had a very close
        texture
        and
        evenly graded grog. Its apparent sp gr was 1.91 and its true sp
        gr was
        2.54. Sample 4 had a very open texture and unevenly graded grog.
        It
        contained
        an abundance of small fissures. The apparent sp gr was 1.85 and
        the
        true
        sp gr 2.45. Sample 5 and Sample 6 were of fireclay brick. Sample
        5 had
        a close structure with very few fissures and evenly graded
        silica
        grains.
        Its apparent sp gr was 2.03 and the true sp gr 2.46. Sample 6
        had a
        very
        open texture and poorly adhering unevenly graded grog. Its
        apparent sp
        gr was 1.92 and its true sp gr 2.46.S ample 7 and Sample 8 were
        of
        silica
        brick. Sample 7 had a uniform close fine-grained texture, but it
        was
        quite
        porous and friable. The apparent sp gr was 1.51 and the true sp
        gr
        2.20.
        Sample 8 had a very open texture with abundant large fissures.
        Its
        apparent
        sp gr was 1.77 and its true sp gr 2.31. Sample 9 and Sample 10
        were
        from
        the same batch of siliceous brick. Sample 10 had seen long use
        in a
        coke
        oven, while Sample 9 was unused. The texture of the unused
        material was
        very close. </p>
      <p>The thermal diffusivities for the same materials as illustrated
        in
        Figure
        73 are shown in Figure 74, from the measurements by Green (270,
        272).
        The
        CGS unit used to measure thermal diffusivity is the rise in
        temperature
        in one cubic centimeter of material by one calorie in one second
        through
        one square centimeter of a layer one centimeter thick by a
        temperature
        difference of one degree Centigrade. It will be observed that
        the
        relative
        thermal diffusivities of the various materials have only slight
        similarity
        to their relative conductivities. </p>
      <p>The silica brick used by Green (270) was of very poor quality,
        when
        judged from the standpoint of American practice, Silica bricks
        used in
        the US contain a larger percentage of silica, are denser, and
        not
        nearly
        so porous. This undoubtedly accounts for the unusually poor
        thermal
        values
        given for silica in Figure 73 and Figure 74. That the thermal
        properties
        of refractories depend greatly upon the temperature at which
        they were
        fired has been observed by Wologdine (266) and has been
        confirmed by
        others.
        This is especially true of silica brick, which has a remarkably
        low
        thermal
        conductivity when poorly fired. Green (271) concluded, regarding
        the
        relative
        thermal qualities of fireclay and silica products, that superior
        well-fired
        silica bricks are better heat conductors than those of fireclay
        below
        800°
        C and that most silica bricks, except those that have been
        ineffectively
        fired, are better conductors than fireclay at high temperatures.
        However,
        many silica bricks and firebricks have equal conductivities at
        low
        temperatures.
        Even though magnesite has a high conductivity, its high specific
        heat
        and
        high density reduce its diffusivity and, in fact, make it
        notably less
        than that of other materials at high temperatures. The thermal
        conductivity
        of used siliceous brick is form 10% higher at 500° C to 22%
        higher
        at 1300° C than that of most unused material. Although little
        change
        was observed in the specific gravity, Green (272) attributes
        this
        increase
        wit use to alterations in the texture of the material by changes
        in its
        constitution and porosity. The thermal conductivity of most all
        refractories,
        except that of magnesite, which is a particularly dense
        material, rises
        rapidly above 1000° C, probably because the transmission of heat
        by
        radiation across the pores of the material becomes sensibly
        appreciable,
        as compared with the heat transmission through the material by
        pure
        conduction. </p>

      <p>The mean specific heat of refractories is a function of the
        temperature,
        as may be seen in Figure 75. The curves have been plotted from
        data
        determined
        principally by Wilson, Holdcroft, and Mellor (274), by Bradshaw
        and
        Emery
        (276), and by Dudley (267), supplemented by the data collected
        by
        Wilkes
        (15). It is interesting to note the small difference between the
        mean
        specific
        heats of silica and fireclay refractories. In all of the common
        refractory
        materials, the mean specific heat increases practically linearly
        up to
        1000° C, after which there is an apparent falling off. Very few
        determinations
        have been published on the specific heat of carborundum, but
        Wilkes
        (15)
        reports a mean specific heat of 0.201 at 100° C and 0.187 at
        1000°
        C for this material, which seems to indicate that its heat
        capacity
        decreases
        with the temperature, as contrasted with the increase observed
        in other
        materials. </p>
      <p>Heretofore, the author has made frequent reference to the
        spalling
        of
        refractories, particularly of silica brick, without any
        consideration
        being
        given to the cause of this phenomenon. According to Searle
        (263),
        spalling
        is the tendency of refractories to flake caused by the
        appearance of
        numerous
        fine cracks when the material is subjected to frequent sudden
        heating.
        It naturally results in a reduction of strength of the material
        and
        finally
        is responsible for its complete failure by disintegration. The
        cause of
        these cracks is attributed to the sudden transformation of
        quartz into
        tridymite or cristobalite, due to its incomplete conversion
        during
        burning.
        This situation is particularly liable to occur when a flame
        plays
        directly
        on the refractory. It can be avoided by carefully heating the
        material
        gradually so that the conversion of the quartz to its other
        allotropic
        form may occur slowly. Repeated heating of silica brick to 800°
        C
        at
        a slow rate will reduce the tendency to the material to spall.
        Tridymite
        bricks are well known to spall less than those of quartz or of
        cristobalite,
        and this procedure favors the formation of tridymite. The
        average loss
        by spalling of a brick is about 30%, but it varies directly with
        the
        fineness
        of the material. Consequently, a coarse-grained brick should be
        used
        where
        it is desirable to reduce spalling to a minimum, unless other
        properties
        possessed by such a material make its selection unwise. If
        properly
        manufactured,
        machine-made bricks spall no more than the hand-made ones. </p>
      <p>An example of the effect of heating below 700° C on the
        spalling
        of silica brick has been furnished by Ross (276), who found that
        the
        specimen
        invariably spalled when heated at the rate of 270° C in 20
        minutes,
        520° C in 40 minutes, and 690° C in 60 minutes. When, however,
        the rate of heating was reduced to 50° C in 15 minutes, up to
        500°
        C, and 100° C in 15 minutes, above that temperature, spalling
        seldom
        occurred. He concluded, however, that the changes in the brick
        structure
        which caused spalling took place below 500° C. </p>
      <p>The composition of all refractories consists largely of a mass
        of
        crystals
        which may have several allotropic forms, each of which is stable
        only
        over
        a limited range of temperature. A large change in volume usually
        accompanies
        the inversion of one allotropic form into another and these
        changes are
        sharply defined in the expansion curve for the material. In this
        respect,
        silica is the chief constituent of refractories to be reckoned
        with.
        The
        curves in Figure 76 give the linear thermal expansion of some
        common
        refractories,
        as determined by Norton (277). These data agree with the less
        precise
        measurements
        of Bogitch (278) for magnesite up to 1400° C and for chromite up
        to
        900° C. </p>

      <p>The silica sample was cut from an ordinary commercial brick
        containing
        about 97% silica. Its thermal expansion rose rapidly to 1.09% at
        260°
        C, at which volume it remained constant until 620° C was
        reached.
        The
        length of the sample then suddenly increased to 1.29%. Since
        only about
        5% tridymite was present, there is no indication of inversion of
        that
        allotropic
        form of silica at 110° C. At 260° C, the conversion of
        a-crystobalite
        to B-cristobalite, together present to the extent of about 70%,
        is
        clearly
        defined. Quartz was present in an amount approaching 25% and its
        inversion
        at 610° C is very sharp. Beyond 620° C, the brick contracted
        uniformly
        of about 1400° C, and then expanded rapidly to a maximum at
        1525°
        C, due to the conversion of quartz to cristobalite. At about
        1525°
        C, the brick again began to shrink and started to soften at
        1700°
        C. </p>
      <p>The composite curve for kaolin is plotted from 3 samples fired
        at
        different
        temperatures, ranging from 1430° C to 1620° C, and represents
        approximately
        the characteristic of a sample burnt at 1500° C. The expansion
        of a
        kaolin brick, fired at 1430° C, is about 21% above the composite
        curve
        and that for a sample fired at 1620° C is approximately 21% less
        than
        the composite curve. Kaolin brick expands more or less uniformly
        up to
        about 1400° C, beyond which a permanent shrinkage takes place.
        In
        general,
        it may be said that permanent contraction begins to appear just
        below
        the
        temperature at which the brick was burnt. There are slight
        irregularities
        in the expansion curve for kaolin, not showing the composite
        curve, but
        these are unimportant and occur principally from inversions of
        small
        amount
        of silica present as a bond or as an impurity. </p>
      <p>The composite curve for fireclay is constructed from 4 samples
        of
        brick
        from Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The specimen from
        Missouri
        contained
        53.1% silica, that from Pennsylvania 54.2%, that from Colorado
        62.6%,
        and
        that from Maryland 62.3%. Each individual sample departed more
        or less
        from the composite curve to the extent of perhaps 20%, at
        points, due
        to
        silica inversions. On the whole, however, the increase in linear
        expansion
        for fireclay can be considered approximately uniform up to about
        1000°
        C, beyond which there was a contraction in every case, except
        that of
        the
        Pennsylvania sample, which began to increase rapidly in length
        at
        1250°
        C, finally reaching 4.8% expansion at 1600° C. The Maryland
        brick
        began
        to contract rapidly at 1000° C, and continued to do so until it
        fell
        to a total expansion of only about 0.11% a 1400° C, beyond which
        it
        again increased in a manner similar to the specimen from
        Pennsylvania,
        reaching finally 2.2% at 1600° C. </p>
      <p>The expansion of carborundum was almost linear, was less than
        that
        of
        the other refractories. And showed no sign of contraction up to
        1700°
        C. The zirconia brick contained 27.3% silica, which accounts for
        the
        fluctuations
        of its expansion curve. It will be observed that these
        variations are
        closely
        related to those in the curve for silica brick. The general
        trend in
        expansion
        of the magnesite brick was a uniform increase up to 1440° C,
        after
        which an irreversible shrinkage occurred, due probably to
        inversion of
        periclase. Except for small irregularities, due no doubt to a
        small
        amount
        of free silica, the chromite brick expanded uniformly to about
        900°
        C, beyond which there was a tremendous change in size up to
        1000°
        C.
        Thereafter there was a slow contraction up to 1500° C, after
        which
        a rapid contraction developed. The similarity of the
        diatomaceous earth
        insulating brick expansion curve with that of silica shows the
        former
        to
        be composed largely of that material. The insulating brick
        shrank
        rapidly
        beyond 1100° C. </p>
      <p>Silica bricks expands as much as 20% of their original size
        when
        fired
        and this is accompanied by a reduction in specific gravity from
        about
        2.60
        to about 2.30. In fact, the specific gravity furnishes a good
        indication
        of the extent to which the brick has been burnt. This expansion
        is due
        to a conversion of quartz, whose specific gravity is 2.65, to
        the
        allotropic
        modifications of crystobalite and tridymite with specific
        gravities of
        2.33 and 2.27, respectively. However, since the conversion is
        never
        complete,
        even though the brick be twice burnt, there is always a further
        permanent
        expansion which takes place during use and must be allowed for
        by
        providing
        expansion joints or openings at intervals in the brickwork. In
        practice,
        approximately 0.25 inches per linear feet is allowed for this
        purpose. </p>
      <p>Norton (279) considers the tendency of a brick to spall as
        being
        directly
        proportional to its coefficient of linear expansion, other
        things being
        equal. Since this coefficient varies with the temperature, it is
        necessary
        to pick out the temperature at which spalling occurs. This has
        been
        determined
        as between 300° C and 700° C. In the light of this theory, the
        curves in Figure 76 fully account for the observation that
        silica and
        chromite
        spall very easily. </p>
      <p>The crushing strength of a refractory depends upon the amount
        of
        cementing
        material which has been fused during burning to bind the
        particles of
        the
        material together. The strength, consequently, is contingent
        upon the
        temperature
        and duration of the burn. When the refractory is subsequently
        heated
        intensely,
        a part of this cementing material fuses and lessens the strength
        of the
        brick, so that it deforms easily under load. We have already
        seen in
        Table
        116 an illustration of the way the squatting temperature is
        reduced
        under
        load. Another example ha been reported by Mellor (280), who
        examined a
        number of British fireclays. In a number of samples, whose
        unloaded
        melting
        point average 1640° C, with a range extending from 1580° C to
        1690°
        C, the average melting point under a load of 54 psi was 1415° C,
        with
        a range of 1380° C to 1435° C. When the load was increased to
        72
        psi, the average fusion point was 1395° C, with a range of
        1350°
        C to 1395° C. Mellor has suggested that the relationship between
        the
        bending temperature, <i>T</i>, and the pressure applied may be
        represented
        by the formula: </p>
      <p>[29]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T = T<sub>0</sub> <i>E </i><sup><font
            size="-1">-CW</font></sup> </p>
      <p>where T<sub>0</sub> is the bending temperature without load; <i>W</i>
        is the pressure in psi, and <i>C</i> is a numerical constant
        depending
        upon the clay, mode of manufacture, etc. </p>
      <p>There is much discrepancy between the crushing strengths of
        different
        samples of the same refractory, tested at various temperatures,
        as will
        be observed from Table 117. The data in this table are all taken
        from
        the
        measurements by Bodin (281), except those for the third sample
        of
        silica
        brick, which are by Le Chatelier (282). The variation between
        the
        respective
        samples of a given material arise from such factors of
        manufacture as
        the
        kind and quantity of bond used, firing temperature of the kiln,
        duration
        of burn, pressure used in molding, etc. Thus Sample 1 of bauxite
        was
        fired
        at 1500° C and Sample 2 at 1300° C. The figures of Bodin are
        probably
        somewhat high for commercial bricks, as they were made on small
        test
        specimens.
        The crushing strength of common refractories decreases with rise
        in
        temperature
        up to about 800° C. Strange as it may seem, Bodin (281) found
        that
        thereafter the strength increases rapidly until approximately
        1000°
        C is reached, due probably to a transition in the structure of
        the
        material.
        Thereafter, the crushing strength falls rapidly with rise in
        temperature.
        Magnesite and chromite refractories were exceptional in that no
        increase
        in strength was observed between 800° C and 1000° C. </p>

      <p><a name="metallic"></a><b>Metallic Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>In the past, cast-iron retorts were used extensively in
        gasworks,
        as
        we have seen, but they were later supplanted by refractory
        retorts for
        a number of reasons. For high or moderate temperature
        carbonization,
        the
        refractory retorts had the advantage of being cheaper, more
        durable,
        and
        more refractory, which is to say, that they were capable of
        operating
        without
        injury at a higher temperature. On the other hand, for such
        operating
        temperatures,
        clay retorts have one serious disadvantage, as compared to those
        of
        cast-iron;
        that is, they do not stand cooling down, invariably contracting
        and
        subsequently
        cracking. But neither is cast-iron perfect in this respect, as
        we shall
        see later, for it is subject to growth upon repeated heatings.
        As far
        as
        low temperature carbonization is concerned, there are two big
        advantages
        to metallic retorts, such that, if other difficulties can be
        surmounted,
        they are vastly superior to refractories. As already pointed
        out, these
        advantages are principally, first, the highly desirable thermal
        properties
        of metals, and second, the absence of gas leakage. Of somewhat
        minor
        importance
        is the lesser retort breakage and the adaptability of metal
        retorts to
        the use of moving parts which may be used to effect the
        transportation
        and discharge of the material that is being carbonized. </p>
      <p>Cast-iron retorts have certain advantages over other types of
        metallic
        retorts. In the first place, it is the cheapest metal; second,
        it is
        almost
        as strong as ordinary cast steel, within the temperature range
        of low
        temperature
        carbonization; third, it has excellent corrosion-resisting
        qualities,
        and
        fourth, it lends itself to cheap quantity production. However,
        the
        designer
        of a cast-iron retort is confronted with a number of difficult
        problems.
        In addition to the usual expansion, which can be provided for
        when
        designing
        the retort setting, and the problem of warping, which can be
        taken care
        of by strengthening the retort with carefully placed ribbing and
        proper
        design of the setting to prevent local overheating, there is the
        question
        of the growth in cast-iron after repeated heatings, especially
        when
        superheated
        steam is present. </p>
      <p>Carpenter (283) has demonstrated, as we shall see later, that
        cast-iron
        growth is greatest in casting of high silicon content and least
        in
        castings
        of low silicon. He attributes this to the fact that the silicon
        is
        present
        in the iron as iron silicide, which reacts with the graphite
        present to
        form oxidizing gases, which in turn attack the iron chemically.
        Without
        the presence of graphite the silicon has no effect. Carpenter
        (284)
        fully
        recognized that, while there is little difficulty in getting
        suitable
        cast-iron
        to stand temperatures up to 625° C, it was another matter, and a
        very
        difficult one at that, the get a casting which would withstand
        use at
        650°
        C. he suggested that the use of chromium as an alloy, in
        preference to
        manganese, was good practice in many such cases. </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board has had a rather successful experience
        in
        the
        use of mild steel retorts in their horizontal setting. Mild
        steel does
        not suffer from growth like cast-iron, but it is easily
        overheated to
        produce
        softening slightly above 600° C. Moreover, mild steel has a low
        elastic
        limit, within the temperature range used for primary
        distillation, and
        suffers a creep, after a time, at loads below the elastic limit.
        This
        creep
        has been particularly noted in low temperature rotary retorts
        which
        have
        been supported on trunnions only at the ends of the heated
        cylinder. In
        such cases, there has been a creep, sometimes mistaken for
        growth
        similar
        to cast-iron, of sufficient magnitude as to cause the retort to
        become
        inoperative. This difficulty has been ingeniously overcome in
        the
        K.S.G.
        retort by supporting the entire load from an inner cooler
        cylinder, as
        has been pointed out already in Chapter VI. </p>
      <p>Efforts have been made to discover ferrous and other alloys
        which
        would
        withstand usage at high temperatures and these investigations
        have in
        part
        been successful. There are a number of metals of various
        compositions
        which
        have the desired properties at elevated temperatures for primary
        carbonization
        retorts. Unfortunately, however, these alloys are all so
        expensive, at
        the present time, as to render their use entirely prohibitive
        from a
        commercial
        standpoint. </p>
      <p><a name="castiron"></a><b>Properties of Cast-Iron ~</b> </p>
      <p>Principal among the properties of cast-iron is its tensile
        strength
        and the manner in which this characteristic varies with the
        temperature.
        One of the features to be observed in this metal is the fact
        that the
        change
        in tensile strength of cast iron up to 850 F is comparatively
        small.
        There
        are some indications of a maximum between 650° F and 900° F.
        Above
        the latter temperature the metal softens rapidly and the tensile
        strength
        accordingly drops sharply. </p>
      <p>The curves in Figure 77 give the tensile strength of
        cast-irons,
        as
        a function of temperature, for a variety of different alloys
        from
        measurements
        by a number of authorities. Specimen 1, after Schwartz (285),
        was a
        malleable
        cast-iron containing from 2.8% to 3.5% carbon and 1.1% to 2%
        silicon.
        Specimen
        2 was also a malleable cast-iron from another source (286) and
        of
        unknown
        composition. Specimen 3 was a semi-steel of unknown composition
        (286).
        Specimen 4 was a semi-steel, as measured by Harper and
        MacPherran
        (287).
        It contained 1.84% silicon, 0.106% sulfur, 0.52% phosphorus, and
        0.64%
        manganese. Specimen 5 was a semi-steel which contained 2.8%
        total
        carbon,
        of which 1.6% to 2% was graphite, and 1.1% to 1.4% silicon.
        Specimen 6,
        also a semi-steel, contained 3.1% total carbon, of which 2.1% to
        2.4%
        was
        graphite, and 1.3% to 2% silicon. Specimen 7 was a cast-iron
        which
        contained
        3% to 3.3% total carbon, of which 2.7% was graphite, and 1.1% to
        2%
        silicon.
        Specimens 5a, 6a, and 7a were all annealed, while Specimens 5b,
        6b, and
        7b were all as cast. Specimens 8 and 9 are for cast-irons form
        the
        results
        obtained by Smalley (289). Specimen 8 analyzed 3.3% total
        carbon, of
        which
        2.8% was graphite, and 2.2% to 2.7% silicon, while Specimen 9
        showed
        3.7%
        total carbon, with 3.5% graphite, and 2.9% silicon. From these
        curves,
        the difficulty of working cast-iron, or indeed any other metal,
        continuously
        over a temperature range from 1000° F to 1200° F may be easily
        appreciated. But we shall se later that the whole trouble does
        not stop
        here, in the case of cast-iron, which has the unfortunate habit
        of
        growth
        with time and temperature. </p>

      <p>Kennedy and Oswald (290) studied the effects of various
        percentages
        of silicon, nickel, and chromium on the strength and other
        properties
        of
        cast-iron. With about 1.4% silicon and no chromium present, the
        tensile
        strength reached a maximum increase of 52%, over the base metal,
        with
        the
        addition of 3.88% nickel, 45% of which increase was obtained
        with 1.23%
        nickel. With about 1.4% silicon and 0.51% chromium the highest
        value of
        57% increase in tensile strength was obtained with the addition
        of 1.1%
        nickel. With higher silicon content, the effect of nickel in
        increasing
        the strength of cast-iron was not so noticeable. Silicon
        apparently
        destroys
        the effectiveness of nickel in strengthening iron, unless means
        are
        taken
        to counteract it, as by the addition of chromium. Thus, with the
        presence
        of about 2.6% silicon and increasing amounts of nickel and
        chromium,
        the
        maximum increase in tensile strength of about 35%, was obtained
        with
        the
        presence of 0.85% nickel and 0.59% chromium. </p>
      <p>The specific gravity (291) of wrought iron varies from 7.8 to
        7.9,
        that
        of white cast-iron extends from 7.58 to 7.73, while gray
        cast-iron
        ranges
        for 7.03 to 7.13 at ordinary temperatures. The mean specific
        heat of
        cast-iron,
        from 20° C to 100° C, is 0.1189 according to Schmitz (292), but
        Honda, as quoted by Hatfield, Wollman, and Priest (15), gives as
        the
        mean
        specific heat from 0° C to 100° C the value of 0.131 to 0.142
        for
        the material as cast and 0.116 to 1.139 when the material was
        annealed.
        Nichol (293) made some measurements on the mean specific heat of
        wrought
        iron over several short temperature ranges. From 15° C to 100°
        C he found it to be 0.1152; at 500° C he gave it the value
        0.176,
        and
        from 1000° C to 1200° C he measured the mean specific heat of
        wrought
        iron as 0.1989. The mean specific heat of a rather pure sample
        of iron
        from 0° C to various temperatures has been accurately determined
        by
        Harker (294). His data have been plotted in Figure 75, along
        with the
        mean
        specific heats of refractories. It will be observed from the
        illustration,
        that the results are not greatly different from those for
        zirconia
        brick.
        Schwartz (285) has calculated the true specific heat of
        malleable
        cast-iron
        and found it to be approximately 0.108 at 0° C; 0.135 at 250°
        C,
        and 0.180 at 500° C. </p>
      <p>Very little information is available on the thermal
        conductivity
        of
        cast-iron. Kaye and Laby (295) gave 0.149 as the mean
        conductivity
        between
        0° C and 100° C. Some data by Jaeger and Diesselhorst (291)
        give
        the thermal conductivity of wrought iron as 0.144 at 18° C and
        0.143
        at 100° C, with a decrease of 0.00008 for each degree Centigrade
        increase
        in temperature. It can be deduced, however, that the thermal
        conductivity
        decreases with temperature, for the case of electrical
        conductivity in
        metals and the two phenomena are closely related. Without an
        adequate
        knowledge
        of the thermal conductivity at high temperatures, it is
        impossible to
        calculate
        the thermal diffusivity, except for ordinary temperatures.
        Ingersoll
        and
        Zobel (296) report the thermal diffusivity of cast-iron at
        ordinary
        temperatures
        as 0.121 and of wrought iron as 0.173, which data are sufficient
        to
        indicate
        that, in order of magnitude, the thermal conductivity and
        diffusivity
        are
        several hundred fold greater than those found in refractories. </p>
      <p>Schwartz (285) has measured the thermal expansion of malleable
        cast-iron
        up to 1100° F, as shown in Figure 80. This is the same sample of
        material
        whose tensile strength was reported as Sample 1 in Figure 77.
        His
        results
        are in agreement with the measurements of Souder and Hidnert
        (297), who
        carried their temperatures up to 1650° F, where vast changes in
        the
        structure of the material took place. The sample tested by them
        contained
        3.08% carbon and 1.68% silicon. Reference to Figure 80 shows the
        expansion
        and contraction which accompanied the heating of this sample of
        cast-iron.
        The linear growth upon cooling amounted to 0.92% for one
        heating. </p>
      <p>The growth of some cast-irons may be tremendous. Thus, Regan
        and
        Carpenter
        (298) observed a volume increase of 63% after 32 heatings to
        850° C
        in a cast-iron containing 3.38% carbon, 6.14% silicon, 0.30%
        manganese,
        and negligible quantities of sulfur and phosphorus. This was, of
        course,
        exceptional, but volume increases of half this amount are not
        extraordinary.
        Since the volume changes more rapidly than the weight during
        growth,
        the
        specific gravity of cast-iron decreases with repeated heating
        and with
        it there is a decided change in the physical properties of the
        material.
        Its mechanical strength and thermal characteristics suffer
        accordingly.
        The action can proceed so far that a failure in tensile strength
        may
        occur,
        or even advance to a stage where the casting can be crumpled
        between
        the
        fingers. </p>
      <p>Outerbridge (299, 300) conducted the first systematic
        examination
        of
        cast-iron growth. He observed that white cast-irons do not grow
        to the
        same extent as gray cast-irons and established that the breakup
        of the
        carbides through the separation of graphitic carbon was
        insufficient,
        in
        itself, to account for the phenomenon. Rugan and Carpenter
        (298),
        however,
        were the first to demonstrate that the volumetric changes were
        accompanied
        by a gravimetric increase, form which they were able to advance
        a
        theory
        for the action which has been accepted rather generally. They
        laid
        particular
        stress on the influence of silicon, to which exception has been
        taken
        by
        others. While it cannot be denied that the amount of silicon
        present is
        of great import, its influence is apparently of an indirect
        nature, in
        that it favors the separation of large graphite flakes which
        make the
        alloy
        ductile and assist the premature appearance of cracks. </p>
      <p>The effect of temperature, in accelerating the linear growth of
        cast-iron,
        is well illustrated in Figure 78, which is plotted from
        measurements by
        Schwinning and Flossner (301). The sample in question was
        composed of
        3.49%
        carbon, 2.56% silicon, 0.46% manganese, 0.735% phosphorus, and
        0.135%
        sulfur.
        The growth began slowly at about 450° C and was strong at 500°
        C. Microscopic examination revealed that the first period of
        slow
        growth
        up to 18 heatings, of 3-hour duration, was accompanied by a slow
        change
        of pearlitic structure into a mixture of pearlite and cementite.
        No
        decomposition
        of the carbide was noted until the second stage of growth, after
        the
        18th
        heating, where the cementite was destroyed with the release of
        graphitic
        carbon, which sets in veins and grew in thickness until all the
        material
        was ferrite. At 650° C the early stages of growth were entirely
        eliminated
        and destruction of the carbide set in at once. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The usefulness of cast-iron in the construction of low
        temperature
        retorts,
        or its appurtenances, has been restricted by the tendency of
        this
        material
        to undergo permanent volume changes, when the castings are
        repeatedly
        heated
        or used continuously in the vicinity of 650° C or even lower
        temperatures.
        The phenomenon depends not only upon the factors of time and
        temperature,
        but upon the composition. In general, white cast-irons and gray
        cast-irons
        grow, but Rugan and Carpenter (298) observed that white
        cast-irons,
        which
        contain more than 3% carbon, tend to deposit temper carbon upon
        prolonged
        heating, which in turn contributes to the metal's expansion.
        They found
        that white cast-iron, which contained about 3% carbon and
        negligible
        amounts
        of the other constituents, and especially one in which the
        silicon
        content
        did not exceed 0.3%, remained practically constant in volume
        when
        heated
        many times to 900° C. </p>
      <p>The effect of the various elements on the growth of cast-iron
        was
        studied
        also by Rugan and Carpenter (298) and later by Carpenter (302).
        They
        found
        the phosphorus tends to reduce growth, to the extent that the
        presence
        of 0.3% phosphorus lessens the growth about 3%. Manganese
        retards the
        rate
        of growth and in most cases diminishes the absolute amount. The
        small
        quantity
        of sulfur found in commercial cast-iron has only a minor effect
        and
        this
        contributes to the action's retardation. The presence of
        dissolved gas
        may cause an expansion of 1% to 2% when the silicon content is
        1.75% to
        3%, but with the silicon present exceeding the higher figure,
        occluded
        gas has no influence. When the silicon amounts to less than 1%,
        dissolved
        gases may cause a growth to the extent of as much as 10%.
        Broadly
        speaking,
        the percentage volume growth is proportional to the percentage
        of
        silicon
        present, which according to Carpenter (284) amounts to a 15%
        volume
        increase
        with 1% silicon, 27% with 2% silicon, and 37% with 3.5% silicon.
      </p>
      <p>Rugan and Carpenter (298), as a result of their investigations,
        recommended
        the use of a special semi-steel for high temperature work. Its
        composition
        consists of 2.66% total carbon, all of which should be combined,
        0.59%
        silicon, and 1.64% manganese, with 0.01% sulfur and phosphorus.
        Such a
        casting showed no growth, but on the contrary, a slight
        contraction of
        0.13% after 150 heatings to 850° C. This sample had a tensile
        strength
        of 50,200 psi initially, which increased to 55,300 psi after
        conclusion
        of the heatings. Analysis showed 2.37% combined carbon and 0.25%
        temper
        carbon at the end of the experiment, representing a conversion
        of only
        9.6%. </p>
      <p>The mechanism of cast-iron growth is only partially understood.
        It
        is
        generally agreed that the phenomenon is due in part to the
        deposition
        of
        carbon as a result of the breaking down of iron carbide, and in
        part to
        oxidation of the elements present. While occlusion of gasses in
        the
        metal,
        together with casting stresses, may also be factors contributory
        to
        growth,
        opinions differ widely among the authorities regarding the
        relative
        importance
        of each, and, in fact, even in regard to the sequence of events
        leading
        up to expansion. It is generally accepted, however, that the
        presence
        of
        silicon is highly undesirable and that the rate at which the
        metal
        deteriorates
        is roughly proportional to the amount of silicon present. </p>
      <p>Carpenter (283) definitely concluded that silicon was chiefly
        responsible
        for swelling in the gray cast-irons examined by him, whether the
        cause
        of growth be superheated steam above 150° C, hot furnace gases,
        hot
        air, or repeated and prolonged heating at high or low
        temperatures.
        According
        to his view, silicon is preset as dissolved iron silicide, but
        this is
        absolutely innocuous unless graphite is present, by thermal
        decomposition
        of cementite or otherwise, so that the breaking down of iron
        silicide
        into
        silicon and iron oxide permits the penetration of oxidizing
        gases,
        which
        attack the metal chemically. The solution of the problem
        naturally
        resides
        in using an alloy which contains no free carbon and which
        further does
        not deposit it upon prolonged or repeated heating. Consequently,
        Carpenter
        (283) concluded that no gray cast-iron and only a few white
        cast-irons
        were suitable for use under such conditions. The choice of a
        suitable
        material
        thereby leads to a consideration of the many varieties of mild,
        medium,
        and hard steels, all of which have no free carbon, do not
        deposit it
        upon
        prolonged or repeated heating, and which are low in silicon
        content.
        The
        presence of manganese retards the deposition of temper carbon
        and
        toughens
        the alloy. </p>
      <p>On the other and, Oberhofer and Piwowarsky (303), as well as
        Honegger
        (304), conclude that the mere presence of silicon does not
        necessarily
        cause rapid growth in cast-iron, but that everything depends
        upon the
        size
        and arrangement of the graphite plates. Even if relatively low
        in
        silicon,
        an iron tends to grow rapidly, if during solidification it is
        cooled at
        such a rate as will cause the production of coarse graphite
        plates. </p>
      <p>Pearson (305) examined the growth of cast-irons of low silicon
        content,
        including among other two samples made by the hot-mold process.
        Repeated
        heating to 900° C for one-hour periods showed a constant
        increase
        in
        length at the end of about 40 heatings, the volume increase
        being about
        5.47%, as compared with 16% to 37% observed in ordinary
        commercial gray
        cast-irons. The sample in question contained 3.33% carbon and
        0.68%
        silicon.
        Similar results for hot-molded low silicon cast-iron were
        obtained by
        Donaldson
        (306), except that his tests were carried only up to 550° C. In
        many
        instances, where a white cast-iron could be successfully used as
        a
        heat-resisting
        metal, the difficulty of producing the castings without internal
        strains,
        liable to cause cracks, is a practical foundry consideration
        which
        renders
        its use impractical. The hot-mold process, however, deserves
        consideration
        on this score in that it gives a means, hitherto unavailable, of
        producing
        a machinable gray cast-iron from pigs of such low silicon
        content as
        would
        yield a white or mottled iron under ordinary conditions. </p>
      <p>Andrew and Hyman (307) made a comprehensive study of the effect
        of
        various
        alloys on cast-iron growth, using a base material containing 3%
        to 4%
        carbon,
        0.4% to 1.6% silicon, and 0.5% to 1.8% manganese. After 50
        heatings to
        900° C, the sample containing nickel had increased in length
        about
        9.5%, the samples containing chromium about 5% and 3.5%
        respectively.
        It
        appears, therefore, that aluminum and nickel have an action
        similar to
        silicon in favoring the deposition of temper carbon, which is
        detrimental
        to the casting from the standpoint of growth. Kennedy and Oswald
        (290)
        investigated the effect of other alloys and confirmed the
        conclusion of
        Rugan and Carpenter (298) that high phosphorus has a marked
        influence
        in
        slowing the rate of growth. They also observed that an iron
        deoxidized
        with titanium grew much more slowly than one of the same
        composition
        with
        that element absent. </p>
      <p><a name="steel"></a><b>Properties of Steel ~</b> </p>
      <p>The tensile properties of steel depend greatly upon its
        composition
        and quite as much upon the treatment which it receives during
        manufacture.
        The variations in composition are so infinite and the special
        treatments
        by rolling, forging, annealing, and quenching are so numberless
        that it
        is quite beyond the scope of this book to undertake a detailed
        discussion
        of this subject. It can be said, in general, regarding the
        tensile
        strength
        of carbon steels, that for temperatures below 850° F the cast
        sample
        has the lowest value, the cast and annealed specimen is somewhat
        stronger,
        the rolled sample has even a higher value, and finally, the
        rolled and
        heat-treated specimen has the highest tensile strength of all.
        However,
        above 850° F and extending to beyond 1400° F, a statistical
        examination
        of the determination by many authorities has convinced the
        present
        author
        that in this temperature region there is no particular advantage
        to
        either
        heat-treatment or rolling in the average case, as will be
        observed from
        Figure 79. This statement does not apply to the case of mild
        steels,
        with
        0.15% and less of carbon, for the results of this study indicate
        that
        cast
        mild steel possibly has a stronger tensile strength between 800°
        F
        and beyond 1400° F than the rolled variety, so far as
        conclusions
        may
        be drawn with limited data. Neither does the statement apply to
        high
        carbon
        steels with carbon contents exceeding 0.9%, in which case the
        difference
        between the tensile strengths of the rolled an cast samples is
        quite
        indistinct
        over the entire range of temperatures. This generalized
        conclusion is a
        statistical statement and hence great departures are found in
        individual
        samples. </p>

      <p>The data in Figure 79 are composite curves which represent the
        average
        result for carbon steels containing 0.4% to 0.8% manganese, 0.1%
        to
        0.6%
        silicon, 0.005% to 0.04% phosphorus, and 0.02% to 0.005% sulfur.
        The
        ultimate
        short-time tensile strength, as a function of the temperature,
        is given
        for each of 3 cast steels, of carious carbon contents, and also
        for 3
        rolled
        steels. The measurements for alloy steels are for individual
        samples.
        Sample
        1 represents a cast steel containing 0.15% carbon. It is plotted
        principally
        from the results obtained by Dupuy (308). Sample 2 represents a
        cast
        steel
        containing 0.30% carbon. It is the composite result of
        measurements by
        Malcolm (309) and by Dupuy (308), together with another sample
        of
        unknown
        composition (286). Sample 3 represents a cast steel with 0.55%
        carbon.
        It is the composite curve from data gathered by Dupuy (308), by
        Tapsell
        and Clenshaw (310), and by Malcolm, as he is quoted by French
        and
        Tucker
        (311). Sample 4 is the characteristic curve of a rolled steel
        containing
        0.15% carbon. It is the composite result of measurements by
        French and
        Tucker (311, 312), by White and Clark (313), and by Dupuy (308).
        Sample
        5 represents a rolled steel with 0.35% carbon. It is the
        composite
        result
        of determinations by Fahrenwald (314), by Lynch, Mochel, and
        McVetty
        (315),
        by French and Tucker (311), by French (316), by Perrine and
        Spencer
        (317),
        and by Dupuy (308). Sample 3 represents the characteristic of a
        rolled
        steel which contains 0.6% carbon. It is plotted from the results
        obtained
        by Tapsell and Clenshaw (310), by French and Tucker (311), by
        Dupuy
        (308),
        and by Dickenson (318). </p>
      <p>As compared with the cast-irons, semi-steels, and malleable
        irons
        illustrated
        in Figure 77, it can be said that the maximum allowable tensile
        stresses
        above 900° F of those materials do not differ much from the
        maximum
        allowable tensile stresses of the carbon steels illustrated in
        Figure
        79,
        considering the tendency of the latter to creep. It has already
        been
        pointed
        out that the main advantage of steel over cast-iron in the
        construction
        of low temperature retorts is the absence of growth in the
        former, but
        on the other hand, steel tends to creep under load, at
        temperatures
        above
        500° F, and this phenomenon generally requires the use of a much
        lower
        stress than the ultimate strength of the material would
        indicate. As a
        matter of fact, according to Mellanby and Kerr (319), at 1000° F
        the
        creep limit of 0.35% carbon steel is only 20% of its ultimate
        tensile
        strength,
        whereas with a chrome-nickel steel, the creep limit was
        approximately
        45%
        of the ultimate strength of that temperature. It can be said, in
        general,
        that the higher the temperature, the smaller is the creep limit
        when
        computed
        as a percentage of the tensile strength. </p>
      <p>The tensile strength of alloy steels have been pretty well
        investigated
        at elevated temperatures, though the measurements have rarely
        been
        carried
        higher than 1100° F. Determinations of the tensile strength have
        been
        made by MacPherran (320), who investigated a great variety of
        alloys,
        by
        Bregowsky and Spring (321), by Lynch, Mochelm and McVetty (315),
        by
        French
        and Tucker (312), and by Malcolm and Welter, as they are quoted
        by
        French
        and Tucker (311). Mockel (322) also examined 15 samples of high
        chromium
        stainless steels. The tensile strengths of some of these
        specimens of
        ferrous
        alloys are included in Figure 79 for purpose of comparison with
        carbon
        steels. </p>
      <p>The properties of alloy steels doubtlessly render them of great
        value
        for high temperature use, but their cost is practically
        prohibitive for
        the construction of low temperature retorts. Like carbon steels,
        alloy
        steels are also subject to creep. Malcolm (323) feels perfectly
        assured
        that cast chrome-nickel alloy steel will stand severe service
        without
        deformation
        over long periods, provided the following maximum allowable
        stresses
        are
        not exceeded: 26,000 psi at 600° F; 18,000 psi at 850° F, and
        6,000
        psi at 1100° F. For ordinary cast carbon steel he recommends the
        use
        of only about 60% of these allowable stresses. </p>
      <p>The thermal expansion of a manganese steel, containing 0.49%
        carbon,
        1.21% manganese, and 0.12% silicon, as determined by Souder and
        Hidnert
        (297), is given in Figure 80, along with the thermal expansion
        of
        cast-iron,
        which has already been discussed. As a matter of fact, there is
        very
        little
        difference between the thermal expansion of steels of different
        composition.
        The effect of alloys is noted mostly during contraction,
        particularly
        in
        the temperature region at which the anomalous changes occur and
        in the
        permanent shrinkage observed on cooling. Slightly above 1200° F
        nearly
        all ferrous alloys undergo a slight shrinkage during further
        increase
        of
        temperature over a region extending 50° F to 200° F.
        Thereafter,
        uniform expansion with temperature increase is observed, but the
        rate
        of
        increase in expansion is always greater thereafter, than before
        the
        period
        of contraction. Upon cooling the steel, the reverse phenomenon
        takes
        place,
        but usually the sample never completely regains its length and a
        permanent
        contraction results. During the period of anomalous expansion
        all the
        physical
        properties of the material are affected, including its thermal
        as well
        as its elastic characteristics. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Like cast-iron, very little is known regarding the thermal
        properties
        of steel at high temperatures. The mean specific heat for a
        sample of
        steel
        containing 0.30% carbon, after Fahrenwald (314), is plotted in
        Figure
        75
        up to 500° C. According to these data, the mean specific heat of
        steel
        is slightly higher than that of pure iron and has a somewhat
        greater
        rate
        of increase. The mean specific heat depends a great deal upon
        the
        composition
        and heat-treatment of the sample, as does the mean thermal
        conductivity.
        Thus, the mean specific heat form 0° C to 100° C has been
        reported
        (315) as 0.123 to 0.113 for carbon steels, 0.129 to 0.115 for
        chromium
        steels, and 0.124 for a nickel steel. In general, the lower
        figures
        apply
        to quenched samples and the higher figure to annealed samples,
        the same
        source gives the mean thermal conductivity from 0° C to 100° C
        as 0.143 to 0.044 for carbon steels, 0.098 to 0.031 for chromium
        steels,
        and 0.060 to 0.039 for chrome-nickel steels. Some data by Jaeger
        and
        Diesselhorst
        (291) give the thermal conductivity for 1% carbon steel as 0.108
        at
        18°
        C and 0.107 at 100° C, with a decrease of 0.0001 for every
        degree
        Celsius
        rise in temperature. Few measurements likewise have been made on
        the
        specific
        gravity of steels at high temperatures. At ordinary
        temperatures, this
        constant ranges form 7.60 to 7.80. With such meager data on the
        thermal
        properties of steel, it is not surprising to find a dearth of
        information
        on its diffusivity. Ingersoll and Zobell (296) give the thermal
        diffusivity
        of mild steel as 0.173 and of 1% carbon steel as 0.121. </p>
      <p><a name="heating"></a><b>Heating of Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>The setting for cast-iron retorts should be as simple as
        possible.
        No
        great heat control is needed below 650° C and the simpler flues
        give
        equally as good results as the more expensive constructions.
        There are
        but two criteria to be observed; first, that the air is best
        admitted
        separately
        for the burners to avoid highly localized temperatures, as is
        often
        obtained
        with the Bunsen type of burner, and second, the burners should
        be
        placed
        in such a way that the metal retort will not be touched directly
        by the
        heating flame. By observing these details, the flue will be
        heated by a
        long lazy flame and the retort will be heated by a combination
        of
        radiation
        from the setting walls and convection from the combusted gases,
        thus
        giving
        the retort a uniform temperature which tends to minimize warping
        of the
        casting. The Fuel Research Board carefully observed these two
        principles
        in both their horizontal and vertical ovens and therein lies a
        large
        part
        of the secret of their success with metal retorts. </p>
      <p>When intense local heating of flat metallic surfaces occurs
        repeatedly,
        buckling or cracking is certain to take place. Fahrenwald (314)
        attributes
        this to cumulative plastic deformation of the material, caused
        by
        excessive
        alternating temperature stresses. This phenomenon is quite
        distinct
        from
        bulging or sagging, with which it is often confused. The latter
        arise
        from
        the failure of physical strength at elevated temperatures. The
        plastic
        deformations, which result in buckling, are due to thermal
        expansion
        stresses
        which exceed the elastic limit of the material and which arise
        from
        non-uniform
        heating. More failures in metallic retorts may be attributed to
        unequal
        temperature distribution than to all other design influences,
        while the
        necessary cooling down of the retort periodically is the
        operating
        factor
        which limits its serviceable life more than any other cause,
        aside from
        overheating. </p>
      <p>Except for certain heat losses which occur in the retort
        setting,
        practically
        all the heat imparted to the coal goes to raise the charge to
        the
        desired
        temperature of carbonization and is later discharged from the
        retort as
        sensible heat of the coke, as sensible heat of the volatile
        products,
        and
        as latent heat of the condensable vapors. </p>
      <p>While there are periods of endothermic reactions, there are
        also
        periods
        of exothermic reaction, and the two tend to counteract each
        other. So,
        from a thermal standpoint, the reactions occurring in low
        temperature
        carbonization
        can, in the aggregate, be considered as slightly exothermic. The
        major
        proportion of the heat which is imparted goes to raise the
        temperature
        of the charge to a point where the desired transformations are
        effected,
        and barring heat losses, it is an irreducible quantity, but the
        other,
        or minor part, which raises the temperature of the exit vapors,
        varies
        with the efficiency of the retort design. </p>
      <p>From the standpoint of thermal economy, the use of an
        insulating
        material
        to prevent heat losses is highly important, for by reducing the
        surface
        losses by radiation and convection s much as possible, the
        amount of
        heating
        gas required for carbonization can be reduced accordingly. Cole
        (259)
        recommends
        diatomaceous earth to be used for this purpose. With a furnace
        temperature
        of 1800° F, the heat loss through a wall consisting of 9 inches
        of
        firebrick and 8.5 inches of redbrick is of the order of 20
        BTU/sq
        ft/hr,
        with an outer surface temperature of 370° F, whereas a wall of
        the
        same total thickness, consisting of 9 inches of firebrick, 4
        inches of
        redbrick, and 4.5 inches of insulation, has a heat loss of about
        190
        BTU/sq
        ft/hr, with a surface temperature of roughly 190° F. </p>
      <p>After the heat has been transmitted by conduction through the
        retort
        wall it must be transmitted into the interior of the charge. The
        problem
        is a simple one as far as the first layers of the charge are
        concerned,
        but thereafter, when the coal has been converted to porous
        semi-coke,
        the
        problem is of quite a complicated nature. Practically no data
        are
        available
        on the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of coke at the
        temperature
        at which the process takes place. Even if these data were at
        hand, the
        difficulty of treating the subject of heat conduction in the
        charge has
        not been overcome, because the hot vapors rising through the
        porous
        coke
        and through the voids of the coal on each side of the plastic
        layer
        carry
        with them much of the heat to the upper levels of the charge and
        entirely
        remove a large proportion as sensible and latent heat of a
        non-recoverable
        nature. </p>
      <p>The rapidity with which the heat can be transmitted through the
        retort
        wall is not the limiting factor of heat transfer, even in
        refractory
        retorts,
        much less than in metallic retorts, for in either case the rate
        at
        which
        heat can be transferred through the walls is considerably
        greater than
        it can be transmitted into the charge. Hence, the speed at which
        heat
        is
        passed from the retort wall into the charge determines the rate
        at
        which
        heat can be imparted to the retort wall from the flue. In the
        very
        early
        stages of carbonization, the conductivity of the retort wall may
        be of
        importance, but it becomes relatively less and less of a factor
        as the
        plastic layer progresses inwardly, leaving an ever increasing
        envelope
        of non-conducting semi-coke behind, through which heat passes
        with the
        utmost difficulty. If heat be imparted to the retort wall from
        the flue
        faster than the charge can transmit it inwardly, the retort wall
        will
        rise
        in temperature gradually until, in the case of metallic retorts,
        the
        casting
        will be seriously injured. </p>
      <p>Within the retort, heat transfer takes place primarily by
        conduction
        which argues for a full retort. However, since the evolved gas
        must
        pass
        out, a certain percentage of voids must be permitted to remain.
        We have
        already seen that the passage of hot gases through the voids may
        be an
        important source of heating by means of convection, and indeed,
        this
        expediency
        has been adopted entirely in certain internally heated retorts.
        It
        follows,
        therefore, that for maximum rate of heat penetration there
        should be an
        optimum size of the coal lump. This has been established by
        Guegnen, as
        quoted by Fulweiler (258), as being 2.5 inches when the period
        of
        carbonization
        is 4 hours. </p>
      <p>A high velocity of flue gas is desirable, for not only does it
        increase
        the rate of heat transfer, but it promotes uniform heating of
        the
        setting.
        The generation of heat occurs, of course, at the point where the
        heating
        gas is combusted and this is largely at the entrance of the gas
        to the
        flue. A high velocity permits the heat to be carried rapidly
        away ad
        uniformly
        distributed over the retort and setting. This is of particular
        importance,
        where low temperature gas is being used to heat the retort,
        because of
        its high thermal value. As a matter of fact, it is not good
        practice to
        sue the low temperature gas, even in part, for heating purposes.
        Lower
        calorific producer gas should be used instead, as it heats the
        retort
        more
        uniformly, and because the more valuable gas of higher thermal
        content
        should be reserved for sale where there is a market for its
        disposition. </p>
      <p>The purpose of checker-brick in regenerators is to absorb as
        much
        heat
        as possible from the flue gases before they are vented to the
        atmosphere,
        to store the absorbed heat for a short period of time, and
        finally to
        yield
        that heat to a cooler gas entering the combustion chamber. The
        transfer
        of heat from and to the gases in the regenerator takes place
        primarily
        by convection and conduction, although radiation has been
        observed to
        play
        an unimportant part. As we shall see later, under the subject of
        convection
        heat transfer, a thin film of stationary gas surround the
        checkers, its
        thickness depending upon the velocity of the gas. Heat transfer
        takes
        place
        from the moving gas through this film to the surface of the
        brick by
        conduction,
        so that, since the film thickness is a function of the gas
        velocity,
        heat
        transfer in the regenerator depends greatly upon the gas
        velocity. </p>
      <p>For use in the regenerator checkerwork, bricks with a high
        heat-absorbing
        capacity are, of course, most desirable. As many bricks as
        possible
        should
        be used in the regenerator, so far as it is compatible with a
        large
        exposed
        surface. Because of the continual reversal from hot gas to cold
        air and
        vice versa, regenerator bricks are subject to spalling, so that
        particular
        attention must be paid to this property of the refractory. In
        addition
        to these properties, other characteristics of the material must
        be
        considered
        in selecting refractories for checkerwork in regenerators, such
        as
        their
        crushing strength and resistance to abrasion and corrosion. The
        design
        of the regenerator usually follows the practice established by
        long
        experience
        and the use of standard shapes and high mechanical strength
        should
        largely
        be considered in its construction. Heat is transmitted to the
        surface
        of
        the brick mainly by convection and is transferred to the
        interior by
        conduction
        at a rate which depends upon the thermal diffusivity of the
        material.
        Consequently,
        the rate at which heat is stored or delivered by the regenerator
        depends
        upon the thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat of the
        refractory,
        while the quantity of heat stored depends primarily on the
        specific
        heat
        capacity and the temperature to which the brick is raised. </p>
      <p>Ingersoll and Zobel (296) developed a mathematical expression
        for
        the
        amount of heat absorbed by a brick heated from two sides, where
        the
        temperature
        of the two surfaces is held constant, <i>viz</i>: </p>
      <p>[30]&nbsp;<img src="30form.gif" height="123" width="420"> </p>
      <p>where <i>H</i> is the heat flow in gram calories through one
        square
        centimeter of surface area in <i>t</i> seconds of time; <i>p</i>
        is
        the
        thickness of the brick in cubic millimeters; <i>h<sup>2</sup> =
          k / cp</i>
        is the diffusivity, where <i>k</i> is the thermal conductivity
        in gram
        calories per centimeter cube per second per degree Centigrade; <i>p</i>
        is the apparent density; <i>c</i> is the specific heat; and
        finally,
        where <strike>O</strike><sub>o</sub>
        = <strike>O</strike><sub>s</sub> - <strike>O</strike><sub>b</sub>,
        in
        which <strike>O</strike><sub>s</sub>
        is the temperature of the brick surface and <strike>O</strike><sub>b</sub>
        is the average initial temperature of the brick. For a period
        greater
        than
        5 minutes only the first three exponential terms need to be
        considered,
        but the fractional coefficient must be retained, the summation
        of the
        fractional
        series being 1.232. </p>
      <p>This equation holds only for the particular case of parallel
        walls
        heated
        from two sides, which approximates the condition in some
        regenerators.
        Hougen and Edwards (324) have shown that, when the bricks are
        placed as
        checkers in the regenerator, a shape factor amounting to 0.97
        must be
        introduced
        into the above equation, when the average temperature of the
        refractory
        is 750° C and when the free cross-sectional area of the
        regenerator
        passage is equal to the cross-sectional area of the brick. </p>
      <p>Hougen and Edwards (324) calculated the time required for
        bricks
        of
        different thickness and made of different refractory materials
        to reach
        95% thermal saturation. Their results are shown in Table 118.
        The time
        required for a brick of given thickness to attain a proportion
        of its
        maximum
        heat absorption varies as the square of the thickness. From the
        standpoint
        of thermal properties, it will be seen from the table, that for
        checker-brick,
        magnesia is the most desirable and carborundum next in order,
        but the
        former
        is eliminated by its tendency to spall and the latter, in
        ordinary
        commercial
        practice, by its cost. </p>
      <p>According to Brown (325), a good high duty firebrick for use in
        checkerwork
        should contain less than 70% silica and should not soften below
        1680°
        C, while siliceous brick should contain more than 70% silica and
        should
        not soften below 1630° C. Searle (263) states that chemical
        action
        and dust erosion are the chief causes of low durability in
        refractories
        which are used in regenerators and recuperators and their
        refractoriness
        is of relatively minor importance. Although costly, basic bricks
        are
        preferable
        to fireclay and grog materials because the basic nature of the
        gases
        causes
        rapid chemical action on siliceous bricks. On this point, as
        well as
        others,
        magnesia is again the most desirable material, but is ruled out
        of
        consideration
        because of its cost and spalling tendency. The latter fault is
        also
        found
        with silica brick, although in some cases they may be used in
        the parts
        of the regenerator where the temperature does not fall below the
        critical
        spalling temperature. When silica can be so used, its desirable
        thermal
        properties are highly advantageous. Phelps, as quoted by Booze
        (265)
        has
        apparently established beyond question that, contrary to the
        opinion of
        many operating men, there is a distinct advantage in using
        machine-pressed
        brick for the regenerators. He established that the
        heat-absorbing
        capacity
        of brick had a distinct relation to its specific gravity. The
        difference
        in this respect may be as much as 6% in favor of the
        machine-pressed
        sample. </p>

      <p><a name="convet"></a><b>Convection &amp; Radiation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Heretofore, we have dealt only with the transmission of heat
        through
        the retort wall and through the charge. We have seen that this
        takes
        place
        principally by conduction. It remains now to treat the problem
        of heat
        transfer from the heating flue to the retort wall, this is
        accomplished
        in two ways, by convection and by radiation, the latter being
        effected
        both by gaseous and by solid radiation. </p>
      <p>The transfer of heat by convection is a function of gas
        velocity,
        size
        of passage, and temperature difference, but it is almost
        entirely
        independent
        of the gas composition. Reynolds investigated heat transfer by
        convection
        as early as 1874, giving special attention to the matter of
        fluid
        turbulence
        above the critical velocity, which marks the transition from
        streamline
        or non-vortical flow. Above the critical velocity, turbulence
        becomes
        an
        important factor, and hence, heat transfer becomes a function of
        the
        fluid
        velocity. Reynolds attributed this phenomenon to increased
        molecular
        bombardment,
        but it is at present well established that the increase in heat
        transfer
        is due to a thin stationary fluid film whose thickness varies
        with the
        fluid velocity. </p>
      <p>When gas flows past a stationary surface there is a frictional
        drag
        which causes the gaseous layers next to the surface to lag, to
        such an
        extent that the layer immediately in contact with the surface is
        at
        rest
        and is known as the stationary film. The transfer of heat
        through this
        film from the moving gas to the stationary surface takes place
        by pure
        conduction, and hence follows the law established in Equation
        [28],
        where
        the film coefficient, <i>h</i>, replaces the coefficient of
        thermal
        conductivity
        divided by the thickness. The film coefficient depends largely
        upon the
        unknown thickness of the film, which is a function of the gas
        velocity
        and its physical properties, as we shall see presently. </p>
      <p>Reynolds (326, 327) deduced a formula for turbulent flow
        convection
        heat transfer of the following form: </p>
      <p>[31]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>h = a + b p V = a + bW / A</i>
      </p>
      <p>where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are constants, <i>p</i> is the
        density, <i>V</i>
        is the velocity of the fluid, and <i>h</i> is the film
        coefficient of
        heat
        transfer. The equation also can be written in the form which
        involves
        the
        mass flow, <i>W</i>, and the cross-sectional area, <i>A</i>,
        of the
        flue
        passage. Although his theory of molecular bombardment has now
        been
        displaced
        by the theory of a stationary film, Reynolds' equation still
        finds
        favor.
        The constant, <i>a</i>, is small, so that the heat transfer is
        roughly
        proportional to the velocity. Stanton (328), in verifying
        Reynolds'
        equation
        experimentally, came to the conclusion that the heat transfer
        varied as
        a power of the velocity somewhat less than unity. </p>
      <p>Among the mathematical investigations of forced convection, the
        work
        of Boussinesq (329, 330) deserves particular consideration, but
        this
        work
        is based upon the premises of streamline flow with inviscid and
        incompressible
        fluids. Rayleigh (331) continued the study and demonstrated,
        from the
        principle
        of similitude, that the kinematical viscosity of the fluid must
        be
        considered.
        The fully developed Boussinesq equation for heat transfer by
        forced
        convection
        with turbulence can be written as: </p>
      <p>[32]&nbsp;<img src="32form7.gif" height="60" width="200"> </p>
      <p>where <i>h</i> is the film coefficient in British thermal
        units
        per
        square foot per hour per degree Fahrenheit; <i>D</i> is the
        inside
        diameter
        of the flue; <i>K</i> is the thermal conductivity of the gas in
        British
        thermal units per hour per foot cubed per degree Fahrenheit; <i>V</i>
        is
        the velocity of the gas in feet per second; <i>p</i> is the
        specific
        gravity
        referred to water, <i>u</i> is the kinematical viscosity in
        poises; <i>C<sub>p</sub></i>
        is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure, and <i>K</i>,
        <i>alpha</i>
        and <i>ß</i> are constants to be determined experimentally. </p>
      <p>Many other equations have been proposed for heat transfer from
        gases
        in turbulent motion during forced convection. Those derived by
        Nusselt
        (332, 333) and by Rice (334) are particularly noteworthy, but
        both of
        them
        have been shown by Cox (335) to be only special cases of the
        more
        general
        Equation [32] derived by Boussinesq and extended by Rayleigh.
        Thus,
        Rice
        (334) found that <i>K</i> = 53.5, <i>alpha</i> = 5/6, and <i>ß</i>
        = 1/3; and Nusselt (332) for simplicity placed, <i>alpha</i> =
        <i>ß</i>,
        thus eliminating <i>u</i>, and found that <i>alpha</i> =
        0.786,
        combining
        the <i>alpha</i>-powers of <i>D</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>C<sub>p</sub></i>
        with the constant, <i>K</i>, to give a new constant. According
        to
        Royds
        (336), the Nusselt formula can be put in the form: </p>
      <p>[33]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> h = e ( V p )<sup>0.786</sup> =
          e
          (
          W / A )<sup>0.786</sup></i> </p>
      <p>where <i>e</i> is a constant and the other symbols are the
        same
        as used
        before. When the film coefficient of heat transfer, <i>h</i>,
        is
        expressed
        in BTU/sq ft/hr per degree Fahrenheit, then <i>e</i> = 4.10 for
        air, <i>e</i>
        = 3.39 for carbon dioxide, <i>e</i> = 11.01 for coal gas, and <i>e</i>
        = 7.67 for superheated steam. Later, Nusselt (333) extended his
        formula
        in the following manner: </p>
      <p>[34]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> h = 12 k / D&nbsp; (D / L )<sup>0.054</sup>
          ( V p D C<sub>p</sub> / k )<sup>0.786</sup></i> </p>
      <p>for the heat transfer from a flowing gas inside of a tube of
        length, <i>L</i>.
        It will be recognized that, since <i>W = Vp</i>, there is no
        essential
        difference in form between Equation [33] and Equation [34].
        Nusselt's
        formula
        has its limitations and is not applicable to temperatures much
        above
        1000°
        F, because of gaseous radiation, not for velocities below the
        critical,
        which according to Nusselt is located at about 3.3 ft/sec, but
        which,
        according
        to Lent (337) is, in the light of recent investigations, more
        nearly
        located
        at 13 to 16 feet per second. </p>
      <p>Royds (336) feels that the experiments of Nusselt are
        confirmatory
        of
        Reynolds' Equation [31], and in fact it will be noted that
        Equation
        [33]
        differs from the former only in dropping the constant, a, which
        is
        small,
        and in raising the second term to a fractional power, as
        previously
        established
        by Stanton (328). The experiments of Jordan (338) on air in
        pipes may
        also
        be taken as confirmatory of the work of Reynolds. Jordan's data
        evaluated
        the constants in Equation [31] as <i>a</i> = 0.0015, and <i>b</i>
        varies
        from 0.00055 to 0.00090, depending upon the hydraulic radius,
        that is,
        upon the ratio of the area of flow to the perimeter of the
        passage, and
        upon the temperature of the stationary film. The smaller the
        value of
        the
        hydraulic radius and the greater the film temperature, the
        greater is
        the
        numerical value of <i>b</i> and hence the rate of heat
        transmission.
        The
        constant, <i>a</i>, in Reynolds' equation is supposed to
        represent the
        heat transferred by conduction and hence should increase with
        the
        temperature
        difference, but Jordan's data, which shows no increase, is
        inconclusive
        on this point. </p>
      <p>As far as the present author is aware, while there have been
        limited
        investigations on forced convection for gases flowing outside of
        conduits,
        they have been confined entirely to transverse flow, and no data
        whatever
        are published on forced convection for gases in external
        longitudinal
        flow,
        which is the case found in a coke oven flue. The research of
        Carrier
        (339)
        is applicable only to air flowing transversely across small
        wrought
        iron
        pipes and does not hold when the gas flows longitudinally to a
        plane
        surface
        of either longitudinally or transversely to a large cylinder.
        The
        experiments
        of Nusselt (332), as well as of Bell (340, 341), and of Jordan
        (338),
        are
        all applicable only to the case of forced convection of gases
        inside of
        pipes. In the latte case, the measurements have been correlated
        by
        Weber,
        as quoted by Walker, Lewis, and McAdams (342), into the
        following
        formula,
        which holds for pipes with diameters up to 2 inches, gas
        temperatures
        up
        to 2000° F, mass flows up to 20 pounds of gas per second of free
        area,
        and for gases with molecular weights varying from 17, as in the
        case of
        illuminating gas, to 44, as in the case of carbon dioxide: </p>

      <p>where <i>h</i> is the film coefficient expressed in BTU/hr/sq
        ft
        per
        degree Fahrenheit; <i>W</i> is the mass velocity in pounds of
        gas per
        second
        per square foot of free area; <i>T</i> is the absolute
        arithmetic mean
        gas temperature in degrees Fahrenheit; <i>S</i> is the surface
        factor,
        that is, the heat transfer area in feet divided by the volume of
        the
        open
        gas passage; and <i>m</i> is the average molecular weight of
        the gas.
        The
        mass velocity is equal to the average linear velocity multiplied
        by the
        density of the gas. </p>
      <p>According to the laws of radiation established by Stefan and
        Boltzman
        (343), the total radiant emission of a solid body is
        proportional to
        the
        fourth power of the absolute temperature. This is exact for an
        absolute
        black body, that is, for a perfect radiator, but is sufficiently
        accurate
        for other materials to be used in ordinary calculations. As it
        is
        usually
        the net heat transferred by radiation that is of interest, the
        Stefan-Boltzman
        law becomes for the case of two infinite planes: </p>
      <p>[36]&nbsp;<img src="36form7.gif" height="88" width="212"> </p>
      <p>where <i>Q</i> is the net heat transferred, <i>A</i> is the

        the
        absolute
        temperatures of the hot and cold bodies, respectively, and <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>

        In
        practice the receiving and emitting radiant surfaces are always
        peculiarly
        related, in regard to their shape and relative positions, so
        that it is
        necessary to introduce a proportionality shape factor, <i>O</i>,
        to
        provide
        the necessary correction from the special case of infinite
        parallel
        planes. </p>
      <p>In most every case for metals, the total relative emissivity
        increases
        slightly with rise in temperature up to about 1500° C, after
        which
        the increase is rapid. The manner in which the relative
        emissivities of
        oxidized cast-iron and steel vary with the temperatures is
        illustrated
        in Table 119, form the measurements of Randolph and Overholzer
        (345).
        The
        relative emissivity of a body is the measure of its radiant
        energy
        absorbing
        power and represents the percentage of the incident radiation
        which
        enters
        the body and is manifest as heat, the remaining energy which
        impinges
        being
        reflected into surrounding space by opaque bodies and being
        transmitted
        by translucent bodies. A good radiator is also a good absorber.
        Although
        the radiating power of a body varies with the wavelength of the
        radiation,
        as established by Kirschoff (346), an average value for the
        emissivity
        can be used in engineering calculations with sufficient accuracy
        to
        make
        consideration of the spectral selectivity unnecessary. There is
        hardly
        any published data on the emissivity of refractory surfaces at
        high
        temperatures,
        but Green (347) has reported an average value of 0.72 for a
        firebrick
        surface
        heated from 200° C to 500° C. </p>
      <p>Flames are luminous or non-luminous, the luminosity depending
        on
        the
        amount of solid material held in suspension and heated to
        incandescence.
        Helmholtz in 1890 was the first to investigate radiation from
        flames
        and
        to observe that the radiation from luminous flames was more
        extensive
        than
        that from non-luminous flames. His student, Julius, found that
        the
        radiation
        from combustion products could be attributed almost entirely to
        carbon
        dioxide and water vapor and he established that the radiation
        was
        highly
        selective, occurring in sharp bands. Callender (348) continued
        the
        investigation
        and found that non-luminous flames radiate about 10% of their
        heat of
        combustion,
        as compared to as much as twice that for luminous flames. The
        radiation
        from each individual incandescent particle in a luminous flame
        undoubtedly
        follows the Stefan-Boltzman law and hence the radiation varies
        as the
        fourth
        power of the absolute temperature. Consequently, as gaseous
        radiation
        varies
        with temperature at a power somewhat less than the fourth, it
        follows
        that
        the more incandescent particles there are suspended in the
        flame, and
        hence,
        the greater its luminosity, the more nearly it approaches the
        true
        Stefan-Boltzamn
        relation. Haslam and Boyer (349) have conducted experiments
        which lead
        them to conclude that the radiation from luminous flames of
        methane,
        ethylene,
        and acetylene is 25 to 30% of the combustion heat and that this
        radiation
        is perhaps fourfold that from a non-luminous flame. </p>
      <p>As distinguished from convection heat transfer, gaseous
        radiation
        is
        a function primarily of temperature, the gas composition, and
        the shape
        of the flue. It is independent of gas velocity, except insofar
        as the
        presence
        of fresh gas maintains the temperature. From a consideration of
        the
        intimate
        nature of radiation, it can be demonstrated theoretically and
        verified
        by experiment that a body is capable of absorbing its own
        radiations.
        Consequently,
        it is only from near the surface of a flame that radiation is
        emitted,
        since radiation from the interior is absorbed by the surrounding
        gas
        and
        does not penetrate great depths of the flame. However, the
        greater the
        mass of the flame, the more easily it can preserve its radiating
        temperature. </p>
      <p>No all gases have ability to absorb radiation easily and it so
        happens
        that the products dealt with in combustion are particularly
        endowed
        with
        this ability, both carbon monoxide and dioxide, as well as water
        vapor
        and hydrocarbons, all being unusually efficient radiators, while
        oxygen
        and nitrogen lack the property almost entirely. Consequently,
        the
        radiating
        efficiency of a given gas mixture falls off as its content of
        oxygen
        and
        nitrogen increases, due to reduction in the concentration of the
        active
        gases. The luminosity of the flame, of itself, has nothing
        whatever to
        do with its power to radiate but the luminosity of a flame due
        to
        suspended
        particles greatly increase the heat radiated. This, however, is
        solid
        radiation,
        as distinguished from gaseous radiation, an entirely distinct
        phenomenon.
        According to its content of suspended particles, such as soot,
        slag,
        etc.,
        a flame can pass through all the stages from pure gaseous to
        solid
        radiation.
        Indeed, Lent and Thomas, as quoted by Schack (350), noted that
        the
        addition
        of a little benzol to blast furnace gas, to render it strongly
        illuminating
        by particles of soot without increasing its temperature,
        increased its
        radiation fourfold. </p>
      <p>Until the thickness becomes sufficient, the gas radiates energy
        at
        a
        power of the temperature somewhat below the fourth. Table 120,
        after
        Schack
        (350), gives the radiation from water vapor and carbon dioxide
        as a
        function
        of temperature and thickness. The radiating and absorption power
        of a
        gas
        is highly selective for energy of particular wavelengths and is
        confined
        entirely to the regions indicated in its absorption spectra.
        Thus, the
        radiation and absorption of energy by gases takes place in
        spectral
        bands,
        and the capacity for radiation in each band may be decidedly
        different.
        Carbon dioxide radiates from 3 bands and available measurements
        indicate
        that a 12.5% concentration of that gas radiates from the second
        band,
        in
        wavelengths from 4.1 microns to 4.5 microns, practically as a
        black
        body
        when the thickness is only about 3.2 inches, whereas the gaseous
        layer
        must be a score or more times that thickness before the
        radiation for
        the
        first band, with wavelengths of 2.6 microns and 2.8 microns,
        approaches
        black body conditions. It will be readily appreciated that the
        effect
        of
        gaseous radiation from the carbon dioxide second band may be
        appreciable
        even in thin layers. The thickness required of the gas to
        approach
        black
        body conditions in the third band, extending from 13 microns to
        167
        microns,
        is intermediate of the other two. Radiation form water vapor
        also takes
        place in 3 bands of wavelengths, the first extending from 2.6 to
        2.9
        microns,
        the second from 5.6 to 7.6 microns, and the third from 12 to 25
        microns. </p>

      <p>Haslam, Lovell, and Hunneman (351) investigated the radiation
        from
        non-luminous
        flames and found that it amounted to 14.9% of the total heat of
        combustion
        for methane, 13.8% for illuminating gas, and 10.4% for carbon
        dioxide,
        when they were burned with the theoretical amount of air, the
        radiation
        decreasing with excess air, as established by Helmholtz and by
        Callendar.
        They also confirmed the results of Helmholtz that the radiation
        from a
        given thickness of flame decreases with the preheat temperature
        of the
        primary air. For small thicknesses, of less than 30 cm, the
        radiation
        varies
        almost linearly with the flame thickness in non-luminous flames,
        but
        beyond
        a thickness of 100 cm it becomes practically constant. </p>
      <p>Lent and Thomas (337) measured the heat radiated from a
        cylindrical
        gas column 48 inches in diameter, containing 21% carbon dioxide
        and
        2.4%
        water vapor. They found 2,500 kilogram calories per square meter
        of
        flame
        area per hour radiated at 300° C; 6,000 kg calorie/m<sup>2</sup>
        at
        500° C, and 18,000 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at 800° C. A method of
        calculating
        heat transfer by gaseous radiation has been proposed by Schack
        (352)
        and
        has been applied by Broido (353) and by Wohlenberg and Lindseth
        (354)
        to
        the problem of heat transfer in boiler furnaces. For a more
        detailed
        discussion
        of the method, reference should be made to the original articles
        quoted. </p>
      <p>An exact calculation of gaseous radiation can be carried out
        from
        Planck's
        law, and Hottel (355, 356) has used this method to compute
        charts by
        which
        the radiation from carbon dioxide and water vapor can be
        determined
        easily
        for flues of various types, for which he has computed the
        necessary
        shape
        factors. His calculations show that, for a heat absorbing body
        whose
        surface
        is maintained at 800° F, the heat transfer by gaseous radiation
        is
        of the same order as that transferred by convection in a 6 inch
        square
        flue with an average gas temperature of 1358° F and with the gas
        containing
        20% carbon dioxide. Since these are temperatures somewhat
        similar to
        those
        obtaining in low temperature carbonization practice, it appears
        that
        gaseous
        radiation plays an important part in heat transfer. It is in the
        order
        of 965 BTU/sq ft/hr. </p>
      <p>Goebel, as quoted by Schack (350), observed that, due to the
        different
        radiating power of the gases, the coefficient of heat transfer
        between
        regenerative checkerwork and the flue gas was higher than
        between air
        and
        the checkerwork during reversal. In designing a heating flue, it
        is
        necessary
        to consider the transfer of heat by both radiation and
        convection, so
        that
        the maximum benefit can be gained from the predominating
        influence at
        the
        zone in question. Thus, at points where the temperature of the
        gases is
        extremely high, the gas velocity may be retarded, as radiation
        is
        independent
        of that variable, but where convection heat transfer is
        dominating, the
        passages should be narrow and a high gas velocity maintained.
        The
        present
        author is of the opinion that in low temperature carbonization,
        where
        the
        flue temperatures may reach 760° C, heat transfer by gaseous
        radiation
        may amount to from 10% to 20% of the total heat transferred,
        depending
        upon the design of the particular setting. </p>
