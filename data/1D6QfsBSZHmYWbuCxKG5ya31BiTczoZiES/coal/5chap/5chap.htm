      <p><a name="distrn"></a><b>Distribution of Nitrogen ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to Fieldner, Selvig, and Paul (210), the nitrogen
        content
        of coals of the USA varies from 0.32% in a sample from
        California, to
        2.15%
        in a sample from Maryland. The Utah coal which was coked at low
        temperature
        by Parr and Layng (101) contained 1.4% nitrogen. Porter and
        Ovitz (96)
        found the following percentages of nitrogen in the coals
        distilled by
        them:
        Pennsylvania, 1.23%; Illinois, 1.31%; Virginia, 1.07%; Wyoming,
        1.06%;
        and Utah, 1.16%; while the bituminous coals carbonized by Taylor
        and
        Porter
        (98) contained nitrogen to the following extent: Pennsylvania,
        1.53%,
        Illinois,
        1.55%; West Virginia, 1.45%; and Wyoming, 1.49%. In Table 16,
        the
        average
        percentage of nitrogen found in coals of the United States has
        already
        been given. As a rule, these coals have from 1.1% to 1.6%
        nitrogen,
        which
        corresponds to 24.5 pounds and 36 pounds of nitrogen per net ton
        of
        coal,
        respectively. On the basis of 100% theoretical yield, this
        amounts to
        from
        30 to 43.5 lb of gaseous ammonia per net ton, or 115 to 169 lb
        of
        ammonium
        sulfate per net ton of raw fuel. <br>
        The efficiency of the nitrogen recovery depends largely upon the
        process
        of carbonization used. When the coke is completely gasified and
        the
        by-products
        recovered, as in some producer processes, the yield of ammonium
        sulfate
        attains as much as 85 lb/net ton, which is 61.5% of the
        theoretical. It
        is interesting to note from Table 86, which gives the average
        recovery
        of ammonium sulfate in the three recovery methods of coal
        carbonization,
        that the greatest efficiency of recovery is obtained in gasworks
        practice
        and the lowest efficiency in low temperature carbonization,
        metallurgical
        coke ovens occupying an intermediate position. We shall see
        later that
        the reason for this resides in the fact that the low temperature
        retorts
        operate at too low a temperature to drive the nitrogen from the
        coke in
        quantities and that the metallurgical coke ovens operate at such
        a high
        temperature in order to get a good coke structure, that the
        ammonia
        evolved
        is partly decomposed by the heat. </p>
      <p>The nitrogen is present within the coal in a number of forms.
        Under
        destructive distillation some of it appears in the gas as free
        nitrogen,
        some as ammonia, and some as cyanogens. A small amount of the
        nitrogen
        appears in the tar, as nitrogen bases, and a large proportion
        ordinarily
        remains in the coke. The nitrogenous products found in low
        temperature
        tar have already been fully discussed in Chapter III under the
        subject
        of tar bases. Table 87, after Lewes (17), quoting McLeod, gives
        the
        distribution
        of nitrogen among the volatile products and residuum of
        carbonization.
        This table presents the interesting fact tht the major portion
        of
        nitrogen
        remains in the carbonization residuum and a large part is lost
        in the
        gases
        which are evolved, so that, in nay event, hardly more than 30%
        of the
        total
        nitrogen is recoverable in a useful form. It has been shown in
        Table 73
        that the percentage of nitrogen in the coke after distillation
        is
        greatest
        for low temperature coke and least for that made in
        metallurgical coke
        ovens. <br>
        The gas evolved in low temperature carbonization contains
        considerable
        elementary nitrogen. Thus, Parr and Layng (101) reported 3.87%
        of the
        gases
        which they obtained from Utah coals at 750° C to consist of this
        gas.
        Davis and Parry (97) found that the Pennsylvania coals which
        they
        examined
        averaged 5.83% nitrogen in the gas. The gas evolved in the
        manufacture
        of Coalite runs considerably higher in nitrogen content, 9.28%
        having
        been
        recorded by Parr and Olin (31) </p>

      <p><a name="efftemp"></a><b>Effect of Temperature ~</b> </p>
      <p>The percentage distribution of the nitrogen in coal among its
        products
        of distillation varies with eh temperature of carbonization.
        Simmersbach
        (211) studied the effect of temperature upon the distribution of
        the
        elementary
        nitrogen with the results shown in Figure 41. These experiments
        were
        made
        upon Silesian coal with a total nitrogen content of 1.39%.
        Reference to
        the illustration shows that the maximum percentage of nitrogen
        occurs
        in
        the ammonia at 900° C, while the minimum percentage of nitrogen
        in
        the gas occurs a hundred degrees lower. Heating of the coal
        beyond
        900°
        C decreases the nitrogen remaining in the carbonization residuum
        but
        does
        not increase the percentage of ammonia. The additional nitrogen
        evolved
        merely goes to increase its content in the gas. The nitrogen
        content of
        the tar remains about constant, irrespective of the temperature
        beyond
        about 600° C. It is interesting to note that, even at a
        temperature
        of 1200° C, over a quarter of the nitrogen contained in the coal
        remains
        in the coke. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="41afig.gif" height="308" width="438"></p>
      </center>
      <p>We have already seen in Table 25 the variation in the
        proportion
        of
        free nitrogen in the gas which was evolved from Lancashire coal
        distilled
        up to 400° C by Burgess and Wheeler (104). Lignites and peats
        usually
        contain usually contain much more nitrogen than bituminous coals
        and a
        large part of it appears as free nitrogen in the gas upon
        destructive
        distillation.
        We have seen in Table 27 that as much as 20% of the gas which
        was
        evolved
        from the carbonization of peat in vertical retorts was free
        nitrogen.
        Again,
        in Table 29 the results of Benson and Canfield (108), on the
        distillation
        at various temperatures of Newcastle lignite from the state of
        Washington,
        show as much as 42.7% free nitrogen in the low temperature
        lignite gas.
        After 400° C temperature of carbonization in this case, there is
        apparently
        no increase in the percentage of free nitrogen in the gas, at
        least up
        to 600° C. </p>
      <p>In Figure 13, it is seen from the results of Taylor and Porter
        (98)
        in heating Wyoming coal for long periods at 350° C, that after
        25
        hours
        of distillation, practically all ammonia had been removed from
        the
        coal,
        whereas the production of saturated hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and
        the
        oxides
        of carbons continued even to coking periods of 200 hours.
        Consequently,
        the longer the period of distillation at this temperature, the
        less the
        proportion of ammonia to be expected in the gas. </p>
      <p>Giles and Vilbrandt (99), in their distillation of Farmville
        (NC)
        coal
        at temperatures ranging from 200° C to 660° C, found that the
        ammonium
        sulfate produced, expressed as percentages of the original coal,
        amounted
        to 0.17% at 200° C, 1.23% at 300° C, 2.2% at 420° C; 2.25%
        at 540° C; and 2% at 660° C. Analyses of the semi-coke obtained
        by Benson and Canfield (108), when distilling a Washington
        lignite at
        temperatures
        ranging from 150° C to 600° C, showed the carbonization
        residuum
        to contain 2.9% nitrogen at 450° C, and 0.5% at 600° C. </p>
      <p><a name="ammsulf"></a><b>Ammonium Sulfate ~</b> </p>
      <p>The authorities differ so greatly in the yields of ammonium
        sulfate
        which they have obtained in their experiments on low temperature
        carbonization
        that a tabulation of their average results, given in Table 88,
        wills
        serve
        valuable comparative purposes. The average of the yields given
        in this
        table is almost exactly 14 pounds of ammonium sulfate per gross
        ton of
        coal, which is the value recommended by the Fuel Research Board,
        after
        their extensive experiments on many different coals, as the most
        reliable
        yield to be expected in low temperature carbonization. In order
        to pay
        for recovery, the ammoniated liquor must be approximately 1.7%
        ammonia
        or 8 ounce strength. This means a recovery of 14 pounds per ton.
        Otherwise,
        it is necessary to scrub the primary liquor with fresh gas until
        it
        reaches
        that concentration, which of course means a larger operating
        expense
        and
        its consequent reduction of profit. </p>
      <p>It is quite obvious from Table 88 that, with one exception and
        within
        the temperature limits of low temperature carbonization, the
        higher the
        temperature the greater is the yield of ammonium sulfate. The
        experiments
        of Burgess and Wheeler (104) on the carbonization of Silkstone
        coal at
        temperatures ranging from 450° C to 900° C, as given in Table
        23,
        show that at the temperatures of 500° C to 700° C inclusive,
        about
        1.5% of the gas evolved consists of ammonia. At 750° C, which
        under
        these circumstance appeared to be extremely favorable to the
        formation
        of ammonia, there was a copious evolution, which thereafter
        decreased
        with
        temperature rise. </p>
      <p>Table 89 gives the temperature variation of ammonium sulfate
        yield,
        as determined from the experiments of Lewes (17) and of
        Simmersbach
        (211).
        The later used Silesian coal, which is by no means typical, for
        the
        yields
        quoted by Simmersbach are much higher than ordinarily obtained
        between
        600° C and 900° C. The figures given by Lewes, who used a good
        gas coal, are perhaps more representative of ordinary coals. The
        yields
        are from charges subjected to carbonization over a period of 6
        hours.
        These
        figures are more than 30% lower than those given by Simmersbach
        in the
        low temperature range, but they are more representative of the
        conditions
        obtaining in full-scale operations. </p>

      <p>Figure 42 gives the data of Table 89 in pounds of ammonium
        sulfate
        per
        gross ton of coal. In the illustration, it is seen that the
        yield of
        ammonium
        sulfate reaches a maximum at 900° C, according to both
        authorities.
        An average bituminous coal may be said to yield considerably
        less
        ammonium
        sulfate when carbonized at low temperatures, from 500° C to
        700°
        C, than when distilled at high temperatures over the range of
        900°
        C to 1100° C. It will be noted in the illustration that the
        curves
        showing the yields of ammonium sulfate decrease after attaining
        their
        maximum.
        It will be pointed out shortly that this drooping of the yield
        curve is
        the direct result of decomposition of the ammonia. Temperature
        serves
        to
        drive the remaining nitrogen from the coke, as indicated by
        Table 89
        and
        Figure 42, but not so much in the form of ammonia as in the form
        of
        elementary
        nitrogen, that is, in the absence of protective gaseous
        atmospheres. </p>
      <p><a name="thermdec"></a><b>Thermal Decomposition ~</b> </p>
      <p>That the yield of ammonia attains a maximum at a certain
        temperature
        under given conditions and thereafter decreases as the
        temperature of
        carbonization
        rises, has already been demonstrated. The reduction in the
        percentage
        of
        ammonia in the gas when it is subjected to superheating has also
        been
        noted
        in Table 36, as well as the decomposition of ammonia effected by
        passing
        the gas over a small incandescent surface, as shown in Table 37,
        and by
        the catalytic action of hot brick contact surfaces, recorded in
        Table
        38.
        Presently, the subject of ammonia decomposition by active brick
        surfaces
        will be taken up again. </p>
      <p>A study of the equilibrium conditions surrounding the chemical
        equation, </p>
      <p>[22]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 NH3 =&gt; N2 + 3 H2 </p>
      <p>will explain this phenomenon clearly. This reaction, when
        proceeding
        from right to left, is an exothermic one and takes place with
        the
        liberation
        of 24,000 calories of heat (116). We can predict immediately,
        therefore,
        from thermochemistry, that low temperatures are favorable to the
        stability
        of ammonia. </p>
      <p>The effect of temperature variation on ammonia decomposition
        was
        investigated
        by Ramsay and Young (214). Their first experiments consisted in
        passing
        the gas through a porcelain tube, filled with broken pieces of
        the same
        material. In the second series of experiments, an iron tube was
        substituted
        for the porcelain tube for the purpose of investigating the
        effect of
        the
        tube material as a catalytic agent. The results are plotted in
        Figure
        43.
        It is seen from the illustration that decomposition of the
        ammonia
        begins
        below 500° C, attains a maximum rate from 600° C to 700° C,
        and is practically complete at 800° C. The catalytic effect of
        the
        surface of the tube is very pronounced. Thus, iron increased the
        decomposition
        at a given temperature often as much as 100% over that obtained
        in the
        presence of porcelain. It must be remembered that the
        equilibrium of
        Equation
        [22] is a dynamic one and the effect of a catalytic agent is to
        accelerate
        the rate of reaction in one of the directions, the net result
        being an
        increase or a decrease in the percentage of ammonia which may
        exist
        under
        given thermal conditions. </p>
      <p>The data in Figure 43 apparently disagree with the results of
        Simmersbach
        and of Lewes given in Table 89 and in Figure 42. The maximum
        yield of
        ammonia
        occurs at 900° C in Figure 42, which is beyond the temperature
        prescribed
        in Figure 43 for complete dissociation of the ammonia.
        Presently, we
        shall
        see that this can be readily accounted for by the retarding
        influence
        exerted
        by certain other constituents of the gas. In any case, the
        quantity of
        ammonia yielded is considerably less than the actual amount
        formed and
        the reduction of the yield at high temperatures must be
        attributed to
        its
        decomposition. The nitrogenous matter in coal is doubtlessly
        present in
        many forms. Some of the constituents of the coal give ammonia on
        simple
        distillation, while others react with the moisture and hydrogen
        which
        is
        present to form ammonia-yielding compounds. </p>

      <p>Foxwell (215, 216) made an extended study of the thermal
        dissociation
        of ammonia in coke ovens. He used in his experiments a silica
        reaction
        tube coated with a thin layer of carbon. Using such a tube
        packed with
        coke, Foxwell studied the concentration of ammonia at various
        temperatures
        and found that the decomposition was a second order reaction
        whose rate
        of reaction, therefore, was expressible by the equation, </p>
      <p>[23]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx /dt = k (a-x)2 </p>
      <p>where x is the amount of ammonia decomposed in time, t, and a
        is
        the
        initial concentration of ammonia expressed in millimeters of
        mercury
        partial
        pressure. From Equation [23] we may solve for the velocity
        constant, k,
        as follows: </p>
      <p>[24]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k = 1 / t ( 1 / a-x - 1 / a) </p>
      <p>Despite the heterogenous reaction, occurring in the thermal
        dissociation
        of ammonia in coal gas, it was found that a bimolecular
        coefficient
        adequately
        expressed the results, even though it is difficult to interpret
        its
        meaning.
        Perhaps the presence of coal gas and water vapor exerted an
        influence
        which
        disguised the true character of the reaction. </p>
      <p>The temperature variation of the reaction velocity constant was
        found
        to agree with Arrhenius' empirical equation, </p>
      <p>[25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> <i><font
            size="-1">E</font></i>&nbsp;
        A ( 1 / T<sub>2</sub> - 1 / T<sub>2</sub> ) </p>
      <p>where A = 13,300 and K<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>1</sub> are the
        constants
        at temperatures T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> respectively.
        The
        calculated
        and measured values of the velocity constant, k, for various
        temperatures,
        when coke is used as the contact material, are given in Table
        90, from
        which it is seen that the temperature increase of the velocity
        of the
        reaction
        is comparatively slow. Foxwell (215, 216) found that the ammonia
        decomposed
        to some extent below 600° C, contrary to the findings of other
        investigators. </p>
      <p>It has been noted in Table 38 that hot brick surfaces catalyze
        the
        decomposition
        of ammonia an it has been pointed out that, since the
        equilibrium given
        in Equation [22] is dynamic, the effect of a catalyst is merely
        to
        accelerate
        the reaction rate which must be reflected in a variation of the
        coefficient,
        k, of Equation [23] and Equation [24]. This is indeed the case.
        Table
        91
        gives the analyses of four different bricks, two of which are
        silica
        bricks
        and two of which are siliceous bricks. The table gives for each
        brick a
        sample low in ferric oxide and a sample high in ferric oxide.
        The great
        influence of silica and ferric oxide on the velocity constant,
        k, is
        quite
        apparent. It can be concluded that silica brick has a much
        smaller
        decomposing
        influence than siliceous brick and that, from the standpoint of
        preservation
        of ammonia, the presence of iron is highly undesirable. All the
        brick
        samples
        had substantially the same porosity. Later we will discuss the
        results
        of Mott and Hodsman (217), who studied the influence of contact
        materials
        on the decomposition and oxidation of ammonia in various gaseous
        atmospheres. </p>
      <p>Since brick contains many of the oxides found in coal ash, it
        might
        be anticipated that the constitution of the ash would have an
        important
        bearing on the decomposition of ammonia evolved from the coal.
        Under
        the
        subject of catalysis in Chapter I, it has already been pointed
        out that
        Lessing (81), Lessing and Banks (82), and Marson and Cobb (83)
        investigated
        the effect of ash analysis on the solid residuum from
        distillation.
        Foxwell
        (215, 216) made a number of experiments to define the influence
        of coke
        ash on the ammonia decomposition velocity constant. He used a
        Durham
        coal,
        containing 8.1% ash in his experiments, to which various
        ingredients
        were
        added in different samples for the purpose of ascertaining the
        effect
        of
        each substance. The analyses of the ash from 8 specimens is
        given in
        Table
        92, along with the mean velocity constant for each sample at
        755°
        C.
        Sample No. 1 was the ash of a gas coke alone; Sample No. 2 was
        the as
        of
        a Durham coal alone; Sample No. 3 contained an addition of 5%
        impure
        pyrites
        from a coal seam; Sample No. 4 contained an addition of 3%
        rutile;
        Sample
        No. 5 contained an addition of 5% orthoclase felspar; Sample No.
        6
        contained
        an addition of 5% ferric oxide; Sample No. 7 contained an
        addition of
        3%
        ignited lime; and Sample No. 8 contained an addition of 10%
        ignited
        lime. </p>
      <p>The velocity constant given in Table 92 is the mean value for
        periods
        of contact ranging form 0.78 second to 4.24 seconds, within
        which time
        intervals the constant was found to be independent of the time
        of
        contact.
        Examination of the table discloses that rutile and felspar have
        practically
        no catalytic effect, whereas iron in certain forms and lime have
        a most
        vigorous influence. During carbonization, pyrites and ferric
        oxide are
        converted to ferrous sulfide and metallic iron, respectively.
        Ferrous
        sulfide
        increases the reaction rate only slightly, whereas the addition
        of
        about
        3.75% metallic iron, reduced form ferric oxide, increased the
        reaction
        rate 15-fold. Consequently, if iron is present in the coal as
        pyrite,
        its
        catalytic effect will be negligible, but if it is present as
        ferric
        oxide,
        the decomposition of ammonia will be tremendously accelerated.
        The
        result
        of the addition of lime was not anticipated and is somewhat
        inexplicable.
        The addition of lime is a well known practical method of
        increasing
        ammonia
        yield in carbonization practice, but these experiments showed
        that the
        addition of 3% lime more than doubled the rate of dissolution,
        which
        was
        further increased only slightly by larger additions of the same
        material. </p>
      <p>Some significant results were obtained by Foxwell (215, 216)
        when
        1%
        salt was added to the coal. In this case, the value of the
        reaction
        velocity
        constant, k, did not remain constant when the period of contact
        varied,
        as in the case of materials previously tested. As the period of
        contact
        increased, the value of k decreased in the following manner: for
        1.14
        seconds,
        k = 0.00200; for 1.20 seconds, k = 0.00142; for 1.33 seconds, k
        =
        0.00131;
        and for 3.86 seconds, k = 0.00093. These data show that when the
        period
        of contact is long enough, the salt acts as a negative catalyst
        and
        retards
        the dissociation of ammonia. The influence of salt is attributed
        to its
        reaction with water vapor and carbon dioxide to form sodium
        carbonate
        with
        the liberation of hydrochloric acid, the latter being the
        retarding
        agent.
        Explanation of the decrease in velocity constant, as the period
        of
        contact
        is lengthened, has been suggested to reside in the disappearance
        of the
        hydrogen chloride, as time progresses, by its reaction with the
        ash
        constituents
        to form hydrogen sulfide, ferrous chloride, and other compounds.
        The
        presence
        of hydrogen sulfide in the gas was indicative of this
        explanation.
        Foxwell
        (215, 216) attempted to ascertain the effect of hydrochloric
        acid
        concentration
        on the ammonia decomposition velocity constant and obtained some
        results
        that are difficult to interpret. He found that the velocity
        constant
        decreased
        from about 0.0030 to about 0.00060 as the ration of hydrogen
        chloride
        to
        ammonia concentration increased from zero to 0.1, at which point
        there
        was an abrupt change. Thereafter, the velocity constant rose to
        a
        maximum
        of about 0.0015 at a concentration ratio of 0.4, finally
        decreasing to
        about 0.00035 at a concentration ratio of unity. The decrease up
        to a
        concentration
        ratio of 0.1 is explained by the negative catalytic effect of
        hydrogen
        chloride; the rise to a maximum at a concentration ratio of 0.4
        is
        attributed
        to the positive catalytic effect of metallic iron, produced by
        the
        reaction
        of hydrochloric acid with ferrous sulfide to form ferrous
        chloride,
        which
        in turn reacts with moisture to form ferrous oxide, the latter
        being
        finally
        reduced by hydrogen to metallic iron; while the reduction of
        velocity
        constant
        up to a concentration ratio of unity can be conceived as the
        result of
        the formation of ammonium chloride, which is stable at
        temperatures
        above
        800 C, thus decreasing the effective quantity of ammonia
        available for
        dissociation. </p>
      <p><a name="ammoxid"></a><b>Ammonia Oxidation ~</b> </p>
      <p>An extensive investigation on the factors which influence the
        destruction
        of ammonia by oxidation in the carbonization of coal was carried
        out by
        Greenwood and Hodsman (218, 219). A knowledge of this phenomenon
        is
        clearly
        important, because of the likelihood of indrawn air in a leaky
        retort
        and
        because of the part played by water vapor and materials of
        construction
        in retarding or promoting ammonia oxidation. It is very well
        known that
        the oxidation of ammonia is exceedingly sensitive to catalysts,
        both
        with
        respect to the velocity of oxidation and with respect to the
        products
        of
        the reaction. Ammonia may react with oxygen to yield elementary
        nitrogen
        and water, or it may react to form nitric oxide and water. Under
        the
        conditions
        obtaining during carbonization, the formation of gaseous
        nitrogen upon
        oxidation is the more likely of the two to occur, but
        conceivably, by
        the
        use of certain catalytic agents, the ammonia could be oxidized
        almost
        quantitatively
        to the oxide. Apparently, ammonia is completely unstable in the
        presence
        of oxygen at all temperatures, so that neither of the above
        mentioned
        reactions
        is reversible under ordinary, or indeed under any known,
        conditions.
        Consequently,
        the decomposition of ammonia by oxidation cannot be regarded as
        limited
        by conditions of equilibrium or by the law of mass action. Under
        given
        physico-chemical conditions with a given catalyst, there is
        always a
        temperature
        at which the tendency to form nitric acid from the reaction of
        ammonia
        and oxygen is at a maximum. Above and below this optimum
        temperature
        the
        tendency is to form free nitrogen, probably as a result of the
        interaction
        of nitric oxide that is produced and fresh ammonia to form
        elementary
        nitrogen
        and water. This sufficiently accounts for the fact that nitrates
        and
        nitrites
        are never found in the gas liquors. </p>
      <p>Greenwood and Hodsman (218, 219) observed that the catalytic
        effect
        of a porous firebrick which contained 1.4% of ferric oxide
        decreased
        from
        a marked activity, in the initial passage of gas, to about 25%
        of its
        former
        value after prolonged flow of gas. Thus, its effectiveness
        diminished
        from
        about 82% of the ammonia oxidized, after 10 liters of gas had
        passed
        over
        the catalyst, to about 25% decomposed after 120 liters had
        flowed
        through
        the reaction tube, the decay of activity apparently following an
        exponential
        law. This fatigue of the brick catalyst cannot be attributed to
        poisoning
        by other constituents of the gas, for the same phenomenon was
        observed
        when pure air was passed. The author suggests than an
        explanation may
        be
        found in surface adsorption and occlusion of gas within the
        minute
        pores. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Greenwood and Hodsman (218, 219) passed ammonia, mixed
        variously
        with
        dry and moist air, over different contact materials for quite a
        range
        of
        temperatures with the results illustrated in Figure 44. A blank
        experiment
        was made with the ammonia mixed with dry air and passed over
        silica,
        representative
        of a relatively inactive contact material, to determine the
        temperature
        range over which oxidation takes place when catalysis is
        minimized.
        Below
        500° C, very small quantities of nitrous acid, but never nitric
        acid,
        were detected, while above that temperature only free nitrogen
        was
        produced
        by the reaction. The introduction of a nitrogenous atmosphere,
        containing
        from 1% to 2% oxygen, caused a retardation of oxidation below
        700°
        C, due to the reduction in oxygen concentration, but above that
        temperature
        this effect was not noticeable. When an atmosphere of coal gas
        containing
        1% to 2% oxygen was substituted in place of air, with silica as
        the
        contact
        material, oxidation of ammonia was so effectively retarded that
        it was
        zero at 600° C and less than 15% had been destroyed up to 800°
        C. When firebrick was substituted for silica as the contact
        material,
        in
        the presence of coal gas there was only a slight increase in
        oxidation.
        On the other hand, when fireclay was used as the catalytic agent
        in
        air,
        the oxidation of ammonia was tremendously accelerated, as seen
        in
        Figure
        44. From zero decomposition at 450° C with silica, the oxidation
        was
        raised to about 8% with fireclay and from about 25% oxidation at
        750°
        C with silica to about 70% with fireclay. When, however, moist
        air was
        substituted for dry air in the presence of fireclay contact
        material,
        there
        was a decrease of about 20% in the proportion of ammonia
        oxidized. All
        of the experimental data were reduced to a contact time of 7
        seconds. </p>
      <p>The results indicated that, under the conditions of the
        experiment
        up
        to temperatures of 800° C, there was very little oxidation of
        ammonia
        in the presence of coal gas, but that at the end of the passage
        the
        entire
        oxygen present had been removed, presumably by combination with
        the
        hydrogen
        or by reaction with the hydrocarbons of the coal gas. Had the
        entire
        ammonia
        present been oxidized, only a fraction of the oxygen would have
        been
        absorbed
        in this reaction. Even at 600° C, absolutely no ammonia was
        oxidized
        in an atmosphere of coal gas containing oxygen, although at this
        temperature
        the oxidation amounted to about 12% and about 8% in atmospheres
        of air
        and nitrogen, respectively. From these experiments, it is
        apparent that
        when ammonia is heated with oxygen in the presence of coal gas,
        oxidation
        of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons takes precedence over oxidation
        of the
        ammonia, and, if any of the latter is destroyed at all, it must
        be
        attributed
        to thermal dissociation rather than to oxidation. </p>
      <p>The presence of moisture when a mixture of air and ammonia was
        passed
        over silica had very little effect, decreasing the oxidation but
        2.5%
        at
        750° C. The presence of moisture in coal gas caused no
        difference
        whatever
        in the amount of ammonia oxidized. However, it is seen from
        Figure 44
        that
        when moisture was admitted to the mixture of air and ammonia
        there was
        a material retardation in oxidation with fireclay as the contact
        material.
        The addition of 2.8% water vapor caused a reduction of the
        percentage
        ammonia
        oxidized at 740° C from 64% to 52.3%. The influence of water
        vapor
        on the stability of ammonia in the presence of oxygen can be
        attributed
        to two factors, viz: the increased rate of gas flow with the
        consequent
        shortening of the period of contact with the active surfaces and
        the
        specific
        effect of the water vapor. The curves in Figure 45 show
        severally the
        variation
        of oxidation at 740° C with the rate of flow for a mixture of
        ammonia
        and dry air; the variation of oxidation at the same temperature,
        as a
        function
        of the rate of flow, when the air is saturated with moisture;
        and, by
        subtraction,
        the resultant curve, which may be regarded as showing the
        specific
        action
        of the water vapor. The preservative influence of moisture on
        the
        oxidation
        of ammonia was marked only in the case of contact surfaces
        exhibiting
        active
        catalytic effects, and then the activity of the catalyst was
        only
        partially
        retarded. The most plausible explanation of this behavior is
        found in
        the
        supposition that a unimolecular film of moisture forms on the
        catalytic
        surface, thus restricting the access of ammonia and oxygen to
        the
        active
        material. </p>

      <p>Mott and Hudson (217) investigated the influence of water
        vapor,
        and
        also the character of the contact materials, on the
        decomposition of
        ammonia
        at various temperatures. Their experiments were performed with a
        mixture
        containing about 1.5% ammonia, which is the same order of
        concentration
        for that gas found in carbonization practice. Figure 44 shows
        the
        decomposition
        of ammonia by oxidation as a function of the temperature when
        heated
        with
        dry and moist air and passed over chattered brick which had
        previously
        seen hard service in ovens where salty coals were coked. This
        brick had
        been badly corroded, iron from the coal ash having been
        volatilized as
        the chloride and deposited within the brick for some distance as
        the
        metal
        or as the oxide. Analysis showed this brick to contain 79.84%
        silica,
        11.49%
        alumina, 1.31% titania, 3.95% ferric oxide, 0.6% lime, 0.12%
        magnesia,
        and 2.47% alkalies, by difference. The high iron content of this
        brick
        probably accounted for its high catalytic action. These curves
        should
        be
        compared with those in Figure 44 for a Farnsley brick,
        designated as
        fireclay,
        from which it is observed that the iron in the chattered
        firebrick
        doubtlessly
        deposited as the more active metallic form, whereas in the
        fireclay it
        probably existed in combination with silicates. The presence of
        about
        3%
        water vapor lower the oxidation at a given temperature much more
        than
        could
        be accounted for by reduction in time of contact, thereby
        confirming
        previous
        experiments indicating a specific action of water vapor. </p>
      <p><a name="nhatmos"></a><b>Nitrogen &amp; Hydrogen Atmospheres ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mott and Hodsman (217) continued their work on the effect of
        contact
        surfaces on the oxidation and dissociation of ammonia in
        different
        atmospheres.
        The results in atmospheres of coal gas, hydrogen, and nitrogen,
        with
        and
        without the presence of oxygen, are shown in Figure 46. In these
        experiments
        the chattered firebrick previously referred of was used as the
        contact
        material. The data were all calculated to the same period of
        contact. </p>

        <p><img src="46afig.gif" height="372" width="453"></p>
      </center>
      <p>When a mixture of dry hydrogen and ammonia, to the extent of
        about
        1.5%,
        was passed through the reaction tube, dissociation began at
        about
        660°
        C and rose rapidly until at 800° C it was practically complete.
        Under
        these conditions the velocity of dissociation increases rapidly
        with
        the
        temperature, the velocity constant k of Equation [23] increasing
        from
        0.00074
        at 675° C to 0.0059 at 750° C and to 0.081 at 800° C. At
        700°
        C the decomposition amounted to about 9.5%; at 750° C to about
        26%;
        and at 800° C to about 86%. When a nitrogenous atmosphere was
        substituted
        in place of hydrogen, dissociation began as low as 550° C and
        reached
        nearly 80% at 650° C. When 1.2% oxygen mixed with nitrogen was
        used,
        the dissociation curve was apparently a linear function of the
        temperature,
        increasing regularly from about 46% at 625° C to about 90% at
        775°
        C. The dissociation of ammonia is tremendously greater in the
        presence
        of nitrogen than in atmospheres of hydrogen, the two curves
        being
        roughly
        parallel and about 150° C apart. In nitrogen the ammonia was
        almost
        completely decomposed at 660° C, whereas decomposition was just
        measurable
        at that temperature with hydrogen. It could of course be argued,
        from
        the
        law of mass action, that changes in the hydrogen concentration
        would be
        far more effective in preserving the ammonia than changes in the
        nitrogen
        concentration.&nbsp; This, of course, is true near the
        equilibrium
        condition,
        but it is neither necessary nor probable under conditions where
        the
        reverse
        reaction is negligible. Quite surprisingly, the presence of 1.2%
        oxygen
        in the nitrogen above 650° C has a preservative influence on the
        ammonia.
        Whether or note this beneficial result is due to initial
        dissociation
        and
        reaction of the hydrogen to form water vapor with its inhibitory
        influence,
        or to an entirely different mechanism, such as direct oxidation,
        is a
        matter
        of conjecture. Finally, when an atmosphere of dry coal gas was
        used,
        the
        destruction of ammonia amounted to 18% at 700° C, and was about
        complete
        at 800° C; but when 1.2% oxygen was present in the gas, the
        decomposition
        was only 62% at the higher temperature. Here the benefit derived
        from
        the
        presence of oxygen is clearer, for water vapor is doubtlessly
        formed by
        the preferential oxidation of hydrogen in the coal gas. </p>
      <p>Further experiments by Mott and Hodsman (217) on the
        decomposition
        of
        ammonia, when passed over coke, gave results similar to those
        derived
        from
        the use of chattered firebrick as the contact surface, but the
        decomposition
        at a given temperature under a given atmosphere was considerably
        less,
        showing the coke to be a far more inactive catalyst than the
        chattered
        brick. They concluded that since carbon has been shown to be an
        indifferent
        catalytic agent, the quantity and quality of the coal ash
        remaining in
        the coke is more likely to influence the decomposition of the
        ammonia.
        We have already seen that Foxwell (215, 216) demonstrated that
        the
        decomposition
        of the ash, indeed, had a great effect on ammonia dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (220) observed that, of the total nitrogen
        present
        in the coal, only 10% to 25% is obtained as ammonia, the greater
        portion,
        amounting to 40% or 80%, remaining in the coal and the rest
        being found
        in the gas as free nitrogen or as cyanogens. Many factors, such
        as
        temperature
        of distillation, nature of the coal, and rate of carbonization,
        affect
        the liberation of ammonia during coking. Temperatures above 500°
        C
        are necessary for a good yield of ammonia and the higher the
        temperature,
        the less nitrogen remains in the coke. In general, the older the
        geologic
        age of the fuel, the less the proportion of total nitrogen
        obtained as
        ammonia. Finally, the slower the rate of distillation, the more
        nitrogen
        is evolved as ammonia, provided the vapors are quickly removed.

      <p>In their study of the liberation of nitrogen from coke as
        ammonia,
        Monkhouse
        and Cobb (220) used a Yorkshire bituminous coal which contained
        5.4%
        moisture,
        34% volatile matter, 56% fixed carbon, and 4.7% ash. The ash
        consisted
        of 25.1% silica, 33.5% alumina, 10.1% ferric oxide, 13.1% lime,
        12.9%
        sulfuric
        oxide, and 5.1% alkali oxides. Ultimate analyses of the raw coal
        and
        the
        three cokes obtained from it are shown in Table 93. The 500° C
        coke
        resembled gas coke, and the 1100° C coke was comparable to
        byproduct
        oven metallurgical coke. The table shows clearly that the
        nitrogen
        present
        in the carbonization residuum was reduced as the temperature
        advanced.
        The ammonium sulfate equivalent of nitrogen in the raw coal was
        176.3
        pounds
        per gross tone of coal; that in the 500° C coke was 197.5 pounds
        per
        gross ton of coke, or 133.3 pounds of ammonium sulfate per gross
        ton of
        coal; the 800° C coke contained nitrogen equivalent to 11.5
        pounds
        of ammonium sulfate per gross ton of coke, or 66.5 pounds per
        gross ton
        of coal; while the 1100° C coke had 61.2 pounds of equivalent
        ammonium
        sulfate per gross ton of coke, or about 34 pounds per gross ton
        of
        coal.
        These cokes were heated at various temperatures in different
        atmospheres
        to determine the specific action of different action of
        different gases
        on the production of ammonia. </p>
      <p>Table 94 shows the results of heating the different
        representative
        cokes
        in the presence of nitrogen. The amount of ammonia evolved from
        the
        100°
        C coke under these conditions was so small as to be negligible.
        The
        500°
        C coke under these conditions had 1.34% nitrogen remaining after
        reheating
        to 1000° C, while the 800° C coke had 1.02% remaining after
        reheating
        to the same temperature. This table should be compared with
        Table 95,
        which
        gives a nitrogen balance for the tests of these cokes when they
        were
        heated
        to the final temperature of 1000° C in an atmosphere of
        nitrogen.
        Reheating
        the 800° C coke in stages to 1000° C removed 30% of the coke
        nitrogen,
        but if any ammonia was formed, practically all of it was
        decomposed
        under
        these conditions, as only 0.2% was recovered. </p>
      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (220), with the idea of minimizing
        dissociation,
        next determined if any more ammonia could be obtained from the
        low
        temperature
        coke by heating it in stages to 800° C, as compared to heating
        it
        directly
        to 800° C in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The results indicated
        that
        the ratio of ammonia to free nitrogen was slightly greater in
        the
        multi-stage
        heating than in direct heating, so that there was some little
        reduction
        of dissociation. </p>

      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (220) also reheated the cokes obtained by
        them
        at
        different temperatures in an atmosphere of hydrogen, thereby
        obtaining
        a distinctly different result from the use of nitrogen. Table 96
        gives
        the results of heating the 500° C and 800° C cokes in stages to
        1000° C in the presence of hydrogen and Table 97 gives a
        nitrogen
        balance
        for the same conditions. The 1100 C coke was heated in hydrogen
        up to
        1000°
        C, but no ammonia whatever was evolved. The nitrogen remaining
        in the
        500°
        C coke, after treatment up to 1000° C, was 0,65% and that
        remaining
        in the 800° C coke was 0.84%. </p>
      <p>The illustration in Figure 47 shows graphically the difference
        between
        the effect of nitrogen and hydrogen atmospheres on the
        production of
        ammonia
        by reheating the low temperature coke to drive off the nitrogen.
        At
        1000°
        C in an atmosphere of nitrogen, the ammonia recovery ceased to
        increase
        appreciably with rising temperature, due undoubtedly to the
        increased
        rate
        of dissociation. The marked influence of a hydrogenous
        atmosphere on
        the
        yield of ammonia is seen by the fact that, when the low
        temperature
        coke
        was reheated at 1000° C in an atmosphere of hydrogen, 34.2% of
        the
        nitrogen in the coke was recovered as ammonia, with 28.2% of the
        nitrogen
        originally present remaining in the coke residuum, as compared
        with
        11.7%
        recovered as ammonia in an atmosphere of nitrogen, with 60.4% of
        the
        original
        nitrogen remaining in the coke after treatment. In all cases,
        the rate
        of ammonia recovery was more rapid when the various cokes were
        reheated
        at 800° C than at either the lower temperature of 600° C or at
        the higher temperature of 1000° C. If hydrogen aided the
        formation
        of ammonia in nitrogenous compounds evolved at the higher
        temperatures,
        it was rapidly decomposed. It is quite conclusive that hydrogen
        exerted
        on the coke a specific action which favored the formation of
        ammonia,
        as
        compared with the indifferent action of such inert atmospheres
        as
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>One remaining phenomenon has its influence on the quantity of
        ammonia
        yielded. That is what has been called the secondary production
        of
        ammonia
        by the action of hydrogen gas on the incandescent coke. Tervet
        (222),
        in
        his experiments, passed a current of hydrogen over incandescent
        coke
        and
        found that the ammonia yield was increased 100%. The action of
        hydrogen
        on the soft coke is such as to attack the nitrogen which it
        contains
        and
        to form increased quantities of ammonia. Hydrogen did not attack
        hard
        coke
        at all and the effect on medium coke was much less pronounced
        than when
        the soft variety was used. A yield as high as 94 pounds of
        ammonium
        sulfate
        per gross ton was reported upon carbonizing the charge of soft
        coke
        slowly
        at 1000° C in an atmosphere of hydrogen. It seems probable,
        therefore,
        that over the range of 500° C to 800° C, hydrogen gas has a
        specific
        action capable of liberating additional quantities of ammonia,
        as well
        as of acting as a preservative of the ammonia otherwise formed.
      </p>
      <p><a name="steam"></a><b>Steaming ~</b> </p>
      <p>The use of steam during carbonization is well known to increase
        greatly
        the yield of ammonia in high temperature processes, but its
        effect in
        low
        temperature methods is questioned among the authorities. The
        Fuel
        Research
        Board maintains that here again the principal function of the
        steam is
        to sweep the retort clean of gaseous products, thus removing the
        ammonia
        as quickly as possible from the conditions favorable to its
        decomposition.
        They maintain that little or no increase in nitrogen, evolved as
        ammonia,
        can be expected through the use of steam in low temperature
        processes,
        although in coals of low moisture content it might assist in the
        recovery
        of small quantities of ammonia which would remain uncondensed
        and make
        scrubbing necessary. We have already seen in Table 43 the
        influence of
        increasing percentages of steam on the analyses of low
        temperature gas,
        the nitrogen content being decreased from 13.8% in dry
        distillation to
        7.6% when 20% steam was passed into the retort. This reduction
        in free
        nitrogen in the gas doubtlessly arises from a reduction of the
        thermal
        dissociation of ammonia. <br>
        Porter and Ovitz (96), in comparing the yield of ammonium
        sulfate
        obtained
        from dry and moist coals, substantiated the opinion of the Fuel
        Research
        board that high moisture content increases the efficiency of
        ammonia
        recovery.
        They found that, when computed upon the basis of dry coal, a
        yield of
        25.3
        pounds of ammonium sulfate was obtained per gross ton of dry
        coal, as
        compared
        with 26.9 pounds of ammonium sulfate recovered when the same
        coal was
        carbonized
        while moist. </p>
      <p>The experiments of Mott and Hodsman (217) demonstrated that the
        presence
        of 25% steam at 850° C completely prevents dissociation of the
        ammonia,
        which ordinarily is completely decomposed at a temperature 50° C
        lower.
        At 785° C they found that 72% of the ammonia ordinarily
        dissociated,
        but with 12.5% water vapor only about 8% decomposed. </p>
      <p>Davis and Parry (97), using Pennsylvania coal of the Freeport
        bed,
        found
        that the use of 88% steam during carbonization at 550° C
        increased
        the yield of ammonium sulfate 43%. The variation of ammonium
        sulfate
        yield
        at various temperatures under steam distillation, as determined
        by
        them,
        is given in Table 98. At 550° C, without steam, they obtained
        only
        10 pounds of ammonium sulfate per net ton, the gas evolving
        containing
        8.2% nitrogen and 1.9% nitrogen remaining in the coke. </p>

      <p>It is seen in Figure 46, for the experiments of Mott and
        Hodsman
        (217),
        that when 1% to 2% ammonia was passed through the reaction
        chamber in
        an
        atmosphere of coal gas containing 1.2% oxygen, the oxidation
        amounted
        to
        about 17% at 700° C, and to about 41% at 750° C, whereas when
        oxygen-free
        coal gas was used the decomposition was 18% and 61% at the
        corresponding
        temperature. At first sight, this appears astonishing, but
        reflection
        shows
        that in every case where oxygen was present in the coal gas it
        had
        entirely
        reacted with the hydrogen and hydrocarbons to form water, which
        undoubtedly
        exerted an inhibitory effect on the ammonia decomposition, it
        having
        already
        been demonstrated that under such conditions the oxidation of
        ammonia
        is
        prevented by the preferential oxidation of the hydrogen and the
        hydrocarbons.
        When a mixture of coal gas and hydrogen, containing about 3%
        moisture,
        was used, the inhibitory effect of water vapor was even more
        marked
        than
        in the case of an atmosphere of air, as shown by the two upper
        curves
        in
        Figure 44. At 700° C, the presence of 3% water vapor reduced the
        ammonia
        decomposition from about 17% to about 3% and at 800° C from
        about
        95%
        to about 38%. The reduction in the time of contact, through
        presence of
        steam, could account for a difference of only about 2%. </p>
      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (220), having ascertained that reheating the
        1100°
        C coke in dry hydrogen up to 1000° C was without effect in
        removing
        the nitrogenous material of the coke in the form of ammonia,
        investigated
        the influence of using a mixture of steam and hydrogen, the
        former
        being
        present to the extent of 65%. The results are shown in Figure
        48, from
        which it is seen that the presence of moisture caused a slow but
        steady
        evolution of ammonia up to 800° C. At 1000° C the evolution of
        ammonia increased greatly, doubtlessly because of gasification,
        according
        to well established principles of ammonia production with excess
        steam,
        as used in the Mond system. It has been stated that in such
        reaction
        the
        carbon-nitrogen ratio of the fuel remains constant during
        gasification,
        which demonstrates that the production of ammonia in
        gasification
        processes
        with the sue of steam is accompanied by simultaneous consumption
        of the
        carbon surrounding the nitrogenous material. </p>

      <p>The successive action of nitrogen, hydrogen, and steam was
        tried
        on
        low temperature coke to ascertain how far the nitrogen remaining
        in the
        coke from one treatment could be removed by application of
        gaseous
        atmospheres
        of more specific action. The experiments were made on 500° C low
        temperature
        coke at a reheat temperature of 800° C. heating was continued
        with
        each gaseous atmosphere until the evolution of ammonia
        practically
        ceased.
        Two curves, giving the results of these experiments, are
        reproduced in
        Figure 49, one for successive heatings with nitrogen, hydrogen
        and
        steam,
        and one for only nitrogen and steam. At the end of the nitrogen
        stage,
        10.1% of the coke nitrogen had been yielded as ammonia; 19.6%
        was
        evolved
        as free nitrogen; and 70.3% remained in the coke residuum. When
        hydrogen
        was then introduced, an additional 32% of the nitrogen was
        gasified, of
        which 31% appeared as ammonia, the decomposition being
        practically nil
        under these conditions. Steam diluted with 37.5% nitrogen was
        next
        admitted
        to the retort. Due to the water gas reaction, the quantity of
        gas
        yielded
        in this case exceeded that of the gas admitted; in fact, when
        the
        experiment
        was discontinued, it was found that this reaction had progressed
        t
        complete
        gasification, so that only the coke ash remained. In this final
        stage
        38.3%
        of the nitrogen originally present in the coke was removed,
        38.1% being
        ammonia and the rest free nitrogen. It is clearly seen that
        large
        additional
        quantities of the coke nitrogen can be removed by heating in
        atmospheres
        of hydrogen and of steam after treatment in nitrogen and,
        furthermore,
        that removal of the ammonia in hydrogenous and steam atmospheres
        is
        accompanied
        by very little decomposition. The latter is attributed to the
        fact that
        the ammonia present was so diluted by the other gases that
        equilibrium
        was not attained. Very little ammonia would have survived at
        800° C
        if equilibrium conditions at that temperature had been reached.
        As a
        matter
        of fact, the concentration of ammonia itself plays a more
        important
        part
        than that of either hydrogen or nitrogen on the rate of ammonia
        decomposition
        at a given temperature, the rate of decomposition being higher,
        the
        higher
        the concentration. Figure 49 also shows the effect of omitting
        the
        hydrogen
        stage, the same amount of ammonia being obtained by this
        procedure in
        40
        hours of treatment as was removed in 240 hours when the hydrogen
        stage
        was introduced. </p>
      <p>In later research, Monkhouse and Cobb (221) investigated the
        use
        of
        hydrogen and steam in obviating the formation of free nitrogen
        instead
        of ammonia, when the same cokes as used before were heated.
        Figure 50
        shows
        the effect of reheating 500° C low temperature coke in 40-hour
        stages
        in two gaseous atmospheres. The steam contained 40% nitrogen as
        the
        carrier
        gas. After 40 hours of heating in the presence of steam at the
        final
        temperature,
        only ash remained, the carbon having been completely gasified.
        At the
        end
        of the 800° C stage, 9.1% of the nitrogen originally present had
        been
        evolved as the uncombined gas when hydrogen was used, as
        compared wit
        only
        1.7% at the same temperature when steam was used, practically no
        dissociation
        of ammonia occurring in the latter case. </p>

      <p>A careful examination of Figure 50 shows that, whereas the
        evolution
        of ammonia in hydrogen at a given temperature had a gradually
        declining
        rate as time went on, the evolution of ammonia in steam
        proceeded at a
        constant rate after the initial rapid evolution at the beginning
        of
        each
        temperature stage. In the former case, the curves are
        logarithmic in
        shape,
        while in the latter case they are hyperbolic. As the temperature
        is
        increased
        at each stage, there is an initial large evolution of ammonia
        which
        accompanies
        the temperature rise, even in an inert atmosphere.
        Simultaneously,
        there
        is taking place a gasification of the coke carbon by the water
        gas
        reaction,
        which is of secondary importance at the beginning of an
        increased
        temperature
        stage, but which ultimately becomes the controlling reaction and
        accounts
        for the characteristic linear portion of the steam atmosphere
        curve. In
        Figure 51 is shown an enlarged curve of the lower part of Figure
        50,
        being
        the evolution of ammonia from low temperature coke at 600° C in
        various
        atmospheres. It is seen that, due to the characteristic shape of
        the
        steam
        curve, it falls below that of hydrogen for the first 35 hours of
        heating
        at this temperature. At temperatures above 700° C, the steam
        curve
        will fall entirely above the others, as the temperature becomes
        more
        favorable
        to the water gas reaction. </p>
      <p>An experiment conducted by Monkhouse and Cobb (221) on the use
        of
        nitrogen
        saturated with 63% steam in effecting the removal of nitrogen
        from
        1100°
        C high temperature coke, showed that when the reheat temperature
        was
        800°
        C, only 1.36% of the coke nitrogen was removed, whereas 95.4%
        evolved
        as
        ammonia at 900° C. After about 90 hours treatment, 10 hours of
        which
        were at 800° C, 70 hours of which were at 900° C, and the
        remaining
        10 hours at 1000° C, 97.3% of the coke nitrogen was removed as
        ammonia
        and 2.7% as free nitrogen. The liberation of ammonia from high
        temperature
        coke, in the presence of steam at a given temperature, was much
        slower
        than from low temperature coke, due to the great reactivity of
        the
        500°
        C coke and to its ease of gasification. </p>
      <p><a name="sdistr"></a><b>Sulfur Distribution ~</b> </p>
      <p>Analyses of many coals of the United States by the US Bureau of
        Mines,
        as compiled by Fieldner, Selvig, and Paul (210) show that the
        amount of
        sulfur present ranges from as low as 0.11% in the case of a
        sample from
        Alaska, to as much as 11.68% for a specimen from the roof of a
        vein n
        Colorado.
        A great many of the bituminous coals of the USA have from 0.5%
        to 4.5%
        sulfur, the average sample containing approximately 2%. The
        disadvantages
        of high sulfur content in coke are well known. When used for
        domestic
        purposes,
        the fumes liberated upon combustion are objectionable to smell
        and are
        injurious to property. When coke is completely gasified, the
        sulfur
        again
        presents the same difficulties, for it appears as hydrogen
        sulfide in
        the
        gas. We have already seen in Table 32 and Table 33 that, even at
        temperatures
        as low as 450° C, considerable quantities of hydrogen sulfide
        may
        be
        found in the gas from low temperature distillation. </p>
      <p>Both inorganic and organic sulfur occur in coal. The inorganic
        sulfur
        is present mostly in combination with iron, either as pyrites or
        as
        marcasites,
        both of which have the same chemical formula. The former usually
        predominates.
        Free sulfur is occasionally found and also small quantities of
        sulfates.
        The organic sulfur had its origin in the protein of the plant
        and
        animal
        life of which coal is the degradation product, according to the
        theory
        discussed in Chapter I under the subject of the origin of coal.
        Powell
        and Parr (223) examined a number of different coals to ascertain
        the
        distribution
        of sulfur between inorganic and organic compounds, They found
        sulfur in
        both the resinic and organic bodies, whose proximate analyses
        were
        given
        in Table 4, and whose extraction has been discussed in Chapter I
        under
        the subject of destructive distillation. On the average, the
        sulfur of
        coal is about equally distributed between organic and inorganic
        compounds.
        Table 99 gives the distribution of sulfur among different
        classes of
        compounds
        as determined by Powell and Parr (223). All the specimens were
        of
        Illinois
        coal except Sample #5, which was form Tennessee. </p>
      <p>The variation of the amount of sulfate which was present in the
        various
        samples is interesting, in view of the different ages of the
        coals
        after
        mining. During storage, oxidation of the coal, as a whole,
        includes
        oxidation
        of the sulfur compounds, and the iron pyrites may oxidize to
        such an
        extent
        that, after 2 or 3 years standing, sulfate may become the major
        sulfur
        compound. The sulfur content of Sample #3 in Table 99 contained
        less
        than
        0.01% sulfate, when freshly mines, as compared with 1.31% after
        standing
        2 years in a flask. </p>

      <p><a name="thermtrans"></a><b>Thermal Transformations ~</b> </p>
      <p>When coal is carbonized, the sulfur divides between the
        volatile
        products
        and the solid residuum. The ratio of volatile to residual sulfur
        varies
        between wide limits, but remains fairly constant for a given
        coal. The
        factors underlying the volatility of the sulfur are not well
        known.
        Undoubtedly,
        certain constituents of the coal, other than the sulfur, have a
        marked
        influence in this respect, but probably the most decisive factor
        is the
        relative amounts of the different sulfur compounds that are
        present in
        the coal. The sulfur compounds in the volatile matter from
        distillation
        are largely in the form of hydrogen sulfide, or thiophene
        derivates,
        while
        the residual sulfur in the coke is principally of an unknown
        organic
        nature
        with traces of sulfides. When the coke from coal Sample #4 of
        Table 99
        was examined by Powell and parr (223) they found that 1.37%
        sulfur
        remained,
        of which 0.3% was sulfide and the rest organic. They found that
        the
        sulfate
        was entirely reduced, not to sulfide, but probably to form
        unknown
        organic
        sulfur compounds. The pyretic sulfur was totally decomposed,
        part being
        volatilized and part remaining as sulfide. Probably the resinic
        sulfur
        of the coal was left in the coke, but in a different form, while
        the
        humous
        sulfur was partly volatilized and partly left as residuum of
        changed
        form. </p>
      <p>Powell (224) extensively investigated the reaction of coal
        sulfur
        in
        the coking process. When mineralogical pyrite is heated, very
        little
        decomposition
        is observed at 500° C, but at 1000° C it is entirely decomposed
        into equal proportions of free sulfur and sulfide sulfur. If
        moisture
        or
        other hydrogen-yielding compounds are present, the free sulfur
        will be
        partially converted to hydrogen sulfide. When mineralogical
        pyrite is
        mixed
        with an equal amount of coal and heated to the same temperature,
        it is
        found that half of the total sulfur appears as ferrous sulfide,
        about
        half
        as much again is evolved as hydrogen sulfide, while the
        remainder is
        divided
        in the ratio of about two to one as free and organic sulfur,
        respectively.
        It has been demonstrated by Campbell (225) and verified by
        Powell (224)
        that the ferrous sulfide residuum is pyrrhotite, or magnetic
        sulfide of
        iron, which is not a definite chemical compound, but a solid
        solution
        of
        sulfur in ferrous sulfide. </p>
      <p>According to Powell (224), the total sulfur in the coal is the
        most
        important factor bearing on the sulfur content of the coke and a
        careful
        scrutiny of the percentage of organic and inorganic sulfur
        contents of
        the raw coal did not reveal any constant relation to the sulfur
        content
        of the coke produced therefrom. This practically nullifies any
        statement
        as to the relative importance of removing organic and pyretic
        sulfur
        before
        carbonization. </p>
      <p><a name="tempfx"></a><b>Temperature Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>The transformation of sulfur compounds at various coking
        temperatures
        was studied by Powell (224), who used a number of different
        coals. The
        results of his heating a Tennessee coal containing 4.25% sulfur
        are
        given
        in Table 100, from a critical study of which it is possible to
        draw a
        number
        of conclusions regarding the reactions undergone by the sulfur
        compounds
        during coking. From Table 100 it is seen that the pyretic sulfur
        is
        rapidly
        decomposed between 400° C and 500° C and that the sulfates,
        which
        have gradually disappeared as the temperature increases, are
        almost
        entirely
        decomposed at 500° C. As the temperature advances, there is a
        gradual
        increase of sulfide sulfur in the coke and there is a gradually
        increasing
        proportion of volatile sulfur compounds found in the gas and
        tar. At
        first,
        the organic sulfur present in the coal varies inversely as the
        temperature,
        but between 400° C and 500° C a radical change takes place with
        the formation of increasing amounts of organic sulfur as the
        temperature
        of carbonization is further advanced. It is interesting to note
        from
        Table
        100 that from the region of low temperature distillation to the
        region
        of high temperature carbonization, the only sulfur remaining in
        the
        coke
        is in the form of sulfides or of organic compounds. </p>

      </center>
      <p>It should be noted that, starting with an initial sulfur
        content
        of
        4.25% at 500° C, 2.95% sulfur remained in the coke and this was
        further
        reduced to 2.65% at 1000° C. Gentry (226) has pointed out that
        the
        high temperature zone in processes of low temperature
        carbonization by
        partial gasification is largely responsible for removal of
        sulfur in
        that
        type of retort, as compared with the ordinary externally heated
        designs.
        At the same time, there is an increase in sulfur present in the
        tar and
        gas to counterbalance the decrease in this constituent of the
        coke. </p>
      <p>When Powell (224) heated Pocahontas, a West Virginia low sulfur
        bituminous
        coal, he found the initial sulfur, consisting of 0.08% pyritic,
        0.01%
        sulfate,
        and 0.47% organic sulfur, was transformed to a residuum with
        0.01%
        pyretic,
        0.43% organic, and 0.04% sulfide sulfur, 0.06% of the sulfur
        volatilizing
        as hydrogen sulfide, and 0.02% distilling into the tar. At 1000°
        C,
        0.27% organic and 0.09% sulfide sulfur was found in the solid
        residuum,
        while 0.17% appeared as hydrogen sulfide and 0.03% was found in
        the
        tar.
        The difference in the transformations taking place among the
        sulfur
        compounds
        of Tennessee coal and of Pocahontas coal may be explained by the
        fact
        that
        the latter contained very little pyretic sulfur and practically
        no
        sulfate.
        Further results from the treatment of Pennsylvania coals from
        the
        Pittsburgh
        and Upper Freeport beds are reproduced in Table 101 principally
        for
        reference,
        as it will be observed that the transformations do not differ
        greatly
        from
        those taking place during the carbonization of Tennessee
        bituminous
        coal. </p>
      <p>Powell (224) next submitted a mixture of Joliet coking coal to
        study.
        This consisted of a mixture of 65% Pocahontas, 20% Kentucky, and
        15%
        washed
        Illinois coals. The sulfur, which was present in the raw
        mixture,
        amounted
        to 0.82%, distributed as 0.26% pyretic and 0.56% organic sulfur.
        After
        carbonization at 500° C, the sulfur in the coke consisted of
        0.12%
        pyretic, 0.44% organic, and 0.08% sulfide, while the volatile
        products
        contained sulfur to the extent of 0.02% in the tar and 0.16% as
        hydrogen
        sulfide in the gas. At 1000° C, the residual sulfur was
        distributed
        as 0.49% organic and 0.06% sulfide, while the volatile sulfur
        consisted
        of 0.02% in the tar and 0.25% as hydrogen sulfide. The general
        transformations
        in this mixed coking coal are the same as those already
        discussed. </p>
      <p>When an Indiana coal containing 1.38% sulfur, distributed as
        0.7%
        pyretic,
        0.03% sulfate, and 0.65% organic, was washed, the total sulfur
        then
        amounted
        to 1.18%, allocate as 0.25% pyretic, 0.03% sulfate, and 0.9%
        organic.
        Powell
        (224), in comparing the results with washed and unwashed Indiana
        coal,
        concluded first that in the raw coal, where the inorganic sulfur
        predominated,
        a larger quantity of metallic sulfides are converted into the
        organic
        form
        than in the washed coal, and second, that in the washed coal,
        where the
        organic sulfur predominated, more of the organic sulfur is
        decomposed
        into
        hydrogen sulfide than in the raw coal. </p>
      <p>These extensive investigations on the transformation of sulfur
        constituents
        of coal during carbonization establish 5 classes of primary
        reactions.
        First, there is the complete decomposition of the pyrite and
        marcasite
        to ferrous sulfide, pyrrhotite, and hydrogen sulfide. This
        reaction
        reaches
        its maximum between 400° C and 500° C, but begins at about
        300°
        C and is complete at about 600° C. Second, there is the
        reduction
        of
        sulfates to sulfides, which is complete at 500° C. Third, the
        organic
        sulfur decomposes to form hydrogen sulfide. Fourth, a small part
        of the
        organic sulfur decomposes to form volatile sulfur compounds,
        which are
        collected in the tar. Fifth, a portion of the ferrous sulfide
        and
        pyrrhotite
        that is formed apparently enters into combination with the
        carbon to
        form
        organic sulfur compounds in the neighborhood of 500° C. his last
        reaction
        has also been noted by Parr (227). In addition to these 5
        primary
        reactions,
        there are a few additional secondary reactions, such as the
        formation
        of
        hydrogen sulfide by the attack of hydrogen in the gas on the
        organic
        sulfur
        compounds and the reduction of hydrogen sulfide by red-hot coke
        to form
        carbon disulfide. Lewes (17) has already shown that carbon
        disulfide is
        never a primary decomposition product of the distillation of
        coal and
        Powell
        (224) concurs in this conclusion. </p>
      <p><a name="desulf"></a><b>Desulfurization ~</b> </p>
      <p>Powell (224) has shown that from one-fourth to one-half of the
        coal
        sulfur can be removed by washing and that there is a
        corresponding
        reduction
        of sulfur in the coke. However efficient this method of
        processing,
        Fraser
        and Yancey (228) pointed out that this washing removes only a
        part of
        the
        sulfur that is present as pyrites, but does not eliminate the
        finely
        disseminated
        pyrite nor the organic sulfur. Besides washing, a number of
        methods
        have
        been proposed to desulfurize coke, all of which involve the
        elimination
        of sulfur compounds as volatile components or conversion of the
        sulfur
        to soluble forms which may be leached. To the first class belong
        such
        proposals
        as the introduction of steam, air, chlorine, carbon monoxide,
        and
        hydrogen
        during coking, while the second class involves the use of such
        addition
        agents as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, and manganese
        dioxide.
        Most
        of these schemes, however, have never become commercial because
        of the
        cost or of inefficiency in sulfur reduction. It has been pretty
        well
        shown,
        in the foregoing tables, that most of the sulfur remaining in
        the coke
        is inorganic in nature, so that any method of desulfurization
        must
        attack
        the sulfur-carbon compounds. </p>
      <p>Powell (229), noting the quantitative method for sulfur
        determination
        of Oteha (230), in which nascent hydrogen was used to attack the
        sulfur,
        studied the elimination of sulfur from coke by passing hydrogen
        through
        the coking mass. His first experiments were made on Pittsburgh
        coal
        containing
        1.72% sulfur, distributed as shown in Figure 101. This coal was
        first
        coked
        at 1000° C for 2 hours until no more sulfur was removed by
        carbonization,
        at which time the residuum contained 1.9% sulfur, or 1.14%
        referred to
        the raw coal. Pure hydrogen was then passed through the furnace
        for one
        hour, after which the coke sulfur was reduced to 1.55%, or 0.93%
        referred
        to the raw coal. A second experiment was made with the same coal
        by
        introducing
        the hydrogen from the beginning of carbonization. In this test
        the coal
        was heated at 500° C for 2 hours and then at 1000° C for 2
        hours
        with the result that the sulfur of the coke was reduced to
        0.86%, or
        0.52%
        referred to the coal. </p>
      <p>The Upper Freeport coal of Table 101, containing 1.21 sulfur,
        was
        also
        treated. When this coal was treated with hydrogen for 2 hours at
        500°
        C, it was found that the coal pyrite was completely decomposed,
        whereas
        only about half had been destroyed without hydrogen, according
        to Table
        101. The speed of pyrite decomposition depends not only upon the
        temperature
        but upon the partial pressure of sulfur over it, so that the
        presence
        of
        hydrogen reduces this partial pressure, the decomposition
        becomes more
        rapid. As Table 101 shows that the pyretic sulfur would be
        destroyed in
        any event by thermal decomposition, the presence of hydrogen
        does not
        effect
        removal of this constituent from the coke, but merely permits
        its
        transformation
        to become complete at a lower temperature. When the Upper
        Freeport coal
        was treated at 500° C for one hour and then at 1000° C for one
        hour with slightly moist hydrogen, it was found that the coke
        contained
        0.82% of the original sulfur after the 500° C stage and only
        0.07%
        after the 1000° C stage. The distribution of sulfur after the
        500°
        C stage was 0.01% pyretic, 0.01% sulfate, 0.63% organic, 0.17%
        sulfide,
        0.36% evolved as hydrogen sulfide, and 0.03% in the tar. These
        data
        should
        be compared with those in Table 101, which gives the sulfur
        distribution
        at the same temperature for the same coal when hydrogen was not
        used.
        Although
        the sulfur reduction at 1000° C amounted to over 90%, the
        passage
        of
        hydrogen produced no effect on the character of the coke, which
        was of
        a rather fragile nature to begin with. The dsulfurizing action
        of
        hydrogen
        is due to its conversion of the organic sulfur compounds to
        sulfuretted
        hydrogen, which action is more vigorous at the higher
        temperatures.
        Monkhouse
        and Cobb (221), however, claim that when the pyretic sulfur is
        reduced
        by heat to ferrous sulfide, it is not further necessary for the
        sulfur
        to form a carbon compound, but that it can be decomposed freely
        at
        1000°
        C by hydrogen, the statement of Roscoe and Schorlemmer (231), as
        quoted
        by Powell (229), to the contrary nothwithstanding. </p>

      <p>Figure 52 shows the amount of sulfur removed from Upper
        Freeport
        coal
        as a function of time, as determined by Powell (229). The
        illustration
        shows the results of purging with pure hydrogen gas, as well as
        with a
        by-produce coal gas which was rich in hydrogen. For comparison,
        curves
        showing the elimination of sulfur as it ordinarily occurs during
        coking
        in by-product ovens and in primary distillation are given. Three
        hours
        of purging with by-product gas reduced the coke sulfur from
        1.21% to
        0.34%.
        When the Joliet coking coal mixture, already discussed in this
        chapter
        under the subject of temperature effect, was simultaneously
        coked and
        purged
        with hydrogen for 3 hours, the coke residuum contained but 0.29%
        sulfur,
        as compared with 0.75% sulfur when hydrogen was not used. </p>
      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (221), while studying the liberation of
        nitrogen
        as ammonia from coal and coke, also determined the liberation of
        sulfur
        as hydrogen sulfide. Analyses of the coke ash has already been
        given
        under
        the discussion of the effect of nitrogenous and hydrogenous
        atmospheres
        on the oxidation and dissociation of ammonia. Analyses of raw
        coal and
        the 500° C, 800° C and 1100° C cokes which were tested were
        also given in Table 93, from which it is seen that the higher
        the
        temperature
        of carbonization, the less the percentage of initial sulfur that
        remains
        in the coke. Taking the sulfur in the coal as 100%, that in the
        500°
        C coke and in the 800° C coke was 56.4% and 50.1% respectively.
      </p>
      <p>Figure 53 shows the result of treating 500° C low temperature
        coke
        successively with nitrogen, hydrogen, and steam at 800° C.
        Comparison
        of this illustration with that of Figure 49, for the same set of
        experiments
        in the removal of hydrogen, sows a great similarity. In an
        atmosphere
        of
        nitrogen, the removal of sulfur is practically negligible, but
        in
        atmospheres
        of hydrogen and of steam the reaction of the sulfur to form
        hydrogen
        sulfide
        is far more sensitive than that of nitrogen to form ammonia. The
        use of
        nitrogen removed 1% of the coke sulfur and the hydrogen removed
        about
        51.8%of
        the coke sulfur, whereas treatment with steam to complete
        gasification
        removed an additional 40.2% of the total sulfur in the coke,
        amounting
        in all to 93%, with the rest remaining in the ash and
        unaccounted for.
        When the experiment was repeated with omission of the hydrogen
        stage,
        only
        53.7% of the coke sulfur was removed as hydrogen sulfide. When
        the
        hydrogen
        stage was omitted, apparently quite apportion of the coke sulfur
        was
        oxidized,
        the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide later reacting to
        precipitate
        sulfur
        as a white milk in the gas washers. </p>

      <p>Figure 54 shows the result of heating the 500° C low
        temperature
        coke to various temperatures in an atmosphere of hydrogen. A
        similar
        experiment
        up to 800° C in an atmosphere of nitrogen resulted in only 0.8%
        of
        the sulfur of the coke being liberated as hydrogen sulfide. Up
        to
        800°
        C, the evolution of hydrogen sulfide from the low temperature
        coke in a
        hydrogenous atmosphere was fairly steady, but at 800° C it fell
        off
        rapidly. At 900° C, however, there was a rapid hydrogenation of
        the
        sulfur which fell off after about 20 hours treatment and could
        not be
        materially
        increased by raising the temperature to even 1000° C, Treatment
        in
        stages of 100° C, up to 800° C, removed 63.4% of the coke
        sulfur
        as hydrogen sulfide in an atmosphere of hydrogen, as compared
        with only
        52.8% when it was heated to 800° C final temperature in a single
        heating
        stage, as seen form Figure 53. After 200 hours of treatment and
        1000°
        C final temperature, 93.8% of the sulfur was removed from the
        coke as
        hydrogen
        sulfide. When next an atmosphere of steam was used in
        multi-stage
        heating
        of the 500° C coke, only 66.4% of the sulfur was finally
        obtained
        as
        hydrogen sulfide and only traces of sulfur were left in the ash,
        the
        remaining
        sulfur being unaccounted for. When the 1100° C coke was heated
        up
        to
        1000° C in nitrogen and steam, only 60.6% of the sulfur was
        evolved
        as hydrogen sulfide, although all was driven from the coke,
        two-fifths
        of that evolved appearing up to 800° C, three-fifths at 900° C,
        and only a fraction of 1% at 1000° C. </p>
      <p>The result of heating the 800° C coke up to 1000° C in
        stages
        with an atmosphere of hydrogen is shown in Figure 55 and Table
        102
        gives
        a sulfur balance for these conditions, as well as for an
        atmosphere of
        nitrogen. From the sulfur balance and the illustration, it is
        patent
        that
        in a nitrogenous atmosphere very little sulfur in any form was
        eliminated
        from the coke. At 600° C in an atmosphere of hydrogen very
        little
        hydrogen
        sulfide was removed from the 800° C coke, but at reheat
        temperatures
        of 800° C and 1000° C, hydrogen sulfide was evolved at a fairly
        uniform rate for 8-hour periods of heating. </p>

      <p>When coke, which was produced at 1000° C, was heated through
        these
        temperature stages in a hydrogenous atmosphere, the results
        noted in
        Figure
        56 were obtained. Only 25.3% of the sulfur in the coke appeared
        as
        hydrogen
        sulfide when heated for over 16 hours to a final temperature of
        1000°
        C, about 76% remaining in the coke. However, when steam was
        mixed with
        the hydrogen and passed over the coke, decidedly different
        results were
        obtained, as shown in Figure 56. With the moist hydrogen
        atmosphere,
        very
        little hydrogen sulfide was produced at 600° C, as before, but
        when
        the temperature was raised to 800° C, the evolution became
        rapid,
        decreasing
        after about 5 hours, but hydrogen sulfide was evolved in
        quantities,
        even
        beyond 12 hours of heating. Finally, when the temperature was
        increased
        to 1000° C, the evolution of hydrogen sulfide became voluminous,
        the
        elimination of sulfur being at the rate of about 11% of that in
        the
        coke
        per hour of treatment. </p>
      <p>Monkhouse and Cobb (220, 221) noted two important differences
        in
        the
        liberation of ammonia and of hydrogen sulfide from coke by
        hydrogen. In
        the first place, there was no loss of hydrogen sulfide by
        thermal
        dissociation,
        as in the case of ammonia, and in the second place, hydrogen at
        800°
        C attacked the sulfur compounds in 1100° C hard coke, but not
        the
        nitrogen
        compounds. The first of these differences is explained by the
        fact that
        the dissociation equilibrium of hydrogen sulfide is only 5.5%
        dissociated
        at 750° C, 15.6% dissociated at 945° C, and 30.7% dissociated
        at
        1132° C. </p>
