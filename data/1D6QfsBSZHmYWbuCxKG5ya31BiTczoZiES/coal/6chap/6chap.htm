      <p><a name="adapt"></a><b>Adaptability of Processes ~</b> </p>
      <p>As may be expected in any new industry, and particularly in one
        where the public imagination has been fired by the
        potentialities of by-product recovery in a field where
        tremendous quantities of raw material are consumed annually, a
        number of the processes that have been proposed in the past for
        low temperature carbonization have been prima facie promotion
        enterprises. Most of the processes, however, which have been
        developed to effect primary distillation are creditable attempts
        to solve the problem, both technically and commercially. A
        number of the retorts, so designed, have failed for lack of
        adequate technical knowledge of the conditions underlying the
        art of low temperature carbonization. The absence of strong
        financial backing, an item of paramount importance in the
        inauguration of new industrial departures, where markets are
        unreceptive and where profits accrue largely from full-scale
        operation, has also been a contributory factor in the failure of
        a number of other processes. </p>
      <p>Aside from laboratory experimental apparatus, with daily
        throughputs of several hundred pounds of coal, many retorts have
        been built which are capable of handling from 5 tons to 25 tons
        of coal per day. Several plants have been erected with a daily
        capacity of over 100 tons of raw material. In one case, a low
        temperature carbonization plant with a throughput of 500 tons of
        coal per 24 hours was erected and several of about this same
        capacity are now (1928) under construction. </p>
      <p>In all, the author has investigated over 175 different
        processes for the low temperature carbonization of carbonaceous
        materials and Brownlie (233) states that there are at least 25
        more, of which he has selected 50 as typical of the application
        of low temperature methods to the processing of bituminous coal.
        The literature, past and present, abounds with methods for the
        treatment of brown coal, lignite, peat, shale, oil sands, wood,
        and other materials, rich in distillable hydrocarbons, for the
        recovery of oils, gas, or carbonaceous residuum, as well as for
        the coking of coal. </p>
      <p>No process of low temperature carbonization is applicable to
        all raw fuels, both with regard to type and to physical
        condition. Some retorts are operative with non-coking materials,
        but not with coking materials; some will function with low grade
        materials such as shales and lignites, whiles others are
        restricted to particular coals or to blended charges. As regards
        physical condition, some processes require a pulverized raw
        material, some use briguets, and some merely crush the coal to
        suitable size. There is a corresponding variation in the
        physical condition of the carbonization residuum, as delivered
        from the low temperature retort, but this, of course, is a
        function of three variables, the initial physical condition of
        the charge, the fuel type, and the manner of distillation, Some
        processes deliver a semi-coke which is suitable only for
        pulverization as a power char or for briguetting; others give a
        material fitted for a variety of purposes after sizing,
        including a domestic size which is adapted to household fuel. </p>
      <p>Finally, no method of low temperature carbonization is adapted
        to give maximum yields of all the products of distillation. This
        same statement applies also to the quality of the products. Some
        retorts are particularly adapted to the production of a high
        calorific coal gas; others are suitable for the recovery of
        oils; some strive for domestic fuels and artificial anthracites;
        and finally, there are those which propose to extract the
        valuable by-products in the preparation of boiler fuel. In every
        case, therefore, it is seen that the selection of a process of
        low temperature carbonization, or the design of a retort to
        attain that end, is not a matter of simple consideration, but
        one which, at best, is a compromise and requires considerable
        knowledge. </p>
      <p><a name="classif"></a><b>Classification of Processes ~</b> </p>
      <p>The simple classification of low temperature carbonization
        processes is a difficult matter, because of the numerous
        processes and their complex nature. Simple comparisons could be
        made with regard to motion, in which the retorts are found to be
        static or dynamic; in relation to position, in which they may be
        horizontal, vertical or inclined; in regard to method of
        heating, in which the charge may receive its heat internally or
        externally; upon the subdivision of the charge, in which the
        processes may involve pulverization, crushing, or briquetting;
        upon operational procedure, in which the retorts may be single
        or multi-stage processes; upon the bases of heat transfer,
        involving the principles of carbonization in thin layers by heat
        conduction, or by convection; and finally, upon any generalized
        point of difference of sufficient import to become the basis of
        classification. Hardly any low temperature process can fall in
        only one of these simple categories, so that more than one point
        of difference must be considered in any attempt to reach a
        satisfactory classification. </p>
      <p>Possibly the best classification of low temperature
        carbonization processes has been given by Fieldner (233) and is
        reproduced herewith: </p>
      <center>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Coal charged in

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Coal charged in
        pulverized form. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Complete
        gasification. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Hot gases or vapors generated outside the
        retort. <br>

        foregoing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Melted lead in contact with coal. <br>
        D. Two-stage carbonization to control the sticking properties of
        coal. </p>
      <p>This classification, however, is not the last word in the
        matter, for obviously no provision is made for processes
        involving the carbonization of pulverized coal by radiant heat;
        multi-stage processes may include either or both internal and
        external heating; and no distinction is made between
        intermittent and continuous operation, as well as in regard to
        other distinctive points of difference. </p>
      <p>In the final analysis, every low temperature carbonization
        process has its points of novelty, is gifted with certain
        advantages, and is confronted with its own peculiar operating
        difficulties. It is beyond the scope of this book to enter into
        a comprehensive exposition on the numerous low temperature
        retorts, but certain processes which are considered
        representative of an outstanding type and which have been fully
        tested in operation will be discussed. </p>
      <p><a name="carboco"></a><b>Carbocoal-McIntire Processes ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Carbocoal process was based upon the patents granted to
        Smith and was developed by the International Coal products
        Company. Under the financial support of the US government in
        1918, a large plant with a daily capacity of 575 tons of raw
        coal was erected at Clinchfield, VA by the Clinchfield Carbocoal
        Company. The data necessary for the design of this plant were
        secured from the operation of a semi-commercial plant at
        Irvington, NJ from as early as 1915. Operating difficulties,
        however, together with changing economic conditions, culminated
        in discontinuance of the Clinchfield plant in the latter part of
        1922. The patent rights were acquired by the Consolidated Coal
        Products Company, who erected a large-scale experimental plant
        at Fairmont, WV where the Carbocoal process has been further
        developed and greatly improved by McIntire. </p>
      <p>The Carbocoal (189) process is a multi-stage system involving
        primary carbonization in externally heated horizontal retorts in
        which the coal is stirred by paddles; briquetting of the primary
        char; and secondary carbonization of the briquets in an
        externally heated inclined retort. The Clinchfield plant
        consisted of a total of 24 primary retorts grouped into four
        batteries, as shown in the frontispiece, and 30 secondary ovens
        arranged in 10 benches. One point of novelty to be noted in this
        system is that it combines the methods of low and high
        temperature carbonization to obtain a high yield of oil from the
        former and to produce an anthracized briquet from the latter. A
        very good description of the Carbocoal process, its development
        and operating difficulties, has been given by Curtis (213) and
        his associates. </p>
      <p>The primary Carbocoal retort, used at Clinchfield, is shown in
        Figure 57. A screw conveyer fed the crushed raw coal to the
        carbonization chamber, which was of cardiodal cross-section and
        built of carborundum shapes which were supported on fireclay
        saddles. A combustion flue surrounded the muffle and two rows of
        10 burners heated the flue from below. The entire retort rested
        upon two heat recuperators in which the combustion air was
        preheated before being introduced to the burners. Two cast steel
        shafts, equipped with revolving paddles set at an angle, served
        to transport the charge to the delivery end and to stir the coal
        during coking, thus bringing fresh material in contact with the
        hot sole of the muffle and allowing volatile matter, entrapped
        within the mass, to escape. When primary carbonization was
        complete, the semi-coke was pushed into a discharge chute, at
        the bottom of which it was crushed by breaker arms, and finally
        delivered by means of a spiral extractor through a water seal to
        a continuous conveyer. The volatile products driven off during
        distillation collected in the crown of the muffle and were
        removed from the carbonization chamber through a gas offtake and
        scrubber standpipe at the discharge end. The muffle end plates
        were suspended by springs from the top to provide for heat
        expansion. The muffle of this retort was about 7.3 feet in
        maximum width and 16 feet long, while the overall dimensions
        were roughly 27 feet high, 12 feet wide, and 37 feet long,
        including machinery, recuperators, etc. The primary retorts
        operated at a temperature of about 760° C and about 3.5 hours
        were required from carbonization, giving a normal capacity of
        about 20 tons per 24 hours per retort. </p>
      <p>The semi-coke was received from the primary retort in the form
        of black, friable, irregular lumps which were prepared for
        briquetting by crushing to 1/8 inch mesh while hot. The briquets
        were formed in a roll press, using hot pitch obtained from
        fractionation of the low temperature tar. This stage yielded a
        hard dense briquet, suitable for a fuel, but it was not
        smokeless because of the tar which was introduced for binding
        purposes. Accordingly, the raw briquets were delivered to the
        secondary retort for further treatment. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The secondary Carbocoal retort is illustrated in Figure 58. The
        selection of an inclined oven for this purpose depended upon its
        ease of charge and discharge, together with reduction of
        excessive breakage by elimination of the weight of thick layers
        of the briquets themselves. The secondary retort was charged
        with raw briquets at the upper end and, after carbonization, the
        finished briquets were discharged into a quenching car at the
        lower end. An inclined horizontal partition divided the retort
        into two carbonization chambers in order to reduce the crushing
        pressure until the briquets had been thoroughly hardened by
        heat. The distillation gases were removed from the crown of the
        oven at the lower end by a standpipe connected with the
        hydraulic main. The oven was heated externally on each side by
        vertical flues, fired from burners located in the crown. The
        combustion gases passed downward through a heat recuperator,
        which supported the carbonization chamber and in which the
        combustion air was preheated. Each of the two carbonization
        chambers was approximately 14 inches wide, 4 feet high, and 25
        feet long. The secondary retort was built of silica brick and
        measured about 45 feet high, 4 feet wide, and 40 feet long in
        overall dimensions. The secondary retort operated at about 980°
        C and approximately 8 hours were required for distillation. The
        finished briquets were delivered as a hard silvery product,
        being reduced in size about 25% through shrinkage. </p>
      <p>The additional equipment a Clinchfield consisted of a very
        extensive by-product recover plant for extraction of light oil
        and ammonia from the gas and for the condensation of primary
        tar. There was also provided a complete tar distillery for
        fractionating the low temperature tar. </p>
      <p>A very great number of different coals from all over the world
        were tested in the Carbocoal process. Table 103 gives the
        ultimate analyses of two coals which were carbonized by this
        method, as well as the analyses of the corresponding Carbocoal
        briquets. The high volatile sample of bituminous coal was from
        Ohio, while the medium volatile specimen, with high ash, was
        from England. Analysis of another sample of Carbocoal has
        already been given in Table 78. These analyses should be
        compared with those of Table 1 to see how early the raw
        bituminous coal was converted to a fuel resembling anthracite.
        Reference has been made in Chapter IV, under the subject of
        power char, to tests made on the use of these briquets as a fuel
        for locomotives and for marine boilers. </p>

          <img src="104tab.gif" height="214" width="319"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The primary and secondary yields from carbonization of the
        coals given in Table 103 are tabulated in Table 104, where it is
        to be observed, as expected, that the high volatile coal was the
        richest in by-products. Space does not permit a detailed
        discussion of the character of the products, but certain
        particulars in this connection have been presented heretofore.
        In Table 62, the fractionation of a tar from the Carbocoal
        process has been given; in Table 72, the yield of crude light
        oil has been reported; and in Table 50 the distribution of
        various tar acids, as determined by Morgan and Soule (48) has
        been reproduced. A distillation analysis of Carbocoal tar was
        given in Figure 24, while the phenolic content of the various
        tar fractions was shown in Figure 22, to which reference should
        now be made. </p>
      <p>It has been mentioned that the Carbocoal retort was
        subsequently improved by McIntire (234) at Fairmont, WV. The
        McIntire primary low temperature retort is shown in Figure 59.
        It will be noted that there are two distinct departures in this
        retort from the older design, apart from the many minor
        improvements relating to accessibility of parts, method of
        heating, etc. In the first place, the costly carborundum shapes
        were replaced by a corrugated metal semi-cylindrical muffle
        floor, which is more durable and gives better heat transmission.
        And, in the second place, the rotating paddles were replaced by
        an oscillating shaft whose paddles sweep back and forward
        through the grooves in the muffle door. The corrugations are
        cast in sections and are held together by tension produced with
        springs, so that there is the utmost freedom for expansion, no
        bolts being used to hold the sections together. The floor of the
        retort is operated at 650° C, but the maximum temperature of the
        charge is about 455° C, while the temperature of the gas in the
        roof of the retort never exceeds 345° C. This retort is said to
        operate satisfactorily and, up to 1926, some 22,000 tons of coal
        had been successfully carbonized in it. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Test results in this retort indicate that one net ton of
        Pennsylvania coal, from the Pittsburgh seam, containing 36%
        volatile matter, yields about 1,480 pounds of semi-coke, 31
        gallons of tar, 2 gallons of light oil, about 10 pounds of
        ammonium sulfate and approximately 3000 cu ft of gas with a
        calorific value of 950 BTU/cu ft. The semi-coke contains 10% to
        14% volatiles. An analysis of the gas which is evolved from the
        McIntire retort, as determined by Fieldner (36) has been given
        in Table 6. </p>
      <p>McIntire has conducted a number of experiments with a view of
        developing a satisfactory oven for the secondary carbonization
        of briquets, manufactured from the semi-coke discharged by the
        primary retort. A tunnel kiln and several internally heated
        retorts were built and abandoned. The carbonizer finally adopted
        consists of 5 superimposed horizontal retorts into which the
        briquets are charged on trays by special machinery. The briquets
        are heated for 30 minutes at a temperature of about 650° C by
        radiation from the crown and sole of the retort. By this means,
        breakage is reduced to a minimum and carbonization is said to be
        complete. The carbonized briquets contain more volatiles than
        the old Carbocoal briquets, 8% to 10% volatile matte being
        allowed to remain. </p>
      <p><a name="coalite"></a><b>Coalite Processes ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have already seen in Chapter I that the Coalite process is
        based upon patents issued to Parker (28, 29), one of the
        pioneers in low temperature carbonization. Some of these patents
        were granted as early as 1890, but real progress was not made
        until 1906, when he introduced the principal of carbonization
        with superheated steam. The processes are controlled by Low
        Temperature Carbonization, Ltd., the successor to several other
        companies engaged in its development. The Coalite retorts are
        all static, externally heated processes, involving carbonization
        in thin layers. </p>
      <p>After parker's initial experiments, the Eticoal Syndicate
        erected a plant at Barugh, near Barnsley, England, with a daily
        capacity of about 50 gross tons of coal. The installation
        consists of 32 retorts, each composed of a single iron casting,
        containing 12 vertical tubes in a nest of two rows. The tubes
        are 9 feet long and taper from 4.5 inches in diameter at the top
        to 5.5 inches at the bottom. The casting is mounted in a
        firebrick flue and supported over a discharge chamber, provided
        beneath for each two retorts. During distillation, the charge is
        retained within the tubes by top and bottom covers. The
        temperature of the retorts is maintained at about 650° C for
        approximately 4.5 hours to carbonize the coal completely. The
        semi-coke is finally rammed from the carbonizing tubes and
        allowed to cool in the closed chamber beneath the retort until
        the next charge is ready for removal. </p>
      <p>A test of the Coalite retorts at Barugh was conducted by the
        Fuel Research Board (235) and the yields obtained from the
        carbonization of Dalton main, a medium caking coal, are given in
        Table 105, along with the yields indicated from an assay of the
        same fuel in the Gray and King assay apparatus, described under
        the subject of coal assay in Chapter I. The factors given in the
        table are the proportionality constants that must be applied to
        yields obtained in the standard laboratory assay apparatus in
        order to convert them to those expected with the same fuel from
        the Coalite retorts. </p>
      <p>The low temperature gas from the test had a calorific value of
        765 BTU/cu ft before scrubbing, and 705 BTU/cu ft after washing
        to remove 2.13 gallons of light oil per gross ton of coal. The
        yield of ammonium sulfate agrees with that reported by Armstrong
        (212) in Table 88. Tests by Brittain, Rowe, and Sinnatt (125) on
        the distribution of phenols in Coalite tar have been given in
        Table 50, while the percentage of bases in the various tar
        fractions was reported in Table 53 and the sulfur distribution
        in Table 54. </p>
      <p>In 1911, the British Coalite Company erected a plant of
        different design at Barking, near London. This plant consisted
        of 20 retorts with a daily throughput of 32 gross tons of raw
        coal. This is a wide narrow oven built of fireclay. It is 11.5
        feet high, about 6 inches wide, and is tapered in length from
        2.5 feet at the top to 3 feet at the bottom. A sliding door at
        the bottom and a hinged lid at the top keep the retort closed
        during coking. After about 7 hours of distillation, the coke is
        dumped into a triangular shaped cooling chamber beneath the
        setting, where it remains until the temperature is reduced below
        the ignition point, so that the semi-coke can be removed without
        combustion. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The most recent design of the Coalite retort is a modification
        by Davidson (187) of the retorts at barking, described above.
        Brownlie (236) has described a setting of 20 retorts of this
        description at Barugh, where the other setting of tubular
        retorts, previously described, is erected. With an operating
        temperature of about 650° C and a carbonizing period of about 8
        hours, the maximum throughput of this setting is approximately
        36 tons of coal per 24 hours. Figure 60 illustrates the Coalite
        retort, a modified by Davidson. It is built of firebrick with
        dimensions of 9.5 feet high, 7.5 feet long at the base, and 11
        inches wide. The crushed raw coal is charged from twin hopers at
        the top through a rotary valve. Just beneath the retort is a
        cooling chamber, shaped as a right angular sector and built of
        steel plate, provided with a water-jacket for cooling the coke.
        A cast-iron rocking cylindrical valve closes the bottom of the
        carbonizing chamber and supports the charge during
        carbonization. Firebrick combustion flues and heat recuperators
        are placed in the bench between adjacent retorts. </p>
      <p>The most unique feature of this modification of the Coalite
        process is the mechanical device which facilitates escape of the
        gases during coking and final discharge of the semi-coke. Two
        perforated cast-iron plates are connected by linkage and
        suspended within the carbonization chamber in parallel position
        so that the charge is separated into two thin layers about 3.5
        inches thick against each side wall of the retort. The center of
        the retort is thus segregated into a gas-collecting chamber
        about 4 inches wide by the two perforated plates. As the plastic
        layer of the charge moves to the center during coking, the low
        temperature gas finds an easy path through the cooler layers of
        the charge into the space between the plates, from which it is
        withdrawn at the top. When coking is complete, the linkage
        mechanism permits the plates to be collapsed so that, even
        though the charge may have swelled considerably during coking,
        it can be removed easily and dropped into the cooling chamber. </p>
      <p>It is said that an average coal containing 25% to 35% volatile
        matter, when distilled in the Davidson modified Coalite retort
        at 550° C, yields per gross ton approximately 6,000 to 6,500 cu
        ft of 700 to 750 BTU/cu ft gas, without deduction for heating of
        the retorts; about 24 gallons of oil, fractionating to 3.6
        gallons of light oil, 9.6 gallons of diesel oil, and 9.6 gallons
        of lubricating oil; 15 pounds of ammonium sulfate, and 1,568
        pounds of semi-coke smokeless fuel, containing 8% to 10%
        volatile matter. A proximate analysis of the semi-coke has
        already been given in Table 78. </p>
      <p><a name="freem"></a><b>Freeman Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>This process bears the name of its inventor, Freeman, and is
        controlled by the British Oil and Fuel Conservation, Ltd. The
        Freeman retort belongs to the general class known a multiple
        retorts. It is an externally heated vertical carbonizing machine
        in which the raw material is progressively distilled in thin
        layers upon rotating horizontal plates. This type of retort is
        suitable for non-coking and weakly coking coals, shales etc.,
        but soon plugs in operation with untreated sticky materials. </p>
      <p>According to Tupholme (237), the Freeman retort which was
        installed at Willesden, London, but now dismantled, was 27 feet
        high, about 5 feet in diameter, and consisted of 6 stages, as
        shown in Figure 61. A central shaft carried a series of rotating
        disks, one to each distillation stage. The cast-iron shell of
        the retort formed alternate carbonization and combustion
        chambers, in such a way that the floor of each distillation zone
        was heated by gas burners from below. A small, annular,
        gas-collecting chamber was formed above each carbonization
        chamber and connected with it through perforations, so that the
        volatile products from each stage could be separately removed
        and condensed to effect partial fractionation of the oils. </p>
      <p>It will be seen from Figure 61 that the crushed raw fuel is fed
        by a sprocket valve into the top of the retort, where it falls
        upon the first rotating disk. A set of stationary scrapers, not
        shown in the illustration, is fitted to the top of each
        carbonization chamber and a second set of moving plows, also
        omitted in the illustration, is fastened to the bottom of each
        rotating platform. The charge is this raked from the center of
        each disk to the periphery, where it falls to the floor of the
        carbonization chamber. It is then carried back to the center of
        the retort by the rotating plows to be dropped, finally, through
        an annular passage onto the second rotating disk of the next
        distillation chamber. The material thus zig-zags its passage
        during coking from the top to the bottom of the retort. The
        semi-coke is finally ejected in pulvurent form from the last
        chamber to a discharge chamber. </p>
      <p>The Freeman multiple retort at Willesden was tested by the Fuel
        Research Board (23) before being dismantled to make room for
        further experiments. The average temperatures maintained in the
        various chambers during the tests were approximately as follows:
        105° C in the first chamber; 215° C in the second chamber, 460°
        C in the third chamber, 420° C in the fourth chamber, 460° C in
        the fifth chamber, and 500° C in the sixth chamber. The first
        distillation chamber serves merely to preheat and dry the coal,
        while the last chamber may be used either as a heating or
        cooling stage, as desired. Proximate analyses of two coals and
        the semi-coke produced therefrom are given in Table 106. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The Kirby coal given in Table 106 was typical of non-caking
        slack, while the Brynna gas coal was indifferently caking. The
        maximum temperature of carbonization was 500° C in each case.
        The products yielded in the carbonization of these two fuels are
        given in Table 107. The coke was not incandescent when
        discharged, but it readily ignited due to its extreme
        combustibility. It was too small for sue as a domestic fuel, but
        was an excellent material for briquetting or pulverizing. It is
        interesting to note the low yield of ammonium sulfate, although
        Table 106 shows the coals to have contained sufficient
        quantities of elementary nitrogen to give a fair yield, provided
        the temperature of carbonization was sufficiently high. This was
        apparently not the case, or else such ammonia as was evolved was
        rapidly decomposed. </p>
      <p>The figures given in Table 107 are based upon a gross ton of
        raw fuel as charged, which included 13.7% moisture in the Kirby
        coal and 5.6% in the Brynna coal. The gas from Kirby slack
        contained 10.9% hydrogen and had a gross calorific value of 895
        BTU/cu ft, while that from the Brynna gas coal contained 12.6%
        hydrogen and had a gross thermal value of 978 BTU/cu ft.
        Comparison of the yields with those obtained from the Gray and
        King assay apparatus at the somewhat higher temperature of 600°
        C showed the following conversion factors for Kirby slack: 0.89
        for semi-coke, 0.51 for gas, 0.81 for tar, and 0.24 for ammonium
        sulfate. The conversion factors for the Brynna gas coal were:
        0.95 for semi-coke, 0.53 for gas, 0.74 for tar, and 0.20 for
        ammonium sulfate. </p>
      <p><a name="frb"></a><b>Fuel Research Board Processes ~</b> </p>
      <p>In 1917, the British Government provided for the organization
        of the Fuel Research Board as a branch of the Department of
        Scientific and industrial Research, and the establishment of a
        Fuel Research Station at Greenwich, London. This station, which
        was initially under the directorate of Beilby and later of
        Lander, was charged with the task, among other duties, of
        conducting experiments on the low temperature carbonization of
        coal and of testing such private plants as requested this
        service. A number of tests conducted under this later function
        have been referred to under the discussion of individual
        processes, so that now only the experiments carried on for the
        purpose of developing operative retorts will be dealt with. </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board (114) inaugurated its work with the
        erection of a battery of 9 horizontal retorts of the type shown
        in Figure 62. After 6 years of satisfactory operation, all but
        two of these have now been dismantled to provide room for
        further experiments. The retorts were built of mild steel convex
        plates, riveted to two steel channels, which formed the sides.
        They were 9 feet long. 2.5 feet wide, and 5 to 7 inches deep.
        The gas offtake connected with the rear wall, while the front
        was closed by a self-sealing door. The crushed coal was placed
        in thin layers upon shallow metal trays, two of which were
        charged at a time to each retort. The trays were formed into a
        grid of 96 cells by vertical partitions, so that the coke was
        formed into briquets of convenient domestic size. All the
        retorts were set in a single heating flue and they were charged
        and discharged in an order which minimized the cooling effect
        produced by these operations. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="62fig.gif" height="243" width="404"></p>
        <p><img src="108tab.gif" height="98" width="296"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In these retorts, the maximum temperature was not allowed to
        exceed 600° C, under which condition from 3 to 4 hours were
        required for carbonization. The yield of products, obtained from
        carbonizing two coals, which yielded semi-coke of satisfactory
        coherency when distilled in the Fuel Research Board horizontal
        retorts, is given in Table 108. The factors for conversion of
        yields from the Gray and King assay apparatus to the yields from
        full-scale horizontal retorts were found to be 1.00 for coke,
        0.57 for tar, and 0.97 for gas. Figure 17 showed the rate of gas
        evolution and the calorific value of the gas obtained from these
        retorts, as a function of the time of carbonization, while Table
        26 showed the composition of the low temperature gas. A
        proximate analysis of the semi-coke was given in Table 78, while
        fractionations of the low temperature tar were reported in
        Tables 62, 63, 64, and 72. </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research board (239) attempted to effect low
        temperature carbonization in a battery of standard Glover-West
        continuous vertical retorts by the simple procedure of lowering
        the flue temperature. It was not expected, however, that any
        economical operation could be obtained from such a retort built
        to function at high temperatures. The retorts were built of oval
        silica brick shapes. They were 21 feet high and 33 inches by 10
        inches in cross-section. Their normal capacity was 2.5 gross
        tons per day, but when the carbonizing temperature was reduced
        to an average of 780° C, the daily throughput fell to 1.8 gross
        tons per 24 hours. A short spiral extractor continuously removed
        the carbonized charge from the retort and delivered to a
        cast-iron cooling chamber, from which it was removed
        intermittently. Four such retorts were placed in a common
        setting, separated into pairs by a vertical partition, and
        heated by 7 separately fired horizontal flues. Provision was
        made for the introduction of steam during carbonization, and the
        beneficial results of this on the distribution of heat through
        the retort has been shown in Figure 9. </p>
      <p>Table 100 gives analyses of the coal and semi-coke which was
        obtained in four tests of the Glover-West retorts by the Fuel
        Research Board, the mean temperature in the combustion chambers
        being approximately 770° C in each case. The charge consisted of
        a mixture of 60% Mitchell Main gas nuts and 40% Ellistown Main
        breeze. Test # 1 was conducted in the absence of steam; 7.24%
        steam was admitted in Test # 2; 13.47% in test # 3; and 20% in
        Test # 4. The products yielded from each of these tests are
        tabulated in Table 110. The composition of the low temperature
        gas from these tests has already been given in Table 43. It is
        interesting to note, that increasing percentages of steam give
        increasing yields of tar. </p>
      <p>The effect of various percentages of steam on the composition
        of the gas from high temperature carbonization in <br>
        the Glover-West retorts has been noted from tests by the Fuel
        Research Board (115) given in Table 41. A number of experiments
        on the carbonization of peat in Glover-West retorts were also
        carried out by the Fuel Research Board (106) and these have
        previously been referred to in Table 27, where the yields and
        gas composition were given; in Table 60, where a fractionation
        of the peat tar was recorded; and in Table 77, where ultimate
        and proximate analyses of the carbonization residuum were
        reported. </p>
      <p>A second battery of 4 externally heated vertical retorts were
        tested by the Fuel Research Board (240). These retorts consisted
        of a standard Glove-West spiral extractor connected by a special
        iron casting with three upper cast-iron sections. The retorts
        were of rectangular cross-section 15 feet high, tapering from 28
        inches by 9 inches at the top to 33 inches by 15 inches at the
        bottom. All 4 retorts were mounted in a common firebrick
        setting. With flue temperatures of 650° C, a throughput was
        attained of 6 tops of briquets and about 5 tons of crushed coal
        per day. After a good deal of difficulty with the formation of
        breeze by the extraction mechanism and with bridging of the
        charge, due both to design and to heat distortion, these retorts
        were finally dismantled and the information gained from their
        operation used to improve the retort construction. </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board finally erected a battery of 4 narrow
        cast-iron continuous vertical retorts of the design shown in
        Figure 63. These retorts are 21 feet high and taper in length
        from 6.5 feet at the top to 6.92 feet at the base. Two of these,
        designated as "D" retorts, taper in width from 4 inches at the
        top to 8 inches at the bottom, wile two, designated as "E"
        retorts, tapered in width from 7 inches at the top to 11 inches
        at the bottom. In all other respects, the two modifications of
        the narrow vertical retorts are identical. The retorts are built
        in three sections of good gray cast-iron one inch thick. A
        modified Woodall-Duckham extractor, consisting of a curved comb,
        which sustains the charge, and a toothed wheel, which slowly
        rotates between the prongs, is used. An outrushing of coke from
        the side of the extractor is prevented by the pressure of
        weighted hinged rods. A number of vertical ribs were cast onto
        the outside onto the outside of the retorts in an attempt to
        prevent warping. The combustion chamber consists of a plain
        firebrick setting surrounding each pair of retorts and heated by
        48 gas burners arranged in three stages of 16 each. Care is
        taken to place the burners close to the flue wall, in order to
        prevent the flame from impinging directly upon the retort
        castings. Two standpipes at the top of each retort remove the
        volatile products and deliver them to an hydraulic main. </p>

        <p><img src="63fig.gif" height="482" width="393"></p>
      </center>
      <p>These retorts have been operated by the Fuel Research Board
        (241) for over a year at flue temperatures up to 625° C. The
        thinner "D" retorts were badly distorted by growth of the
        cast-iron after prolonged operation at 650° C. After
        carbonization of over 1,350 tons of raw coal of various types in
        the model "E" retorts, they have been declared successful and
        arrangements have been completed to give them a commercial trial
        by the erection, at London, of a battery of these retorts, with
        a daily capacity of 100 tons, by the Fuel Production Company,
        Ltd., organized under the joint auspices of the British
        government and the Gas Light and Coke Company. </p>
      <p>Tests demonstrated that, with carbonization temperatures
        ranging from 605° C to 625° C, the throughput per day of each
        "E" retort varied from 4.1 to 2.7 gross tons of coal, depending
        on the fuel used. A number of different coals, both coking and
        non-coking, as well as blended and briquetted fuels, have been
        successfully distilled. The yields obtained form three different
        materials are given in Table 111.&nbsp; The briquets consisted
        of a mixture of 74% Durham coal, 20% semi-coke breeze, and 6%
        pitch. Instead of working the retorts continuously, it was found
        more satisfactory to work them intermittently, fresh charges
        being introduced every hour, in the case of Dalton Main, and at
        2-hour intervals in the case of the other two fuels. </p>
      <p><a name="fusion"></a><b>Fusion Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Fusion low temperature retort is the invention of Hutchins
        and is controlled by the Fusion Corporation, Ltd. Much of the
        development was carried out in a 5 gross ton per day unit,
        installed at the works of the Electro-Bleach By-Products, Ltd.,
        Clifford, England. This system belongs to the type of externally
        heated rotary kilns which contain an internal deice for
        agitating the charge. According to Tupholme (242), two types of
        retorts have been designed, the single and the double-tube type.
      </p>
      <p>The single-tube Fusion retort is shown in Figure 64. It
        consists of a mild steel cylinder which is mounted horizontally
        upon roller at the ends. The crushed fuel is introduced at one
        end of the rotating tube by an automatic feeding device and the
        coal is transported through the kiln by the combined action of
        rotation and the head of raw material which is built up by fresh
        coal at the charging end. At the discharge end of the retort,
        there is a stationary chamber, into the bottom of which the
        semi-coke falls to await delivery, while the gas is removed by
        an offtake and conducted successively to a dust-catcher,
        condenser, scrubber, and finally top the gas-holder. A
        star-shaped breaker is placed within the cylinder, but in no way
        connected with it, so that the rotation of the retort causes the
        breaker to tumble over and over, stirring the charge and
        chipping off the hard crust which tends to form on the inner
        wall when carbonizing sticky fuels. The retort is surrounded by
        a firebrick flue, containing on one side a combustion chamber
        from which the hot products of combusted producer gas are
        extracted by heating flues and circulated around the rotating
        cylinder. </p>
      <p>The double-tube Fusion retort operates on essentially the same
        principle as the single-tube design. In this modification, two
        cylinders are mounted concentrically. The inner and smaller
        cylinder contains the breaker. This construction has two
        advantages. In the first place, it permits charging and
        discharging at one end, thus eliminating one gas-tight gland
        between the rotating and stationary parts. In the second place,
        the coal is preheated in the inner tube before actual
        carbonization in the outer cylinder. It has already been
        demonstrated in Chapter IV, under the subject of preheating and
        oxidation of the charge, that this thermal pretreatment destroys
        the coking power of the coal to prevent adhesion of the plastic
        material to the retort walls, as often occurs in kilns of this
        design. Ordinarily, if some means is not provided to prevent the
        formation of this crust, when dealing with sticky materials, it
        becomes so thick that sufficient heat cannot be conducted
        through the refractory material to carbonize the charge without
        raising the flue temperature to regions which endanger the
        retort shell. </p>
      <p>A test of the semi-commercial single-tube Fusion retort at
        Cledford was made by the Fuel Research Board (243). The tube of
        the retort is 25 feet long, 2.5 feet in diameter, and contains 5
        breakers, 20 inches in diameter, placed end to end. The
        temperature of carbonization ranged from a minimum of 325° C, in
        the flue, to a maximum of nearly 625° C, just past the middle of
        the retort. Under these conditions, the daily throughput was
        nominally 5 tons, depending on the character of the fuel
        treated. The Welback Cannel, used in the test by the Fuel
        Research board, contained 1.8% moisture, 46.6% volatile matter,
        36.8% fixed carbon, and 14.8% ash. The carbonaceous residuum
        from distillation contained 9.7% volatile matter, 64.8% fixed
        carbon and 25.5% ash. The products yielded by carbonization, per
        gross ton of raw fuel, consisted of 1196 pounds of semi-coke,
        60.2 gallons of oil, 2,740 cu ft of gas, 4.5 gallons of light
        oil scrubbed from the gas, and only about 3 pounds of ammonium
        sulfate. It is said that about 65 gallons of tar per gross ton
        of coal could be obtained by rearranging the discharge chamber.
        The above yields gave the following conversion factors for
        yields, as determined in the gray and King assay apparatus: 0.98
        for semi-coke; 0.73 for tar; ad 0.86 for gas. The gross
        calorific value of the gas was estimated as 1,110 BTU/cu ft
        after scrubbing. The solid residuum was discharged in small
        pieces of about the size it was introduced into the retort and
        was, therefore, suitable for briquetting and pulverization. </p>

      <p><a name="greene"></a><b>Greene-Laucks Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>This retort bears the name of its two inventors, Greene and
        Laucks, but it is controlled by the Old Ben Coal Corporation,
        Chicago. The experimental work was carried out by the Denver
        Coal By-Products Company at Denver, CO but subsequently a
        semi-commercial plant was built at Waukegan, IL, according to
        Greene (244). The Greene-Laucks process belongs to the general
        class of vertical externally heated retorts with an internal
        spiral conveyer. It is operated primarily to produce a domestic
        fuel from low-grade bituminous coal screenings. <br>
        This retort has undergone a number of modification with respect
        to minor details, but it remains essentially the same in
        principle of design. Figure 65 shows two of the battery of 4
        retorts erected at Denver. These retorts consist of a cast-iron
        shell about 12 inches in diameter and 18 feet long. Mounted
        centrally within this casing is a hollow shaft, 8.5 inches in
        diameter, which has a 1.5-inch spiral web cast on its exterior.
        Each pair of retorts is fed from a common hopper by a screw
        conveyer which introduces the raw coal at the bottom of the
        retort. The central core is mounted upon a thrust bearing at the
        bottom and is geared to rotate slowly, so that the charge is
        forced upward by the motion and discharged at the top after
        carbonization. The speed of rotation varies from 1 rpm to 3 rpm,
        depending upon the material being processed and upon the
        percentage volatile matter which is permitted to remain in the
        coke. Each retort is mounted in a firebrick setting, leaving a 4
        inch heating flue surrounding the metal shell. Sticking of the
        charge to the rotor is prevented by heating the interior walls
        of the shaft by a gas burner, consisting of a perforated gas
        pipe. The height of this retort was subsequently reduced to 12
        feet, while the Waukegan modification was again increased to 18
        feet high and enlarged to 3 feet in diameter. </p>
      <p>With a shell temperature of about 450° C, extensive tests on
        bituminous coals showed a yield of low temperature tar amounting
        to 0.876 gallons per 1% of volatile matter in the raw fuel. The
        average yield of products per net ton from bituminous coal was
        1,400 pounds of semi-coke, 35 gallons of tar, 4000 cu ft of gas,
        and 12 pounds of ammonium sulfate. About half of the gas, which
        had a calorific value of approximately 700 BTU/cu ft, was
        required for heating the retort. A low grade Colorado shale,
        containing 28% volatile matter and 30% ash, yielded upon
        carbonization 1,500 pounds of solid residuum, 30 gallons of tar,
        4000 cu ft of 793 BTU/cu ft gas per gross ton, and 15 pounds of
        ammonium sulfate. </p>

      <p><a name="ksg"></a><b>K.S.G. Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Kohlensheidungs Gesellschaft, Essen, Germany, is
        responsible for this process, which was invented by Cantieny
        (245). The development work was carried out at the Mathias
        Stinnes Colliery at Karnap. A plant of this type, with a large
        daily capacity, is now (1928) under construction at New
        Brunswick, NJ by the International Coal Carbonization Company, a
        subsidiary f the International Combustion Engineering Company,
        who have acquired the process. The K.S.G. process belongs to the
        general type of externally heated rotary kiln retorts in which
        the coal is preheated before actual distillation. </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 66, the K.S.G. retort consists of two
        coaxial cylinders securely fastened together and mounted at an
        inclination upon rollers, so that they rotate as a unit. The
        entire weight of the retort is carried by the cooler inner
        cylinder, which, according to Mueller (246), is an important
        advantage, in that the supporting structure never exceeds 300°
        C, and sagging of the retort, caused by reduction of tensile
        strength through heating of the steel shell, is avoided. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="66fig.gif" height="299" width="558"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The K.S.G. kiln, which is installed at Karnap, is 76 feet long.
        Its inner cylinder is 5.75 feet in diameter, while it outer
        shell is 10 feet in diameter. The charge requires about 2.5
        hours to pass through the retort when the speed of revolution is
        approximately once in 1.5 minutes. A retort of this size has a
        daily throughput ranging from 60 to 80 tons. It will be seen
        from Figure 66 that the crushed raw fuel is introduced by a
        special screw conveyer, which projects well into the lower end
        of the inner or preheating cylinder. Spiral flights, fastened to
        the inner wall of the smaller cylinder, convey the coal to the
        upper end of the retort, where it falls through discharge ports
        into the outer or carbonizing cylinder. It is claimed that this
        pretreatment sufficiently removes the sticking quality of the
        fuel, so that it does not stick to the walls of the outer
        chamber. The retort s mounted in an ordinary firebrick
        combustion chamber in such a way that the hottest zone of the
        retort is at the point where the pretreated coal falls into the
        carbonizing cylinder. By this procedure, the pretreated coal is
        rapidly brought through the plastic stage long before the
        semi-coke is discharged, thus giving the material sufficient
        time to cement the coal particles together and harden, with the
        result that the breeze is reduced to a minimum. The pretreated
        charge, having been deposited at the upper end of the outer
        chamber, descends to the charging end under the combined action
        of gravity and rotation. At the bottom end of the retort, the
        finished semi-coke is elevated by a plow into a short extremity
        of the inner cylinder, where reverse spiral flanges transport
        the material to the discharge exit. The volatile products are
        withdrawn through a hollow shaft at the upper end of the retort.
        Provision is made for introducing steam to the carbonizing
        cylinder through 12 longitudinal steam chests which are arranged
        around the periphery of the outer cylinder and connected with a
        rotating valve so that steam is introduced only while coal is
        above the steam chests. The temperature of preheating ranges
        from 200° C to 300° C, while that of carbonization ranges from
        600° C to 700° C. The superheated steam is introduced at a
        pressure of about 7.5 psi and at a total temperature of
        approximately 450° C. </p>
      <p>Using a weakly coking German coal, containing 25% volatile
        matter, 57% fixed carbon, about 15% ash, and 3% moisture, the
        average yield was 1837 pounds of semi-coke, 11.3 gallons of dry
        tar, 2420 cu ft of low temperature gas, and slightly over one
        gallon of light oil scrubbed from the gas. The thermal value of
        the low temperature gas ranged from 750 to 830 BTU/cu ft. About
        85% of the semi-coke was in lumps, ranging in size from 0.5 inch
        to 4 inches, and proximate analysis showed it to contain 9.3%
        volatile matter and 18.6% ash. When coals containing a higher
        percentage of volatile matte were used, a greater yield of tar
        was obtained, but the throughput of the retort was
        correspondingly reduced. </p>
      <p><a name="maclaur"></a><b>Maclaurin Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The patents on this process are controlled by Maclaurin
        Carbonization, Ltd. The Maclaurin (188) retort is an internally
        heated process of the partial gasification type. It combines
        both the principles of low temperature carbonization and of the
        manufacture of producer gas. </p>
      <p>After his initial small-scale experiments, Maclaurin (247)
        erected a semi-commercial plant with a daily capacity of 20
        gross tons at the Port Dundas plant of the Glasgow Corporation,
        Scotland. The Port Dundas retort consisted of a gas producer and
        a carbonizing shaft built into a single setting with a
        connecting conduit, so that the hot producer gas could be led
        directly from the top of the gasification chamber into the
        bottom of the carbonizing shaft. The hot producer gas, rising up
        through the layers of fresh coal, distilled it with its sensible
        heat. The semi-coke was extracted at intervals from the bottom
        of the carbonizing shaft and partly charged to the combustion
        chamber for complete gasification. The top of the retort was
        built of steel, as an inverted cone, and the volatile products
        were led over the top of the funnel to a gas-collecting chamber,
        from which it was withdrawn to the condensers. The gasification
        and carbonization chambers were segregated in the Port Dundas
        retort to reduce the ash that would appear in the semi-coke, and
        both operations were carried out in a single chamber. It was
        subsequently discovered, however, that the ash from partial
        gasification can be very easily separated from the semi-coke, so
        that segregation of the gasification chamber from the
        distillation shaft was entirely unnecessary. An analysis of the
        semi-coke obtained from this retort has been given in Table 78.
      </p>
      <p>Following the experience gained at Port Dundas, a retort of the
        design shown in Figure 67 was erected and tested at Grangemouth,
        Scotland, and the results are said to have been sufficiently
        satisfactory to warrant the installation of a battery of 5
        Maclaurin low temperature retorts at the Dalmarnock Gasworks of
        the Glasgow Corporation for the production of smokeless fuel. </p>
      <p>The Grangemouth retort, which somewhat resembles a blast
        furnace in shape, has a daily capacity of 20 tons. It is square
        in cross-section and stands about 45 feet tall overall.
        Externally, the retort tapers from about 8 feet at the top to
        about 13 feet at the bottom, but internally the maximum width of
        8 feet occurs about 7 feet from the base. Air is blown into the
        retort at the point of its maximum internal width, so that this
        section of the retort constitutes the partial gasification zone,
        while the superincumbent layers of fuel constitute the
        carbonizing shaft. The top of the firebrick shaft is surmounted
        by a double-walled metal cylinder, into which the raw coal is
        introduced from a charging hopper immediately above. Any oils,
        which are distilled from the coal and condense on the cold metal
        walls, are collected by a trough at the top of the refractory
        shaft, thus preventing the low temperature oil from trickling
        down the walls to the hot gasification zone where they would be
        cracked. A V-shape dividing wall extends across the retort just
        below the combustion zone and seems to divide the charge so that
        it can be withdrawn from two discharge doors at the bottom of
        the retort. The mixture of producer and low temperature gas is
        withdrawn at the top of the retort, the metal cylinder being
        built with hollow walls to form an annular gas-collecting
        chamber. The temperature in the retort ranges from about 900° C
        in the combustion zone to about 70° C at the top of the retort,
        the bulk of the volatile products, however, being removed at
        temperatures from 300° C to 500° C. </p>
      <p>A test on bituminous coal at Grangemouth showed a yield, per
        gross ton of coal, amounting to 1,096 pounds of semi-coke, 18.7
        gallons of oil, 27,731 cu ft of gas, and 14.5 pounds of ammonium
        sulfate. About 74% of the coke was larger than one-inch lumps.
        The composition of the gas, which had a gross heating value of
        247 BTU/cu ft, has already been given in Table 26. The original
        coal contained 30.5% volatiles, 53.7% fixed carbon, 8.1% ash,
        and 1.3% moisture, whereas proximate analysis of the large lumps
        of the residuum showed 3% volatile matter, 81.2% fixed carbon,
        13.5% ash, and 2.3% moisture. Most of the ash from combustion
        was concentrated in the breeze, which contained from 20 to 35%
        ash. </p>
      <p>Tupholme (248) reports some yields when the Grangemouth retort
        was used to completely gasify the coal for the purpose of
        recovering the low temperature oil, ammonia, and gas without the
        production of coke. The fact that the solid fuel is completely
        gasified, of course, has very little bearing on the
        characteristics of the tar produced, as long as the tar is
        distilled out by the sensible heat of the gas before the coke
        reaches the combustion zone. Table 112 gives the proximate
        analyses of three low-grade fuels completely gasified in the
        Maclaurin retort, without the production of smokeless fuel. The
        thermal efficiency of complete gasification was 81% for the
        cannel coal, 88% for the bituminous refuse, and 72% for the
        anthracite refuse. </p>

      <p>This process, which is based on the invention of McEwen, is
        controlled by the International Combustion Engineering
        Corporation and was largely developed by Runge (249) at the
        Lakeside Station of the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light
        Company. The McEwen-Runge process is an internally heated static
        vertical retort of the treatment of pulverized coal. </p>
      <p>McEwens's initial attempt at the low temperature carbonization
        of powdered coal was made in a closed circuit of cast-iron pipe
        6 inches in diameter and approximately 70 feet in length. In
        this apparatus the pulverize coal was held in suspension by the
        rapidly moving superheated gas, which acted both as the
        carbonizing medium and as the means of transport for the fuel.
        The completely carbonized particles were finally separated from
        the heating medium by a cyclone dust-catcher. The original
        scheme was eventually abandoned when it was found impossible to
        maintain the dust in suspension at the temperature required for
        carbonization without maintaining excessive gas velocities,
        which would necessitate an undue length for the carbonizing
        circuit. </p>

      <p>The Milwaukee development unit, shown schematically in Figure
        68, consists of two superimposed steel cylinders, each about 30
        feet in length and 6 feet internal diameter. The cylinders are
        lined with refractory to protect them from the heat. The upper
        cylinder constitutes the primary retort, where the coal is
        treated by preheating or partial oxidation to destroy its coking
        property, while the lower cylinder forms the secondary retort,
        where the coal is carbonized. The pulverized coal is introduced
        at the top of the primary retort through 4 feed pipes which
        project about 8 feet into the cylinder and which are fed by
        screw conveyers. The raw pulverized coal then falls freely to
        the bottom of the primary retort against a current of hot air,
        or products of combustion, introduced by means of a bustle pipe
        at the bottom of the chamber. By the time the pretreated coal
        collects in the bottom of the primary retort its agglomerating
        power has been entirely destroyed and the hot material is fed by
        screw conveyers through four additional deed pipes into the top
        of the secondary retort, where it again falls counter-current to
        a current of ascending hot inert heating gas introduced in the
        same manner at the bottom of the cylinder. Two combustion
        chambers are provided, one for the primary and one for the
        secondary retort. A certain proportion of the coal gas is
        combusted in the primary heating chamber and the hot glue gas is
        used to raise the temperature of the primary retort to
        approximately 320° C. It is found that, if a certain amount of
        excess air is present, the treatment is far more effective than
        if preheating alone is used. Very little volatile matter is
        removed in the primary retort, so that the gas is vented to the
        atmosphere. A certain proportion of the scrubbed low temperature
        gas is preheated in the secondary combustion chamber to bring
        the temperature of the secondary retort to approximately 570° C.
        The hot semi-coke, which is pulvurent in form, collects in the
        cooling chamber at the bottom and may be fed hot to a pulverized
        coal boiler or reduced in temperature below its ignition point
        by a heat exchanger before being discharged by a spiral
        extractor. The volatile products are removed at the top of the
        retort by two gas offtakes which connect with a hydraulic main.
        Both the primary and secondary retorts are expanded to a
        diameter of about 13 feet at the top, to reduce the velocity of
        the gas to such an extent that none of the pulverized material
        is carried through the gas offtake. The capacity of the
        Milwaukee installation exceeds 200 tons of raw coal per day. </p>

        volatiles, 57.6% fixed carbon, and 7.8% ash on a dry basis, the
        yield per net ton in extensive tests was approximately 1,400
        pounds of semi-coke, 25 gallons of tar, 3 gallons of light oil
        scrubbed from the gas, and about 4,000 cu ft of surplus gas with
        a calorific value of approximately 540 BTU/cu ft. When the raw
        coal was pulverized, so that 60% passed 200 mesh, 85% passed 100
        mesh, and 100% passed 40 mesh screens, the resultant semi-coke
        showed that 7% passed 200 mesh, 22% passed 100 mesh, and 100%
        passed 10 mesh screens. </p>
      <p><a name="nielsen"></a><b>Nielsen Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The low temperature retort designed by Nielsen (91, 250) is a
        horizontal rotary kiln, internally heated by the sensible heat
        of hot gas. The process, originally controlled by Messrs. Laing,
        Marshall, and Nielsen, is now owned by the Sensible Heat
        Distillation, Ltd, London. A plant of this type, with a daily
        capacity of 100 gross tons per day, has been erected in India by
        the Carbon Products Company. While the general scheme of
        internal heating is always adhered to in this system, there are
        a number of variations in the method of applying it. Thus,
        distillation may be effected by the sensible heat of unignited
        producer or water gas, by combusted gas, by recirculated and
        superheated coal gas, and by combusted powdered coal. </p>
      <p>The Nielsen process, outlined diagrammatically in Figure 69, is
        arranged for the use of superheated producer gas, mixed with
        superheated steam, as the heating medium. A portion of the
        producer gas is combusted in a gas-fired superheater to raise
        the temperature of the rest of the producer gas to the required
        degree. A waste-heat boiler, surmounting the superheater, serves
        to generate steam for mixing with the heating gas. Once the
        process is started, a part of the low temperature gas can be
        drawn from the system and recirculated to replace the lower
        calorific producer gas, giving a final product of superior
        heating quality. </p>
      <p>Tupholme (252) gives the dimensions of the unit, which was
        erected in India with 100 gross tons daily capacity, a 90 feet
        long, 7 feet in diameter, for the first half of its length near
        the charging end, and nearly 9 feet in diameter for the
        remainder of its length. Near the discharge end there is an
        annular cooling chamber 8 feet long and 14 feet in diameter. A
        hand-operated sliding valve connects the discharge chamber with
        the retort, the end of the kiln stopping abruptly in a bulkhead.
        A second sliding door permits the cooled semi-coke to be
        extracted from the apparatus. The kiln is mounted upon rollers
        at each end and in the center, being tilted at a slight angle so
        that the combined action of rotation and the inclination causes
        the charge to travel through the retort. The kiln is built of
        plate steel sheets and is lined with refractory to protect the
        metal from the influence of hot heating gas, introduced at the
        lower end of the cylinder to secure the benefit of
        counter-current heating. The installation of the Carbon Products
        Company is of the simple hot producer gas type. </p>
      <p>The average temperature of the heating gas as it enters the
        Nielsen retort is 750° C and it emerges at a temperature ranging
        from 120° C to 245° C. The refractory lining, which is of double
        thickness over the length of the kiln that is especially large
        in diameter, prevents the metal shell from exceeding 45° C.
        About 2.5 hours are required for the charge to pass through the
        kiln. A part of the semi-coke is used to fire the gas producer.

      <p>Tests on the Nielsen retort, with a bituminous slack as the raw
        fuel and producer gas as the heating medium, showed a gross
        tonnage yield of 21.6 gallons of oil, 44,000 cu ft of gas, and
        15.2 pounds of ammonium sulfate. In addition there was a gross
        production of 1,475 pounds of semi-coke, of which 620 pounds
        were consumed in the gas producer, giving a net yield of 855
        pounds. The gas from the process consisted of a mixture of about
        5,000 cu ft of true low temperature coal gas, with a calorific
        value of about 735 BTU/cu ft, and approximately 39,000 cu ft of
        producer gas, with a thermal value of about 140 BTU/cu ft. Thus
        the mixture amounted to 44,000 cu ft, wit a heating value of 230
        BTU/cu ft. Analysis of the mixed gas showed it to contain: 5.6%
        carbon dioxide, 22.7% carbon monoxide, 10.5% methane, 14.1%
        hydrogen, 45.6% nitrogen, and about 1.6% hydrocarbons and free
        oxygen. A fractionation of the low temperature tar from the
        Nielsen process has been given in Table 62 and a proximate
        analysis of the semi-coke is reported in Table 78. The proximate
        analysis of several other fuels tested in the Nielsen retort,
        together with analyses of the semi-coke, are tabulated in Table
        113. The Barnsley coal, given in Table 113, was a coking slack
        which yielded a fairly soft coke; the cannel coal was a coking
        fuel, and the brown coal was a sample from Germany, which
        yielded a semi-powdery solid residuum. </p>
      <p><a name="piron"></a><b>Piron-Caracristi Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>This process bears the name of its two inventors, Piron (252)
        and Caracristi (253). The Piron-Caracristi process belongs to
        the class of internally heated retorts in which carbonization is
        effected by means of molten lead. It consists essentially of a
        long horizontal tunnel kiln, through which the fuel is
        transported in thin layers by means of an endless conveyer. Two
        units of this design, each with a daily throughput of
        approximately 50 tons of raw coal, were erected by the Ford
        Motor Company, one at their River Rouge, Detroit, plant and one
        in Canada at their Walkerville, Ontario, plant. Both of these
        installations, however, were dismantled because of operating
        difficulties, which are now said to have been overcome. </p>

      <p>A Piron-Caracristi retort, designed for a daily capacity of
        about 50 tons of fuel, is illustrated by longitudinal and
        cross-sectional views in Figure 70. Its overall dimensions are
        approximately 47 feet long, 33 feet high, and 22 feet wide. The
        distillation chamber consists of an arched brick tunnel about 14
        feet wide and 6.5 feet high. The floor of the distillation
        chamber is formed by molten lead, which is maintained in a
        liquid state by a number of transverse U-shaped cast-iron flues
        of rectangular cross-section which are placed side by side
        beneath the lead. The cast iron flues are fastened down to
        prevent them from floating on the molten lead. The heating
        flues, which are gas-fired, are built into the firebrick setting
        alongside the distillation chamber, so that the hot combusted
        gases can be drawn through the transverse cast-iron flues to
        maintain the lead at the required temperature. An endless
        conveyer, built of hinged plates, passes over sprocket wheels at
        each end of the tunnel, the upper part of the conveyer floating
        on the surface of the molten lead and the lower part passing
        through a conveyer tunnel built immediately below the
        distillation chamber. This serves to transport the charge
        through the retort. A second apron conveyor is placed in the
        lower tunnel to receive the finished semi-coke at the opposite
        end of the retort from which is is charged and return it to the
        charging end for delivery after it has cooled sufficiently to
        prevent its ignition. A regenerator or recuperator is placed on
        top of the setting to preheat the combustion gas by extracting
        heat from the spent flue gas. </p>
      <p>The crushed raw coal is fed in thin layers to the apron
        conveyer and carbonized in about 5 minutes, during which time it
        passes through the distillation chamber. The entire heat for
        distillation is transmitted by metallic conduction from the
        molten lead, maintained at about 650° C, through the plates of
        the apron conveyer and into the thin layer of raw fuel. At the
        far end, the semi-coke falls in slabs upon the return conveyer
        on which it is cooled, during the return passage through the
        lower tunnel, before discharge. </p>
      <p>Among all molten metals available as a heating agent, lead has
        a number of advantages which render it particularly suitable. In
        the first place, it is not attacked by sulfur in the coal gas,
        except at temperatures considerably higher than those prevailing
        in the distillation chamber. Furthermore, it has a low melting
        point and a high boiling point, which prevents freezing and loss
        of vapor respectively, thereby eliminating the necessity of
        close temperature regulation. Experience has shown that
        practically no lead is lost by oxidation and no difficulty is
        experienced in retaining the molten metal within a refractory
        structure. The lead losses consist almost entirely of small
        quantities lifted out of the bath by the conveyer at the
        discharge end of the retort and most of this can be recovered
        later. </p>
      <p>A test in the Piron-Caracristi process installed at
        Walkerville, Ontario, using a bituminous coal containing
        approximately 38% volatile matter, 5.4% moisture, and 4% ash,
        yielded a semi-coke containing an average of 9.7% volatile
        matter. The products obtained per net ton of coal amounted to 26
        gallons of tar, 3,973 cu ft of gas, and 1,425 pounds of
        semi-coke. The low temperature gas had a calorific value of
        about 793 BTU/cu ft. The semi-coke was pulverized and used as a
        fuel for firing steam boilers. </p>
      <p><a name="sutcliff"></a><b>Sutcliffe-Evans Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>This process for the low temperature carbonization of coal is
        frequently referred to as the Pure Coal Briquet process, as well
        as by the name of its inventors, Sutcliffe and Evans (254). It
        was developed by Pure Coal Briquets, Ltd, at Leigh, England. The
        Sutcliffe-Evans process is an internally heated continuous
        vertical retort, whose chief novelty resides in preliminary
        preparation of the coal, particularly in super-pressure
        briquetting before carbonization. </p>
      <p>This process depends largely for success upon the washing,
        grinding and blending of the raw fuel. The crushed coal is
        usually washed, so that its ash content does not exceed 6%,
        dried to less than 3% moisture, and then ground to a size
        determined by the quality of fuel desired. Ordinarily the coal
        is prepared to pass a 30 mesh screen, which gives satisfactory
        results without excessive grinding cost. Non-coking coal or coke
        breeze is next mixed with eh charge in suitable proportions to
        prevent swelling of the briquets during carbonization. Most
        British coals give best results with about 22% coke breeze.
        Finally the mixture is formed into briquets, without the use of
        a binder, under the extreme pressure of approximately 20,000
        psi. A special rotary briquetting press, designed by Sutcliffe
        and Speakman, Ltd., is used in this stage of the process. </p>

      <p>The Sutcliffe-Evans retort, shown in Figure 71, consists of a
        vertical steel cylinder lined with refractory and provided with
        a charging hopper and a discharge chamber at top and bottom,
        respectively. The raw briquets descend the carbonization shaft
        under their own weight. Two vertical checkerwork regenerators
        are used in connection with the retort. Part of the low
        temperature gas is burned in the combustion chamber of one
        regenerator, the hot spent gas being drawn through the brickwork
        and finally through a steam superheater. Meanwhile the
        superheated steam, mixed with another portion of the low
        temperature gas, is circulated through the other regenerator
        until the mixture of steam and gas is intensely superheated. The
        hot heating gas is then led to the base of the carbonization
        shaft and introduced to the retort, where it carbonizes the
        briquets with its sensible heat. As rapidly as one generator is
        cooled down, circulation of the heating gas is diverted to the
        other, which has meanwhile been reheated. The mixture of
        volatile products and steam is removed by a gas offtake at the
        top of the retort. </p>
      <p>In a test with Lancashire coal in the Sutcliffe-Evans retort at
        a temperature of approximately 400° C, there was obtained per
        gross ton of briquets, 1,400 pounds of semi-coke briquets, 53
        pounds of ammonium sulfate, 18 gallons of tar, 4.8 gallons of
        light oil, and about 17,000 cu ft of gas. The gas had a
        calorific value of 437 BTU/cu ft and approximately 9,000 cu ft
        of the gross yield was required for heating the regenerators.
        The high yield of ammonium sulfate is remarkable. The carbonized
        briquets contained approximately 5% volatile matter, whereas the
        raw coal contained 35%. The percentage of volatile matter
        remaining in the carbonized briquets can be reduced to as little
        as 1.5% by raising the temperature of the heating gas to 1,000°
        C. </p>
      <p><a name="tozer"></a><b>Tozer Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Tarless Fuel Syndicate, London, developed and control the
        process invented by Tozer (190). In principle, the Tozer system
        is an intermittent static vertical cast-iron retort. It is
        externally heated and depends upon the method of thin layers and
        upon heat conduction by metal walls to effect carbonization at
        low temperatures. Beginning as early as 1909, a number of
        different retorts were designed, culminating with that shown in
        Figure 72. <br>
        A battery of Tozer retorts, of the design shown in Figure 72,
        with a daily capacity of 25 tons, was erected at Battersea,
        London, and tested on many different carbonaceous materials.
        This retort is built of silicon cast-iron, which was found to
        stand up well after 8 years of service at temperatures as high
        as 650° C. The casting is about 10 feet high and consists of 3
        coaxial cylinders held together by 4 radial fins. The inner
        chamber is kept empty during charging of the retort by means of
        a removable stopper, thus providing a gas-collecting passage.
        Two quartered annular cells constitute the distillation
        chambers, into which the coal is delivered. The retort tapers
        slightly from top to bottom to facilitate discharge. The
        cast-iron cylinder is provided with a hinged bottom to support
        the charge and to provide a communicating passage between the
        carbonization chamber and the gas-collecting zone. A removable
        lid permits charging at the top and maintains the system
        gas-tight. The casting is surrounded by a refractory setting,
        which provides an external heating flue adjacent to the retort.
        Even though the coal may be as far as 10 inches from a heating
        surface at certain points in the retort, sufficient heat is
        conducted by the metal walls and fins to completely carbonize
        the charge in layers approximately 5 inches thick. When the
        temperature of carbonization is maintained at 540° C, about 4.5
        hours are required to complete the distillation. </p>

      <p>Marshall (255) has reported the yields obtained from a number
        of different fuels in the Tozer retort, as well as the
        composition of the residual coke. These data are reproduced in
        Table 114 and Table 115. The bituminous coal referred to in
        these tables was a Silkstone slack, the cannel was from Wigan,
        and the lignite and shale were from Spain. The temperature of
        carbonization was approximately 650° C in each case. An analysis
        of another sample of semi-coke, manufactured in the Tozer retort
        from a strongly caking coal, was given in Table 78. </p>
      <p>In addition to the yields per gross ton of raw fuel tabulated
        in Table 115, the Tozer process gives approximately 4,500 cu ft
        of 450 BTU stripped gas, from 2 to 4 gallons of light oil being
        removed in the scrubbing process. A distillation analysis of a
        low temperature tar, obtained in the carbonization of an
        ordinary bituminous coal, has been given in Table 62. One point
        of particular interest in Table 115 is the notably high yield of
        tar obtained from Wigan cannal. The semi-coke from the Tozer
        process is said to be suitable for domestic uses and tests have
        demonstrated its value as a fuel for complete gasification. </p>
