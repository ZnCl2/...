      <p>The low temperature carbonization of coal can lay claim to four
        distinct
        lines of descent from closely related fields of industry and
        research.
        A thorough understanding of its technology, therefore, requires
        a
        knowledge
        of the manufacture of coke and coal gas, of by-product recovery,
        and of
        complete gasification. Consequently, a brief review of the
        history and
        circumstances surrounding the origin and development of the
        various
        purposes
        for the processing of coal will be both interesting and helpful.
      </p>
      <p>Even though the perpetual fires sacred among the superstitions
        of
        paganism
        were doubtlessly natural gases issuing from fissures in the
        earth in
        the
        vicinity of petroleum deposits and asphalt beds, there seems to
        be no
        published
        account of an investigation of the properties of combustible
        gases
        before
        1658. In that year Shirley (1) communicated to the Royal Society
        an
        account
        of his investigation of a combustible gas issuing from a marsh
        in the
        vicinity
        of a coal mine near Wigan, in Lancashire. This same site was
        revisited
        by Clayton (2), Dean of Kildare, in 1739. Upon damming the water
        and
        digging
        beneath the creek bed, he discovered a coal deposit and,
        according to
        his
        account, he distilled some of the coal in a retort over an open
        fire,
        obtaining
        a black oil and non-condensible "spirit which catched fire at
        the flame
        of a candle." Although Van Helmont of Brussels had proposed the
        name of
        GAS in 1662, it is interesting to note that it had not come into
        general
        usage half a century later. Van Helmont writes in Latin,
        according to
        Richards
        (3), of his experiments in retorting charcoal and, referring to
        the
        gaseous
        distillate, he says, "This spirit. ...I call by the name of
        Gas." </p>
      <p>Hales, in his "Vegetable Staticks," published in 1726, records
        the
        first
        destructive distillation of coal. He states that upon distilling
        158
        grains
        of Newcastle coal, he obtained 180 cubic inches of air (gas),
        weighing
        51 grains. Six years prior to Clayton's visit to Wigan, Lowther
        (4)
        communicated
        to the Royal Society that the damp air issuing from a coal mine
        near
        Whitchaven
        could be ignited and would burn. Bladders were filled with the
        gas and
        carried away, afterwards being burned through a small pipe
        inserted in
        the bladder, according to his report. </p>
      <p>Even though it is said by Molinari (5) that the Chinese
        employed
        petroleum
        vapor, distributed through wooden pipes for lighting purposes,
        as early
        as 900 AD, it is remarkable that over half a century elapsed
        from 1733
        until 1792 before any actual application was made of combustible
        gases
        evolved through the destructive distillation of coal. The credit
        for
        practical
        application of coal gas to artificial illumination is due
        Murdock,
        according
        to Clegg (6). The date of his initial experiments is unknown,
        but in
        1792
        we find him manufacturing coal gas with which he illuminated his
        premises
        and offices at Redruth, in Cornwall. The first use of gas
        lighting as a
        commercial and economic substitute for lamps and candles was six
        years
        later when Murdock installed an apparatus in a factory at Soho.

      <p>An old wood-cut, taken from "Parl{es' Chemical Catechism"
        published
        in 1810 and reproduced in Figure 1, illustrates the state of the
        art at
        that time. It shows the approved experimental apparatus for the
        destructive
        distillation of coal as used in lectures to arouse popular
        interest. In
        1807 a few street lamps were illuminated with coal gas in Pall
        Mall,
        London,
        but the public in general and even men of science were decidedly
        prejudiced
        against gas lighting. In fact, it is said that Davy considered
        the
        project
        ridiculous and inquired of one of its advocates if he proposed
        to take
        the dome of St. Paul's for a gasometer, to which the gentlemen,
        Clegg,
        replied
        that he hoped to see them no smaller. A century later his
        expectations
        were <br>
        realized many times over. </p>
      <p>While iron is known to have been extracted as early as 4000 BC
        and
        coke
        was an article of commerce among the Chinese before 100 BC, the
        latter
        was not used in the metallurgy of iron until 1619, when it was
        introduced
        by Dudley. The following year in England, St. John was granted a
        patent
        for the first beehive oven. Aside from the small quantities
        consumed in
        ancient oriental trade and among certain European arts during
        the
        middle
        ages, the use of coke as a fuel may be said to date from the
        introduction
        of the blast furnace in the smelting of iron. </p>
      <p>The memoirs of Becher in the end of the 17th century contain
        the
        earliest
        reference to coal as a source of by-products, according to
        Thorpe (7),
        and it is recorded by Wagner (8) that he received a patent in
        1700 for
        an oven which permitted the recovery of tar in the coking of
        coal. He
        reported
        having found a method of treating coal, "so that it no longer
        smoakes
        nor
        stinks" and at the same time obtaining a -tar equal to the
        Swedish.
        Stahl
        is said to have been the inventor of a process used at Sulzbach,
        near
        Saarbrucken,
        prior to 1768, where coal was coked for iron smelting with a
        crude
        by-product
        recovery. </p>
      <p>Seventeen years before the introduction of illuminating gas by
        Murdock
        in 1798, the Earl of Dundonald obtained a patent for distilling
        coal
        under
        the heat of its own combustion, thereby obtaining the tar and
        oils
        which
        it contains. From the patent it is plain that Dundonald was
        aware of
        carbonization
        in closed retorts at that date. In 1825 Faraday discovered
        benzene and
        twenty-two years later Mansfield (9) isolated it from coal tar.
        Runge
        (10)
        had isolated aniline from coal tar by 1834, but the real
        stimulus to
        the
        by-product coke industry did not come until 1856 when Perkin
        (11), a
        lad
        of eighteen years, discovered the first aniline dye, mauve or
        aniline
        purple,
        while attempting the synthetic preparation of quinine. On August
        26 of
        the same year Perkin (12) received a patent and within a year
        the
        youthful
        chemist had built and placed in successful commercial operation
        a
        factory
        for producing the new dye from coal tar, without ever having
        seen
        inside
        of a chemical plant of any kind. </p>
      <p>The great chemist Lavoisier discovered in 1793 that, when steam
        is
        passed
        over incandescent carbon, the reaction produces carbon monoxide
        and
        hydrogen,
        two combustible gases. This furnished the principle by which a
        cheap
        industrial
        gas could be made from coke or coal. The first gas producer,
        constructed
        as such, seems to have been made by Bischof in Germany in 1839,
        according
        to Rambush (13). He was followed closely by Ebelmen in France
        the
        following
        year. From an industrial standpoint, the development of gas
        producers
        dates
        from the patent granted the brothers Siemens in 1861 for a
        combined
        producer
        and regenerative furnace. Mond showed 28 years later that the
        by-products
        of producer plants could be recovered and made to render
        valuable
        service
        to the chemical and agricultural industries. This gave a decided
        stimulus
        to the producer gas industry. </p>
      <p>Goethe in the episodes of his life "Dichtung und Wahrheit"
        describes
        his visit in 1741 to a burning hillside near Dutweiler, a
        village in
        the
        Palatinate, where he met Stauf, a coal philosopher, engaged in
        collecting
        the tar and oils obtained in the distillation of coal in crude
        ovens.
        How
        little did Goethe suspect that the black evil-smelling liquors
        of Stauf
        would some day be made to yield the richest and most vivid of
        colors,
        the
        sweetest of flavors, and the most fragrant of perfumes! </p>
      <p><a name="solid"></a><b>Solid Fuels ~</b> </p>
      <p>Solid fuels can, in general, be classified into three distinct
        classes,
        the cellulosic fuels, the sedimentary fuels, and the residuary
        fuels.
        The
        cellulosic fuels, of which wood is the most important member,
        have
        little
        value in modern industry because of their comparatively low
        heating
        quality
        and their cost. The sedimentary fuels consist of peat, lignite,
        and the
        two general grades of coal, bituminous and anthracite. They
        were, of
        course,
        originally cellulose-rich vegetation which was transformed
        during the
        geologic
        ages into the black, brittle, compact crust we find in the
        earth's
        today.
        They form the most important source of power which civilization
        has
        been
        able to master, either in their mineral or retorted state. The
        residuary
        fuels are obtained by heating the cellulosic and sedimentary
        fuels out
        of contact with air, forming charcoal and coke, respectively.
        They are
        distinguished by their high carbon and low volatile contents. </p>
      <p>Outside of this classification, there remain those solid
        materials
        which
        contribute indirectly to our fuel resources, such as the shales
        which
        are
        not directly combustible, and synthetic compounds, representing
        the
        stored
        energy obtained from other sources of power, such as carbides.
        While
        the
        oil derived from shale and acetylene obtained from carbide have
        local
        must
        be stated that as a great source of energy they reached a
        position of
        primary
        importance. However, the vast deposits of shale constitute a
        great
        potential
        source of oil whose economic value will increase with the
        exhaustion of
        the petroleum resources. </p>
      <p>The utilization of solid fuels follows three different methods:
        first,
        direct combustion; second, destructive distillation with
        simultaneous
        coking;
        and, third, complete gasification. Direct combustion is by far
        the
        simplest,
        oldest, and most extensively used. It consists in the burning of
        the
        raw
        carbonaceous material in the furnace in lump, powdered, or
        briquetted
        form.
        The residuum consists wholly of ash and clinker, devoid of all
        combustibles. </p>
      <p>When fuel, rich in hydrocarbons, is distilled in closed retorts
        without
        the introduction of air, it is separated into the solid, liquid,
        and
        gaseous
        phases; in other words, into coke, tar, and gas. The coking of
        coal
        resolves
        itself into various methods, depending upon the disposition to
        be made
        of the products. The primary object in central or municipal
        gasworks is
        to produce a good grade of gas for domestic illumination and
        heating.
        Coke
        is a by-product in this process. Industrial coke ovens strive
        for a
        high
        quality of metallurgical coke. Tar and gas are by-products of
        this
        method.
        The low temperature distillation of coal aims at a compromise
        between
        these
        two systems and seeks to obtain a coke suitable as a smokeless
        fuel for
        industrial and domestic consumption with the simultaneous
        production
        and
        recovery of tar, its derivatives, and of high thermal value gas.
        Which
        of the products is of paramount importance depends on the coal,
        the
        process,
        and the economics of the case. </p>
      <p>As distinguished from carbonization, complete gasification
        intends
        to
        convert the coal entirely into gaseous and liquid combustible
        matter,
        leaving
        only ash as a residuum. To this end, three means are resorted
        to:
        first,
        gasification by air; second, gasification by water; and, third,
        gasification
        by both air and water. The air producer method is based upon the
        incomplete
        combustion of carbon to carbon monoxide, only sufficient air
        being
        admitted
        to maintain a temperature at which the reaction can take place.
        Gasification
        by water is an intermittent process. Air is first introduced to
        raise
        the
        carbonaceous material to incandescence through the heat
        liberated in
        the
        complete combustion of carbon. After the air is shut off, steam
        is
        introduced
        to disintegrate and form a mixture of carbon monoxide and
        hydrogen. The
        production of semi-water gas combines these two principles and
        simultaneously
        introduces air and steam to the combustion chamber. Recent
        progress has
        been made in the use of pure oxygen mixed with steam to effect
        the
        continuous
        generation of semi-water gas. </p>
      <p><a name="origin"></a><b>Origin of Coal ~</b> </p>
      <p>At this point a brief review of the origin and constitution of
        coal
        is pertinent as preliminary to a study of the chemical process
        underlying
        carbonization. Today it is well established that the
        carbonaceous
        deposits,
        ranging from peat to anthracite, represent progressive changes
        which
        have
        taken place in the structure of decayed vegetable matter.
        Unquestionable
        evidence is furnished by fossil remains that among the early
        geologic
        ages,
        millions of years ago, the dead vegetation, which was so
        abundant at
        that
        time, accumulated in damp lowlands and bogs. There, with the
        exclusion
        of air by the water, a slow process of disintegration took
        place. The
        vegetable
        tissue, consisting mainly of cellulose, decomposed with the
        liberation
        of the oxides of carbon, marsh gas, and water, to form the
        material
        known
        as peat. As the bottom lands sank below the surface of the water
        and
        sedimentary
        deposits built up, a pressure developed which rendered the peat
        deposits
        more compact and consolidated, thus forming the lignites and
        sub-bituminous
        coals. The internal forces of the earth became active at that
        stage and
        the sedimentary rocks above and below the lignite deposits were
        violently
        thrown into folds, developing additional pressure with the
        generation
        of
        heat. The result of this upheaval and folding was the further
        consolidation
        of the mass and its transformation into bituminous coal. The
        remaining
        metamorphosis into anthracite is said to have been brought about
        by the
        cracking of the rock folds to permit the escape of entrapped
        hydrocarbons,
        evolved from the carbonaceous material. </p>
      <p>The chemical representation of the follows, according to
        Heinrich

      <p>Whatever the physical circumstances bringing about the
        vegetable
        transformation,
        or whatever the intermediate stages of the metamorphism, these
        equations
        give the initial and final stages in the transition. </p>
      <p>The age of the coals in the United States ranges from the
        Carboniferous
        to the tertiary epochs. In general, the Carboniferous coals
        occur east
        of the 100th, the Cretaceous coals from the 100th to the 115th
        meridian,
        and the tertiary coals between the 120th meridian and the
        Pacific
        Ocean.
        An exception to this geologic distribution is a large area of
        Tertiary
        lignites in the Gulf States and a small area of Trianic coals in
        Virginia
        and North Carolina. </p>
      <p><a name="constit"></a><b>Constitution of Coal ~</b> </p>
      <p>The constitution of coals found in the United States,
        determined
        by
        the proximate analyses as given by Parr (15), are shown in Table
        1.
        These
        data are compiled from chemical determinations on a number of
        different
        samples and represent the average distribution of the
        constituents. The
        changes in the constitution of coal which take place with its
        geologic
        aging can be seen clearly. The moisture content of the fuel
        reaches its
        maximum in the peats and decreases to a low percentage in
        semi-anthracite.
        The volatile matter rises to a maximum in sub-bituminous coals
        and then
        varies inversely with the aging. On the other hand, the fixed
        carbon is
        almost directly proportional to the density of the coal. The ash
        remains
        about constant, but the heating value of the coal increases with
        the
        consolidation
        of the fuel, except for a slight decrease among the hard coals.
      </p>
      <p>Table 2 gives the ultimate analyses of these fuels, showing
        their
        elementary
        constituents, as compiled by the author from numerous samples.
        The
        deoxygenation,
        occurring in the aging process, is quite apparent, but the
        dehydrogenation
        is not as rapid, although present. The percentage of nitrogen
        and
        sulfur
        seems to have no general relation to the antiquity of the fuel.

      </center>
      <p>The ash referred to in the proximate analyses consists of a
        number
        of
        fused oxides, principally silica and lime. Representative
        analyses of
        the
        ash of various coals, as compiled by the author, are given in
        Table 3.
        Examination of this table discloses that the silica content
        increases
        quite
        regularly from peat to anthracite. The alumina increases also,
        but in a
        less orderly manner. The oxides of iron and calcium
        progressively
        decrease
        toward the harder coals. No generalizations can be drawn
        concerning the
        other oxides found in the ash, as they are largely dependent on
        the
        general
        geological and mineralogic structure in the immediate locality
        of the
        mines.
        The oxides of magnesium, and of anhydrides of phosphorous and of
        sulfur
        part of the ash. The melting point of the ash is well. The usual
        practice
        of washing the coal before carbonization can, of course, be
        resorted to
        for the purpose of reducing the ash content of the coke. </p>
      <p>When coke is used as a fuel for domestic and industrial
        purposes,
        the
        formation of clinker on the grates should not be more of a
        nuisance
        than
        is ordinarily experienced with coal. If the coke is completely
        gasified
        and sold to the community for lighting and heating purposes,
        care must
        be taken to reduce the phosphorous and sulfur contents of the
        gas to a
        minimum, in order to prevent injury both to the consumers and to
        their
        property. It is not unlikely that the oxides present in the coal
        ash
        exert
        a catalytic effect in the decomposition of the hydrocarbons, as
        pointed
        out by Lessing (16) and as discussed later in this book. </p>
      <p><a name="destr"></a><b>Destructive Distillation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Four general constituents of coal can be distinguished; the
        carbon
        residuum,
        the humous bodies, the resinous bodies, and the hydrocarbons.
        The last
        three undergo thermal decomposition with the formation of solid,
        liquid,
        and gaseous products, according to a table prepared by Lewes
        (17),
        while
        the first contains principally carbon and ash. </p>
      <p>Constituents of Coal &gt; Decomposition Products (Solid ~
        Liquid ~
        Gaseous) </p>
      <p>Humous &gt; Carbon ~ Water, Thin Tar ~ Carbon Oxides, Methane </p>
      <p>Resins &gt; Carbon, Pitch ~ Water, Rich Tar ~ Carbon Oxides,
        Ethylene,
        Unsaturated Hydrocarbons </p>
      <p>Hydrocarbons &gt; Carbon, Pitch ~ Heavy Tar ~ Methane, Ethane,
        Homologues </p>
      <p>Carbon Residuum &gt; Unaffecetd by heat </p>
      <p>It appears that Dundoroff (18) first extracted resin from coal
        by
        the
        use of chloroform and other solvents. He found that these resins
        have a
        low melting point in the vicinity of 40° C to 80° C, and that
        they
        begin to decompose at 100° C to 140° C. The resinous bodies,
        which
        are soft in structure and dark brown in color, appear in the
        coal as
        slender
        rods. Chemical analysis shows then to contain 75% to 85% carbon;
        8% to
        10% hydrogen; 5% to 12 per cent oxygen; about 3% nitrogen; and
        about
        1.5%
        sulfur. </p>
      <p>Many of the volatile hydrocarbons of bituminous coal are
        decomposition
        products of the resinous and humous constituents and the
        characteristic
        cell structure of coke owes its existence to the melting and
        disintegration
        of these bodies. It will be noted from Table 4 that the humus
        differs
        from
        the resin mainly in the fixed carbon content. </p>

      </center>
      <p>In their researches on the low temperature carbonization of
        coal,
        Burgess
        and Wheeler (19) observed three significant facts. First, that
        for all
        coals there is a well defined point, between 700° C and 800° C,
        where the evolution of hydrogen increases rapidly, thereby
        indicating
        decomposition.
        Second, that the evolution of paraffin hydrocarbons takes place
        below
        700°
        C and ceases above that temperature. And, third, that ethane,
        propane,
        butane, and other members of the series form a large part of the
        gas
        below
        450° C. They concluded from these facts that coal was composed
        mainly
        of two substances, the first or more unstable of which yields
        paraffin
        hydrocarbons
        and no hydrogen, and the second of which becomes unstable at
        700° C
        to 800° C, yielding hydrogen as its chief decomposition product.
        The
        first of these substances has been called by Clark and Wheeler
        (20) the
        resinic and the second the cellulosic constituent of the coal. </p>
      <p>According to many authorities, low temperature tars are easy to
        distill,
        and, therefore, require less fuel than the tars from high
        temperature
        processes.
        Care must be taken in the distillation procedure, however,
        because of
        the
        large amount of light oil present. For this reason refrigerating
        equipment
        is sometimes provided in conjunction with the cooling apparatus
        to
        insure
        complete condensation. Distillation must be slow on account of
        the
        large
        quantities of tar acids present; otherwise, frothing will be
        severe and
        subsequent separation of by-products will be rendered difficult.
        The
        cresols
        emulsify with the water and cause frequent trouble. Agitators
        have been
        found to decrease the time of distillation and the use of
        superheated
        steam
        toward the end of the process is generally recommended to secure
        a good
        yield of heavy oil. In the distillation of coal, dissociation is
        much
        more
        pronounced at higher temperatures. Furthermore, carbon deposited
        from
        the
        decomposition exerts a reducing effect on the saturated
        hydrocarbons of
        the paraffin series that are present and results in the
        production of
        higher-boiling
        hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>When highly oxygenated coals, having in the neighborhood of 15%
        oxygen,
        are used, the condensed water, driven off in distillation up to
        450°
        C, contains much more acid that that from coal of relatively
        lower
        oxygen
        content. The hydrocarbons do not appear in highly oxygenated
        coals
        until
        290° C, instead of 240° C. The acidity of the distillate is due
        to acetic compounds. Liberated at low temperatures and
        originating from
        the ligneous or cellulosic content of high oxygen coals. Carbon
        dioxide
        is also evolved more voluminously than from the more resinous
        coals. </p>
      <p>When carbonized at low temperatures, some fuels produce a char
        instead
        of a true coke. This char can be converted often into coke by
        subsequent
        treatment. It is often friable, lacking in the characteristic
        coke cell
        structure and is free burning. In some cases the char is
        briquetted for
        fuel, but the pitch, ordinarily used as a binder, causes a good
        deal of
        smoke and thus defeats one of the purposes of low temperature
        carbonization.
        Further treatment by heat eliminates this difficulty. On the
        other
        hand,
        some fuels, when carbonized at low temperature in certain
        retorts,
        yield
        a strong dense semi-coke. The character of the carbonaceous
        residuum,
        indeed,
        depends as much upon the process of carbonization as upon the
        raw coal. </p>
      <p>Coal is such a heterogenous substance and its behavior so
        peculiar
        and
        complicated that it is almost impossible to make
        generalizations. Not
        only
        are the products in each instance so peculiar to the particular
        coal
        treated,
        but they depend upon the numerous physical and chemical
        circumstances
        surrounding
        the distillation. Such diverse factors as temperature gradient,
        thickness
        of the charger, pressure, and rate of carbonization, all have a
        direct
        bearing on the quantity of gas, tar, and coke that is obtained,
        as well
        as upon their quality and constitution. </p>
      <p>Withdrawal of the products immediately after formation is
        desirable
        from the physical as well as the chemical standpoints. In the
        first
        case
        it means the saving of heat, because any excess heat absorbed by
        the
        gases
        is usually lost in cooling. A low temperature of evolution
        throws less
        work on the condensing plant, thereby increasing the overall
        efficiency,
        as well as decreasing the time of carbonization. From a chemical
        standpoint,
        it prevents cracking, which causes a deposition of carbon and an
        increase
        of gas yield at the expense of light oil and tar. </p>
      <p><a name="ltc"></a><b>Low Temperature Carbonization ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most discussed factors in the destructive
        distillation
        of
        fuel has been the temperature of carbonization. When coal was
        first
        coked
        for illuminating gas over a century ago, this topic was as much
        in
        discussion
        as today. The early engineers recognized to some extent the
        value of
        low
        temperature processes, but as the production of gas was of
        primary
        importance
        to them, they resorted to the practice which gave the greatest
        yield
        and
        so adopted the high temperature method exclusively. The
        knowledge which
        has been gained concerning distillation products. Added to
        changing
        economic
        conditions, has given a new incentive to the carbonization of
        coal at
        low
        temperatures; and so again the discussion of thermal conditions
        has
        been
        brought forward, accompanied by its misunderstandings and its
        controversies. </p>
      <p>The matter of thermal definition of the low temperature
        carbonization
        process is in considerable disagreement among the authorities.
        Parr and
        Layng (21) define it as below 750° C to 800° C, while Bone (22)
        considers it not beyond 550° C to 600° C, and Gluud (23) fixed
        the range as 500° C to 600° C. This disagreement may be
        understood
        by an examination of the coals considered and the particular
        type of
        product
        desired by each authority. Thus, Parr and his co-workers used
        Illinois
        coal and wished to secure a smokeless fuel for domestic use;
        Bone was
        interested
        in British coals; and Gluud was considering the production of
        primary
        tar,
        if primary tar, that is, tar with a small percentage of free
        carbon, is
        desired. It may be seen, therefore, that the temperature range
        depends
        upon the quality of products desired, as well as upon the method
        of
        processing.
        At most, it remains a balance between a good metallurgical coke
        and
        poor
        tar or a good tar and poor metallurgical coke. </p>
      <p>By way of scientific definition, low temperature carbonization,
        as
        hereafter
        used, is taken to mean the destructive distillation of coal at
        or below
        the cracking temperature of the hydrocarbons in primary tar.
        This
        temperature
        is, of course, a function of the physical conditions of
        retorting;
        thus,
        for example, in vacuum distillation it may not exceed 450° C,
        and
        in
        case of pressure distillation may run beyond 1000° C under
        peculiar
        circumstances. It will vary in practice with the quality of the
        coal
        and
        with the economic balance in grade of products that is
        determined by
        local
        conditions. For the most part, however, under atmospheric
        pressure and
        for average coals, 750° C may be taken as the upper limit of low
        temperature
        carbonization. Gentry (24) has advocated this definition of low
        temperature
        carbonization as the only adequate and the most scientific one
        that has
        been proposed. </p>
      <p>From an economic standpoint, the known losses in the present
        method
        of utilization of fuel fall under two categories; smoke, arising
        though
        incomplete combustion and forming not only a civic nuisance but
        a real
        fuel waste; and loss of valuable by-products through lack of
        proper
        recovery
        methods. It may be said that low temperature carbonization has
        for its
        purpose the abatement of the smoke nuisance on the one hand and
        the
        increase
        in overall efficiency of fuel utilization on the other hand. It
        does
        not
        mean conservation of natural resources, but the increase
        consumption of
        one economics good to obtain another. </p>
      <p>The modus operandi is made clear when it is pointed out that
        certain
        hydrocarbons which are present in coal break down into their
        constituents,
        or crack, during the ordinary process of combustion. Elementary
        carbon
        is thus deposited in a finely divided state and carried through
        the
        stack
        before it has an opportunity to burn. It is plain that if these
        hydrocarbons
        are removed from the fuel by preliminary treatment, smoke can be
        eliminated
        almost entirely. Incidental to this operation is the question of
        what
        disposition
        is to be made of the hydrocarbons thus removed and which in
        themselves
        represent a pecuniary value. The answer of this is found in the
        fractional
        distillation of the tar to retrieve its valuable constituents
        for
        industrial
        use. Some of the products can be used as petroleum substitutes,
        commercial
        solvents, and as fertilizers. The coke obtained in this primary
        distillation
        will be characterized by the absence of smoke in its combustion,
        and it
        may be handles in the raw, briquetted, pulverized or gaseous
        form. </p>
      <p>Quite naturally the history of low temperature carbonization is
        closely
        associated with that of coal gas. One of the first to recognize
        that a
        maximum yield of oil is obtained at low temperatures was Perkins
        (15),
        who secured a patent in 1853 for extracting oil from shale and
        other
        carbonaceous
        materials by distillation at a low temperature. The following
        year,
        Sparr
        (26) suggested the coking of coal for oil, rather than for gas,
        under
        the
        conditions of a high vacuum. In 1880 Scott-Moncrieff (27)
        proposed to
        free
        the atmosphere from smoke by partially coking the coal in high
        temperature
        retorts before combustion. Investigation, however, proved that
        only the
        outer layers of coal had been partially coked when removed from
        the
        retorts
        and the core remained as raw coal. Ten years later arker 28),
        the
        inventor
        of the Coalite process, secured a patent for the production of a
        smokeless
        fuel by distillation with superheated inert gases, such as
        steam, water
        gas, or coal gas, at 600° C to 650° C. Later, Parker (29)
        obtained
        patents for heating coal in the presence of steam below 450° C.
        These
        formed the basis upon which he developed his Coalite process,
        which
        will
        be discussed in Chapter VI. </p>
      <p>In the United States, experiments had meanwhile been carried on
        from
        as early as 1902 at the University of Illinois. An announcement
        of the
        results was made in 1908 and further results were reported in
        1912 by
        Parr
        (30, 31) and his various co-workers. While some of the earliest
        research
        on this subject was made in the United States, it has been
        extended,
        until
        recently, mostly by countries with limited or no petroleum
        resources
        and
        which recognized that their coal deposits could be made to yield
        a
        liquid
        fuel which would be of national importance. The World War gave
        great
        impetus
        to research in this field, particularly in England and Germany.
        The
        British
        Board of Fuel Research was established in 1917 to promote fuel
        economy
        and to coordinate fuel research. To that end, it has contributed
        a
        great
        deal of work to the carbonization of coal. The Kaiser Wilhelm
        Institute
        has performed a similar service in Germany. </p>
      <p><a name="chem"></a><b>Chemistry ~</b> </p>
      <p>In addition to a relatively small proportion of pyridine bases,
        low
        temperature tar contains, in general, two types of compounds:
        chemically
        neutral hydrocarbons, forming a mixture resembling paraffin base
        crude
        petroleum; and acidic hydrocarbons, having one or more phenolic
        hydroxyl
        groups. The former consist principally of alipathics with a
        certain
        proportion
        of naphthalene derivatives and aromatic compounds with extensive
        side
        chains.
        The proportion of acidic compounds in the primary tar depends,
        among
        other
        things, upon the oxygen content of the raw coal. Research at the
        Kaiser
        Wilhelm Institute has disclosed that a coal containing 3%
        oxygen,
        yields
        a tar, containing neutral hydrocarbons 45 or 6 times in excess
        of the
        acidic
        hydrocarbons present, whereas a coal containing 7.5% oxygen
        produces a
        tar composed of approximately equal proportions of neutral and
        acidic
        compounds. </p>
      <p>The benzol ordinarily extracted from high temperature tar
        consists
        of
        a mixture of compounds of the aromatic hydrocarbon series, whose
        general
        formula is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>, and whose chief member
        is
        benzene,
        although toluene and xylene are always present in quantities.
        Benzene
        and
        the other members of the cyclic hydrocarbons are not present as
        such
        within
        the coal, but they are derived through decomposition of other
        hydrocarbons
        by cracking during distillation. This is demonstrated by the
        fact that
        the primary tar, obtained when coal is distilled at low
        temperatures,
        contains
        no benzol in the ordinary meaning of the term. The word benzol
        is
        frequently
        employed, however, when referring to that fraction of low
        temperature
        tar,
        or to the light oil extracted by scrubbing the low temperature
        gas,
        which
        is suitable as a motor fuel and should more properly be
        designated a
        light
        oil or motor spirit. On the other hand, it has been pretty well
        established
        that the alipathic hydrocarbons belonging to the general formula
        C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2n</sub>
        are present as such within the coal. The formation of aromatic
        compounds
        from those of the paraffin series can be explained (32) by the
        fact
        that
        the higher paraffin hydrocarbons within the coal are broken into
        the
        lower
        members of the series and into olefins of the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>.
        Further heating will split the olefins into methane and
        acetylene,
        which
        latter is a member of the series C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>.
        Benzene
        can be formed by polymerization of the acetylene molecule. </p>
      <p>The specific mechanism of the transformation from methane to
        anthracene
        has been outlined by Berthelot as follows, according to Audibert
        and
        Raineau
        (33): </p>
      <p>[4] 2CH<sub>4</sub> =&gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>
      </p>
      <p>[5] 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> =&gt; 2CH<sub>4</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>+
        H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>[6] 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> =&gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
        +
        C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>which are the pyrogenic reactions entering into the first stage
        of
        the
        transformation. The second stage of the transformation is
        represented
        by
        the equations: </p>
      <p>[7] 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> =&gt; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
      </p>
      <p>[8] C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>
        =&gt; C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub> </p>
      <p>[9] C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>
        =&gt;
        C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>
        + H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>[10] 2C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>
        =&gt; C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>10</sub>
        + 2H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>which are all pure polymerizing reactions. </p>
      <p>Schultz and Buschmann (34) in an examination of products,
        obtained
        from
        the Fellner-Ziegler process, found nearly a hundred different
        chemical
        compounds in the low temperature light oil, whose boiling point
        ranged
        from 30° C to 200° C; in the pressure condensed liquids below
        30°C,
        and in the residual gas. Schultz and Buschmann (35) reported, in
        addition
        to water, hydrogen, and nitrogen, 20 hydrocarbons of the
        paraffin
        series;
        9 hydrocarbons of the olefin series, representing each of the
        diolefins
        with chain and cyclic structures; 20 aromatic hydrocarbons,
        comprising
        8 of the benzene series, 4 of the naphthalene series, 6
        representatives
        of the indenes and hydrindenes, and 2 representatives of the
        more
        highly
        condensed aromatics. Only 3 compounds of the hydro-aromatic
        series
        derived
        from perhydornapthalene were identified. Four series of organic
        oxygenated
        compounds, consisting of aldehydes, ketones, phenols, and
        cumarones,
        were
        found. Phenols were represented by 8 simple aromatic phenols,
        one
        bivalent
        phenol and one napthol. Among the other oxygenated compounds,
        only 2
        aldehydes,
        4 ketones, and one cumarone were determined. Five sulfur
        compounds were
        identified, while the nitrogen derivatives were represented by 5
        pyridine
        bases, 2 quinoline bases, one aromatic primary amine, and 2
        alipathic
        nitrates,
        including hydrocyanic acid. From -250° C to 0° C there were
        about
        12 substances which comprised some 6% by weight of the coal,
        whereas
        from
        0° C to 200° C there were more than 50 chemical compounds whose
        total quantity was only about one-fifth of this. Table 5, after
        Schultz
        and Buschmann (35) gives a quantitative determination of certain
        constituents
        identified in the tar fraction from 0° C to 200° C. </p>
      <p>Fieldner (36) has examined and compared the unpurified volatile
        products
        obtained from the McIntire externally heated primary retort at
        Fairmont
        WV with the products of low temperature distillation educed from
        a Utah
        non-smoking coal processes at two different temperatures in an
        externally
        heated retort and also in one heated internally with superheated
        steam.

      <p>Gentry has compiled a list of chemical compounds which have
        been
        definitely
        identified in the volatile products of low temperature
        carbonization,
        as
        reported in the researches of a number of different authorities.
        This
        list
        in classified form is given in Table 7. Many additional
        compounds
        remain
        unidentified and a great deal of study will be required before
        their
        structure
        is definitely known. This is especially true of the high boiling
        constituents,
        which are difficult to isolate without decomposition. Many of
        the
        compounds
        listed in the following table do no occur in all low temperature
        volatile
        products, a great deal, of course, depending on the coal and on
        the
        process
        of carbonization. Some of the compounds listed, such as benzene
        and
        phenol,
        although occasionally present, are found only in very small
        quantities
        in true primary products. </p>
      <p>A critical examination of Table 7 discloses the presence of a
        number
        of compounds involved in Berthelot's mechanism for the
        transformation
        from
        chain to cyclic hydrocarbons. That aromatic derivatives are
        decomposition
        products in coal carbonization becomes conclusive when a list of
        the
        volatile
        products of high and low temperature distillation are compared.

      <p><a name="assay"></a><b>Coal Assay ~</b> </p>
      <p>A number of attempts have been made to devise a satisfactory
        method
        of coal assay for purposes of carbonization, notably by Burgess
        and
        Wheeler
        (57) who experimented with a closed silica tube containing 2
        gram
        samples
        which were heated at temperatures ranging from 400° C to 1000°
        C, and by Lessing (58) who advocated the insertion of a piston
        within
        the
        silica tube to compress the coal slightly. Gray and King (59)
        devised a
        standard apparatus for coal assay and conducted extensive
        experiments
        to
        determine its peculiarities and applicability in determining the
        yields
        to be expected from a given coal in full-scale operation. By
        correlating
        results obtained in the assay apparatus with those obtained in
        commercial
        retorts it has been possible to derive the necessary conversion
        factors
        for gas, tar, and coke. In cases where these factors have been
        determined
        by tests conducted by the Fuel Research Board, they will be
        reported
        hereafter
        under the discussion of each individual process. Other methods
        have
        been
        devised also by Fischer and Gludd (23), who used a small
        rotating
        cylinder,
        by Nielsen (61), by Layng and Hawthorne (62), and by Foxwell
        (63), all
        of whom used a method of internal heating. </p>
      <p><a name="thermch"></a><b>Thermochemistry ~</b> </p>
      <p>In studying the thermochemistry of coal carbonization, it is
        necessary
        to bear in mind the distinction between gross and net heat
        values, that
        is, between the heat liberated or absorbed, referred to liquid
        tar and
        water and that referred to gaseous volatile products. The net
        value is
        the only one of importance in practice. </p>
      <p>Coal is such a complex and homogenous substance that it is
        almost
        impossible
        to make a detailed analysis of the endothermic and exothermic
        reactions
        which occur during distillation. As a matte of fact, both
        exothermic
        and
        endothermic reactions take place simultaneously and only the net
        effect
        can be observed. </p>
      <p>At high temperatures, Mahler (64) found that the heat of
        combustion
        of coal was about 460 BTU per pound less than that of all the
        products
        of carbonization, while Euchene (65) using a coal of the same
        analysis
        at lower temperatures, found an evolution of heat amounting to
        about
        115
        BTU per pound. Constam and Kolbe (66) studied a number of
        British coal
        and found an absorption of heat equal to as much as 6% of the
        thermal
        value
        with a Nottingham coal and as little as 2.1% of the calorific
        value
        with
        a Welsh coal. </p>
      <p>Hollings and Cobb (67, 68) studied the thermal reactions of
        Mockton
        coal during low temperature carbonization. They observed that
        endothermic
        reactions predominated in the short region 410-470° C. A second
        endothermic
        period was found from 470-610° C. Above 610° C the reactions
        were
        decidedly exothermic in character, but between 750-800° C the
        reactions
        again became endothermic. This variation between the
        predominance of
        reactions
        involving the liberation and absorption of heat within various
        temperature
        limits explains sufficiently the discrepancies of earlier
        observations. </p>
      <p>Strache and Fromm (69) studied the heat required for
        carbonizing
        various
        grades of fuel, ranging from wood to bituminous coal, at 750° C
        and
        found that the heat liberated was a function of the percentage
        of
        oxygen
        present in the fuel. With oxygen contents below 15%, the fuel is
        usually
        endothermic during its decomposition, while the fuels containing
        more
        than
        this amount of oxygen are exothermic in character. Of course,
        when very
        wet fuels are treated, the amount of heat required to evaporate
        the
        moisture
        may be so great as to entirely obscure any heat which might be
        liberated.
        In some cases, particularly in low temperature carbonization,
        where
        close
        temperature control is desirable, the exothermic reactions may
        be of
        importance.
        Thus, Parr and Layng (70) base their process upon this
        phenomenon and
        Gentry
        (71) has pointed out its importance in the carbonization of
        pulverized
        coal. </p>
      <p>More recently, Davis and Place (72, 73) have investigated the
        thermal
        reactions of carbonization at the US Bureau of mines. They found
        that
        the
        exothermic heat varies not only with the oxygen content of the
        fuel but
        also with the conditions of distillation. Under conditions of
        low
        temperature
        carbonization, they found that most American coals have positive
        heat
        reactions.
        They confirmed the research of Klason (74) on wood cellulose,
        obtaining
        a liberation of 318 BTU/lb of pine sawdust. </p>
      <p>Davis, Place and Edeburn (75) have made a very careful study of
        the
        heat of carbonization of various fuels by the calorimetric
        method
        devised
        by Davis (76). They showed that the primary decomposition of
        coal was
        exothermic
        in character, while the tendency of secondary reactions was
        endothermic.
        In other words, that the reactions involved in low temperature
        carbonization
        are principally those which liberate heat, whereas the reactions
        involved
        in the transition from low to high temperature carbonization
        products
        are
        those which absorb heat. </p>
      <p>The difficulties of making such thermometric measurements are
        enhanced
        by the numerous variables affecting the results. Hulett and
        Capps (77)
        have shown that the pressure has considerable effect on the
        character
        and
        quantity of the products, and hence upon the heat of reaction,
        according
        to the principle laid down by Thompson (78) that the heat of
        formation
        of a compound is equal to the difference between its heat of
        combustion
        and the heat of formation of its products of combustion. The
        rate of
        heating
        determines the proportion of secondary reactions taking place
        simultaneously
        with the primary reactions and, therefore, causes a variation in
        the
        net
        heat evolved. Even then, the character of the inert gaseous
        atmosphere
        is not without its influence, as might be expected from its
        bearing on
        the reaction equilibrium. Thus, Davis and his coworkers found
        that at
        930°
        F the heat evolved was about 85% greater in an atmosphere of
        carbon
        dioxide
        than in an atmosphere of hydrogen, when using Illinois and Ohio
        coals.
        Pre-oxidation renders the coal less exothermic, while preheating
        in
        hydrogen
        up to 390° F has no effect. </p>
      <p>Analyses of the fuels, whose heat of carbonization was
        determined
        by
        Davis, Place, and Edeburn (75) are given in Table 8. These
        analyses are
        given on an air-dried basis. The heats of carbonization were
        determined
        in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The results are shown graphically
        for the
        coals in Figure 2 and for pine sawdust and peat in Figure 3. An
        examination
        of these illustrations discloses that all the fuels are slightly
        endothermic
        below the decomposition temperature, which is about 600° F for
        coals
        and 500° F for peat and sawdust. There is a rapid evolution of
        heat
        when primary decomposition sets in between 600° F and 800° F.
        The
        maximum heat evolution is reached at bout 900° F with coals and
        at
        about 1000°F with peat and sawdust. After attaining the maximum,
        the
        heat evolution curves drop off fairly rapidly and actually
        become
        endothermic
        again at 1050° F for the older and more consolidated coals. </p>

      <p><a name="heatb"></a><b>Heat Balance ~</b> </p>
      <p>Euchene (79) was one of the first to recognize the value of a
        heat
        a
        balance in coke ovens, but since his early experiments a great
        deal of
        valuable research has been done. The heat applied to decompose a
        fuel
        into
        its final products of coke, tar, and gas can be attributed to 8
        factors,
        viz.: heat abstracted by moisture; heat abstracted by
        non-condensable
        gas
        as it leaves the retort; heat abstracted by tar oils; heat
        abstracted
        by
        liquor; sensible heat of the coke; sensible heat of the ash;
        internal
        heat
        of decomposition; and heat losses from the retort. Rambush (80)
        has
        proposed
        a method of estimating the heat balance of coal distillation by
        the use
        of tables, prepared to show the heat abstracted by each of the
        above
        factors
        as a function of the temperature of the gas outlet and yields of
        the
        various
        products. </p>
      <p><a name="catal"></a><b>Catalysis ~</b> </p>
      <p>The catalytic action of mineral matter in the coal,
        particularly
        in
        the ash, has long been overlooked, although attention was called
        to it
        in 1914 by Lessing (81). Experiments conducted by Lessing and
        banks
        (82)
        showed wide variations in the amount of coke produced when
        carbonizing
        sugar and cellulose in the presence of different inorganic
        compounds.
        The
        results were confirmed by Marson and Cobb (83). In view of the
        vital
        importance
        of catalysis in the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons by
        hydrogenation
        of
        coal, it would not be at all surprising to find that the mineral
        matter
        in coal has a far more marked effect upon the volatile products
        than
        upon
        the solid residuum. </p>
      <p><a name="plast"></a><b>Plastic Layer ~</b> </p>
      <p>The mechanism of carbonization in a retort can be described as
        follows:
        the raw cola introduced into the chamber rapidly absorbs heat in
        its
        surface
        layer, thereby driving off free moisture, which moves inward and
        condenses
        in the interior regions of the cold charge; the temperature of
        the
        surface
        layer rises to 575° F or 750° F, within which temperature range
        it becomes fused or plastic; a rapid evolution of volatile
        products
        follows
        the fusion stage and the coke assumes a porous structure. From
        each
        wall
        of the retort the plastic layers migrate slowly inward until
        they meet
        at the center of the chamber, producing a line of demarcation
        always
        found
        as a central crack in the charge. The plastic layer is estimated
        to be
        from 0.5 inch to 1.5 inches in width, and it is characterized by
        a
        larger
        temperature drop across the fusion zone and a great resistance
        to the
        passage
        of gas through the layer. In fact, Evans (84) found that the
        resistance
        to passage of gas offered by the plastic layer was 3000 times
        that
        offered
        by screened lump coal, 75 times that offered by coal dust, and
        300
        times
        that offered by 1400° F coke. </p>
      <p>Foxwell (63) investigated the temperature at which the plastic
        layer
        if formed and found that it lay between 752° F and 842° F,
        which
        is slightly above what is usually considered the fusion range. A
        pressure
        as high as 480 mm of water was required to force the passage of
        gas
        across
        the plastic layer, as compared to about 20 mm before and after
        fusion.
        Layng and Hawthorne (86) also investigated this problem for over
        40
        American
        coals and found pressures as high as 1500 mm of water in the
        case of
        Pocahontas
        coal. It is very apparent, therefore, that in coke ovens the gas
        evolved
        must develop quite a pressure to penetrate the plastic layer.
        The
        resistance
        offered by the fusion zone depends greatly upon the coal,
        particularly
        upon the degree to which it has been pre-oxidized. Figure 4
        shows the
        result
        of some experiments by Parr (87) to determine the effect of
        pre-oxidation
        on the phenomena occurring during fusion. The reduction in
        resistance
        to
        gas passage, which accompanies pre-oxidation, evidently must be
        attributed
        to reduction in the coking power of the coal. </p>
      <p>Ryan (88) has determined the progress of the fusion zone across
        a
        16.5
        inch Rothsburg coke oven and found that 16.3 hours were required
        for
        the
        two plastic layers to reach the center from each side when the
        flues
        were
        maintained at a temperature of about 2100° F. The progress of
        the
        plastic
        layer is shown clearly in Figure 5. The result of such a
        differentiation,
        using 0.5 inch increments to calculate the slope, is shown in
        Figure 6.
        With reference to the last illustration, it is seen that, when
        the raw
        coal is introduced into the hot retort, the surface layers in
        contact
        with
        the flue have a high heat transfer. Consequently, in the initial
        stages
        of coking, the plastic zone travels at the relatively high
        velocity of
        about 1.5 inches per hour. However, as the plastic layer recedes
        from
        the
        oven wall, it becomes more and more difficult to transfer the
        heat
        necessary
        to raise the charge to plasticity, and therefore the rate of
        travel
        rapidly
        falls to a minimum of about 0.3 inch/hour. During the progress
        of the
        plastic
        layer, additional heat has been expended immediately in front of
        the
        fusion
        zone to drive off the moisture which condensed on the interior
        of the
        charge,
        and to raise the temperature of the center of the mass. Finally,
        the
        chilling
        action of the center of the charge is checked and the rate of
        heat
        transfer
        to the plastic zone becomes greater, thereby raising again its
        rate of
        migration. </p>

      <p><a name="heatran"></a><b>Heat Transfer ~</b> </p>
      <p>Because of the poor heat conductivity of coal, the time of
        carbonization
        is greatly influenced by the size of the particles, porosity of
        the
        charge,
        method of heating, shape of the retort, and other peculiarities
        of the
        particular process under examination. In addition to the time
        consumed
        in heat transfer, there is a time interval required. While the
        coal is
        maintained at the maximum temperature, until coking is complete.
        Both
        the
        time of carbonization and the rate of heating depend, among
        other
        factors,
        upon the ration of the mass of the charge to the surface of the
        charge. </p>
      <p>The thermal conductivity of coal is so low that even with a
        high
        temperature
        gradient of 1100° C in the flues of the retort and 100° C in
        the
        center of the carbonization chamber, the rate of heat transfer
        rarely
        exceeds
        0.8 inch/hour in practice. Thickness of the charge, therefore,
        becomes
        of primary importance when carbonizing between 400° C and 800°
        C. Measurements under commercial conditions have been made by
        Wellington
        and Cooper (89) with retorts of different thickness to study the
        rate
        of
        heat transfer and are given in Table 9. In accordance with the
        laws of
        heat transfer, we find that for a high thermal gradient there is
        a high
        velocity of heat transfer and a low time interval for the center
        of the
        charge to attain its maximum temperature. For a reduction of 50%
        in the
        thermal gradient, however, there is a reduction of but 35.5% in
        the
        velocity
        of heat transfer and an increase of 33.4% in the time of
        retorting. </p>
      <p>The slow rate of heating of the charge is seen clearly by
        reference
        to Figure 7, where some data on the experimental determination
        of
        temperature
        inside of the carbonization chamber during coking are given. The
        measurements
        on the low temperature process are reported by Wellington and
        Cooper
        (89),
        who used a vertical fireclay retort, 11.5 feet high and 5 inches
        wide.
        It was heated externally with producer gas and the flues were
        maintained
        at 765° C. About 8 hours were required for the center of the
        charge
        to reach the initial temperature of the retort. The results
        presented
        for
        the high temperature process are from measurements made by
        McBride and
        Selvig (90) on standard Koppers ovens. These ovens were of the
        horizontal
        variety, 39 feet long and 18 inches wide. Over 20 hours elapsed
        before
        the interior of the charge reached its maximum, while the flues
        were
        kept
        at 1200° C. In the first case, the rate of heat transfer was
        about
        0.625 inch/hour and in the second case about 0.850 inch/hour. </p>

      <p>In Figure 8 are shown some isochronic temperatures across a

        oven
        for various times after charging, as measured by Ryan (88). The
        measurements
        begin with the 14th hour after charging, or just about 2 hours
        before
        the
        plastic layer reached the center of the retort, after which it
        is
        apparent
        that, once the fusion stage is over, the rate of temperature
        increase
        becomes
        rapidly greater until, after the 20th hour, the charge attains
        almost a
        uniform temperature throughout. </p>

      <p>According to Newton's law, the flow of heat through a body by
        conduction,
        after the steady state has been attained, is expressed by the
        differential
        equation: </p>
      <p>[11]&nbsp; dQ / dt = kA (sT / dx) </p>
      <p>where Q is the unit of heat; T, the temperature; x, the
        distance
        in
        the direction of heat flow; t, the time; A, the area
        perpendicular to
        heat
        flow; and k the coefficient of heat transfer. The complexities
        of
        carbonization,
        however, render this equation inapplicable in its simple form
        for two
        reasons.
        In the first place, the coefficient of heat transfer is not
        constant,
        but
        is a function of both the time and the distance from the retort
        wall
        and,
        secondly, because the rate of change of temperature with respect
        to
        distance
        is also a variable with respect to the time as well as the
        distance.
        The
        coefficient of heat transmission for coke is considerably
        greater than
        for coal, hence, the manner in which the mean coefficient might
        vary
        can
        be gathered from consideration of Figure 5, recalling that coke
        exists
        in the center of the chamber. The manner in which the
        temperature
        gradient
        varies as a function of time and distance can be gathered by
        graphical
        differentiation of the family of curves in Figure 8 to determine
        their
        slope. </p>
      <p>It will be seen from Figure 8 that for several hours after
        charging
        n account of the low thermal conductivity of the coal, the
        temperature
        range within the oven is very great. Different zones of the
        charge,
        therefore,
        undergo different carbonization transformations at the same
        period.
        Nielsen
        (91) has nicely illustrated this point under conditions of low
        temperature
        distillation by determining the variation of the percentage
        volatile
        matter
        remaining in the coke with the distance of the distillation
        residuum
        from
        the retort wall for a retort 6.5 inches thick. The carbonization
        was
        carried
        on for 6 hours at about 600° C before the coke was examined. It
        was
        found that even after this period of retorting, there is a range
        of
        from
        10.4 % to 13.4% volatile matter in the coke, depending on the
        distance
        of the residuum from the chamber wall. The maximum volatile
        content
        occurs
        in the center of the charge where the temperature is a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>The Fuel Research Board (92) has determined the longitudinal
        distribution
        of temperature in vertical retorts, both with and without the
        introduction
        of steam. The results are shown in Figure 9. The upper curve
        shows the
        change in temperature distribution, arising from the passage of
        13.5%
        steam
        through the retort. The experiments were made on a Glover-West
        retort.
        Under ordinary conditions of distillation, only the lower 25% of
        the
        retort
        was above 300° C and 50% above 100° C. When steam distillation
        was used, 48% of the retort was above 300° C, and 98% above
        100°
        C. In the zones of the retort, extending from 5 feet above the
        base to
        the top, constituting about 75% of the carbonization chamber,
        the use
        of
        13.5% steam raised the temperature of the charge over 100%. It
        will be
        pointed out later that one of the functions of steam
        distillation is to
        assist in the uniform distribution of heat throughout the
        charge, heat
        being absorbed in the lower hot portions of the retort and
        distributed
        through the upper cooler zones. </p>

      <p>The introduction of coke breeze has a material effect in the
        transfer
        of heat. Roberts (93) examined the time required for the
        interior of
        the
        charge to reach 360° C, and found that 58 minutes were required,
        when
        using raw Welsh coal; 46 minutes when 20% breeze was added; and
        31
        minutes
        when 30% breeze was mixed with the charge. Table 10 shows the
        result of
        his investigation. Apparently, the beneficial effects of coke
        breeze
        are
        derived from the fact that it increases the thermal conductivity
        of the
        charge and gives a certain amount of porosity to the mass, which
        allows
        the transfer of heat by internal convection currents. </p>
      <p><a name="intext"></a><b>Internal &amp; External Heating ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is easier to withdraw vapors soon after their formation in
        horizontal
        than in vertical retorts. In a static horizontal retort, where
        the
        material
        moves progressively, eduction pipes can be placed at intervals
        along
        the
        top of the retort to withdraw the vapors. Thus, the mechanical
        design
        of
        the retort is found to play an important part in determining the
        yield
        of the desired products. </p>
      <p>Two methods of heating have been resorted to, external and
        internal.
        In external heating, the solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel is
        burned in an
        outer chamber and the coal is placed in a gas-tight retort. When
        carbonization
        is carried on by internal heating, the sensible heat of producer
        gas,
        generated
        externally or in the retort itself, superheated steam, molten
        lead, or
        some other agency, is employed to effect the distillation. One
        of the
        main
        differences between the two methods lies in the quantity of gas
        evolved.
        Thus, in the producer gas method of low temperature
        carbonization, the
        yield of gas is of the order 25,000 to 35,000 cubic feet per net
        ton of
        coal, a compared with 3,000 to 4,500 cubic feet obtained in
        external
        distillation.
        On the other hand, the great volume of gas yielded by the
        producer gas
        method is of low heating value, such as 250 BTU per cubic foot,
        as
        compared
        with the high calorific value of 800 to 1000 BTU per cubic foot
        obtained
        in the externally heated retorts. </p>
      <p>The uniform distribution of heat in the retort by steaming
        suggests
        the advantage of internal heating over the external method.
        Nielsen
        (91)
        obtained the results in Table 11 by comparing the rate of
        evolution of
        gas from carbonization at low temperature in externally and
        internally
        heated retorts. The rate of evolution rises to a maximum after
        about
        three-quarters
        of an hour of carbonization, after which it gradually falls in
        value.
        Internally
        heated retorts attain an 18.5% higher maximum in the same period
        than
        those
        heated by external methods. The recession in the rate of
        evolution is
        also
        much more rapid when the heat is conducted through the charge by
        the
        internal
        heating process. By integrating these curves, that is, by
        measuring the
        area between them, the total quantity of gas evolved over any
        period of
        distillation can be found. Comparison of the two areas discloses
        that,
        over a period of 2.75 hours, 75% to 80% of all the gas evolved
        from the
        coal during low temperature carbonization in internally heated
        retorts
        has been yielded, whereas 70% to 75% has been given off in
        externally
        heated
        processes. For the same character and yield of products in the
        two
        cases,
        this is equivalent to a material reduction in the time of
        carbonization. </p>

      <p><a name="hilow"></a><b>High &amp; Low Temperature Carbonization
          ~</b> </p>
      <p>For the sake of concise presentation, it would be permissible,
        perhaps,
        to risk a generalized comparison. Considering a coal containing
        approximately
        35% volatile matter, 7% ash, and 58% fixed carbon, it is
        reasonable to
        expect under ordinary circumstances the yields per net ton of
        raw fuel
        shown in Table 12. </p>

      <p>The gaseous products of low temperature carbonization consist
        mainly
        of the lower saturated and unsaturated alipathics. Aromatic
        compounds
        are
        generally absent. The gases, while produced in lesser quantities
        than
        in
        high temperature ovens, are rich in their thermal value. </p>
      <p>Low temperature tar contains more members of the paraffin
        series
        and
        fewer aromatic compounds than high temperature or coke oven tar.
        One of
        the chief characteristics of low temperature tar is its high tar
        acid
        content.
        The fraction up to 170° C, and the pitch usually contain about
        40%
        tar acids, while the coke oven distillate runs as low as 15% or
        less.
        Very
        little phenol itself is produced, but this varies to a great
        extent
        with
        the coal. Of the tar acids, more cresol and homologues of phenol
        are
        present
        than in high temperature tar. Napthalene is absent, but other
        members
        of
        the series have been found in minor quantities. While coke oven
        tar has
        a specific gravity of about 1.17 at 15° C and contains about
        6.5%
        free
        carbon, the low temperature product runs less than 1.10 specific
        gravity
        and usually contains less than 1% free carbon. The presence of
        free
        carbon
        in tar is partly indicative of cracking, which is reduced to a
        minimum
        at low temperatures. The presence of as much as 3% free carbon
        in some
        low temperature tars, however, is due to dust and not to
        cracking. </p>
      <p>The evolution of ammonia gas from coal under destructive
        distillation
        begins below 300° C and ceases above 1200° C, so that it is to
        be expected that the ammonium sulfate yield of low temperature
        carbonization
        should be low. A great part of the nitrogen present remains in
        the coke
        and methods have been proposed for increasing the yield. </p>
      <p>The two cokes are entirely different. The high temperature coke
        is
        coarser,
        denser, and harder to burn than low temperature coke. The latter
        is
        usually
        characterized by its friability, softness, fineness of texture,
        and
        high
        combustibility, but some semi-cokes are quite as hard and dense
        as the
        high temperature variety. </p>
      <p>Since it is obvious that high temperature carbonization removes
        the
        hydrocarbons and resin out compounds, which cause the formation
        of
        smoke,
        as well as does low temperature carbonization, the question
        arises as
        to
        why the coke from gas ovens is not itself a suitable smokeless
        fuel for
        domestic consumption. The difference is that the former is not
        generally
        free-burning. The physical condition accounting for this
        difference in
        the free-burning property is said by Brownlie (94) to be in the
        porosity
        of the coke. High temperature coke is very spongy, while low
        temperature
        coke is more like charcoal. Furthermore, in the gas coke a
        graphitic
        film,
        deposited from the cracking of hydrocarbons, covers the walls of
        the
        pores
        and adds to its incombustibility. </p>
