      8. A more positive indication that the DNA accident associated
      with cancer may be reversible is the clear evidence from some of
      the case histories reported in Ross Gwynn's book "Bioelectrolysis
      in Man", that when enough of his electrolyzed physiological saline
      can be introduced to a cancer site the replication of cancerous
      tissue ca&nbsp; revert to the replication of normal tissue in a
      period of about 72 hours.<br>
      <br>
      9. Because the active components of the Electrolysed Physiological
      Saline referred to in (8) are simple oxidants, it can be assumed
      that an oxidant function at the molecular-cellular level is
      responsible for the favorable change, and that a contributing
      factor to the onset and persistence opf the cancer accidnet must
      be hypoxia at the molecular-cellular level.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Biodynamics has been defined as "piecing together random research
      findings into a coherent picture of how and why drugs work" (The
      Drug Research Revolution by Norman Applwig, Chemical Week, 1 March
      1972). The author goes on to point out that "Biodynamics gives
      researchers three advantages over the old ways:<br>
      <br>
      (1) They can custom design synthetic compounds to do specific
      jobs.<br>
      <br>
      (2) They can use the body's own chemicals to fight disease.<br>
      <br>
      (3) They can deliver therapeutic agents directly to target
      organs."<br>
      <br>
      While the advantages achieved through Biodynamics are individually
      and collectively of profound significance there is believed to be
      another, namely the ability to depart from conventional thinking
      and evolve new theories as to how the body functions in sickness
      and in health.<br>
      <br>
      To one without formal medical education but having rubbed
      shoulders with many in the medical profession as patent attorney
      practicing extensively in areas of therapeutic development for the
      past 35 years and having read extensively in all fields of medical
      advance, a few unfortunate realities become apparent.<br>
      <br>
      A. The practice of medicine to a large extent, and the conducting
      of medical research to a still greater extent is highly
      compartmentalized according to disease or affliction.<br>
      <br>
      B. Individuals to a considerable extent lean toward an area of
      specialization early in their preofessional training with a
      limited amount of broad range experience.<br>
      <br>
      C. In any area of specialization the amount of publication to keep
      abreast of is so voluminous that the individual, once committed to
      an area of specialization, has little time or energy available to
      folow progress in other areas.<br>
      <br>
      The situation might be compared with exploration of a mountain
      range by ground crews before the coming of aircraft. No matter how
      much data was collected and compiled by such ground crews, it goes
      without saying that a later crew exploring by helicopter would
      develop information, data, and inter-relationships that had eluded
      the ground crews. Only as the findings of the ground and air crews
      are combined and correlated can a maximum understanding of the
      mountain range be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The writer has had the thrilling experience of being observer and
      collaborator in a "helicopter flight" piloted by Ross M. Gwynn in
      which, within a few short years, a new therapeutic agent and
      treatment has been used with remarkable success in treating
      several hundred human volunteers having a wide variety of ills and
      afflictions. What has been particularly noticeable in this
      experience is the number of times that response and reaction when
      treating one type of affliction has thrown light on seemingly
      unrelated afflictions.<br>
      <br>
      The new therapeutic agent is physiological saline electrolyzed in
      a manner to generate about 65 ppm of active components comprising
      hypochlorite, a small amount proportion of ozone, and traces of
      free radicals, the active components being collectively referred
      to as "chlorine equivalent". This electrolyzed saline is most
      effectively administered by intravenous injection, and by
      intramuscular injection only when small amounts are neededm
      particularly wbe&nbsp; treating gastro-intestinal disorders, and
      extended bathing of the whole body or body parts, as when treating
      burns, ulcers, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In a publication by Ross Gwynn entitled "Bioelectrolysis In Man"
      he has summarized this clinical work and presented some
      interesting new theories in an attempt to explain the beneficial
      results obtained with a broad range of ills and afflictions. In
      essence the new theories can be summarized as follows:"<br>
      <br>
      I. The common denominator to many human ills appears to be
      hypoxia, general or local ( deficiency of oxygen).<br>
      <br>
      II. In every individual there appears to be a supplemental or
      booster oxidant function, variably produced by electrical charges
      generated in the body as by bone flexing and in brain waves of the
      alpha and higher voltage level, capable of counteracting such
      hypoxia.<br>
      <br>
      III. The severity of an illness or injury can overtax the
      individual's ability to generate sufficient of the supplemental or
      booster oxidant function, creating a 'deficiency' situation.<br>
      <br>
      IV. Also contributing to the creation of such a deficiency
      situation, even with a seemingly healthy person, would be poor
      bioelectrolysis performance induced by curtailed physical
      activity, or an extended period of anxiety, frustration or
      depression, or a combination of these.<br>
      <br>
      V. Injected Chlorozone appears to provide an equivalent
      supplemental or booster oxidant function in unlimited amount to
      aid the natural healing or recovery process during the period of
      such deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      In his book Ross Gwynn has commented in page 51: "In the book
      entitled HYPOXIA by Van Leere and Stickney, published by the Univ.
      of Chicago Press in 1963, it was pointed out that the state of
      hypoxia can be so far-reaching as to affect the mobility, and
      hence the availablity of amino acid. This one factor alone has
      implications o far-reaching as to link hypoxia to the onset of
      many major disorders. Furthermore, they have noted various other
      body chemicals and functions whicjh are altered during the state
      of hypoxia."<br>
      <br>
      These effects of hypoxia on the balance of essential body
      chemicals when thought of at the cellular level have profound
      implications when considering cancer, which is now generally
      recognized as being initiated by an accidnet or distortion of a
      single cell, and the proliferation of such distortion in
      succeeding cell divisions.<br>
      <br>
      The key to cell division os the separation of the strands of the
      chromosomal DNA and the building onto the separated strands A and
      B the chemical 'building blocks' to form two identical DNA
      molecules having strands AB' and A'B. When a proper chemical
      balance is present in the cell environment, and all the building
      blocks to form strans B' and A' are available as needed, the DNA
      replication and cell division can proceed smoothly providing
      normal, healthy cell division and tissue regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      Much has been published concerning the role of viruses, and
      various chemicals as triggering the type molecular accident that
      leads to cancer; but it is considered that these may in reality be
      contributing to a state of chemical imbalance also influenced by
      local hypoxia, and that it is the hypoxia, whether augmented by a
      virus or chemical carcinogens, or induced primarily by the
      individual's poor bioelectrolysis performance, that is the
      proximate cause of a cancer producing cellular accident.<br>
      <br>
      [ ... ]<br>
      <br>
      In Ross Gwynn's work with cancer patients, most of whom have
      unfortunately been in the terminal stage before receiving his
      treatment, there have been clear indications that the injections
      of his electrolyzed physiological saline Chlorozone are capable of
      causing remissions in the cancerous growth. In one patient with a
      rapidly advancing malignancy involving an entire upper quarter
      arm, chest, back, neck and face plus internal growth which was of
      unknown scope and beyond reach, the follwoing progress was
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      A. Local IM injections along a line of advance would halt that
      advance and cause it to retreat.<br>
      <br>
      B. Injections into and around several isolated tumors caused these
      to disappear within about 48 hours -- and there was no sign of
      their recurrence during the patient's remaining lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      C. On two occasions when the patient's throat became so closed as
      to prevent eating and impair breathing, injections deep into the
      neck and throat caused enough of a retreat to clear the throat for
      eating and free breathing.<br>
      <br>
      D. In the center of a mass of chest tissue that was the
      consistency of cardboard, and from which insertion of needles drew
      no blood, prolonged infusions of EPS on two successive days caused
      an island of normal appearing, normal feeling tissue to develop,
      in which the insertion of a needle would again draw blood, and
      this apparently restored tissue persisted for the remainder of the
      patient's life.<br>
      <br>
      Ross Gwynn's work with advanced cancer patients did not permit any
      planned comparative studies, but in one instance fate provided a
      situation which afforded meaningful comparison.<br>
      <br>
      A doctor in Athens had at the same time two patients with advanced
      abdominal cancer and general metastasis. The conditions of both
      patients had deteriorated to the point where death, for both, was
      expected within about one week. The doctor decided to let Patient
      A receive Ross Gwynn's Chlortozone treatment, but withheld them
      from Patient B. Patient B died, as expected, in about one week.<br>
      <br>
      Patient A, on the other hand, responded very well to Chlorozone
      injections, was able to resume a moderately active life, and lived
      on, relatively free of pain for 7-1/2 months. During this period
      he received Chlorozone injections totaling 27,371 cc. This long
      survival strongly suggests an arresting or retarding of the
      cancerous growths, with apparent local remissions; and it raises a
      question as to possible benefits of even larger, or more frequent
      or prolonged injections of Chlorozone.<br>
      <br>
      The one, early-stage cancer treated by Ross Gwynn as the patient's
      primary affliction was lip cancer, for which the diagnosis had
      been confirmed by biopsy test at a cancer clinic in Athens. At the
      start of Chlorozone injections the lip was about twice its normal
      size and discolored. After three IV injections of Chlorozone
      totaling 750 cc over a two week period, the lip had returned to
      normal size and color, and the cleft (surgical) that was made on
      the inside during the biospy was filling up with healthy tissue.
      An additional 200 cc IV injection was given at this time, and two
      weeks later, one month after the start of Chlorozone injections,
      reexamination at the clinic which made the original diagnosis
      showed no signs of a tumor.<br>
      <br>
      It is realized that these case history summaries do not, by
      themselves, prove anything concerning the effectiveness of
      Chlorozone in treating cancer. They are believed, however, to
      provide an indication that Chlorozone injections provide some
      benefit worthy of careful and contrrolled investigation.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the fact that these case histories embrace several
      different types of cancer as apparently responding to Chlorozone
      injections, would seem to suggest that, whatever the action of
      Chlorozone, it must be taking place at the molecular or cellular
      level, i.e., at a level which would provide a common denominator
      for the type disorder which cancer appears to be.<br>
      <br>
      The theory earlier discussed, which realtes cancer to a particular
      type of error or accident in DNA replication, provides such common
      denominator; and makes plausible the benefits observed in the
      three case histories described. The theory is of course advanced
      in a macro sense, i.e., that the chemical imbalance setting the
      stage for the DNA accident is induced by hypoxia and that
      correction of the DNA accident hinges on eliminating the state of
      hypoxia.<br>
      <br>
      The oxidant function of injected Chlorozone is obviously quite
      different from supplemental oxidant produced by an individual
      having good 'bioelectrolysis performance', but the similarity of
      beneficial effects points the way to interesting new areas for
      investigation, i.e., just what are the biochemical paths and
      reactions for overcoming hypoxia? And does the apparent rapid
      change of cancerous tissue to normal tissue somehow involve a
      partial breakdown of cancerous tissue normal tissue to collagen
      and other 'building blocks' which can then be reassembled as
      normal tissue?<br>
      <br>
      To the extent that the latter question is a valid one, it must be
      recognized that conventional techniques which remove (surgically)
      or destroy (by x-ray and other radiation, and by toxic chemicals)
      the cancerous tissue may be impeding recovery by eliminating
      'building blocks' essential to recovery.<br>
      <br>
      For this reason it is urged that those who may be stimulated by
      this presentation to undertake evaluation of Chlorozone in the
      treatment of cancer be guided by the following principle:<br>
      <br>
      1. All experimental techniques should be devised or modified to
      accomodate the theories here presented.<br>
      <br>
      2. In all instances where cancer is being originally diagnosed and
      not previously treated, insist on an introductory period ( a few
      days to about 2 weeks) of treatment with Chlorozone alone, prior
      to the start of any conventional surgery or radiation or toxic
      chemcial techniques.<br>
      <br>
      3. In instances where conventional cancer treatments have already
      been employed, they should be discontinued during a period of
      cChlorozone treatment as 'incompatible' with the theory of
      Chlorozone's effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      4. Supplement Chlorozone treatments by whatever means available to
      stimulate the patient's bioelectrolysis performance, particlarly
      in the area of stimulating alpha, and higher voltage brainwave
      activity. If religious faioty, meditation, etc, are not applicable
      to a particular patient, biofeedback techniques can be used to
      train the patietn in alpha and higher voltage brain activity.<br>
      <br>
      The interesting thing about this Biodynamic Approach to Cancer is
      that in addition to providing and explaining what appears to be a
      safe and effective therapeutic treatment of cancer patients, it
      also provides a plausible explanation of waht may bring about the
      'natural remissions' reported in the medical literature.<br>
      <br>
      What is presented here is far from any 'final answer or solution'
      to the problem of cancer. The theory advanced does, however,
      recognize the wondrous ability of the body, given a chance, to
      heal itself; and it is hoped that among the readers there may be
      those in a position to do so, who will undertake some of the
      controlled studies and evaluations, known to be needed, to confirm
      or disprove the theory.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The generation of chlorine by electrolysis of sodium chloride
      brines at an applied potential of 3.5 to 7 volts has been
      practical for many years in the commercial production of chlorine
      gas. In such production of chlorine gas the products released at
      anode and cathode are separately removed from the cell. The
      chlorine in each instance is removed as a gas while the sodium
      released at the cathode is recovered in different ways. In the so
      called mercury cell employing a mercury cathode the sodium
      combines with the mercury as amalgam. In other type cells such as
      the diaphragm type or bell jar type the released sodium in the
      cathode compartment reacts with water to liberate hydrogen, which
      is separately collected, and form sodium hydroxide which is drawn
      from the cell as fresh brine is added.<br>
      <br>
      More recently there have developed procedures for electrolyzing
      sodium chloride brines and other readily dissociating chlorides
      including aqueous hydrochloric acid by passing the electrolyte
      between spaced anode and cathode, without any attempt to separate
      the products released in the electrolysis. When operating in the
      range of 3.5 to 7 volts with a constant flow of brine between the
      electrodes the amounts of electrolysis products liberated are
      generally sufficiently low to be dissolved or dispersed in the
      discharged electrolyte. Furthermore there is some interreaction of
      the chlorine with the components released at the cathode to form
      hypochlorite.<br>
      <br>
      Adaptations of such flow-through electrolysis of brines have found
      considerable use in the chlorinating and hypochlorinating of
      waters in swimming pools, urban water supplies and the like; and
      by special controls to enhance the formation of hypochlorite, the
      basic process has been adapted to the commercial production of
      bleaching solution and the like.<br>
      <br>
      When chlorinating water supplies the practice has generally been
      to treat a concentrated brine to develop therein a relatively high
      chlorine concentration and to blend this with water to provide the
      1 to 5 p.p.m. or other chlorine content required for the intended
      purification. In swimming pool chlorination a practical approach
      has been to add sodium chloride to the pool water to provide about
      2,500 to 3,000 p.p.m. of NaCl. Then in the recirculating and
      filtering system for the pool a portion of the recirculating water
      can be diverted through a cell, electrolytically fortified with
      chlorine, and returned to the recirculating stream. Such a system
      can be operated continuously or intermittently, and the voltage
      and/or flow rate adjusted to meet the needs of a particular size
      pool and the number of pool users.<br>
      <br>
      One of the limitations on the more extensive use of electrolytic
      chlorinating in pools, water supplies, and the like has been the
      sensitivity of electrodes to damage and deterioration under the
      corrosive conditions that characterize the flow through of
      electrolyte between closely spaced electrodes. The anode, in
      particular, is sensitive to attack leading to both loss of
      efficiency and eventual destruction of the anode. Even electrodes
      carrying an electroplated deposit of platinum have poor resistance
      to the corrosive environment, apparently due to a porosity in the
      electroplated deposit; and if voltage across the cell is increased
      to about 10 volts the breakdown of such electroplated electrodes
      is quite rapid.<br>
      <br>
      This problem has been solved by an improved electrode developed by
      applicants, and fully disclosed and claimed in the pending
      application Ser. No. 520,596 filed Jan. 14, 1966, now U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,443,055. The improved electrode comprises a laminated body
      of a platinum metal foil on a substrate or backing of a metal such
      as titanium, tantalum, or niobium (also known as columbium) which
      is highly resistant to electrolytic oxidation, the bonding being
      effected by high localized pressure and thermoelectric heat. The
      new electrodes have found extensive use in swimming pool
      chlorination, and while they have not been in use long enough to
      determine their actual durability in the field, they are believed,
      on the basis of accelerated aging tests, to have a useful life of
      more than 5 years when used daily for 10 to 12 hours per day.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The development of the new electrodes above mentioned has not only
      provided for more efficient practicing of known chlorinating
      processes, but it has also removed the equipment imposed
      limitation on voltage to be employed, since the new electrodes can
      withstand extended operation at 100 volts and even higher.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been found that in the electrolysis of sodium chloride
      brines and other electrolytes providing chloride ion there is a
      significant change in the nature of the electrolysis products when
      the voltage is increased above about 10 volts, and particularly
      when it is above about 14 volts. The full nature of this change is
      not understood, but it appears to involve the generation of free
      radicals and/or charged or ionic species of varying stability
      which appreciably modify and extend the biocidal activity of the
      cell effluent.<br>
      <br>
      Among the free radicals which may be generated are Cl@. Cl3 @. ,
      OH@., HO2 @. and ClO@. . Most of these are quite short lived but
      apparently give rise to the formation of highly oxidizing species
      such as O3, C10 2 and H2 02 which may be considered in the nature
      of stabilized free radicals. There is the further indication that
      chlorite and chlorate ions (C102 @- and C103 @-) and/or superoxide
      ion (02 @-) may be formed which in turn may generate additional
      free radicals and stabilized free radicals.<br>
      <br>
      As earlier stated, it is not yet known just what combination of
      free radicals or other oxidizing components are produced in the
      high-voltage operation. It does appear, however, that appreciable
      amounts of ozone are generated and that the ozone persists, at
      progressively reducing levels, for a sufficient time to exert a
      supplementary biocidal action comparable to or even exceeding that
      of the chlorine and hypochlorite which normally would provide the
      biocidal activity.<br>
      <br>
      It can be demonstrated, however, that high-voltage electrolysis of
      dilute NaCl solutions leads to production of at least 1 mole of
      free radicals for each 10 to 100 moles of chlorine; that ozone is
      present in the cell effluent in the proportion of about 2 to 5
      parts (and occasionally as high as 20 parts) for each 100 parts of
      chlorine, and that the ozone persists in the cell effluent for an
      extended period.<br>
      <br>
      In order that the reader may better visualize these factors
      typical test procedures and determinations will be described.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETERMINATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF
        FREE RADICALS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An electrolysis unit is employed having electrodes of platinum
      foil bonded to a titanium metal base (by the method disclosed in
      said application, Ser. No. 520,596 ). The electrodes measure 2.25
      .times.6 inches and are supported in a plastic (methyl
      methaerylate) frame with the exposed platinum surfaces measuring 2
      .times.6 inches and appropriately 0.64 cm. apart. The solution to
      be electrolyzed is introduced at the bottom and removed at the top
      of the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Saline solutions used are Palo Alto California tap water
      containing 3,000 p.p.m. of C.P. sodium chloride (approximately
      0.05 molar NaCl). The solution is fed at approximately 35 ml./sec.
      while applying a potential of 15 volts and current of 25 amperes
      to the electrodes, and quantities of effluent are collected for
      testing. Under these conditions the effluent solution contains
      approximately a 10@-@5 molar chlorine concentration.<br>
      <br>
      For detection of free radicals a Varian, Model V-4502 electron
      paramagnetic resonance (X-band) spectrometer was used. This
      instrument, hereinafter referred to as the EPR apparatus is
      supplied by Varian Associates of Palo Alto, Calif.<br>
      <br>
      As free radicals are of very short duration, being used up rapidly
      in forming more stable species, a free radical indicator or
      stabilizer is used, in the form of a 0.02 molar aqueous solution
      of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, hereinafter referred to as TMP.
      This solution is tested prior to use in the EPR apparatus and
      treated with hydrazine until no signal could be detected, and is
      incorporated in the saline solution or effluent in the proportion
      of about 10 ml. per liter.<br>
      <br>
      The following test procedures were then followed with the noted
      results.<br>
      <br>
      a. With the cell operating as described a sample of cell effluent
      was collected and transferred to the EPR apparatus. No signal was
      detected, indicating that free radicals which may have been
      present were consumed before reaching the EPR apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      b. A 200 ml. sample of effluent collected in a beaker containing 2
      ml. of the TMP solution. when this was tested in the EPR apparatus
      it gave a weak signal indicating a free radical concentration of
      about 10@-@8 molar. The point of collection of the sample,
      however, was at the end of a cell outlet tube about 3 meters long,
      and in passage through the tube free radicals could have been
      consumed. Therefore the following additional tests were made.<br>
      <br>
      c. A mixture of 1 liter of the saline solution and 10 ml. of the
      TMP solution were run through the cell under the same flow and
      current conditions. A sample of the resulting effluent, when
      tested in the EPR apparatus gave a strong triplet signal
      indicating a free radical concentration of about 10@-@6 molar.<br>
      <br>
      d. To be sure that the TMP did not itself generate free radicals
      as it passed through the cell, a fresh quantity of saline solution
      was electrolyzed and TMP solution, at approximately one-tenth the
      flow rate through the cell, was introduced into the effluent at
      the juncture of the cell and discharge tube. A sample of the
      effluent mixture, when tested in the EPR apparatus, showed the
      same strength of signal as in "c" above, indicating a free radical
      concentration of about 10@-@6 molar.<br>
      <br>
      Bearing in mind that the chlorine concentration is approximately
      10@-@5 molar the molar ratio of free radical: chlorine is
      approximately 1:10.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DEMONSTRATION OF EXISTENCE OF
        OZONE IN THE CELL EFFLUENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ozone is extremely difficult to detect and quantitatively
      determine in the presence of chlorine because most tests
      responsive to an oxidizing function will respond similarly to
      these two materials. An ozone detecting apparatus has been
      developed, however, which is specific to ozone and does not
      respond to chlorine. This apparatus, which utilized a
      chemiluminescence method, has been described in an article
      entitled "Rapid Ozone Determination Near an Accelerator" by
      Niderbragt, van der Horst, and van Duijn which appeared in NATURE,
      Apr. 3, 1955, at page 87. This apparatus cannot detect ozone or
      the amount thereof in an electrolyte but it can detect the
      presence and approximate concentration of ozone in the air above
      an electrolyte, which is an indirect demonstration of the presence
      of ozone in the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      Stationary (no-flow) tests were conducted using electrodes of the
      size and spacing described above, filling the cell (about 750 ml.)
      with solution to be tested, and turning on the current at the
      voltage and amperage levels indicated below for a period of 30
      seconds, with the ozone detector apparatus supported with its
      inlet about 10 ml. above the liquid level. A solution containing
      3,000 mg./1. of NaCl (0.0513 molar) was first tested, and other
      solutions of approximately 0.0513 molar concentration were tested
      for comparative purposes. The results are tabulated below:
      ##SPC1##<br>
      <br>
      This data indicates the special effect of chloride ion and
      increase in voltage on ozone production. The fact that NaOH gave
      no ozone was to be expected in view of the known instability of
      ozone under alkaline conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Similar tests were run with Palo Alto tap water (5mg./1. NaCl) and
      solutions containing 100 mg./1. and 200 mg./1. of NaCl with the
      following results: ##SPC2##<br>
      <br>
      This data further indicates the importance of chloride ion
      concentration and voltage in obtaining ozone production. It has
      separately been determined that significant amounts of ozone can
      be generated with as little as 20 p.p.m. of NaCl by operating at
      about 100 volts or higher. Furthermore, the transcient presence of
      ozone can be demonstrated by the increase in oxygen level upon
      electrolysis of a complex system containing chloride ion. An
      example of this is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      A series of tests were run on Palo Alto sewage which contains
      about 100 mg./l. or 100 p.p.m. of NaCl. Sewage and diluted sewage
      (4 1. diluted to 20 1. with water to which 25 ml. of KH2 PO4
      buffer was added) were passed through a cell having the electrode
      size (2.times.6 inches) and spacing (0.64 cm.) as above described
      at a flow rate of one liter per 24 seconds employing current at
      the different voltages and amperage shown below: ##SPC3##<br>
      <br>
      A composite sample of all electrolyzed samples showed a BOD of 82
      mg./1. compared with 230 mg./1. for the raw sewage control.<br>
      <br>
      The build up of the dissolved oxygen concentration is considered
      to reflect the increased generation of ozone with the voltage
      increases, which ozone reacts immediately with the organic soil to
      release oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHOD OF ANALYSIS FOR CHLORINE
        AND OZONE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Having thus demonstrated that substantial amounts of ozone are
      formed in high voltage electrolysis of aqueous media containing
      chloride ion, it becomes possible to measure quite accurately the
      amounts of chlorine and ozone in a cell effluent by the following
      two-stage method of analysis which is based on a procedure
      outlined in Scott's Standard Method of Chemical Analysis 5th
      Edition.<br>
      <br>
      a. To an aqueous sample, suitably about 100 ml., containing
      chlorine and ozone is added 2 g. of KI crystals and a slight
      excess of acetic acid (to pH 3.0 to 4.0 ). Titrate the liberated
      I2 with 0.1 normal (or other known normality) Na2 S2 03 until the
      yellow color becomes very pale. Then add starch indicator and
      titrate until the blue color entirely disappears.<br>
      <br>
      Calculate the total Cl2 +O3 as Cl2 equivalent by the following
      formula in which N is the normality of the Na2 S2 03.<br>
      <br>
      b. The same procedure is followed with a second sample to which
      NaOH has been added to raise the pH to 10 to destroy the ozone,
      followed by acidification to below pH 7 with acetic acid. This
      titration measures the Cl2 alone.<br>
      <br>
      By subtracting the values in titration "b" from the value in
      titration "a" the difference represents the quantity of ozone in
      terms of mg. Cl2 (equiv.)/liter. This value multiplied by the
      factor 48/70.91 (or 0.677 ) provides the approximate mg./1. of 03.
      It is quite possible that other oxidizing species may be present
      along with the ozone and also inactivated by the alkaline
      treatment, in which event the approximate mg./1. of 03 as thus
      determined could be somewhat higher than the true 03
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone may also be determined directly and much more accurately by
      the spectrophotometry method described by P. Koppe and A. Muhle in
      z. Anal. Chem. 210(4), 214-256 (1965 ).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPARATIVE PRODUCTION OF
        CHLORINE AND OZONE FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Using the no-flow procedure above described in which 750 ml. of
      test solution is electrolyzed for 30 seconds at the indicated
      current and potential, a number of different solutions were
      treated and then analyzed for Cl2 and O3 by the method above
      described. Pertinent data on these tests are tabulated below.
      Solution temperatures were approximately 23 DEG C. (73.4 DEG F.)
      at the start unless otherwise indicated. ##SPC4##<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing data indicates that:<br>
      <br>
      a. Halide solutions other than chloride suppress or inhibit ozone
      formation, and that the presence of another halogen can reduce or
      prevent the ozone production even though a preponderant amount of
      chloride ion is present.<br>
      <br>
      b. Significant amounts of ozone are produced when other soluble
      metal cations are substituted for the sodium.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that ozone is a very active biocidal agent, more
      active in most instances than chlorine. Thus the ability to
      generate useful amounts of ozone along with chlorine in
      electrolysis of chloride containing solutions is in itself a
      highly advantageous development for many disinfecting, sanitizing
      and other biocidal purposes. Furthermore, the ozone-chlorine-free
      radical environment created by the high-voltage electrolysis
      appears to prolong or regenerate available chlorine activity. In a
      sense the chlorine-ozone association, possibly influenced by
      unidentified free radicals or other active species, provides a
      synergistic biocidal action substantially exceeding that which
      could normally be attributed to the chlorine and ozone separately.<br>
      <br>
      Turning now to the practical adaptations of the present invention,
      they are as numerous as the various known needs for biocidal
      activity. Furthermore they involve several different procedural
      approaches depending on factors such as availability of chloride
      ion in the water to be treated, the quantity of medium to be
      treated, whether continuous operation or intermittent operation is
      called for, and closely related thereto, whether equipment cost or
      operating cost is the more important economic factor. While the
      procedural approach may be widely varied to meet particular needs,
      most adaptations of the invention will fall in one of the
      following categories.<br>
      <br>
      a. Flow through electrolysis of the total volume of a natural
      chloride containing medium such as domestic water or central water
      supply containing at least 10 p.p.m. of Cl@-, raw sewage
      containing at least 100 p.p.m. of Cl@-, and other naturally
      occurring media such as blood and sea water.<br>
      <br>
      b. Flow through electrolysis of the total volume of a chloride
      enriched medium such as swimming pool water having 2,500-3,000
      p.p.m. of NaCl, for preparing heavy duty sanitizing and
      disinfecting solutions and/or bacterial warfare decontamination
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      c. Flow through electrolysis of a diverted portion of a chloride
      containing medium, particularly as a modification of the procedure
      described in "b" above for treating swimming pool water.<br>
      <br>
      d. Flow through electrolysis of a diverted portion of a medium
      with controlled addition of chloride to the diverted portion prior
      to electrolysis, and return of the diverted portion to the main
      body of medium after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      e. Flow through electrolysis of a separate, high chloride (1,000
      to 35,000 p.p.m. NaCl) medium for controlled addition to a medium
      to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      f. Flow through electrolysis of a body of chloride solution to
      build up a desired C12 and O3 level while introducing brine and
      withdrawing enriched solution at a relatively slow rate.<br>
      <br>
      g. Modification of procedures "a" to "e" conducted on a no-flow
      basis with a given volume of static or agitated medium with
      residence time, or duration of current flow, providing control of
      chlorine generation.<br>
      <br>
      Typical uses for one or more of these procedures include, with
      limitation:<br>
      <br>
      1. Swimming pool treatment.<br>
      <br>
      2. Treatment of domestic or community drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      3. In hospitals, doctors offices, and in the home for preparing
      sanitizing and disinfecting solutions of selected chlorine and
      ozone content.<br>
      <br>
      4. Treatment of sewage.<br>
      <br>
      5. Pollution control in rivers and harbors; and algae control in
      lakes.<br>
      <br>
      6. Treatment of air conditioners cooling waters to control algae.<br>
      <br>
      7. Preparation of agricultural disinfectants such as egg wash, and
      dairy equipment sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      8. Industrial sanitation and/or sterilization in laundries,
      restaurants, food processing industries and the like.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples will show specific adaptions of the
      invention in each of the procedural categories above mentioned,
      but it is to be understood that these examples are given by way of
      illustration and not of limitation. In these examples the
      electrodes in each instance are of platinum foil bonded to a
      titanium substrate according to the disclosure of said pending
      application, Ser. No. 520,596. In certain of the examples cells
      may be identified as 3 A, 6 A, 9 A, and 18 B cells. In such event
      they are cells of the type disclosed in applicants' pending
      application, Ser. No. 642,951 filed June 1, 1967 now U.S. Pat. No.
      3,479,275, wherein the electrodes are so supported in a plastic
      (methyl methaerylate resin) frame that more than 99 percent of the
      flow through the cell, from bottom to top, passes between the
      electrodes, and the space outside the electrodes is occupied by an
      essentially static body of the circulating medium. The sizes and
      electrode spacings of these electrodes are:

      In the examples values are sometimes given for both chlorine and
      ozone yield in the cell effluent. In other instances the yield is
      expressed as chlorine equivalent by thiosulfate test. While such
      yields are primarily chlorine, it is to be understood that small
      amounts of ozone and other oxidizing species are also present and
      react with the thiosulfate to give a reading which is somewhat
      higher than the chlorine per se. As the ozone and other oxidizing
      species have bacteriacidal action comparable to or greater than
      that of chlorine, the recording of the combined oxidizing species
      as "chlorine equivalent" permits realistic evaluation of the cell
      effluents.<br>
      <br>

      Blending this effluent with the city water at the rate of 1 gal.
      per 300 gallons provides a desired chlorine level of 1 p.p.m. and
      about 0.05 p.p.m. of ozone.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE IV</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A sample of raw sewage at 50 DEG F. containing about 100 p.p.m. of
      NaCl was fed through a 9A cell with applied potential of 15 volts
      at the rate of 1 gal./min.<br>
      <br>
      Data was collected on the input and output fluid on 12 test runs
      and the values averaged as follows:
      ---------------------------------------- -<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      In this series of runs the current flow was so low as to not
      register on the available ammeter. The tests indicate, however,
      that the applied voltage, even with negligible current flow, has a
      marked effect upon the sewage.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE V</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A 30,000 gal. swimming pool has a recirculating system with a flow
      of about 60 gal./min. (equivalent to a complete change of water
      every 8 hours). In the line between the filter and the pool and
      18B cell is installed to carry the full flow of water. Salt is
      added to the pool water to provide a 3,000 p.p.m. NaCl
      concentration. With a water temperature of about 78 DEG F. the
      cell is operated at 17 volts and 25 amps. The return water to the
      pool tests at 3 p.p.m. of chlorine equivalent. After about 6 hours
      of operation with little or no organic load the pool reaches a
      level of about 1 p.p.m. chlorine equivalent. This level is readily
      maintained by operation of the cell 12 to 20 hours per day
      depending on the extent of use and/or the amount of contaminates
      being introduced into the pool.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure in this example has the drawback of exposing the
      electrodes to excessive wear particularly due to large quantity
      and rapid flow of the circulating water. This problem is
      eliminated by the modified procedure of the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE VI</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In a pool setup similar to that described in example V about 5
      percent of the fluid flow leaving the filter is diverted to a
      branch line containing a 6 A cell, the discharge from the cell
      rejoining the main stream at the intake side of the circulating
      pump. When this cell is operated at 17 volts and 18 amps with a
      flow rate through the cell of about 3 gal./min. and water
      temperature of about 78 DEG F. the cell effluent is found to
      contain 25 p.p.m. of chlorine equivalent. After an initial buildup
      in the pool a chlorine level of about 1 p.p.m. is maintained
      throughout the pool by operating the cell 12 to 20 hours a day,
      depending on the swimming load. The circulation of the cell
      effluent through the filter prior to return to the pool has the
      beneficial effect of lowering the contamination on the filter. If
      the cell were located between the filter and the pool the chlorine
      level of the pool could be maintained with less operation of the
      cell, but more frequent backwashing of the filter would probably
      be required.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE VII</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A pool of the size described in example V, and having a similar
      circulating system, but without the 3,000 p.p.m. of added salt in
      the pool water, is provided with a branch line between filter
      discharge and the suction side of the pump to carry about 5
      percent of the fluid flow. Into this branch line is metered a
      concentrated brine, and the mixture is passed through a 6 A cell
      conveniently located in said branch line. The mixture entering the
      cell contains about 3,000 p.p.m. NaCl. A flow of brine through the
      cell at 17 volts and 18 amps at the rate of 0.75 gal./min.
      provides an effluent containing 100 p.p.m. chlorine equivalent. As
      this effluent is delivered to the main recirculating stream it is
      reduced to about 3 p.p.m. chlorine equivalent, and a pool level of
      about 1 p.p.m. chlorine can be maintained by operating the cell 12
      to 20 hours a day depending on the extent of pool use.<br>
      <br>
      When a particular chlorine level such as 1 p.p.m. has been
      established in the pool by any of the methods described in
      examples V and VII it has been found that if the pool is not used
      by swimmers the chlorine level may hold for 36 to 48 hours, or
      even longer with very little change. Possibly this is due to the
      lingering effect of traces of ozone or more active species acting
      to liberate available chlorine from other chlorine containing
      species.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE VIII</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An air conditioning cooling tower for recirculating water over
      which the water is circulated at the rate of about 30 gallons per
      minute developed algae deposits on the cooling racks at the rate
      of 1 inch or more per week requiring shut down and removal of
      algae deposits every 2 to 3 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The warm water line to the tower was provided with a branch line
      diverting about 10 percent of the flow and concentrated brine was
      metered into this branch line to provide approximately 3,000
      p.p.m. of NaCl. This mixture was passed through a 9 A cell
      inserted in the branch line and the cell was operated at about 17
      volts and about 10 amps. The cell effluent when recombined with
      the recirculating water stream provided in said stream a chlorine
      equivalent of about 2 p.p.m. By passing this chlorine enriched
      water to the tower during all periods of operation the formation
      of algae was completely eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      This procedure will gradually cause a buildup of NaCl in the
      circulating water and as this buildup progresses, smaller amounts
      of brine will be needed to provide 3,000 p.p.m. of NaCl in the
      solution entering the electrolytic cell. In fact, when the salt
      content of the recirculating water has risen to about 3,000 p.p.m.
      the supplemental feed of brine can be eliminated. In most
      installations a salt concentration of the order of 3,000 p.p.m. is
      not sufficient to cause any corrosion problem in equipment
      (generally a salt concentration of about 6,000 p.p.m. or higher is
      required to cause a significant corrosion problem). On the other
      hand, if in a particular situation a salt concentration of 3,000
      p.p.m. in the circulating water would be considered excessive, the
      system can be made to generate comparable amounts of chlorine
      equivalent at a substantially lower salt concentrations by
      operating the cell at higher voltage.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE IX</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A small 3A cell can provide saline solutions of widely varying
      chlorine and ozone concentration in practical quantities for home
      use, doctor's and dentist's offices, and the like. A few typical
      solutions are prepared as follows: ##SPC5##<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that effluents of lower, higher, or
      intermediate chlorine concentration can be obtained by suitable
      adjustment of the salinity, applied voltage, and flow rate through
      the cell. Furthermore the effluents can be used full strength or
      diluted to suit particular disinfecting and sanitizing needs. They
      can also be stored for extended periods in closed containers,
      solutions stored for several weeks showing little loss of
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      The uses to which the effluents, or suitable dilutions thereof,
      can be put are as varied as the needs for sanitizing or
      disinfecting treatment of people and things around home, doctors'
      and dentists'offices, hospitals and the like. By way of
      illustration solutions having a chlorine equivalent of 25 to 100
      p.p.m. have been effectively used as gargles, solutions for the
      cleaning of wounds including irrigation of abdominal wounds, and
      sterilization of the transfer tissue and graft site in skin
      grafting. At higher concentrations of 300 to 1,000 p.p.m. of
      chlorine equivalent, solutions are effectively used for
      sterilization of instruments, sterilization of the hands in
      preparation for and during surgery and related purposes where high
      bactericidal action is required. Even at the 1,000 p.p.m.
      concentration, the solutions are surprisingly nonirritating.<br>
      <br>
      Bottled quantities of solution are practical for travelers,
      campers, or the like. For example, a solution of 100 to 300 p.p.m.
      chlorine equivalent concentration provides a versatile solution
      for full strength or diluted use in meeting the needs for
      germicidal and disinfecting action when traveling or camping. An
      ounce of 100 p.p.m. solution added to a quart of water of
      questionable purity would provide a chlorine content of about 3 to
      5 p.p.m., thus assuring the safety of questionable water. In this
      connection, it is significant to note that no taste of chlorine in
      the treated water can be detected until the chlorine equivalent
      level reaches about 3 p.p.m. This is in distinct contrast to water
      treated with chlorine gas in which the chlorine can generally be
      tasted at concentrations as low as 0.3 or 0.5 p.p.m.<br>
      <br>
      Both the absence of taste below concentrations of 10 p.p.m.
      chlorine equivalent and the nonirritating nature of solutions
      having as high as 1,000 p.p.m. chlorine equivalent, serve to
      emphasize the unique nature of the cell effluents when subjecting
      sodium chloride solutions to high voltage electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      While the foregoing examples have been based primarily on
      flow-through operation in which saline solution is passed between
      electrodes of a cell, it will be understood that comparable
      results can be achieved with limited volumes of salt solution in a
      stationary cell and with the extent of electrolysis controlled by
      the duration of the applied current. The following example will
      serve to illustrate a practical adaptation of such stationary or
      no-flow operation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE X</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A small cell having platinum coated electrodes of the type
      described approximately 0.75 inch wide, 1.75 inches long and
      spaced apart by 0.75 inch provides a chamber between the
      electrodes having a capacity of approximately 1/2 fluid ounce. The
      electrodes are connected to a suitable plug for insertion in the
      conventional automobile cigarette lighter socket. When salt
      solution is placed in the cell and the plug inserted in the
      lighter socket, fed by a 12 volt battery, electrolysis readily
      takes place as evidenced by the bubbling of the solution between
      the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      If salt solution of about 5,000 p.p.m. concentration (which is
      slightly salty to the taste) is placed in the cell and
      electrolyzed for about 30 seconds, this develops in the solution a
      chlorine equivalent of approximately 100 p.p.m. The resulting half
      ounce of chlorinated solution could be used directly for cleaning
      and dressing of a wound or could be put to other disinfecting
      uses. For example, addition of the half ounce of solution to a
      pint of questionable water would make it safe for drinking without
      creating any objectionable chlorine taste.<br>
      <br>
      The unit above described is therefore a practical unit for the
      traveler or camper. Furthermore, it would be apparent that fixed
      cells of somewhat larger size could be practical for the home or
      even for doctors' and dentists' offices and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In examples I to X no attempt has been made to measure active
      species other than chlorine and ozone. It is to be understood,
      however, that the presence of detectable amounts of ozone is an
      indication of a substantial free radical generation in the
      electrolysis. It had been clearly demonstrated that this free
      radical and ozone production results from employing a potential of
      at least 10 volts and preferably at least 14 volts in the
      electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      The minimum voltage required to produce useful quantities of ozone
      varies with the salinity or the chloride ion concentration. Within
      the fractional normality range of about 0.0003 N to 0.6N NaCl it
      has been found that there should be a potential of at least 100
      volts for 0.0003 N solution or chloride ion concentration of about
      10 p.p.m., and at least 10 volts for a 0.6 N solution or chloride
      ion concentration of about 21,000 p.p.m. The following table will
      more clearly indicate the general relationship between minimum
      voltage and chloride ion concentration. ##SPC6##<br>
      <br>
      Increasing the voltage above the minimum value for a given
      chloride ion concentration will increase the yield of both
      chlorine and ozone, and will generally increase the ozone:chlorine
      ratio. Thus at a voltage about 25 percent above the minimum value
      for a particular chloride ion concentration, and at favorable pH
      and temperature conditions as hereinafter described, the ozone to
      chlorine ratio is generally in excess of 1 part ozone to 20 parts
      chlorine, and at a voltage 50 percent above such minimum this
      ratio may be as high as 1 part ozone to 5 to 10 parts chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      The pH of a medium is also an important factor and for production
      of useful amounts of ozone (i.e., at least 1 part by weight per 50
      parts of chlorine) the pH should be within the range of 6 to 8.5.
      When seeking an ozone:chlorine ratio of the order of 1:20, the pH
      range should be narrowed to about 7 to 8, and for maximum ozone
      production a pH of 7.2 to 7.8 is preferred. Chlorine production,
      however, is favored by a slightly lower pH, and adjustment of pH
      is therefore a practical way to vary the chlorine:ozone ratio in a
      cell effluent.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature of the electrolyte in and leaving the cell has an
      important influence on the amount of ozone generated. While
      temperatures within the range of about 55 DEG to 95 DEG F. can be
      employed, substantially higher ozone yields are obtained if the
      effluent temperature is in the 60 DEG to 75 DEG F. range; and at a
      temperature in excess of about 66 DEG F. and pH of 7.2 to 7.8 the
      proportion of ozone may be as high as one part by weight to each 5
      to 10 parts by weight of chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the chloride ion concentration, the cell size, flow
      rate and applied voltage and current, small to relatively large
      amounts of heat can be generated within the cell, but in any
      flow-through operation the fluid input temperature is a major
      factor in determining the effluent temperature. It is sometimes
      desirable, therefore, to preheat the input water or solution,
      particularly if its temperature is below about 55 DEG F. Warming
      the electrolyte increases ion mobility and hence conductance,
      particularly at the more dilute saline concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it appears that temperature and pH, as well as the voltage
      applied to a solution containing chloride ion within a cell are
      closely related or interdependent factors in creating the high
      incidence of free radicals and advantageous yields of ozone which
      characterize the methods herein disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with a typical hypochlorite cell, the method of the
      present invention electrolyzes a much more dilute brine or saline
      solution, i.e. a solution having a much lower chloride ion
      concentration, at a much higher voltage, obtaining lower
      conversions and current efficiencies. Usually the current density
      is less than 5 amperes per square inch, or less than 3 amperes per
      square inch with more dilute brines. With more concentrated
      brines, i.e., those approaching 21,000 p.p.m. of chloride ion,
      current densities somewhat higher than 5 amperes per square inch
      can be practical, since maximum current density increases with the
      saline, or chloride ion, concentration, while voltage decreases.<br>
      <br>
      The practical variations in voltage and amperage are considered to
      be those variations which provide a watt density of 10 to 100
      watts per square inch of electrode surface. Within this range the
      lower values apply primarily for the more dilute brines, while the
      higher values e.g., 30 to 100 watts per square inch apply
      primarily for the more concentrated brines. It will be understood,
      however, that voltage, current density, and watt density in any
      particular installation can vary substantially with changes in
      other variables such as temperature, flow rate, or fluctuations in
      the chloride ion concentration of the medium being electrolyzed.<br>
      <br>
      It should be emphasized that the practical utilization of the
      methods herein disclosed is dependent on employing spaced
      electrodes, with the exposed surface of at least the anode having
      a continuous surface of a platinum metal. In systems intended for
      periodic reversal of electrode polarity it follows that both
      electrodes must have such continuous surface of a platinum metal.
      On the other hand, when polarity is not to be reversed the cathode
      can be formed of nickel, stainless steel, or other conventional
      cathode material. In adapting the invention to different uses it
      has been indicated in the foregoing examples that the size and
      spacing of electrodes can be varied to accommodate the quantity of
      electrolyte to be treated. It is to be understood, however, that
      the invention also contemplates the use of two or more cells for
      the simultaneous (parallel) and/or successive (series) treatment
      of brines and other electrolytes containing chloride ion.<br>
      <br>
      Various changes and modifications in the procedures herein
      described will occur to those skilled in the art, and to the
      extent that such changes and modifications are embraced by the
      appended claims, it is to be understood that they constitute part
      of the present invention.<br>

      We, Ross MERTON GWYNN AND TIM THEMY, citizens of the United States
      of America, of 4724 Donnie Lyn Way and 5735 Hesper Way,
      respectively, Carmichael, State of California, United States of
      America, do hereby declare the invention, for which we pray that a
      patent may be granted to us, and the method by which it is to be
      performed, to be particularly described in and by the following
      statement:<br>
      <br>
      This invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In the electrolysis of salt solution, particularly in chlorinating
      and hypochlorinating processes, considerable difficulty has been
      experienced in providing electrodes which will perform effectively
      for extended periods of time By way of illustration in the
      chlorinating of swimming pools it is desirable that electrodes
      should perform satisfactorily for a period of 3 to 5 years, but
      most electrodes used for this purpose in the past have lost
      efficiency or broken down completely in less than a year of
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      Materials which are advantageous in electrode construction bv
      virtue of their of chemical resistance and electric conductivity
      are the metals of the platinum group including in particular
      platinum, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and alloys thereof.<br>
      <br>
      These metals are, however, so expensive as to preclude their use
      as electrodes for most electrolytic processes unless they are
      applied as thin layers or foils on the surface of less expensive
      supporting materials.<br>
      <br>
      Various methods have been proposed in the past for coating a
      substrate, such as tantalum, niobium, titanium, and alloys
      thereof, with metals of the platinum group.<br>
      <br>
      For example in United States Patent No. 2 719 797 there is
      described chemical decomposition or electrolysis to form thin
      deposits of platinum group metals, in conjunction with heating to
      effect a bond with the substrate These methods, however, tend to
      produce uneven or incomplete coatings of the platinum group metal,
      and there is a substantial tendency for the heat treatment to
      effect the platinum group metal 50 and its electric conductivity,
      thereby reducing its effectiveness as an anode surface material.<br>
      <br>
      It is pointed out in said United States Patent No 2719797 that
      "attempts to cover 55 the tantalum strip with a platinum metal
      foil to hold the metals together, as by sweating, rolling or
      hammering, have proved to be unsatisfactory because the platinum
      metal foil is held to the tantalum only by 60 mechanical contacts
      which is not sufficient to permit its use as an anode".<br>
      <br>
      In our Patent Specification No 1,253,217 we have described a
      method of bonding a platinum group metal to a substrate such 65 as
      tantalum, titanium and niobium (also known as columbium) under the
      influence of pressure and local electrically generated heat which
      produces electrodes that are far superior to previously available
      electrodes 70 In particular there is described and claimed a
      method of making an electrode that comprises bonding a foil of a
      metal or an alloy of metal or an alloy of metals selected from the
      platinum group to a 75 compatible metal substrate as defined below
      which is highly resistant to electrolytic oxidation by applying a
      pressure of from to 300 pounds per inch length along a linear zone
      of contact between said foil 80 and a small diameter cylindrical
      member of hard conductive metal which is rotatable in a massive
      electric conductor, said pressure being between said cylindrical
      member and a second massive electric conductor 85 in engagement
      with said substrate, and further applying an electric current
      below 12 volts at an amperage to provide at least 3 kva per inch
      length of said linear zone of contact, while advancing said small
      90 1 274 242 diameter cylindrical member in a directioi
      perpendicular to said linear zone of contac at a rate to provide a
      bonding heat sufficien to soften, without melting, the substrata
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      By a compatible metal substrate as use( above we mean a substrate
      of a metal oi alloy which can be bonded at the interface of the
      metal foil and substrate when the substrate has been subjected to
      a bondinj heat sufficient to soften without melting itl surface
      Examples of such substrates an described in our Specification
      1,253,217.<br>
      <br>
      The bonding of the platinum group meta 1 in our Specification
      1,253,217 is preferably affected at a pressure of from 50 to 15 C
      pounds per linear inch, employing a voltage of from 0 1 to 5 volts
      at an amperage to provide from 7 to 100 kva per inch length of
      said zone of contact.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of electrodes by the method described in our
      Specification No. 1,253,217 requires extreme precision in the
      pressure and rate of feed applied to the small diameter
      cylindrical member which forms the linear zone of contact with the
      workpieces Insufficient pressure or too rapid advance of the
      cylindrical member can result in incomplete or discontinuous
      bonding of the platinum group metal foil to the substrate, and too
      slow or uneven advance of the cylindrical member can cause rupture
      or burn-through of the foil The latter type of damage can usually
      be detected by visual inspection and remedied by spot patching
      with additional foil applied by the same method The incomplete or
      discontinuous bonding of the foil to the substrate is a more
      serious problem since it is difficult to detect by inspection.<br>
      <br>
      It has been observed with many electrodes that such incomplete or
      discontinuous bonding does not interfere with performance of an
      electrode, so long as the overlying layer of platinum group metal
      remains sound and free of pores or microscopic breaks which might
      permit electrolyte to reach the substrate When such break does
      occur, however, the entire area of incomplete bonding can rapidly
      be stripped of the platinum group metal foil If the area is small
      and the electrode is operating at a low voltage such as from 6 to
      8 volts the damage may not seriously impair the efficiency of the
      electrode, and electrodes with slight damage of this sort have
      been continued in use successfully for many months If more than
      about 5 To of the electrode surface is thus damaged its efficiency
      may be sufficiently reduced to warrant replacement If the voltage
      at which the electrode is operated is appreciably above 8 volts,
      however, any such rupture of an unbonded portion of the platinum
      group metal can lead to erosion of the surn rounding sounding
      bonded areas with prot gressive destruction of the entire
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The problems due to incomplete or discontinuous bonding as above
      described have come into focus in extensive experiments which we
      have been conducting in which the electrodes bonded by local
      electrically generated heat have been operated at unusually high
      voltages for extended periods of time; and the surprising and
      unexpected results of such high voltage operation have indicated
      that there is a real need for eliminating the problem of failure
      due to incomplete or discontinuous bonding.<br>
      <br>
      We have now found that the problems above described with
      electrodes having a platinum group metal foil bonded directly to a
      heavy metal substrate by local electrically generated heat can be
      overcome by employing in addition to the platinum group metal foil
      an intermediate metal foil which has a melting point appreciably
      higher than both the platinum group metal and the substrate The
      method of bonding is generally similar to the method disclosed in
      our Patent Specification No 1,253,217 differing somewhat therefrom
      in the optimum operating conditions as hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred general purpose electrode has a titanium substrate, an
      intermediate layer of columbium or tantalum and an outer layer of
      a platinum group metal For unusually high voltage operation the
      substrate can be columbium, the intermediate layer tantalum and
      the outer layer a platinum group metal.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the superior bonding attained with the three layer
      electrode according to the invention appears to be the use of an
      intermediate foil which has a substantially higher melting point
      than both the platinum group metal and the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      This provides a greater concentration of heat at a location to
      permit more effective surface softening of the substrate and
      assurance of intimate contacting of the superimposed metal surface
      throughout the length of the small cylindrical conductor as it is
      pressed against and rolled along the assemblage This explanation
      of what is apparently taking place is based both on the intense
      orange glow which develops in the intermediate foil in alignment
      with the small cylindrical roller, and on the slight surface
      deformation of the bonded substrate and foils In fact the path of
      the cylindrical roller on the assemblage tends to assume a
      slightly rippled contour, indicating that the localized heating is
      so instantaneous and sensitive that the softening of the substrate
      surface varies slightly in each cycle of the current supply.<br>
      <br>
      According to one aspect of the invention we provide a free
      component electrode comprising a substrate of titanium or A
      columbium, a surface layer of a platinum group metal and an
      intermediate layer of tantalum or columbium to which the substrate
      and the surface layer are bonded the metal of the said
      intermediate layer having a melting point higher than that of the
      substrate and the platinum group metal of the surface layer.<br>
      <br>
      According to another aspect of the invention we provide a three
      component electrode for electrolytic use having enhanced
      resistance to damage when used at high voltages and comprising a
      substrate of titanium or columbium having an intermediate layer of
      tantalum or columbium bonded thereto by means of local
      electrically generated heat the said intermediate layer having a
      thickness of from 0003 to 01 inches and a higher melting point
      than the metal of said substrate, and an outer layer of platinum,
      rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, or an alloy thereof bonded to said
      intermediate layer by means of local electrically generated heat
      the said outer layer having a thickness of from 0003 to 005 inches
      and a melting point lower than the metal of said intermediate
      layer, the bonding being effected under sufficient electrically
      generated heat and pressure to cause visible surface deformation
      of said substrate and intimate adherence of said intermediate
      layer to the thus deformed surface of the substrate and intimate
      adherence of said outer layer to said intermediate layer.<br>
      <br>
      The selection of metals to use in the substrate and foils should
      be made with reference to both the relative melting points and the
      type of use intended for the electrode The following tabulation of
      melting points will serve as a guide:<br>
      <br>
      Metal Approx MP.<br>
      <br>
      Outer Foil Platinum 17730 C.<br>
      <br>
      Rhodium 19660 C.<br>
      <br>
      Iridium 24500 C.<br>
      <br>
      Ruthenium 24500 C.<br>
      <br>
      Intermediate Foil Columbium 24150 C.<br>
      <br>
      Tantalum 28500 C.<br>
      <br>
      Substrate Titanium 17250 C.<br>
      <br>
      Columbium 2415 C.<br>
      <br>
      Bearing in mind that the intermediate foil should have a higher
      melting point than the outer foil and substrate it follows that if
      the substrate is titanium, the middle foil can be either columbium
      or tantalum; but if the substrate is columbium the middle foil
      will be tantalum Also, if the middle foil is columbium, iridium
      and ruthenium should not be employed as the outer foil except as
      lower melting point alloy forms.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of intended use of the electrode an important factor is
      the voltage to be employed Titanium can withstand only 7 to 10
      volts before showing signs of breakdown Columbium on the other
      hand, can withstand up to about 45 volts and tantalum about 130
      volts Thus if an electrode is intended for operation in the 10 to
      45 volt range a middle foil of columbium over a titanium substrate
      provides reasonable protection for the substrate in the event of
      damage to the platinum metal exposing portions of the middle foil
      For operation at voltages above about 45 volts such protection
      would best be provided by switching to a tantalum middle foil, and
      suitably also switching to columbium as the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      The equipment employed in assembling the new electrodes is the
      same as that described in our Specification No 1,253,217.<br>
      <br>
      The substrate can rest on a large massive conductor suitably in
      the form of a heavy plate of copper or highly conductive harder
      copper alloys A movable massive conductor grooved to receive a
      small diameter cylindrical roller of a hard conductive metal, such
      as tungsten, tungsten carbide, alloys of tungsten carbide, and
      stainless steel, is arranged above the first massive conductor in
      a manner to apply downward force against superimposed substrate
      and foils as the cylindrical roller is rotated to advance it over
      the workpiece assembly in a direction perpendicular to its axis.
      The cylindrical roller can be of a length to traverse the full
      width of the electrode substrate or it can have a portion of
      enlarged diameter (fitted within a recess in the upper massive
      conductor) which provides a line of contact substantially shorter
      than the width of the electrode, requiring a number of passes to
      fully bond the superimposed foils to the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      In a large scale adaptation of the method the flat bed massive
      conductor can be replaced, as disclosed in our Specification No.
      1,253,217, with a large diameter roller, driven in synchronism
      with the small diameter roller, and having a diameter of the order
      of 10 to 20 times the diameter of the small diameter roller.<br>
      <br>
      The operating conditions for assembling the three part electrode
      are somewhat more severe than those described in our Speciiication
      No 1,253,217, for laminating platinum group metal foil directly to
      the substrate The pressure applied should be from 600 to 3000
      pounds and preferably from 840 to 1440 pounds per linear inch of
      contact between the small diameter cylinder (or enlarged portion
      thereof) and the superimposed foils and substrate; and the roller
      is rotated to advance the line of contact at from 12 to 36 inches
      per minute.<br>
      <br>
      The applied voltage should be less than 10 volts, and suitably in
      the 0 5 to 5 volt range, with the applied current providing at
      least and suitably from 40 to 100 kva per linear inch of contact
      of the small diameter roller (or enlarged portion thereof)-when 1
      274 242 using relatively thin substrate and foils As the
      thicknesses of substrate and foils, anc particularly the
      intermediate foil, are increased, the kva can be increased to as
      much as about 500 kva per linear inch.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that the applied pressure and the speed of
      rotation of the small diameter roller advancing the same over the
      workpiece assembly be maintained essentially constant, and that
      the electric current be turned on and off while the pressure is
      applied and the roller is in motion There is no harm in going over
      a previously bonded area provided these limitations are adhered
      to; in fact when using a roller with an enlarged portion which
      contacts only part of the width of the electrode substrate it is
      important to overlap the previously bonded portion slightly when
      making the next pass in order to assure overall bonding of the
      superimposed foils Any stopping of the forward movement of the
      roller while the current is on must be avoided, as this may cause
      a burn-through of one or both of the superimposed foils.<br>
      <br>
      The substrate metal can be of any desired thickness to provide the
      desired rigidity in the electrode For electrodes from 2 to 3
      inches wide and from 6 to 12 inches long a thickness of from 03 to
      25 inches is generally suitable The middle foil may be from 0003
      to 01 inches thick and preferably from 001 to 0015 inches thick;
      and the outer platinum metal foil may be from 0003 to 005 inches
      and preferably from 0003 to 0006 inches thick.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples will serve to more fully demonstrate how
      typical electrodes in accordance with the present invention are
      assembled, but it is to be understood that these examples are
      given by way of illustration and not of limitation:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE I</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Electrodes are prepared by bonding to flat sheets of titanium
      measuring 2 inches by 6 inches by 06 inches thick an intermediate
      foil 0 0015 " thick of tantalum and an outer foil 0 0005 " thick
      of platinum In the bonding operation the titanium plate is placed
      on a large copper alloy bed providing one terminal of an
      electrical circuit.<br>
      <br>
      A hand held copper electrode forming the outer side of said
      circuit has a transverse groove in the lower end thereof which
      receives a rotatable tungsten carbide cylinder about O 5 inches in
      diameter having a central enlargement about 0 75 inches in
      diameter, and having an axial length about 0.25 inches, with a
      slightly rounded surface contour The end of the cylinder is
      provided with an offset crank to facilitate controlled rotation
      along the foils as the same slidably rotates in the hand held
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      While applying a downward pressure of about 80 pounds to the
      superimposed foils and titanium plate (providing about 800 pounds
      per linear inch at the line of contact between the roller
      enlargement and the platinum foil) the crank is turned at a rate
      to advance the line of contact at the rate of about 12 inches per
      minute With the pressure thus applied and motion initiated a foot
      switch is accuated to apply current between the conductors from a
      25 volt power source capable of delivering 5000 amperes This
      amount of power provides about 125 kva per linear inch along the
      line of contact of the roller enlargement with the platinum foil
      When approaching the end of the titanium plate the foot switch is
      released to cut off the power supply and only then is the
      application of pressure and rotation of the roller terminated.<br>
      <br>
      As observed from the side the heat generated by the applied
      current provides a bright orange glow, apparently concentrated
      primarily in the tantalum foil in a small area directly aligned
      with the line of contact established by the roller enlargement.
      The steps above described are repeated along a second path in
      which the line of contact with the roller enlargement slightly
      overlaps the first path, and the sequence of steps is repeated a
      number of times until the superimposed foils have been bonded to
      substantially the entire area of the titanium plate.<br>
      <br>
      Overhanging edges of the foils are cut off slightly beyond the
      edges of the titanium plates, folded around the titanium plate,
      and bonded to the reverse side thereof by inverting the assemblage
      on the conductor base and repeating the bonding procedure along
      the folded over portions of the foils. Terminal posts are then
      welded to the reverse side of the titanium plate, and the reverse
      side and edges of the assemblage are encased in a resistant resin,
      suitably a polyacrylic resin such as methyl methacrylate polymer
      to insulate and protect portions of the assemblage not covered by
      the superimposed foils.<br>
      <br>
      In the paths made in the bonding operation there are slightly
      visible ripples quite uniformally spaced along each path which are
      caused by fluctuations in the alternating current supply There are
      also slight ridges at the overlap between successive bonded paths
      When an electrode is torn apart to separate the foils from the
      substrate these ridges and ripples appear in the substrate in
      exact conformance with the surface appearance indicating a
      progressive softening and displacement of the surface metal which
      provides the desirable overall bonding of the superimposed foils
      to the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Electrodes prepared as above described are extremely durable in
      chlorinating operations at from 10 to 40 volts, and current
      densities ranging from a trace to 5 amps/ sq in of electrode
      surface, and such electrodes have an estimated useful life, based
      on 10 to 12 hours per day of operation, in excess of five years.<br>
      <br>
      At these voltages the electrodes have operated successfully for
      long extended periods at current densities as high as 30 amps/sq
      in of electrode surface Furthermore the electrodes have shown
      remarkable stability at potentials as high as 220 volts and
      current density of the order of 1 amp/ sq in of electrode surface.<br>
      <br>
      In the foregoing example it is to be understood that tantalum and
      platinum metal foils can be bonded to the reverse side of the
      electrode, if desired, by repeating the procedural steps described
      with the previously bonded surface bearing against the copper
      alloy bed For many uses and adaptations of the electrodes,
      however, such coating of the reverse side of the electrode is
      unnecessary and would be uneconomical in view of the cost of the
      foil materials.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure as described in the foreging example can readily be
      adapted to the bonding of substrate and foils of different
      thickness or different composition In general the applied pressure
      and the kva of current per linear inch should be increased as the
      thicknesses of the substrate and foils are increased, and
      decreased as these thicknesses are decreased Alternatively, the
      amount of heat generated along the line of contact of the pressure
      roller wih the assemblage can be increased or decreased by
      respectively slowing or increasing the rate of advance of the line
      of contact, while holding the applied current constant.<br>
      <br>
      If the tantalum intermediate foil in the foregoing example is
      replaced by the same thickness foil of the lower melting columbium
      the same operating conditions will nevertheless apply. On the
      other hand, if the titanium substrate is replaced by the higher
      melting columbium somewhat higher current or slower advance of the
      line of contact so of the pressure roller is required to provide
      the same degree of softening of the substrate surface.<br>
