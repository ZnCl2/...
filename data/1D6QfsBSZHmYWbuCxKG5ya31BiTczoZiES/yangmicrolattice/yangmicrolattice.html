      </div>
      <br>
      Ventilated aero-structures include a micro-lattice structure
      operatively coupled to a honeycomb core. The interface between the
      honeycomb core and the micro-lattice structure is configured to
      permit air flow to and from the honeycomb core via the
      micro-lattice structure. Aircraft include a ventilated
      aero-structure and a ventilation system configured to circulate
      air through the ventilated aero-structure. Some methods include
      coupling a micro-lattice structure to a honeycomb core. Some
      methods include utilizing a ventilated aero-structure to assemble
      an aircraft...<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Honeycomb structures are often used in the construction of
      aircraft, because they typically have high strength to weight
      ratios. Typically, honeycomb structures are sandwiched and bonded
      between opposing panels, or face-sheets, resulting in closed
      volumes of air within the cells of the honeycomb structures.
      Closed cells are susceptible to collecting moisture and do not
      permit airflow for venting, cooling, or heating applications.
      Moisture ingress may contribute to failure of the bond between the
      honeycomb structure and adjacent panels, as well as separation and
      degradation of cells of the honeycomb structure. Unvented
      honeycomb structures may be difficult to process in autoclave
      bonding operations, which use gas pressure and/or vacuum to apply
      forces to the structure to achieve bonding, because pressures can
      build and collapse the honeycomb structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Ventilated aero-structures according to the present
      disclosure include a micro-lattice structure and a honeycomb core
      operatively coupled to at least one side of the micro-lattice
      structure. The interface between the honeycomb core and the

          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      A micro-truss sheet having material properties varying across the
      sheet. The sheet may include a plurality of truss members
      intersecting at nodes. The diameter of the truss members at one
      point in the sheet may differ from the diameter of the truss
      members at another point in the sheet. In one embodiment the
      spacing between adjacent truss members may be different in one
      part of the sheet from the spacing between adjacent truss members
      in another part of the sheet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S</b>)<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application incorporates by reference in its entirety,
      as if set forth in full, <b>U.S. Pat. No. 8,195,023</b> (“the
      '023 patent”), entitled “FUNCTIONALLY-GRADED THREE-DIMENSIONAL
      ORDERED OPEN-CELLULAR MICROSTRUCTURE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME”,
      and <b>U.S. Pat. No. 7,382,959</b> (“the '959 patent”), entitled
      “OPTICALLY ORIENTED THREE-DIMENSIONAL POLYMER MICROSTRUCTURES”.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to micro-truss materials, and
      more particularly to micro-truss materials in sheet form, with
      material properties varying across the sheet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Polymer cellular materials or three-dimensional (3D)
      microstructures, having the shape of a three-dimensional
      micro-truss, have numerous applications, including applications as
      mechanical structures for support, cushioning, and
      shock-absorption, as heat or mass exchangers or components
      thereof, and as flow-regulating devices or materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In these applications it may be desirable that the
      properties of a piece of material not be uniform throughout the
      piece, but varying. For example, in a flow control material, it
      may be preferred to have a greater rate of flow through one
      portion of the piece of material than another, or, in a piece of
      material used as a cushion, it may be preferred that one portion
      of the cushion be firmer than another portion.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Thus, there is a need for a micro-truss material with
      non-uniform properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] The present invention relates to a micro-truss sheet having
      material properties that vary across the sheet. The diameter of
      the truss members, or their spacing, for example, may vary across
      the sheet, providing a novel material suited to applications in
      which a non-uniform sheet is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to an embodiment of the present invention, there
      is provided a micro-truss sheet, including: a plurality of first
      truss members defined by a plurality of first self-propagating
      polymer waveguides and extending along a first direction; a
      plurality of second truss members defined by a plurality of second
      self-propagating polymer waveguides and extending along a second
      direction; and a plurality of third truss members defined by a
      plurality of third self-propagating polymer waveguides and
      extending along a third direction; the plurality of first truss
      members, the plurality of second truss members, and the plurality
      of third truss members being integrally provided as one continuous
      body; the sheet having a length substantially greater than its
      thickness, and the sheet having a first point and a second point
      separated along the length of the sheet. Here the diameter of a
      truss member of the plurality of first truss members, the
      plurality of second truss members, and the plurality of third
      truss members at the first point is at least 10% greater than the
      diameter of a truss member of the plurality of first truss
      members, the plurality of second truss members, and the plurality
      of third truss members at the second point...<br>

      micro-truss for energy absorption. Each of the above
      cross-referenced applications is incorporated by reference herein
      in its entirety. <br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The following description relates to energy-absorption
      materials and more particularly to cellular materials with
      periodic, ordered micro-micro-truss structures with enhanced
      energy absorption capabilities for mitigation of injuries from
      blasts and impacts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Energy absorption materials are widely used to protect
      people and goods from damaging impacts and forces. In an impact or
      blast event these materials should reduce the impulsive load to a
      level below a damage threshold by absorbing a maximum of energy
      while not transmitting a stress in excess of the damage threshold.
      Examples from the automotive, sporting and defense sectors include
      crash absorbers, helmet pads and blast-mitigating foot pads.
      Depending on the application, different performance
      characteristics are required of the energy absorbing material. The
      injury criterion or damage threshold athdetermines the maximum
      allowable stress, atr, transmitted through the energy absorber,
      i.e., to avoid damage is it necessary that atr&lt; σ^. For energy
      absorbers in direct contact with the human body the injury
      criterion is generally on the order of 1 MPa.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Cellular materials are often used as energy absorption
      materials because they can absorb energy on compression. Single
      use energy absorption materials may be metallic and include closed
      or open cell foams and pre-crushed honeycombs; multi-use materials
      with reversible energy absorption are typically polymeric and
      include visco-elastic closed or open cell foams, and thermoplastic
      polyurethane (TPU) twin hemispheres. Lattice structures can be
      composed of polymer or metallic materials and may consist of a
      periodic arrangement of solid or hollow members (struts, trusses).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Figure 1 is a schematic plot illustrating the ideal
      behavior of an energy absorption material. At low stress, the
      strain increases linearly with stress, up to a stress of, e.g., 1
      MPa. At this threshold stress, the strain of the material
      increases rapidly at substantially constant stress, and the
      material absorbs energy. Finally, when the material reaches a high
      strain referred to as the densification strain, the stress again
      increases. The maximum possible volumetric energy absorption for a
      given material structure is calculated as the product of the peak
      stress with 100% strain.<br>
      <br>
      [0007J Real materials typically deviate from the ideal response
      and have lower absorption efficiency. Figure 2 illustrates the
      typical behavior of a lattice or truss structure with high
      structural symmetry and internal connectivity. Here, after
      reaching a peak initial stress (labeled as Max. transmitted stress
      in Figure 2), the strain increases at a lower level of stress,
      resulting in a reduction in energy absorption compared to the
      ideal case illustrated in Figure 1. This is believed to be due to
      the fact that the onset of buckling at a single point in such a
      structure with high structural symmetry and internal connectivity
      triggers buckling throughout the structure, which leads to an
      abrupt loss of load-carrying capability and reduced impact energy
      absorption efficiency. In such a case, the densification strain is
      defined as the strain at which the stress- strain curve intersects
      a horizontal line at the peak initial stress value. The volumetric
      energy absorbed is calculated as the area under the stress-strain
      curve between 0% strain and the densification strain. The energy
      absorption efficiency of such a material is calculated as the
      ratio of the volumetric energy absorbed to the maximum possible
      volumetric energy absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Figure 3 shows a compressive stress-strain response typical
      of types of aluminum foam used as energy absorption materials.
      Such materials have a plateau-like stress-strain curve and do not
      exhibit the non-ideal behavior of an initial stress peak followed
      by softening. However, such materials have a low densification
      strain since the stress starts to rise at an increasing rate at
      approximately 30% strain, which limits the energy absorption
      efficiency to be about 35%. Figure 4 shows the compressive
      stress-strain response of an aluminum honeycomb energy absorption
      material. In this case, the material exhibits a large initial
      stress peak followed by softening, which limits its energy
      absorption efficiency to about 34%. Figure 5 shows the compressive
      stress-strain response of a twin hemisphere energy absorption
      material. The material exhibits softening after an initial stress
      peak, which limits its energy absorption efficiency to about 47%.
      [0009] Certain materials with a truss or lattice architecture have
      constant architectural parameters through the thickness direction,
      i.e., the energy absorbing direction of the truss or lattice
      structure. In these materials, the high structural symmetry and
      lack of disconnected internal members lead to simultaneous
      buckling and a sharp loss of load transfer capability as shown in
      Figure 2. This reduces the energy absorption efficiency of the
      material as the stress level associated with compaction drops well
      below the peak value. Figure 6 displays the compressive
      stress-strain response of a typical hollow metallic micro-truss
      structure with no enhancement on the structure. It exhibits a
      large stress peak followed by softening, and additional stress
      peaks. The energy absorption efficiency is about 15% - 30%.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Therefore, there is a need for micro-truss or lattice
      architectures with the inherent structural and low mass benefits
      of such architectures, yet with improved energy absorption
      response.<br>

      arranging for some but not all of the tubes to extend to both
      surfaces, adjusting the number of layers of repeated unit cells in
      the structure, arranging for the nodes to be offset from alignment
      along lines normal to the surfaces, or including multiple

      transmitting nearly constant pressure in the range of 0.3 - 7 MPa
      under dynamic loading at 1 - 20 m/s impact velocity. [0013] In one

      the second surface; and a vertical post extending from the first
      surface in a normal direction having a first end on the first
      surface and a second end extending past the lower node closest to

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The following description relates to energy-absorption
      materials and more particularly to architectured lattice materials
      with enhanced energy absorption capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Energy absorption materials have been widely used to
      protect people and goods from damaging impacts and forces. Energy
      absorption materials can be divided into two categories: those
      without truss architecture, and those with truss architecture. The
      former category includes cellular materials such as metallic or
      polymeric closed or open cell foams, crushed honeycombs, or other
      commercial materials such as Skydex™. The latter category includes
      micro-truss structures composed of solid or hollow members
      (struts, trusses, or lattices) with constant architectural
      parameters such as unit cell size, radius, length, or angles of
      each member, through the thickness direction of the structure. For
      the former category, the cellular materials dissipate kinetic
      energy associated with impact via elastic and/or inelastic
      deformation. The compression response of foam and pre-crushed
      honeycomb materials approaches an ideal response (as shown in FIG.
      1, which will be described in more detail afterwards), but the
      ability of these materials is limited either by the low
      densification strain in foams or the low load-bearing capability
      in pre-crushed honeycombs. In either case, although the response
      characteristics are ideal, the performance of the material suffers
      due to non-ideal spatial arrangement of the microstructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Previous materials with truss or lattice architecture have
      constant architectural parameters through the thickness direction,
      i.e., the energy absorbing direction of the truss or lattice
      structure. The high structural symmetry and lack of disconnected
      internal members lead to simultaneous buckling and a sharp loss of
      load transfer capability as shown in FIG. 2. This reduces the
      energy absorption efficiency of the material as the stress level
      associated with compaction drops well below the peak value.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Turning now to the behavior of a given energy absorption
      material during impact or compression, architected materials
      composed of truss- or beam-like elements experience collapse
      mechanisms in which the incoming energy or external work is
      absorbed in three stages: initial buckling, compaction at a
      constant or near-constant stress plateau, and ultimately full
      densification. FIG. 1 is a schematic plot illustrating the ideal
      behavior of an energy absorption material. The initial response of
      the material is a compressive strain that changes linearly with
      the compressive stress corresponding to the material response
      prior to the onset of buckling or plasticity. After reaching a
      peak stress 101, the ideal material response switches from the
      linear elastic stage to a constant stress plateau stage 102, where
      the force transmitted through the material remains uniform and
      constant, until the material reaches a densification stage in
      which the strain increases rapidly, linearly or non-linearly, with
      the stress again. The strain corresponding to the transition point
      from the plateau stress to the densification stage is identified
      as the densification strain 103. The maximum possible volumetric
      energy absorption for a given material is calculated as the
      product of the peak stress 101 with 100% strain. However, actual
      architected materials will have deviation from the ideal response
      and lead to a loss of absorption efficiency. FIG. 2 illustrates
      the typical behavior of a lattice or truss structure with high
      structural symmetry and internal connectivity. Here, after
      reaching a peak stress 201 at the onset of buckling, rather than
      staying at the peak stress level, the compressive stress drops to
      a lower plateau stress 202. This is believed to be due to the fact
      that the onset of buckling at a single point in a structure with
      high structural symmetry and internal connectivity will trigger
      buckling throughout the structure, which leads to an instantaneous
      loss of load-carrying capability and reduced energy absorption
      efficiency. In such a case, the densification strain 203 is
      defined as the strain level corresponding to the interception of a
      horizontal line at the peak stress value with the stress-strain
      curve. The actual volumetric energy absorbed is calculated as the
      area under the stress-strain curve between 0% strain and the
      densification strain. The energy absorption efficiency of such a
      material is calculated as ratio of the actual volumetric energy
      absorbed to the maximum possible volumetric energy absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Therefore, there is still a demand for lattice
      architectures with the inherent structural and low mass benefits,
      yet with improved energy absorption response.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] Aspects of embodiments of the present invention pertain to
      architected materials with superior energy absorption properties
      when loaded in compression. The materials possess a truss or
      lattice configuration with hierarchy through the thickness
      direction, i.e., the primary energy absorption direction, of the
      material, which provides enhanced energy absorption functionality
      versus lattice architectures in prior art while retaining their
      inherent structural and mass benefits. The added dimension of
      architectural control can be introduced to a standard lattice
      structure in two different embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In one embodiment of the invention, a three-dimensional
      lattice architecture with a thickness hierarchy includes a first
      surface and a second surface separated from each other (along a
      normal direction to at least one of the first and second surfaces)
      with a distance therebetween defining a thickness of the
      three-dimensional lattice architecture; a plurality of angled
      struts extending along a plurality of directions between the first
      surface and the second surface; a plurality of nodes connecting
      the plurality of angled struts with one another forming a
      plurality of unit cells. At least a portion of the plurality of
      angled struts are internally terminated along the thickness
      direction of the lattice structure and providing a plurality of
      internal degrees of freedom towards the first or second surface of
      the lattice architecture...<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to methods for curing structures in
      a net shape, and, more particularly, to methods for curing the
      structure utilizing a dual photoinitiator system, and to
      structures produced thereby.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Lightweight sandwich structures, that is, structures including a
      core sandwiched between two facesheets, are utilized for a variety
      of purposes including heat exchangers, padding (e.g., in seats,
      cushions, helmets, shoe insoles, mattresses, etc.), advanced armor
      applications (e.g., blast protection), high impact/low weight
      applications (such as bumper beams, battery trays, wings), and/or
      the like. In some applications, it may be beneficial to shape
      lightweight sandwich structures into particular curvatures that
      conform to a surface where the structure will be utilized. In some
      instances, framing a sandwich structure into a particular shape
      may require costly manufacturing techniques.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the materials utilized for lightweight sandwich
      structures dictate how the structure is formed and whether it can
      be formed to have complex curvatures. Existing materials utilized
      as cores for lightweight sandwich structures include foams,
      honeycomb, and metal lattice structures. Each of these materials
      has limitations in its ability to conform to particular
      curvatures.<br>
      <br>
      Foams can be either open-cellular or closed cellular and are
      available in a variety of materials including, but not limited to,
      polymers, metals, and ceramics. Open-cellular foams generally have
      limited strength and stiffness, which limits their usefulness in a
      variety of applications. Open-cellular foams also have tortuous,
      non-uniform paths for fluid flow, in which high pressures are
      often utilized to force fluid through the structure.
      Closed-cellular foams have greater strength and rigidity than
      open-cellular foams, making them more suitable as cores for
      sandwich structures. However, closed-cellular foams do not permit
      fluid to freely flow through the material, which limits their
      usefulness in applications where fluid flow is required, such as
      heat transfer applications. Generally, machining is utilized to
      form foam into a particular curvature.<br>
      <br>
      Honeycomb structures are also available in a number of different
      materials including, but not limited to, aluminum, and
      thermoplastic polymers. Generally, honeycomb structures are
      closed-cellular. In order to achieve a particular curvature with a
      honeycomb structure a specific corresponding unit cell shape is
      generally utilized. This approach may work for a structure
      requiring a single radius of curvature; however, it is less
      effective for complex curvatures which have more than one radius
      of curvature.<br>
      <br>
      Metallic lattice structures have good strength and stiffness
      properties and may also function as fluid heat exchanges because
      the structures allow low pressure drop fluid flow through the
      material. However, to form a metal lattice structure into a
      particular curvature, the structure is generally plastically
      deformed or machined.<br>
      <br>
      As such, what is desired is a lightweight structure that can be
      easily formed to have a particular curvature without resorting to
      pre- or post-production manufacturing, which may be time
      consuming, expensive, and/or may damage the structural integrity
      of the sandwich structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed to
      curing structures in net shape by utilizing a combination of
      different photoinitiators and different wavelength light sources.<br>
      <br>
      Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed
      toward forming and curing a microlattice structure by forming a
      compliant (e.g., pliable) precursor structure through activating a
      first photoinitiator of a resin formulation by a light (e.g.,
      ultraviolet (UV) light) of a first wavelength and first intensity,
      shaping the precursor structure, if desired, and post-curing the
      precursor structure through activating a second photoinitiator of
      the resin formulation by a light (e.g., UV light) of a second
      wavelength and a second intensity, where the second wavelength is
      shorter than the first wavelength and the second intensity is
      greater than the first intensity.<br>

      provide a monomeric formulation for fabrication of microlattice
      structures, the monomeric formulation including: a plurality of
      monomers; a first photoinitiator configured to substantially

      [0001] This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S.
      Provisional Application No. 61/918,540, filed Dec. 19, 2013, the
      entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to polymer
      structures and, more particularly, to partially metallized polymer
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Metallized components are ubiquitous. Components are
      commonly metallized for aesthetic, structural, conductive, and/or
      corrosion resistance purposes. Related processes for metallizing
      components include painting, dipping, electroplating, electroless
      plating, spraying, sputtering, and laser activation. Processes for
      metallizing components are typically directed at uniformly coating
      the component. Non-metallized portions of the component are
      typically the result of uncontrollable variation, which is
      indicative of an unsuccessful process and therefore such partially
      metallized components are typically discarded.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Additionally, related processes for metallizing components
      are typically limited to line-of-sight coverage of the component.
      For instance, related metallizing processes may be limited to
      metallizing only external surfaces of the component. Additionally,
      related metallizing processes may be restricted to components
      having limited sizes and geometries (e.g., related metallizing
      techniques may be limited to the two-dimensional coating of flat
      components, such as circuit boards). Thus, related metallizing
      processes may be suitable only for components having limited sizes
      and architectures.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure are
      directed toward various methods for manufacturing a structure
      having at least one plated region and at least one unplated
      region. In one embodiment, the method includes plating a metal on
      a polymer structure having a first region accepting the metal and
      a second region unreceptive to the metal. The polymer structure
      may include a plurality of interconnected polymer optical
      waveguides arranged in a unitary lattice structure. Plating the
      polymer structure may include conditioning the polymer structure,
      etching the polymer structure, neutralizing the polymer structure,
      catalyzing the polymer structure, immersing the polymer structure
      in an accelerator, and immersing the polymer structure in an
      electroless bath. Plating the polymer structure may include a
      catalyst poisoning method, an inhibition of metal reaction method,
      an over-etched polymer surface method, an increased etch rate-post
      process method, an uncured surface inhibition of plating method,
      or an etch resistant polymer-prevention of catalyst deposition
      method. The first region may include fully-cured, cross-linked
      polymer optical waveguides and the second region may include
      partially-cured polymer optical waveguides. The first region may
      include a first polymer composition, and the second region may
      include a second polymer composition different than the first
      polymer composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The method may also include immersing the polymer structure
      in a catalyst inhibitor that deposits onto the second region of
      the polymer structure and is repelled by the first region of the
      polymer structure. The method may also include immersing the
      polymer structure in a reaction inhibitor that deposits onto the
      second region of the polymer structure and is repelled by the
      first region of the polymer structure. The method may also include
      etching the polymer structure. The first region of the polymer
      structure may etch at a first rate and the second region of the
      polymer structure may etch at a second rate different than the
      first rate. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by irradiating one or more photo-monomers with a series
      of light beams. The polymer structure may include a series of
      interconnected polymer optical waveguides arranged in a unitary
      lattice structure. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by irradiating a volume of a first photo-monomer with a
      series of light beams to form the first region of the polymer
      structure and irradiating a volume of a second photo-monomer with
      a series of light beams to form the second region of the polymer
      structure. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by an additive manufacturing process, such as
      stereolithography, digital light processing, fused deposition, or
      selective laser sintering.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another embodiment, the method includes irradiating a
      volume of a first photo-monomer with a series of light beams to
      form a first region of a polymer structure and irradiating a
      volume of a second photo-monomer different than the first
      photo-monomer with a series of light beams to form a second region
      of the polymer structure coupled to the first region of the
      polymer structure. One of the first and second regions of the
      polymer structures accepts metal plating and the other one of the
      first and second regions of the polymer structure rejects metal
      plating. The method may also include plating the first or second
      region of the polymer structure that accepts metal plating. The
      method may also include metal plating the other one of the first
      and second regions of the polymer structure and removing the
      polymer structure by etching to form a plurality of interconnected
      hollow struts...<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a three-dimensional (3D) ordered
      open-cellular microstructure and a method to fabricate such a
      material. In particular, the present invention relates to a
      functionally graded 3D ordered open-cellular microstructure and a
      method of making the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A three-dimensional (3D) ordered open-cellular microstructure is
      an ordered 3D structure at the micrometer scale. Aspects of
      embodiments of the present invention are directed toward a
      functionally graded 3D ordered open-cellular microstructure and a
      method of making the same. Here, the term “functionally graded”
      refers to a spatial variation in the physical microstructure—and
      thus the properties—through the thickness of the material.<br>
      <br>
      A 3D ordered open-cellular microstructure can be formed, for
      example, by using a stereolithography technique, which relies on a
      bottom-up, layer-by-layer approach. This process usually involves
      a platform (substrate) that is lowered into a photo-monomer
      (photopolymer) bath in discrete steps. At each step, a laser is
      scanned over the area of the photo-monomer that is to be cured
      (polymerized) for that particular layer. Once the layer is cured,
      the platform is lowered a specific amount (determined by the
      processing parameters and desired feature/surface resolution) and
      the process is repeated until the full 3D structure is created.<br>
      <br>
      One example of such a stereolithography technique is disclosed in
      Hull et al., “Apparatus For Production Of Three-Dimensional
      Objects By Stereolithography,” U.S. Pat. No. 4,575,330, Mar. 11,
      1986, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      Modifications to the above described stereolithography technique
      have been developed to improve the resolution with laser optics
      and special resin formulations, as well as modifications to
      decrease the fabrication time of the 3D structure by using a
      dynamic pattern generator to cure an entire layer at once. One
      example of such a modification is disclosed in Bertsch et al.,
      “Microstereolithography: A Review,” Materials Research Society
      Symposium Proceedings, Vol. 758, 2003, which is incorporated by
      reference herein in its entirety. A fairly recent advancement to
      the standard stereolithography technique includes a two-photon
      polymerization process as disclosed in Sun et al., “Two-Photon
      Polymerization And 3D Lithographic Microfabrication,” APS, Vol.
      170, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
      entirety. However, this advance process still relies on a
      complicated and time consuming layer-by-layer approach.<br>
      <br>
      Previous work has also been done on creating polymer optical
      waveguides. A polymer optical waveguide can be formed in certain
      photopolymers that undergo a refractive index change during the
      polymerization process. If a monomer that is photo-sensitive is
      exposed to light (typically UV) under the right conditions, the
      initial area of polymerization, such as a small circular area,
      will “trap” the light and guide it to the tip of the polymerized
      region due to this index of refraction change, further advancing
      that polymerized region. This process will continue, leading to
      the formation of a waveguide structure with approximately the same
      cross-sectional dimensions along its entire length. The existing
      techniques to create polymer optical waveguides have only allowed
      one or a few waveguides to be formed and these techniques have not
      been used to create a self-supporting three-dimensional structure
      by patterning polymer optical waveguides.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, functionally graded foams with random cell
      configurations have been fabricated through various techniques and
      are discussed in Lefebvre et al., “Method Of Making Open Cell
      Material,” U.S. Pat. No. 7,108,828, Sep. 19, 2006; in Lauf et al.,
      “Method Of Making A Functionally Graded Material,” U.S. Pat. No.

      are incorporated herein by reference. However, these functionally
      graded structures with specifically designed and ordered
      microstructures rely on layer-by-layer approaches similar to the
      above discussed stereolithography techniques, an example of which
      is also discussed in Keicher et al., “Forming Structures From CAD
      Solid Models”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,251, May 21, 2002, which is

      cited references do not, however, disclose or discuss a
      manufacturing technique for 3D patterning of self-propagating
      polymer optical waveguides to form functionally graded
      open-cellular microstructures.<br>
      <br>
      As such, there continues to be a need for 3D patterning of
      self-propagating polymer optical waveguides to form functionally
      graded 3D ordered open-cellular microstructures (or open-cellular
      materials) on a large and useful scale using a simple technique...<br>

      A method and system of creating one or more waveguides and/or
      patterning these waveguides to form a 3D microstructure that uses
      mask and collimated light. In one embodiment, the system includes
      at least one collimated light source selected to produce a
      collimated light beam; a reservoir having a photo-monomer adapted
      to polymerize by the collimated light beam; and a mask having at
      least one aperture and positioned between the at least one
      collimated light source and the reservoir. Here, the at least one
      aperture is adapted to guide a portion of the collimated light
      beam into the photo-monomer to form the at least one polymer
      waveguide through a portion of a volume of the photo-monomer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to patterning one or more polymer
      waveguides to form an ordered three-dimensional (3D)
      microstructure and/or a system and method to fabricate the one or
      more polymer waveguides.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An ordered three-dimensional (3D) microstructure is an ordered 3D
      structure at the micrometer scale. Currently, polymer cellular
      materials that are mass produced are created through various
      foaming processes, which all yield random (not ordered) 3D
      microstructures. Techniques do exist to create polymer materials
      with ordered 3D microstructures, such as stereolithography
      techniques; however, these techniques rely on a bottom-up,
      layer-by-layer approach which prohibits scalability.<br>
      <br>
      A stereolithography technique is a technique that builds a 3D
      structure in a layer-by-layer process. This process usually
      involves a platform (substrate) that is lowered into a
      photo-monomer (photopolymer) bath in discrete steps. At each step,
      a laser is scanned over the area of the photo-monomer that is to
      be cured (polymerized) for that particular layer. Once the layer
      is cured, the platform is lowered a specific amount (determined by
      the processing parameters and desired feature/surface resolution)
      and the process is repeated until the full 3D structure is
      created. One example of such a stereolithography technique is
      disclosed in Hull et al., "Apparatus For Production Of
      Three-Dimensional Objects By Stereolithography," U.S. Pat. No.
      4,575,330, Mar. 11, 1986, which is incorporated by reference
      herein in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      Modifications to the above described stereolithography technique
      have been developed to improve the resolution with laser optics
      and special resin formulations, as well as modifications to
      decreasing the fabrication time of the 3D structure by using a
      dynamic pattern generator to cure an entire layer at once. One
      example of such a modification is disclosed in Bertsch et al.,
      "Microstereolithography: A Review," Materials Research Society
      Symposium Proceedings, Vol. 758, 2003, which is incorporated by
      reference herein in its entirety. A fairly recent advancement to
      the standard stereolithography technique includes a two-photon
      polymerization process as disclosed in Sun et al., "Two-Photon
      Polymerization And 3D Lithographic Microfabrication," APS, Vol.
      170, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
      entirety. However, this advance process still relies on a
      complicated and time consuming layer-by-layer approach.<br>
      <br>
      3D ordered polymer cellular structures have also been created
      using optical interference pattern techniques, also called
      holographic lithography; however, structures made using these
      techniques have an ordered structure at the nanometer scale and
      the structures are limited to the possible interference patterns,
      as described in Campbell et al., "Fabrication Of Photonic Crystals
      For The Visible Spectrum By Holographic Lithography," NATURE, Vol.
      404, Mar. 2, 2000, which is incorporated by reference herein in
      its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      Previous work has also been done on creating polymer optical
      waveguides. A polymer optical waveguide can be formed in certain
      photopolymers that undergo a refractive index change during the
      polymerization process. If a monomer that is photo-sensitive is
      exposed to light (typically UV) under the right conditions, the
      initial area of polymerization, such as a small circular area,
      will "trap" the light and guide it to the tip of the polymerized
      region due to this index of refraction change, further advancing
      that polymerized region. This process will continue, leading to
      the formation of a waveguide structure with approximately the same
      cross-sectional dimensions along its entire length. The existing
      techniques to create polymer optical waveguides have only allowed
      one or a few waveguides to be formed and these techniques have not
      been used to created a self-supporting three-dimensional structure
      by patterning polymer optical waveguides.<br>
      As such, there continues to be a need to create polymer cellular
      materials with ordered microstructures on a large and useful scale
      using a simple technique.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An aspect of the present invention provides a method and system of
      fabricating polymer cellular (porous) materials with an ordered
      three-dimensional (3D) microstructure using a simple technique.
      These cellular materials are created from a pattern of
      self-propagating polymer waveguides, which are formed in an
      appropriate photopolymer. This method and system can create truly
      3D microstructures without building the structures layer-by-layer
      as with stereolithography and other prototyping techniques.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the present invention creates polymer cellular
      materials with ordered microstructures on a large and useful
      scale.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, a system for forming at
      least one polymer waveguide is provided. The system includes at
      least one light source selected to produce a light beam; a
      reservoir having a photo-monomer adapted to polymerize by the
      light beam; and a patterning apparatus adapted to guide a portion
      of the light beam into the photo-monomer to form the at least one
      polymer waveguide through a portion of a volume of the
      photo-monomer.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the system, the at least one light source
      includes at least one collimated light source, the light beam is a
      collimated light beam, the patterning apparatus includes a mask
      having at least one aperture and positioned between the at least
      one collimated light source and the reservoir, and the at least
      one aperture is adapted to guide the portion of the collimated

          </b><b>Compressible fluid filled micro-truss for energy
            absorption</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A kinetic energy and blast energy absorbing material includes: a
      micro-truss structure including: a plurality of first struts
      extending along a first direction; a plurality of second struts
      extending along a second direction; and a plurality of third
      struts extending along a third direction; and a compressible fluid
      comprising a liquid or gel and a nanoporous material, wherein the
      micro-truss structure contains the compressible fluid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Cellular, or porous, materials have the ability to absorb
      significantly more energy than solid structures because of their
      ability to become denser (e.g., “densify”) in response to impacts.
      As such, cellular materials such as metallic or ceramic foams have
      been proposed as an energy absorbing layer in armor-type systems.
      However, the random microstructure of these materials severely
      diminishes their mechanical properties. The deformation of a
      cellular foam is dominated by the bending behavior of the cell
      struts. Simple mechanics dictates that bending dominated
      structures are less efficient in load carrying capacity than
      compression dominated behavior exemplified by a truss structure.
      Due this mechanical inefficiency, some fraction of the mass in the
      foam does not participate in energy absorption and represents
      added or parasitic weight.<br>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,698,331</b> and <b>7,128,963</b>, which are
      incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, propose blast
      protection material systems that incorporate random cellular
      ceramic or metallic foam as an energy absorbing layer. However,
      these patent disclosures do not provide an ordered micro-truss
      structure. The use of metallic lattice (truss) materials for
      energy absorbing application is discussed in U.S. Pat. No.
      7,382,959 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/801,908;
      12/008,479; 12/074,727, 12/075,033, and 12/455,449 which are
      incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Methods of
      manufacturing a micro-truss structure are described, for example,
      in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/455,449, which discloses a
      method of fabricating micro-truss structures having a fixed area,
      and 12/835,276, which discloses a method of continuously
      fabricating micro-truss structures according to a continuous
      process (e.g., a strip of arbitrary length), which are
      incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. However, there
      is still a demand for an impact or blast energy absorbing material
      that is light weight.<br>
      <br>
      Compressible fluids have the ability to absorb a significant
      amount of energy. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/720,784,
      which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety,
      describes a compressible fluid which may include a nanoporous
      material immersed in a non-wetting liquid which is compressed when
      external forces push the liquid into the nanopores of the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      An explosive blast typically comprises an air pressure wave
      characterized by an overpressure P0 in excess of the ambient
      pressure Pa (and where P0/e and ti indicate that the pressure
      drops exponentially) with an associated impulse per unit area, as
      illustrated, e.g., in FIGS. 11a and 11b. In order for an
      intervening medium to protect a structure against the overpressure
      P0, the medium must reduce the pressure below the structure's
      damage threshold σth. This can be achieved by the intervening
      medium's undergoing a large volume decrease at a constant
      pressure, thereby extending the duration of the impulse.<br>

      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Aspects of embodiments of the present invention relate to a
      micro-truss based structural apparatus with compressible fluid for
      absorbing energy from impacts or pressure waves (e.g., a fluidic
      micro-truss based impact or blast protection apparatus).<br>
      <br>
      Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed
      toward a fluidic micro-truss based blast protection apparatus
      which is capable of absorbing energy from an impact or a pressure
      wave. Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed
      toward a fluidic micro-truss blast protection system which may be
      used as a component of personal armor, a component of vehicle
      armor (e.g., on a Humvee), or a component of a blast protection
      wall (e.g., a Bremer wall) in order to provide additional
      protection against collisions, projectiles (e.g., bullets), and
      blasts (e.g., from improvised explosive devices (IEDs)).<br>
      <br>
      Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are also directed
      toward a fluidic micro-truss blast protection system which may be
      used on internal surfaces of a vehicle to provide additional
      protection for passengers.<br>
      <br>
      According to embodiments of the present invention, polymer
      micro-truss structures, which are formed by interconnecting
      self-propagating polymer waveguides (or struts), are converted to
      lightweight, high-strength materials such as carbon, metals,
      ceramics, or polymers (e.g., high toughness polymers) or
      composites thereof, that are utilized by the micro-truss based
      protection apparatuses for high velocity impact or pressure wave
      applications. According to embodiments of the present invention,
      these micro-truss structures are combined with a compressible
      fluid, e.g., a suspension of nanoporous particles in a liquid or
      gel (which may be referred to as a
      “nanoporous-materials-functionalized (NMF) fluid”), to provide
      additional energy absorbing characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, a kinetic
      energy and blast energy absorbing material includes: a micro-truss
      structure including: a plurality of first struts extending along a
      first direction; a plurality of second struts extending along a
      second direction; and a plurality of third struts extending along
      a third direction; and a compressible fluid comprising a liquid or
      gel and a nanoporous material, wherein the micro-truss structure
      contains the compressible fluid.<br>
      <br>
      The compressible fluid may be a compressible nano-porous materials
      functionalized (NMF) fluid. The NMF fluid may be a liquid or a
      gel. The NMF fluid may include a nanoporous material and an
      infiltration fluid, wherein the infiltration fluid is nonwetting
      to the nanoporous material. The nanoporous particles may be silica
      based nanoporous particles. The nanoporous particles may be a
      hydrophobic zeolite. The nanoporous particles may be a nanoporous
      carbon. The nanoporous carbon may be a mercaptohexadecanoic acid
      (MHA) treated nanoporous carbon.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoporous particles may have a surface area at 100
      m&lt;2&gt;/g or 2000 m&lt;2&gt;/g or between 100 m&lt;2&gt;/g and
      2000 m&lt;2&gt;/g.<br>
      <br>
      The infiltration fluid may include water, an aqueous solution of
      electrolytes, a viscous liquid, a liquid metal, a gel, a polymer,

        <big><b>STRUCTURES HAVING SELECTIVELY METALLIZED REGIONS AND
            METHODS OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Methods of manufacturing a structure having at least one plated
      region and at least one unplated region. The method includes
      plating a metal on a polymer structure having a first region
      accepting the metal and a second region unreceptive to the metal
      plating. The first region may include fully-cured polymer optical
      waveguides and the second region may include partially-cured
      polymer optical waveguides. The first region may include a first
      polymer composition and the second region may include a second
      polymer composition different than the first polymer composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates generally to polymer
      structures and, more particularly, to partially metallized polymer
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Metallized components are ubiquitous. Components are
      commonly metallized for aesthetic, structural, conductive, and/or
      corrosion resistance purposes. Related processes for metallizing
      components include painting, dipping, electroplating, electroless
      plating, spraying, sputtering, and laser activation. Processes for
      metallizing components are typically directed at uniformly coating
      the component. Non-metallized portions of the component are
      typically the result of uncontrollable variation, which is
      indicative of an unsuccessful process and therefore such partially
      metallized components are typically discarded.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Additionally, related processes for metallizing components
      are typically limited to line-of-sight coverage of the component.
      For instance, related metallizing processes may be limited to
      metallizing only external surfaces of the component. Additionally,
      related metallizing processes may be restricted to components
      having limited sizes and geometries (e.g., related metallizing
      techniques may be limited to the two-dimensional coating of flat
      components, such as circuit boards). Thus, related metallizing
      processes may be suitable only for components having limited sizes
      and architectures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure are
      directed toward various methods for manufacturing a structure
      having at least one plated region and at least one unplated
      region. In one embodiment, the method includes plating a metal on
      a polymer structure having a first region accepting the metal and
      a second region unreceptive to the metal. The polymer structure
      may include a plurality of interconnected polymer optical
      waveguides arranged in a unitary lattice structure. Plating the
      polymer structure may include conditioning the polymer structure,
      etching the polymer structure, neutralizing the polymer structure,
      catalyzing the polymer structure, immersing the polymer structure
      in an accelerator, and immersing the polymer structure in an
      electroless bath. Plating the polymer structure may include a
      catalyst poisoning method, an inhibition of metal reaction method,
      an over-etched polymer surface method, an increased etch rate-
      post process method, an uncured surface inhibition of plating
      method, or an etch resistant polymer- prevention of catalyst
      deposition method. The first region may include fully-cured,
      cross-linked polymer optical waveguides and the second region may
      include partially-cured polymer optical waveguides. The first
      region may include a first, polymer composition, and the second
      region may include a second polymer composition different than the
      first polymer composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The method may also include immersing the polymer structure
      in a catalyst inhibitor that deposits onto the second region of
      the polymer structure and is repelled by the first region of the
      polymer structure. The method may also include immersing the
      polymer structure in a reaction inhibitor that deposits onto the
      second region of the polymer structure and is repelled by the
      first region of the polymer structure. The method may also include
      etching the polymer structure. The first region of the polymer
      structure may etch at a first rate and the second region of the
      polymer structure may etch at a second rate different than the
      first rate. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by irradiating one or more photo-monomers with a series
      of light beams. The polymer structure may include a series of
      interconnected polymer optical waveguides arranged in a unitary
      lattice structure. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by irradiating a volume of a first photo-monomer with a
      series of light beams to form the first region of the polymer
      structure and irradiating a volume of a second photo-monomer with
      a series of light beams to form the second region of the polymer
      structure. The method may also include forming the polymer
      structure by an additive manufacturing process, such as
      stereolithography, digital light processing, fused deposition, or
      selective laser sintering...<br>
