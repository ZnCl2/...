        ---- The resonant problems in different areas of physics,
        chemistry and biology from the unified point of view -
        extremeness of resonant statuses of motion in the nature are
        reviewed. In particular, the problems of dynamics of motion and
        holding of atomic, macroscopic particle, micro-organisms in
        inhomogeneous fields, outside and inside resonance conditions
        are analyzed; problems of dynamic stability of unstable states,
        bifurcation, chaos, discretization, evolution of non-linear
        dynamic systems which are not inclusive in an obvious view a
        small parameter. A fundamentals of the resonant theory of
        dynamic systems are set out. The unsolved problems are marked
        and the paths of their solution are planed, in particular: ball
        lightning, activated water, resonant effect of superweak fields
        at biological systems, including correlation between periods of
        solar activity and processes happening at this time on the
        Earth.<br>

        Nowadays there are a number of methods of drinking water quality
        determination. The main water characteristics are its chemical
        composition and purity. However it turns out that even pure
        water has very complex structure and properties. Drinking water
        standards do not reflect the most essential water property- its
        biological beneficial effect. That is why regular water we drink
        is not good enough.<br>
        <br>
        During the last decades scientists are getting more interested
        in water, as water is a unique liquid. Numerous experiments
        results show that existing methods of water properties
        investigation do not satisfy requirements. They do not include a
        number of water parameters that actually characterize water
        beneficial properties and biological activity. Physiological
        water properties are determined not only by its chemical
        composition and the process of its purification, but also by a
        number of interrelated physical parameters which characterize
        water as a complex structured system in a non-equilibrium
        thermo-dynamic state. This system has a microcluster structure
        and become a source of emission (Figure 1) [1].<br>

        solution 4 was contact activated by means of electrolysis, the
        solution 5 was non-contact activated by means of electrolysis.
        The solution 6 was non-contact activated by means of ultrasonic

        radiation. The solution 8 was activated by means of gaseous
        fractions formed in the result of a reaction between Al and HCl
        solution. Activated water has a high physicochemical and
        biological activity.<br>

        One of the most essential drinking water parameters is water
        "charge", that is water RedOx. Silver-chlorine electrode was
        used as an auxiliary electrode for RedOx measurement. RedOx
        water in these conditions should be negative and pH should be
        neutral, since RedOx of human body cells is ? ?70 mV. When RedOx
        of cells is different from the norm, people contract diseases.
        Investigation data (Invention application <b>RU 2007127132, RU
          2007127133; Patents RU 2299859, RU 2316374) show that RedOx is
          a general parameter reflecting drinking water structure and
          biological activity</b>. RedOx can vary even if pH remains
        unchanged. RedOx and pH anomalies [2.3] do not contradict Nernst
        equation. It actually reflects the fact that Nerst equation is
        not universal and can not be applied to every case. It also
        reflects peculiarities of non-equilibrium environment parameters
        measurement (Figure 3, during our experiments electromotive
        voltage of signal - E was changed by the method described in
        Invention application <b>RU 2007127132</b>).<br>

        <b>Anomalies of pH and RedOx of non-contact and contact
          activated water can easily be explained by the fact, that </b><b>stable





          high-energy resonant microclusters form on the base of
          covibrating dipoles (water molecules, OH-) near anode and
          cathode</b> [2-4]. In a static state such dipole systems are
        not stable (collapse effect), but in a dynamic state there is a
        stabilization effect. Alternating field formed on the base of
        two covibrating in antiphase dipoles has a narrow frequency
        range (resonance effect) and becomes narrower at the rate of
        1/r4.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The anomalous properties of activated water solutions (such
          as relaxation period, non-contact activation effect, cluster
          structure existence period</b>- Figures 1 and 2, opportunity
        to predetermine and control mineralization degree, homeopathy)
        can be explained by high-quality microcluster structures
        ("molecular tuning forks")- Q ~ 1013-23. Regular drinking water
        (RedOx&gt;0) penetrates into human body tissues and takes
        electrons from cells that consist of water by 80-90%. In the
        result of that biological structures of the human body (cell
        membranes, organoids, nucleic acids, etc) are destroyed by
        oxidation processes. That is how body gets older, essential
        organs cease to perform their functions, immunity decreases.<br>
        <br>
        Melt water in mountains have microcluster structure and a
        negative charge due to triboelectricity, transconformation and
        phase transition. Drinking water with a negative RedOx is easily
        assimilated by human body. It gives its charge to human blood
        and compensates a negative cell charge. For example, we found
        out that if mice that<b> if mice are treated with a lethal dose
          of X-rays and then given water with RedOx =-450 mv, their
          death rate decreases from 96% to 10% (in comparison with the
          control group of mice, that was given regular de-activated tap
          water with a positive RedOx.</b><br>
        <br>
        As a rule, a negative water RedOx lasts not longer than 24
        hours, that is why it is recommended to prepare such water or
        live near mountain springs with 'alive' water.<br>
        <br>
        In 1990 Kiselev B.I. discovered a method of <b>water solutions
          non-contact activation by means of laser, magnetic or sonic
          field (Patent 1827274 USSR</b>). He proved for the first time
        that it is possible to make water biologically active for some
        period of time by means of physical methods. Clinical tests show
        that <b>activated water solutions can be used as
          immunostimulant remedies, therapeutic and prophylactic agents,
          since they do not have any side effects. Oral introduction of
          activated water solution (during 60 days) is less effective
          than infusion introduction ( 10 days).</b><br>
        <br>
        In 2000 microhydrin (nanocarbon) was discovered. They called it
        "longevity tablets". One tablet per a glass of water, milk or
        coke shift liquid RedOx from +300 mV to -300 mV which is much
        more than fresh carrot juice RedOx (-70 mV). Microhydrin is one
        of the most effective antioxidants, but unfortunately, 1 liter
        of such water is rather expensive $4. Later Dvornikov V.M.
        created a beverage "Vashe Zdorovye" (Patent RU 2234945) which
        can retain negative RedOx during 6-12 months. As test had shown,
        the beverage has marked immunostimulating properties and can be
        used as effective therapeutic and prophylactic agent, but is
        quite expensive- $6/liter.<br>
        <br>
        One of the important water parameters is its mineral
        composition. Ca++, Mg++, J, Se bulk ions deficiency in water
        cause a number of diseases. There are few springs which have
        water with microelement and ion content which comply with
        Russian Healthcare Organization standards. Some of these springs
        are situated in Sarovo area.<br>
        <br>
        Calcium and magnesium deficiency can lead to hypertension, heart
        ischemia, osteochondrosis (even in 1.5 year old children),
        osteoporosis, incorrect posture, intelligence and memory
        decrease, quicker bilestone formation and stone formation in
        urinary tracts, tooth decay, alopecia etc. Ca and Mg ions are
        essential for normal development and health. They are especially
        important for children, women during pregnancy and
        breastfeeding, aged people.<br>
        <br>
        The tests show that there are just a number of unique springs
        with water with such properties and composition that this water
        comply with the demands for healthy life. As a rule, these
        springs are situated in mountains. So what can people do if they
        mostly drink regular tap or bottled water?<br>
        <br>
        In the course of history, two methods of water production were
        created.<br>
        <br>
        The first method is more widely-spread and cheap. It is based on
        water purification and decontamination up to standards of the
        particular region. This method allows to preserve necessary
        mineral substances and to produce cheap water - $0.0001-0.001
        per liter.<br>
        <br>
        The second method was considered to be affordable only for some
        people. It allows to produce high quality clear water by means
        of reversed osmosis or electrodialysis and the following
        mineralization (addition of mineral compositions, substances and
        gases). Now the reversed osmosis technology is getting less
        expensive and more widely-spread. It will allow producing
        cheaper and more affordable water.<br>
        <br>
        Reversed osmosis devices are usually advertised as
        next-generation devices for high-quality water production. But
        it is proved that because of the reversed osmosis devices water
        becomes:<br>
        <br>
        -distilled (demineralized);<br>
        <br>
        - deionized (oxidated), since water RedOx is positive in
        comparison with silver chloride electrode (200-400 mV);<br>
        <br>
        - water structure retain information about pipes covered with
        slime and dirt; it is especially dangerous for people with low
        immunity.<br>
        <br>
        Such water is not good enough for drinking.<br>
        <br>
        New unique Russian technologies, patented devices and methods
        allowed creating next-generation devices for production of high
        quality water (on the base of FTR-3 (Flow-Through Reactor,
        Figure 4) and extra-high quality water (by mens of Faraday
        screen) with resonant microcluster structure (Figure 5). Such
        devices can also control water parameters during water
        production.<br>

        Now the device "Izumrud-SI" (mod.01 os) has no analogues (Figure
        5).<br>
        <br>
        The new approach is based on three main stages: pure water
        activation, the following mineralization and properties control.
        The offered device (Faraday screen, Patent 2299859) allowed to
        boost efficiency of water activation and electrical safety and
        to lower power inputs. Water mineralization was performed by
        means of unique Russian mineral composition "Severyanka++"
        containing Ca++, Mg++, J, Se ions.<br>
        <br>
        The device has integrated controller, flow-type sensors with
        two-level indication system - reversed osmose processes
        monitoring (purification), activation monitoring (water
        ionizing), water mineralization (mineral composition
        optimization). The integrated controller and twin indicator
        lamps (green and red) perform sensors monitoring and signal if
        any disrepairs happen. Three light indicators regimes: 1) green,
        2) flashing (green/ red), 3) red, which tells that filters or
        mineral additive should be changed.<br>

        $0.008-0.08/liter (mod. 01 os).<br>
        <br>
        The devices can be used in different spheres of science and
        engineering when intensification of the processes is needed by
        means of activated high-quality water solution production with
        predetermined composition and properties.<br>

        The device can be applied for creation of new class of condensed
        substances (solid substances, activated solutions and
        beverages). Block scheme of the device "Izumrud-SI" (mod. 01 os-
        Figure 6a) includes purification subassemblies 1, 2,
        electroactivation subassemblies 3, mineral composition
        controller 4, sensors 5, 6, 9 for control of water properties
        (activation degree, pH, RedOx, temperature, dielectric
        capacitivity , conductivity etc), sensors 7 and 8 for liquid
        composition control (mineral elements, substances). The sensors
        5, 7, 9 are on the system output, sensors 6 and 8 are installed
        in front of the purification subassemblies. If necessary, one
        can also install water disinfection subassemblies 10 and 11
        (Figure 6a), fine filter 12, degasifier 13, tank for activated
        liquids 14, liquid heater 15, liquid cooler 16, one or several
        ultrasonic activators, high-pressure switch 19, low-pressure
        switch 22, automated cut-off valve 20 and pump 21. Fine filters
        12 and degasifiers 13 can be standard membrane devices- on the
        base of osmotic, track, selective or hollow fibers membranes, on
        the base of vacuum or ultrasonic deaerators or on the base of
        both. Tank for activated liquids 14 can also have pressure and
        temperature maintenance system.<br>
        <br>
        This technology is aimed at liquid quality and treatment
        efficiency increase, at water parameters control, at <b>preventing





          electrode overgrowing with cathode depositions. It prevents
          diaphragms from clogging</b>. The technology allows to expand
        operational options and to make the device user-friendlier and
        easier to maintain.<br>
        <br>
        Tap water always was and will remain process water, unless the
        offered technology is used. This is said in new State Standard.
        Low water quality is explained by water treating facilities
        condition and water chlorination technology that is widely used
        and other factors. Now there are two ways out: first, to produce
        bottled water, second, to treat tap water by means of regular
        water purifiers or purifying installations.<br>
        <br>
        The "Izumrud" electroactivation devices can produce 100-2000
        tons of water depending on tap water quality. The main advantage
        of this technology over bottled water production consists in the
        quality of produced water - <b>it is ionized and has RedOx and
          pH close to that of melt water and human body.</b> The project
        creators hope that if one distinguishes drinking water and
        process water it will help to solve numerous problems of water
        supply and to increase average life expectancy.<br>

        Results of the water ECA experiments are given. Simple model,
        explains the noncontact activation, are suggested.
        Electrochemical activation, theoretical physics.<br>
        <br>
        ---- The noncontact electrochemical water activation phenomenon
        (CAW) was theoreticaly predicted in 1992 on the base of
        substantial field physical theory by I.L. Gerlovin [1].
        Noncontact ECA experimental results was published by V. Bahir in
        1992 [2].<br>
        <br>
        ---- Hermetically sealed thin-walled capacitys (ampoules or
        capsules), or a polyvinyl chloride tube (PVC, diameter - 3 mm,
        thickness of the wall - 1 mm) with physiological solution was
        placed to the work chambers of (anodic or cathodic)
        electrochemical diaphragmal activator. As a rule, <b>activation
          of the ampoules was conducted for 30 minutes </b>by switched
        on current or by current switched off immediately before placing
        of the capacitys with physiological solution to ECA mediums.<br>
        <br>
        ---- After 30 minutes of noncontact activation results to the
        solutions in the ampoules was [3]:<br>

        immediately before placing the capacities with physiological
        solution to ECA mediums.<br>
        <br>
        ---- In that way, after exposition of hermetical ampoules with
        the physiological solution in anolyte or in catholyte, the
        results ?? and ORP of physiological solution was materially
        changed; it could be regarded as displaying of the noncontact
        ECA. The effect is the same when the electrolizer is switched on
        or when it is switched off. Anolyte and catholyte are influence
        on the physiological solution though the glass, lavsan and
        fluoroplastic. By that, the direction of the pH and ORP changes
        corresponds (for the glass and lavsan) to sign of
        electrochemical processing (anodic or cathodic) and inverts for
        the fluoroplastic. In 2 hours after ECA, the pH and ORP results
        are relaxing; it is the evidence of electrolize stable products
        unpenetration into hermetically sealed thin-walled capacities.
        Therefore, <b>noncontact ECA passes on an energetic level
          without any attendant transport (mass exchange) of ions</b>
        through the ampoules wall[3].<br>

        The experiments permit to draw some conclusions:<br>
        <br>
        The noncontact electrochemical water activation are to be
        observed by small thickness of dielectric partition (mm and
        less) and depends from a material of the partition; by that,
        CAW, in anodic and cathodic chambers, has a different sign of D
        ORP (table) for the same material partition;<br>
        <br>
        CAW takes place as for ECA water with diaphragm as for ECA water
        without it (table 1);<br>
        <br>
        DORP increases by activation in a metal capacity, or in a metal
        capacity with a thin nonconductive dielectrical cover (table 2)<br>
        <br>
        Nonthermal influence effect of microwave field to the catholyte
        (sharp decreasing of ORP table 3). <br>
        <br>
        ---- Anomal properties 1-3 phenomenon of noncontact
        electrochemical activation can be simply explained by origin of
        high energetics steady resonance systems from oscillating water
        difields, - (two and more) near the anode and cathode [4-7]. In
        statics such systems from difields are not steady (collaps
        effect), in dynamics, by resonance, a dynamics stabilisation
        unsteady condition effect displays though [5-7]. Variable
        electromagnetic field from two synchronously-oscillating
        difields (SAD) [6] has a narrow frequency spectrum (resonance
        effect and decrease ~ 1/r6. Maximum of the spectrum, possibly,
        belong to microwave diapason, because, for ??- typical
        frequencies of rotation transitions ~2 ??? (length of a wave l?
        =18 sm). Therefore, <b>contactless activation can to be origin
          only from thin walls</b>, close by SAD, and depend from
        spectral properties of material-partition. Amplification of CAW
        in metal cylindrical form capacities can be explained by
        amplification of active microwave field by means of reflection
        from the conducting surfaces (microwave resonator effect). It
        should be expect amplification of CAW by the sizes of capacityes

        Discussing questions about water activation on level of
        molecular structure.<br>
        <br>
        Proposing to use water activation by short wave resonance
        irradiation.<br>
        <br>
        ---- Simplicity of production and storage relatively harmless
        action on living organism activated water produced by technology
        of electrochemical activation (ECA) provided its wide use in
        different spheres and technologies.<br>
        <br>
        ---- Water activation in general is conducted with adding
        diluted solution of salt. During process of flowing through
        anode chamber in ECA every microvolumetic salt solution comes
        into contact with surface of anode, where appears in high
        intensity electric field. As a result, solution exposed to
        strong electron - acceptor influence and inside of the solution
        synthesize active substances which acts like strong oxidants.
        Most parts of those compounds cannot exist outside of water in
        another state of aggregation. In this matter anolyte is unique
        in its chemical composition. Also, in this solution guarantees
        absence of dioxins or any xenobiotics which create risk of
        contamination to environment.<br>
        <br>
        ---- Physics of this process is complicated, but it's easy in
        general to understand. Flowing through reactor activated water
        obtained features of "Mazera" - systems highly active ions,
        molecules "microgenerators". Water activated by resonance short
        wave frequency (SWF) - electromagnetic radiation acquires
        characteristics close to ECA activation [1]. In some way
        molecules of activated water based on clinic experiment of their
        use of our hospital center [2], - It's something like a
        miniature version of SWF generators ("Kremlin Pills"), which by
        flowing through a living organism causes its "restoration" -
        healing by resonance field. That is why even a small amount of
        these substances soluted in that water will cause effects
        (effect close to homoeopathy).<br>
        <br>
        ----According to this experiment it becomes extremely important
        to learn the spectrum of emission and absorption of liquid
        atmospheres which were activated by ECA and using internally,
        because of <b>clinical experiment of using SWF devices were
          found to have not only positive influences by electromagnetic
          vibrations, but also negative influences at certain
          frequencies. That is why additional activation of liquids by
          short wave resonance radiation on certain frequencies may
          substantially increase its healing abilities.</b><br>

        The article, in a very short and concise way, describes the
        major discovery of great importance to human civilization, for
        the first time it is proved that the so-called "bio" is not the
        prerogative of living objects. This discovery provides, firstly,
        a complete theory of the fundamental fields, secondly, to take a
        fresh look at the origin of life on earth and, finally, thirdly,
        a new direction in medicine, is fundamentally different from all
        known and allow for the two main principles of treatment;<br>
        <br>

        <br>

        wide range of diseases.<br>

        Say immediately : it further goes on regular panacea, and will
        be shown one possibility - a new approach to patient management.<br>
        <br>
        Purpose of this study is on the one hand, the formulation of the
        new directions in alternative medicine, in which treatment of
        the patient is fundamentally different from all known methods of
        eastern European or mainstream medicine, and the other is to
        show practical achievements in the proposed area for treatment
        in the last eight years.<br>
        <br>
        The basis for this new direction and establishes the following
        assumptions :<br>
        <br>
        diagnosis and treatment choices priority (with several diseases)
        should be made by the patient's body;<br>
        <br>
        according to their reserves resistance, the body shall mobilize
        the patient choices and creating their own funds to deal with a
        disease;<br>
        <br>
        command key, in which the body begins to work this way, should
        be a matter to a neutral body itself.<br>
        <br>
        Easy to suggest that the implementation of these assumptions can
        :<br>
        <br>
        any possible medical errors, but also be able to treat diseases
        such that the early stages are not diagnosed, such as IBS;<br>
        <br>
        the possibility of complications and side effects, and the
        complete absence of contraindications;<br>
        <br>
        change the role of the attending physician.<br>
        <br>
        Obviously, the medical institute's approach to treatment is not
        to teach. Therefore, asking for the opinion of modern medical
        technique, even with higher ranking doctors is useless.<br>
        <br>
        Technology to the key had been tested in Pokrovskaya Hospital C
        - Petersburg, from which the author received a certificate in
        1990. The principle of this technology was handling the
        electromagnetic field vials isotonic sodium chloride solution
        method intact. In other words, the chemical composition of the
        solution in the processing has not been changed. The following
        experiments were conducted at the outset IN VITRO to ensure
        objectivity, then at the Institute of Animal Physiology of
        Pavlova.<br>

        This is the first time shown that the method can artificially
        and physically force an inanimate object (water) for a limited
        time, a media bio. In other words, created an artificial source
        of bio (IIBP), as opposed to natural-life source.<br>
        <br>
        In the early twentieth century, Academician Vernadsky V. I. has
        the idea of a global theory, which would have unified laws to
        animate and inanimate nature. This is the future of the unity of
        live and dead he called “noosphere”. In theory, no par. It is
        expected that it will be the most important theory of
        civilization on Earth. Currently, a critical step in
        establishing the theory of undefined methodological framework
        for future theory, and viable paradigm for developing systems.
        In this paradigm contains the basic requirements for any viable
        and growing system in animate and inanimate nature and the
        systems that characterize the viability of all civilization on
        Earth. This law is far from par, but the conditions laid down in
        the paradigm must enter in theory “noosphere”.<br>
        <br>
        One theory is Fundamental Fields (TFP), the foundation of the
        theory of soils, a paradigm based on a viable and developing
        systems. Average combines all forms of interaction in the matter
        : the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational - the main
        concept of TFP-laminate space. All the contradictions within
        existing disparate theories Spacetime time substance, and among
        addressed through TFP. However, the current hypothesis in
        biology, biophysics, and the hypothesis of the bio, ie special
        fields supposedly inherent only living system, a barrier between
        the known fields in biophysics and this particular field of
        living systems. We show that in fact there is no such barrier.<br>
        <br>
        In this work, experimentally it has shown that the special
        effects of water or aqueous solutions known in physics fields,
        in the water or in aqueous solution, and there may exist some
        time secondary stimulated radiation in connection with the
        collapse of large water clusters with small numbers game small
        (electrically active) clusters with large numbers game. These
        small dipole, chaotically moving, a very low radiation of
        Incoherent chaotic spatial polarization. Since water is a major
        component of living systems, it is what field biologists called
        bio.<br>
        <br>
        Random clusters of water in a living system comes from the
        special internal chemical mechanism changes (in a person that
        ATF) clusters. If this mechanism did not exist, the cells would
        not be able to assimilate micro-clustered water. Thus,
        stimulated emission of living systems (bio) is certainly a
        necessary accompaniment of the metabolism of cells of these
        systems, ie making large clusters of small external water.<br>
        <br>
        On the magnetic radiospectrometer RE-1306, working Effect
        paramagnetic resonance with hydrophilic probes measured changes
        in the rotational mobility of ions in the cell water, as
        compared to natural water. Owners resonance lies in the range of
        15-25 Hz. And the probe shows the rotational mikrovyazkosti
        decrease by 20-30%. As the frequency of the radiation is very
        low, and a living object is small compared to the wavelength of
        radiation, the actual field measurements near the site is always
        in short zone. Thus, the living organism as the laser is the sum
        of noncoherent point emitters with chaotic in a very low
        polarization range. Thus, it can be an important conclusion,
        namely : bio measuring devices must be physically in a
        multi-anechoic chamber for the suppression of external
        interference in the very low range of 120 dB. Such cells, in the
        author's opinion, in the territory of Russia is not. This is a
        very expensive camera. It should now understand. With
        measurements must be conducted by an electric dipole, and with
        high sensitivity magnetic antennas, ie parametric antennas with
        lasers, which can provide high sensitivity measurements.<br>
        <br>
        Another problem, which is transport, water molecules are
        resonant absorbent of proteins. Dipole number is in the tens of
        thousands-tens, and the natural water these numbers are mainly
        based on the number of Debye. Thus, mono-structurized water
        molecules is essential for effective synthesis and protein
        breakdown.<br>
        <br>
        To determine the impact of protein, a biological experiment on
        the effectiveness of the drug on blood cells IN VITRO. This two
        similar tubes filled the same number of the same blood. Then one

        In 1974, I defended a thesis on "The Oscillator Energy SPATIAL
        Feedback".<br>
        <br>
        In 1975, HAC rejected my thesis because it was incomplete.<br>
        <br>
        I have repeatedly defended this thesis in Vake 5 more times. By
        the then 19 copyright certificates were already issued to me.
        However, in the course of defending my thesis, I realized that
        the reason for rejection was very different and the truth began
        to surface. After a while, I showed a letter to my best friend,
        who suggested that the rejection was because I was considered an
        anti-Soviet.<br>
        <br>
        Thesis were rejected.<br>
        <br>
        However, the topic was not abandoned and I began to use it in
        medicine.<br>
        <br>
        As a result, in 1990, I received the copyright certificate
        number 1827274 for "Method for processing physiological
        solution. Kisseleva BI."<br>
        <br>
        In due time, I had perfected the process and received several
        patents. Testing began with the measurement of blood IN VITRO
        prior to the introduction of a nat. solution and treated by my
        usual method.<br>
        <br>
        It was found that blood, as an independent body of liquid has an
        opportunity to respond to an "artificial bio-field"<br>
        <br>
        Venous blood in the eyes become blood Alogo color, although
        color was dark. The blood of anaemic patients became normal
        haemoglobin rate. Later, in 1993, under the direction of MD SK
        Churin extensive studies were carried out on IN VITRO, and IN
        VIVO. The results were contained in a report submitted to the
        Academic Council approved by the hospital.<br>
        <br>
        The primary findings of the work:<br>
        <br>
        1. In the experiment, IN VITRO "Akvatsit-K" (the so-called
        structured I nat. Slurry). Structuring turned ordinary nat.
        solution in cell water and reduced the aggressiveness of
        platelets, to normalize the distribution of calcium inside the
        cell, causing activation of platelets.<br>
        <br>
        2. "AKVATSIT-K" reduces the content of lipid hydroperoxide in
        plasma, indicating a stabilization of cell membranes.<br>
        <br>
        3. There is good portability and lack of side effects course
        "AKVATSIT-K" for all the examined patients and the virtual
        absence of contraindications for this therapy to patients.<br>
        <br>
        4. Under the short course influence of "AKVATSIT-K" as with the
        course AUEFOK, influences on the level of the lipids of the
        blood (cholesterol, HDL and LPNP) as well as blood sugar level
        could not be noted.<br>
        <br>
        5. Towards the end of the course of "AKVATSIT-K", patients with
        hypertension 1,2 st. were observed hypotensive effect.<br>
        <br>
        6. Against the background of the course "AKVATSIT-K", an
        improvement in the indices of ergometric was revealed. Tolerance
        to the physical load increased. However, with the course AUEFOK
        the tolerance to load remained at the same level as before the
        treatment.<br>
        <br>
        7. There are positive developments in the state of blood
        coagulation (prolongation of time recalsification, reducing
        troboplastin-Thrombin activity and prothrombin activity).<br>
        <br>
        Taking into account the favorable influence of "AKVATSIT-K" on
        the platelet count and the positive shifts in the clinic against
        the background of an improvement in the state of patients, it is
        possible, with a high portion of probability, to assume that the
        conducted course of "AKVATSIT-K", is connected with its
        influence on the coagulation potential of the blood and the
        processes of the peroxide oxidation of the lipids, which have
        value in atherogenesis.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, this processing technique of intact nat. solution and
        methods of measurement of quantitative characteristics of
        changes in energy ions allowed the testing on patients with
        cardiovascular diseases, HIV patients and other diseases.<br>

        Patients suffering from multiple sclerosis 1-2 Art., Scoliosis,
        Article 1-3. As well as secondary syphilis had been successfully
        treated. Go to the second part of my work, namely, to create<b>

        <br>
        This enhancement of current is <b>because of clearance across

        In other words, through the sum of a constant force and forces
        of Brownian motion, impacts of a wide spectrum is produced
        throughout the entire length of electrodes. It is possible to
        assume that the lattice of the atom emitters under the influence
        of these forces, will enter into resonance and will drop
        electrons from its shells, which will already possess
        considerably larger energy, than energy of the action of
        protons.<br>
        <br>
        Experimentally, such "fast" electrons were found as follow:<br>
        <br>
        <b>A solution was made of saturated KMnO4 (pregnant solution).</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><b><br>
        </b><b> After a few minutes in the generator, the solution
          became completely transparent, and at the bottom of the
          dilators, precipitated brown iron ore were deposited. Iron in
          the periodic table is right at the next location and is
          different from the manganese to one electron at the second
          level. Thus, the penetration of the electron on the second
          level of the manganese atom shows no normal energy of the
          electron.</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><b><br>
        </b><b> It is thus natural to assume that the electron left the
          atom emitter from its resonant power spectrum of proton
          strikes.</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><b><br>
        </b><b> In other words, the amplifier turned dynamo (UPT), which
          has its own source of nuclear energy. It is possible to
          formulate cold hydrogen-nuclear reactor for fast electrons,
          which differs from the existing nuclear fast neutron reactors.</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><b><br>
        </b><b> Therefore, such a generator fuelled electrolyte as an
          alternative to forms of fuel could be a serious competitor for
          all methods to obtain power and energy.</b><br>

        In Pokrov Hospital of St. Petersburg and the Institute of
        Physiology. Pavlov, a study on the impact of intact-structured
        isotopic solution of sodium chloride (Akvatsit-K) for the
        biological experiment and clinical (cardiovascular disease,
        ischemic heart disease and hypertension).<br>
        <br>
        The experiment was conducted in vitro on the blood of animals
        (IP 14) to determine the SA-binding capacity of the membranes of
        platelets using KHTTS, fluorescent probe for spectrofluorometer.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, a study on the blood of animals (? 15) the impact
        of the preparation "Akvatsit-K" for hydroperoxide oxidation of
        blood lipids and given the comparative evaluation of the impact
        with the impact of MSS-blood for the same parameter.<br>
        <br>
        Result: Reduction of fluorescence of platelets in the
        experimental group was an average of 32,4% ± 0,6%, in the
        control group - a decrease by an average of 15,1% ± 0,27%, that
        in 2,1 times less than in experimental group. The observed
        statistically significant effect of increasing calcium in the
        outer membrane as compared with the control group, which is
        likely to reduce the ability of platelet aggregation after
        exposure to the preparation "Akvatsit-K", ie reduced
        aggressiveness of platelets.<br>
        <br>
        Result of hydroperoxide oxidation of lipids in blood plasma
        showed a decrease in average, 0,61 ± 0,03 to 1 ml of blood
        (control group). Thus, the statistically significant effect of
        reduction in the hydroperoxide oxidation of lipids with working
        of the plasma of the blood in vitro by the preparation of
        "Akvatsit-K" is a favorable factor for the stabilization of cell
        membranes, damage by the activation process of peroxide
        oxidation of lipids.<br>
        <br>
        With MSS, there is increase in blood lipid peroxidation, which
        is a destabilizing factor for the "normal" functioning of cell
        membranes.<br>
        <br>
        Studies conducted in vitro, showed good progress under the
        influence of "Akvatsit-K" in a state of cellular membranes,
        reducing the extent of lipid peroxidation, "aggressiveness" of
        platelets. One can assume that the changes observed in the
        smooth muscle cells (SMC) vascular wall, which in its
        SA-homeostasis resembles platelets: changes in concentration in
        the sagas + MMC vessels occurs by the same laws and mechanisms.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Clinical part</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        We examined 27 male patients aged 20 to 62 years. The majority
        of patients were persons of working age (avg. age 48 years). The
        main diagnoses: ischemic heart disease and / or hypertension.
        Angina with CHD corresponded to I-II functional class,
        hypertension of WHO classification in line with I-II stage.<br>
        <br>
        The heavier group of patients consisted of 5 persons
        (transferred infarction with the postmyocardial infarction
        angina II- III functional class).<br>
        <br>
        All the patients in the group were treated with traditional
        therapy treatment and a course of "Akvatsit-K". The course
        consisted of intravenous drip of 15 ml ampoules of "Akvatsit-K",
        dissolved in 150ml of isotonic solution of sodium chloride over
        7-10 course of injections daily. No cases was reported of
        clinical deterioration in the current disease or poor tolerance
        of procedure. In patients with normal blood pressure,
        "Akvatsit-K" did not affect its value, while in patients with
        elevated systolic blood pressure, value fell by an average of 15
        ± 5 mm and the diastolic by 7 ± 7 mm and remained stable until
        patient was discharged. Influence of "Akvatsit-K" for the
        frequency of attacks of angina pectoris was assessed only on the
        group of severe patients (5 men) with angina strain II-III
        functional class. There was a significant reduction of attacks
        of angina at rest, the easier halting of the stenocardia
        attacks, a sharp (5 times) reduction in the number of
        nitroglycerin tablets to halt attacks during the day, all
        patients managed to reduce the dose of designated nitrate's
        prolonged action of beta blocker and calcium antagonists.<br>

        patients on background therapy were minimal objective signs of
        improvement only on this type of treatment. In addition, the
        improved haemodynamics (increase in heart rate, blood pressure,
        rate of spending reserves myocardium under load). A study of
        influence of "Akvatsit-K" for blood coagulation system, as well
        as indicators of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (cholesterol,
        sugar). Patients did not receive anticoagulants of direct and
        indirect actions.<br>
        <br>
        After the end of the treatment time recalcification of plasma
        extended the average for the group from 162 ± 11,6 sec. to 235 -
        139 sec. It decreased the value of thromboplastin-Thrombin

        <br>
        <b>Description</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The invention relates to a device according to the preamble of
        claim 1<br>
        <br>
        The device can be used for activation of liquids and for the
        preparation of high-quality water, water solutions with
        predetermined mineral compositions and properties can be used.<br>
        <br>
        Also for the production of washing, disinfection and germicidal
        solutions can be used.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the device for reacting liquids in a thermodynamic
        activated non-equilibrium state with resonant micro cluster
        structure can be used.<br>
        <br>
        This condition is characterized by increased physical chemical
        activity.<br>
        <br>
        It is used for intensification of chemical, biological and
        physical processes.<br>
        <br>
        Activated liquids are everywhere used where antiseptics and
        stimulators are used by biological and chemical processes.<br>
        These include the treatment of seeds for various crops before
        planting and the soil for the purpose of casting weed control.<br>
        <br>
        They can also be used to accelerate growth of crops and increase
        their harvest.<br>
        <br>
        Also for the treatment of wounds in animals and humans and for
        the treatment and prevention of many diseases, the activated
        device with liquids.<br>
        <br>
        There are devices for the activation of liquids by means of
        electrolysis (with and without diaphragm) known (VM Bachir
        Electrochemical activation, M. VNIIIMT, 1992, part 1, 401 pp.).<br>
        <br>
        These devices allow fluids with predetermined properties (in
        particular with a certain oxidation-reduction potential = redox
        potential, pH, micro cluster structure) to be produced.<br>
        <br>
        However, they also have significant defects.<br>
        <br>
        During the preparation of the activated liquids no system for
        monitoring their properties and composition.<br>
        <br>
        It is used untreated tap water.<br>
        <br>
        In effect, contain activated liquids uncontrollable side
        pollutants.<br>
        <br>
        There is a Elektrodenbeschlagung (cathode deposits).<br>
        <br>
        This in turn causes an uncontrollable degradation of the
        produced fluids, a deterioration of the electrolytic cell
        operation and frequent refresh.<br>
        <br>
        Of the invention, the closest prior art, the means I sumrud SI
        (RU 12 120 U) for the preparation of activated liquids (water,
        anolyte, catholyte, contactless activated liquids).<br>
        <br>
        This device contains a purification unit and units for
        electrical activation and addition of mineral elements and
        materials.<br>
        <br>
        The major shortcomings of these devices are: the absence of a
        system for the control of the properties and composition of the
        produced fluids, and the formation of cathode deposits
        contaminated activated media (depending on the composition of
        the raw water).<br>
        <br>
        The object of the invention is to increase the quality of the
        produced fluids and the operating and ease of installation.<br>
        <br>
        This object is achieved by the features of claim 1.<br>
        <br>
        The device for activation of liquids comprising components for
        the cleaning, the electrical activation, and the addition of
        mineral elements and substances.<br>
        <br>
        It is also additionally provided with one or more transmitters
        with a display system to control the properties of the activated
        liquid.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, this device can be also equipped with one or more
        transmitters with a display system for the control of fluid
        properties at the inlet of the device.<br>
        <br>
        They can also be provided with one or more donors with a display
        system for monitoring the temperature of the composition of the
        liquids.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, they can also be provided with or
        Flüssigkeitserhitzern-cool, with memories and ultrasound
        activators, and with one or a plurality Entkeimungsbaugruppe
        degassers.<br>
        <br>
        Which is arranged in front Entkeimungsbaugruppe the cleaning
        unit.<br>
        <br>
        The cleaning unit of the device can additionally be provided
        with one or more fine filters.<br>
        <br>
        The raw liquid contains different side after cleaning materials
        and gases.<br>
        <br>
        These cause fogging of the cathode electrodes with debris and
        contamination of the fluids and the formation of activated
        secondary pollutants (carbonic acid, carbon, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        The complete assembly of the device (one or more) sensors with a
        display system for the display of liquid properties and
        composition makes it possible to control the operation of the
        device for the produced fluids.<br>
        <br>
        Disturbances and also fogging of the electrodes detected and
        replenished the pads and the filter elements are replaced.<br>
        <br>
        The membranes Cartridgen with the mineral elements and
        substances can be exchanged and the feedback systems are being
        implemented to control and automatic transmission.<br>
        <br>
        Attaching an additional unit for fine cleaning and degassing
        significantly reduces the cathode deposits.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the operating time of the device is extended
        without refresh, thereby improving the stability and the quality
        of the produced activated liquids.<br>
        <br>
        The use of storage (even with heating or cooling) extends the
        functionality of the application possibilities and effectiveness
        of the device considerably without affecting their performance
        is increased.<br>
        <br>
        The intensification of activation processes in the range of
        specific temperatures warming is taking place or Cooling of
        fluids during the production of the activated liquid.<br>
        <br>
        This is done by means of incorporation of temperature control
        devices in the apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        The invention will be explained in detail in the drawings

        <br>
        The memory 14 may be equipped with a system which maintains a
        constant pressure and a constant temperature.<br>
        <br>
        As an example for the realization of the proposed technical
        solution is the device for the activation of liquids Izumrud-Sl
        (Mod. 01 os) as shown in Figure 3.<br>
        <br>
        In this device as a display unit for a single donor separate
        assembly 18 is designed on the basis of a double light
        indicator.<br>
        <br>
        The device contains additional assemblies and modules for
        operation automation.<br>
        <br>
        These include high-pressure relay 19, automatic shutoff valve
        20, 21 booster pump, low pressure relay 22<br>
        <br>
        The memory 14 is equipped with a system for the maintenance of
        constant pressure.<br>
        <br>
        The device for activation of fluids works as follows:<br>
        <br>
        Come into the Rohflüssigkeiten units 1 and 2 for cleaning (Fig.<br>
        1).<br>
        <br>
        While they flow through the encoder 6 to the display system to
        determine the properties and the sensor 8, with a display system
        for determining the composition of the liquids.<br>
        <br>
        After cleaning, the liquids are transported to the electrical
        activator third<br>
        <br>
        Here comes into the electrical activation of the liquids.<br>
        <br>
        It may be added before or after the electrical activation of the
        assembly 4 certain substances.<br>
        <br>
        Due to the stress caused by the electric field (electric
        activation) the modification of the internal structure of the
        water comes into (under normal conditions and in the absence of
        external influences is the water is a mixture of homogeneous
        isotropic Raumclustem polar water molecules and their ambipolar
        radicals).<br>
        <br>
        Here, the water is activated with its modified structures both
        in Kathodenais stored in the anode region of electric activator
        dynamically.<br>
        <br>
        These modified structures exist for a time and then relax back
        to the unactivated raw water after the activation process is
        completed.<br>
        <br>
        The liquids at the exit of the electrical activator 3 can be
        monitored by the sensor 5, 7 and 9 for the determination of the
        properties and the composition of the fluids with each display
        systems.<br>
        <br>
        Before cleaning the fluids can be disinfected by the units 10
        and 11 (Figure 2).<br>
        <br>
        At the output of the cleaning units, the liquids are
        subsequently purified by filter 12 and additionally treated with
        degasser 13th<br>
        <br>
        After the activation and control of the properties of the fluids
        may be transported by means of units 15 and 16 is heated or
        cooled in the memory 14.<br>
        <br>
        In the apparatus for fluid-Sl Izumrud activation (Fig. 3) flows
        the liquid (the original tap water) through the first filter of
        the first pre-cleaning unit<br>
        <br>
        The first filter (Absetzcartridgefilter) holds the mechanical
        admixtures to-back.<br>
        <br>
        The second filter (with active carbon) provides an odor removal
        and removal of the residual chlorine from the water.<br>
        <br>
        The third filter (Pressed coal) from organochlorine compounds,
        unpleasant taste and odor.<br>
        <br>
        After flowing through the three Vorreinigungsfilter the filtrate
        enters the fine cleaning filter 12 (rückosmotische membrane).<br>
        <br>
        The pore diameter in this membrane is max. 0.0001 [mu] m.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this membrane can practically only water molecules
        and dissolved oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        After the final purification filter the water comes to the
        deaerator 13 (Nachreinigungskohlenfilter from coconut).<br>
        <br>
        Then the purified water flows through the encoder 6 for property
        control (activation step) and donor 8 for composition control
        (mineralization conductivity meter).<br>
        <br>
        Then it passes into the third electric activator<br>
        <br>
        The electrical activator device lsumrud-SI (Mod 01 os) has a
        special design and is constructed from modern materials.<br>
        <br>
        He has a resonant power supply.<br>
        <br>
        This electrical activator makes it possible to activate the
        water, to sterilize effectively, its structure and redox
        potential in the range of about<br>
        ~ - (100 .. 25O) mV to improve.<br>
        <br>
        In the end, the water has antioxidant properties.<br>
        <br>
        If the water continues to Mineralisationsbaueinheit the
        mineralizer 4, flows through, it is saturated with the easily
        digestible for the human organism trace elements Ca &lt;+ +&gt;,
        Mg &lt;+ +&gt;, I &lt;"&gt;, Se.<br>
        <br>
        Thereafter the activated and mineralized water is conveyed
        through the sensor 5 to determine the characteristics
        (activation step), and the sensor 7 for determining the
        composition (mineralization conductometer).<br>
        <br>
        In the storage tank 14, it is then collected and discharged
        through the high pressure valve 19 and a valve.<br>
        <br>
        Which is collected in the storage container Antioxydanswasser 14
        under a pressure up to 2.5 bar.<br>
        <br>
        If no water is then derived, remains its redox potential
        obtained at least 3 days.<br>
        <br>
        The signals from the input sensors 5 and 6 for the control
        characteristic and the output sensors 7 and 8 for the
        composition control can be processed by control units
        (controllers) of the electrical activator, third<br>
        <br>
        They provide consumers with the information on the proper
        operation of the device via the display 18 in the form of 3
        double-LEDs.<br>
        <br>
        While green and red mean in order a deviation from the norm.<br>
        <br>
        The three LEDs indicate the quality of the cleaning, activation,
        and mineralization of activated water.<br>
        <br>
        The alarm LED unit in a timely manner to malfunction of the
        electrical activator and exchanged cartridges and refill the
        mineral additives.<br>
        <br>
        The high pressure relay 19, the automatic shut-off valve 20, the
        booster pump 21 and the low pressure relay 22 provide the

        the recognition process reduced, the cluster structure and the
        microclusters recognised in deep liquid layers and the dynamic
        range improved, wherein the liquid under investigation is
        subjected to ultrasound radiation, wherein the liquid
        microclusters themselves form highly energetic eddy formations

        <b>Description</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The invention relates to a method for the detection of clusters
        of micro-structure and the cluster of liquids.<br>
        <br>
        It can be used for measuring the physico-chemical and biological
        activity of the structured liquids in various applications.<br>
        <br>
        To specifically include the detection of characteristics and
        parameters of the biologically active substances (biologically
        active additives), the activated gases and liquids, which are
        located in thermodynamic non-equilibrium state with micro
        cluster structure or have been brought into this state by means
        of substances and fields, for the optimization of process the
        activation of the liquids and the hydrogen energy in real-time.<br>
        <br>
        It is a method for the detection (identification and acquisition
        of the properties and parameters) of the structured conductive
        liquids known.<br>
        <br>
        This is done by visualizing the structure of water by freezing
        water and photo-taking (Masaru Emoto, Messages from Water:
        secret codes of the ice crystals.<br>

        t = 1065).<br>
        <br>
        The main shortcomings of this method are its complexity, inertia
        and conservation, ie Freezing.<br>
        <br>
        Only the structure of the upper layer of the liquid is detected.<br>
        <br>
        The conditions for the implementation of the method
        significantly affect the measurement results.<br>
        <br>
        It is a method for visualizing and exploring the parameters of
        the patterned conductive liquids due to the method of the gas
        discharge visualization (GEV) known.<br>
        <br>
        The GEV method is a process tool.<br>
        <br>
        It allows to analyze the thin water structures rapidly and to
        take into account the particularities of environmental
        influences (the assessment of structural modifications in the
        liquid phase objects, http://grv.fromru.com/use.html).<br>
        <br>
        About the shortcomings of this method is one in which complexity
        of its technical realization.<br>
        <br>
        Only the structure of the upper layer of the liquid is detected.<br>
        <br>
        The conditions for the implementation of the method
        significantly affect the measurement results.<br>
        <br>
        Is technically closest to the proposed method is the method for
        the detection of characteristics and parameters of the patterned
        conductive liquids by means of the visualization
        supraübermolekulären water complexes due to laser interference <br>
        <br>
        (Smirnov AN Lapshin VB Balyschev AW Lebedev IM Syrojeschkin AW
        Supraübermolekuläre water complexes. "Explored in Russia", p
        413-421. http://zhurnal.ape.relarn.ru/articles/2004/038.pdf).<br>
        <br>
        The liquid to be tested is treated with laser radiation.<br>
        <br>
        If supraübermolekuläre water complexes (SUEK) is present in the
        liquid, so as a result of this treatment is the amplitude of
        phase modulation of the laser radiation on optical inhomogeneity
        of the extended laser beam passing through the liquid system.<br>
        <br>
        Observing and documenting SUEK done using video equipment.<br>
        <br>
        The main shortcomings of this method are the complexity of its
        technical implementation, the complexity of the realization of
        the resonance methods of detection when the micro-cluster sizes
        exceed the radiation wavelength, because an optical
        high-frequency range is used.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the cluster structure is recognized only in the thin
        surface layer of the liquid.<br>
        <br>
        The object of the invention to simplify the technical
        feasibility of the process of increasing its sensitivity to
        lower the cost of the acquisition sequence to identify the
        cluster structure and the micro-clusters in deep and liquid
        sections to extend the dynamic range.<br>
        <br>
        This object is achieved according to the invention in that after
        the change of the characteristics of the radiation acting on the
        under test liquid, the liquid is treated with ultrasound, and in
        the measurement of the radiation characteristics of the Doppler
        frequency shift is applied.<br>
        <br>
        The use of ultrasound as a radiation source shall ensure that: a
        simplification of the process, the reduction of the energy
        intensity of the process, its cheaper, increasing the
        sensitivity and the possibility of three-dimensional mass
        analytical detection of the cluster structure of the liquid due
        to the method of pulse wave Doppler (using Doppler frequency
        shift for the measurements).<br>
        <br>
        The use of ultrasound for the detection and visualization of
        various physical education and inhomogeneities in liquids is
        well known.<br>
        <br>
        However, it was due to the specific structure and the properties
        of the cluster of micro-liquid to be impossible to realize such
        structures by ultrasound.<br>
        <br>
        We have demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that it is
        possible.<br>
        <br>
        This is due to the fact that the liquid micro-clusters are
        themselves high-energy vortices (high-energy vortical
        formations) from FlüssigkeitsdipoSen (di-polar liquid).<br>
        <br>
        The Flüssigkeitsdipole the resonance microclusters (RM)
        (Resonance micro-clusters (RM)). With dimensions of ~ [lambda]
        of ultrasound in liquid and less<br>
        <br>
        This allows the resonant micro cluster with the ultrasonic
        radiation are in resonance interaction and dissociate in
        Komponentendipole (composition dipole) and ions.<br>
        <br>
        This is also due to the technical simplicity of
        Frequenzumstimmung and the possibility of application of pulse
        wave Doppler ultrasound for.<br>
        <br>
        The formation of stable clusters of micro bound dipoles was
        first explained theoretically 1985 (Schironossov VG reports from
        universities, Physics, 1985, Volume 28, Issue 7, pp. 74-78).<br>
        <br>
        It was previously unknown to law the formation of stable
        vortical resonance micro-clusters (RM) of two or more resonance
        moderately in push-pull oscillating dipoles (solution of the
        problem "1 / R &lt;3&gt;") established with a rapidly decreasing
        radiation field.<br>
        <br>
        The field decreases with the distance from (~ 1 / R &lt;4&gt;).<br>

        industry. - M.: VNIIIMT NPO EKRAN, 1999, Part 1, page 66) was
        also tentatively (discovered empirically) the effect of the
        non-contact activation of liquids (KAF) in the electrolysis
        without a diaphragm by means of thin walls.<br>
        <br>
        Such non-contact activation of liquids was determined by the
        RM-radiation.<br>
        <br>
        The resonant micro clusters of water bound OHDipolen (after
        peroxy type - H2O2 H2O2 ...) cause the formation of
        characterizing radiation in different wavelength ranges
        (mechanisms of action of the electromagnetic waves of low
        intensity to water and water solutions.<br>

        of electronics", http://merak.ru/journal20rus.htm).<br>
        <br>
        The specific relaxation time of the RM - [tau] RM exceeds by
        several orders of magnitude the [tau] o the usual nonequilibrium
        media (KMR (NMR), ESR, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        They can be a few tens of seconds to a few decades.<br>
        <br>
        This is confirmed by the results of the tests.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the patterned conductive liquid is a substance which is in
        a thermodynamic non-equilibrium state with a micro cluster
        structure.<br>
        <br>
        And this material itself acts as a radiation source.<br>
        <br>
        Structured systems (liquids and gases) have their own vortex

        The means for detecting the cluster structure and the
        micro-clusters of liquid (Figure 1) consists of a container 1 to
        be investigated with the (micro-structured and cluster 2
        containing) liquid 3<br>
        <br>
        The emitter 4 and the U.S. receiver 5 are arranged either in
        this tank or contact (with the walls of this container FIG 1).<br>
        <br>
        The emitter 4 and the U.S. receiver 5 can be used as a single
        component 6 using the Impulsererfassungsmethoden (FIGS. 2 - 3)
        are performed.<br>
        <br>
        The container 1 (Fig. 1 - 3) may be a flow-Eindosierbehälter.<br>
        <br>
        The procedure for the detection of clusters of micro-structure
        and clusters of liquid consists in the following: The container
        1 contains structured liquid 3 (Fig. 1 - 3); the radiator 4 and
        the U.S. receiver 5 (Fig. 1) or a unified element 6 ( FIG 2, 3).<br>
        <br>
        Everything is placed in the container 1.<br>
        <br>
        Here, the radiator 4 and the U.S. receiver are arranged on the
        container walls 6.<br>
        <br>
        Due to the interaction between the U.S. and the waves of the
        liquid 3 micro clusters 2 comes into a change in the wave
        parameters.<br>
        <br>
        Below are the parameters of the abandoned and the reflected wave
        (amplitude, frequency, phase, delay, when pulse techniques are
        used) measured.<br>
        <br>
        Thereby, a signal is formed which represents the parameters and
        the properties of the cluster structure of the liquids.<br>
        <br>
        By mathematical processing of the signals of several converters
        (Fig. 3) the display of the cluster structure and the
        micro-clusters of liquid is visualized on a screen.<br>
        <br>
        Order to increase the sensitivity and the degree of the method,
        in addition, the dissociation of the cluster pattern is effected
        in the molecular components and ions by the frequency and the
        amplitude of the wave can be retuned U.S..<br>
        <br>
        The resolution of various substances in the fluid to be examined
        as well as the treatment of the liquid with different fields
        cause the modification of the cluster structure of this liquid.<br>
        <br>
        Acting accordingly using the signal to be detected size.<br>
        <br>
        As to be examined structured liquids, such substances can be
        used, which are located in the liquid state, and which have been
        brought into the thermodynamic non-equilibrium state with
        resonance microclusters structure or can be maintained in this
        state, by means of the release of various substances, chemical
        and biochemical reactions, physical processes, heating and
        radiation of various electrical and mechanical generators and
        power sources.<br>
        <br>
        These include, for<br>
        <br>
        As solutions of chemicals, Mikroclusterund nanoclusters powder
        (Mikrohydrin, Megamin, Sehydrin (Segidrin), activated alumina,
        etc.), the contact or in contactless activated liquids (which
        have been produced by electrolysis with or without a diaphragm,
        with the use of electrical and mechanical generators warming)
        form.<br>
        <br>
        The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by examples
        notified of detection of the cluster structure and the
        micro-clusters of different liquids, which are located in
        thermodynamic non-equilibrium state with resonant micro cluster
        structure (4 to 11).<br>
        <br>
        The representations of&nbsp; the cluster structure and the
        micro-clusters of liquid were at modes of Echound Doppler
        signals (the limited to the frame area) in the U.S. Scanner
        "MyLab 15" is generated.<br>
        <br>
        The amounts of distilled water were sonicated by ultrasound.<br>
        <br>
        It was known in advance that the treatment benefits would not
        cause intense heating of the liquid to be examined (line encoder
        10.0 MHz).<br>
        <br>
        During this treatment, in the usual pattern formation fluids
        were visualized on echo operation, which have been previously
        observed in the prototype using optical methods.<br>
        <br>
        When power Doppler operation limited Doppler positive
        developments were visualized by micro-clusters.<br>
        <br>
        They had a stable rounded shape and distinct contours.<br>
        <br>
        These micro cluster formations had. The form of rings and
        toroids or other stable forms having a diameter of 0.6 to 1, 5
        cm, and moved over the entire volume of liquid USbehandelten<br>
        <br>
        It increased the amount and size of the described positive
        Doppler toroids depending extension of the exposure time, the
        frequency selection and the power increase of the search pulses.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the number of toroids produced in specified volume
        of liquid, and their formation rate were influenced by the
        actual state of the activated liquid.<br>
        <br>
        The dependence of the amount and from what the articles
        described the characteristics of the U.S. sonicated liquid
        indicates that these micro-clusters (stable long-life education
        and no bogus representations ie, Artefacts).<br>
        <br>
        The Doppler representation of the toroidal microclusters are
        actually the velocity of the water particle motion again
        (molecules, clusters and larger clusters) in the predetermined
        point of the room.<br>

        The invention relates to a method for determining the activity
        of a structured liquid, including the measuring of physical
        parameters thereof. The potential difference between the
        electrodes dipped in the liquid is used as a characteristic
        value for measurement, the electrodes being made of materials
        with which the microclusters of the liquid do not interact in
        the same manner, which simplifies the technical construction,
        increases sensitivity, records activity on smaller portions

        <b>Description</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The invention relates to a method for determining the activity
        of a structured liquid.<br>
        <br>
        The method can be used in various applications, including
        specifically in the detection of characteristics and parameters
        of biologically active substances, as well as activated gases
        and liquids, which are in thermodynamic non-equilibrium state
        with micro cluster structure or have been brought into this
        state by means of the substances, and of fields .<br>
        <br>
        It is a method for detecting the characteristics and parameters
        of the liquids by means of visualization of the structured
        conductive supraübermolekulären water complexes due to laser
        interference known (Smirnov AH Lapshin VB Balyschev AW Lebedev
        IM Syrojeschkin AW Supraübermolekuläre water complexes.<br>
        <br>
        "Explored in Russia", p 413-421.
        http://zhurnal.ape.relarn.ru/articles/2004/038.pdf .<br>
        <br>
        The main shortcomings of this method are its complexity and the
        fact that the activity is detected only in the surface layer of
        the liquid, and that due to the application of an optical
        high-frequency range.<br>
        <br>
        Is technically closest to the proposed method is a method for
        determining the activity of a structured conductive liquid.<br>
        <br>
        Such activity measured using the detection of residual radiation
        from excited water micro-clusters of bound dipoles OHnach the
        peroxy type - H2O2, H2O2 ...<br>
        <br>
        (Mechanisms of action of low-intensity electromagnetic waves on
        water and water solutions. 22nd International scientific and
        practical conference "Problems of electronics",
        http://merak.ru/journal20rus.htm).<br>
        <br>
        The major shortcoming of this method is that it is necessary to
        use super-sensitive spectral with Mikrowellenund mm areas.<br>
        <br>
        This eliminates the possibility of measurement of activity of
        small portions of liquid, which have been subjected to a
        specific way.<br>
        <br>
        Other shortcomings include the lack of sensitivity of the
        method, the complexity and costliness of its technical
        realization and insufficient accuracy (for insufficient exposure
        to the inner physical fields on the electrode sensors of
        Mikrowellenund mm ranges through the liquid medium).<br>
        <br>
        It is an object of the invention to simplify the technical
        realization of the process, to increase the sensitivity to
        detect the activity of small portions of liquid to reduce the
        energy intensity and to reduce the cost of the detection
        sequence.<br>
        <br>
        This object is achieved according to the invention is achieved
        in that the potential difference is used between the immersed in
        the liquid electrodes as to be measured characteristic value,
        wherein the electrodes are made of materials which cooperate
        dissimilar with the micro-clusters of the liquid (Fig. 1).<br>
        <br>
        For measuring the parameters of the test liquid special
        electrodes are immersed in the liquid to be tested and measuring
        the potential difference between the electrodes are immersed.<br>
        <br>
        Here, the structured liquid to be analyzed is separated by a
        thin wall of the liquid to be tested.<br>
        <br>
        Also then, the potential difference of the test liquid to be
        compared with the potential difference of the liquid to be
        examined.<br>
        <br>
        The use of potential difference between the immersed in the
        liquid electrodes as being measured characteristic value, while
        the electrodes are made of the the micro clusters of liquid
        different cooperating materials, ensures the simplification of
        the procedure itself, the reduction of the energy intensity of
        the process and its cheapening .<br>
        <br>
        This is due to the fact that the micro-clusters of the liquid
        surface with atomic electromagnetic fields of dissimilar
        electrodes cooperate to dissociate in the formation of
        lonenkomponenten Hydratisierungselektronen.<br>
        <br>
        As a form at the dissimilar electrode potentials of various
        sizes.<br>
        <br>
        The difference between these potentials (EMK) serves just as an
        activity measure of the structured liquid (concentration of
        micro-clusters after the peroxy type, per unit volume).<br>
        <br>
        Thus, in detail, one of the electrodes, which dissociates the
        peroxy active are formed from silver, gold, platinum, palladium
        or iron oxide.<br>
        <br>
        This is, for example, to determine the activity of the patterned
        conductive liquids from bonded OH dipoles (after the peroxy type
        - H2O2, H2O2, etc).<br>
        <br>
        The other electrode, such As the low activity may be carried out
        of iron.<br>
        <br>
        The actual appearance of the rapid decomposition of the
        compounds of bonded dipoles on the surface of each electrode was
        as activation (activation) denotes (Altshuller GS, Shapiro RB
        Oxiwasser.<br>
        <br>
        "Technology for young people", Issue No. 10, 1958.<br>
        Pp. 25-27.).<br>
        <br>
        The formation of stable clusters of micro bound dipoles was
        explained theoretically 1985 (Schironossov VG reports from
        universities, Physics, 1985, Volume 28, Issue 7, pp. 74-78).<br>
        <br>
        It was previously unknown to law the formation of stable
        resonance micro-clusters (RM) of two or more resonance
        moderately in push-pull oscillating dipoles (solution of the
        problem "1 / R &lt;3&gt;") established with a rapidly decreasing
        radiation field.<br>
        <br>
        The field decreases with the distance from (~ 1 / R &lt;4&gt;).<br>
        <br>
        Later experimentally discovered (empirically) the effect of
        non-contact activation of liquids (KAF) in the electrolysis cell
        without diaphragm through thin walls.<br>
        <br>
        Such non-contact activation of liquids was the RM-radiation
        caused Collected (Schironossov VG, EV Schironossov theses of the
        reports of the 2nd International Symposium. Electrochemical
        activation in medicine, agriculture and industry. - M.: VNIIIMT
        NPO EKRAN, 1999, part 1, page 66).<br>
        <br>
        The specific relaxation time [tau] of RM RM exceeds by several
        orders of magnitude the [tau] 0 the usual nonequilibrium media
        (KMR (NMR), ESR, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        They can be a few tens of seconds or more.<br>
        <br>
        This is confirmed by the results of the tests.<br>
        <br>
        The activated or by the action of substances or fields to be
        activated is a liquid substance, which is located in a
        thermodynamic non-equilibrium state with a micro-structure and
        the cluster itself, the radiation source.<br>
        <br>
        Structured liquids have a specific electromagnetic radiation
        (http://merak.ru/journal20rus.htm,

        Hears the influence of substances, or on fields completely,
        returns the non-equilibrium structure of the substances back to
        their original state of equilibrium, and therefore so does the
        induced emf.<br>
        <br>
        The specificity of the method is its high sensitivity to weak
        energy flows and small amounts of soluble substances.<br>
        <br>
        This is because the change of the polycrystalline structure of
        the water according to the laws of thermodynamics molecular
        requires much less energy than. The change of the characteristic
        values ??of weak electrolytes<br>
        <br>
        The measurement of the potential difference between the immersed
        in the test liquid electrodes, the test fluid is separated from
        the to be tested structured liquid by means of a thin wall,
        makes it possible the influence of the electrodes reduce the
        change process essential to carry out the selective measurements
        by specific spectral characteristics of the walls and the test
        fluid to be used, and the determination of the liquid contact
        and activity without introduction of chemical admixtures make
        the part of the electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        The additional measurement of the potential difference between
        the possible in the test liquid immersed electrodes and the
        comparison of this difference with the measured potential

        tolerance and the accuracy of the device for realization of the
        process and their calibration significantly (by a few orders of
        magnitude increase).<br>

        Two electrodes are arranged in the container 3 and 4 from
        dissimilar materials.<br>

        The method for determining the activity of the structured liquid

        The electrodes 3 and 4 are made from such materials, which
        interact differently with the micro-clusters of the liquid.<br>

        Due to the interaction of the liquid with the microclusters

        FIELD: applied physics; applied chemistry; methods of production
        of the solid substances from the different crystallizable
        liquids. ^ SUBSTANCE: the invention is pertaining to the field
        of the applied physics and the applied chemistry and may be used
        for production of the solid substances from the different
        crystallizable liquids. The crystallizable liquid before
        crystallization is exposed to the contact with the other liquid
        activated or being activated by means of electrolysis or at the
        expense of dissolution of the microhydrin. The contact with the
        crystallizable liquid is exercised directly or through the
        intermediate medium, which represents the thin wall, the liquid
        or of their combinations.; The invention allows to simplify the
        production process, to vary the structure of the crystallizable
        substance with the minimal power inputs. ^ EFFECT: the invention
        ensures simplification of the production process, the capability
        to vary the structure of the crystallizable substance at the
