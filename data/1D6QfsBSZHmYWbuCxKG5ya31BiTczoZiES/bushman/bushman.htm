      </b><b>EXPERIENCE:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, 1986 to 2000 (and present
      consultant), Mr. Bushman has participated in Advanced Aircraft
      Concepts as a member of the technical team. He has conducted
      European Theater Tactical Fighter performance analysis,
      coordinated customer interface and development performance
      concepts. He developed laser, electro-optical sensor, and power
      systems. He developed and taught analysis courses. Several
      million-dollar contracts were obtained directly from him. Bushman
      holds 26 US Patents and classified Patents.<br>
      <br>
      Texas Instruments, 1979-1987, Mr. Bushman worked on the
      development of laser guided smart bombs, Tank Mounted Infrared
      FLIR systems, focal plane arrays and GPS Systems all of which are
      currently deployed as major components of Tactical Land Air and
      Sea systems.<br>
      <br>
      From 1976 to 1979 Mr. Bushman was a Manager at Parsons
      International of Iran, Mexico and then Louisiana with the U.S.
      department of Energy's Strategic Oil Reserve Program. He managed a
      division of Trans Universal Finance Company in Southern
      California. Funding was obtained for high multimillion dollar
      projects.<br>
      <br>
      At Hughes Aircraft (Now Ratheon), 1968-1976, Mr. Bushman was the
      Manager/Technical Liaison officer to the Infrared Sensor Division
      (SBRC Santa Barbara Research Center). He was involved in technical
      description and financial disbursement. Systems were deployed to

      <br>
      Here's more info about Bushman's Magnetic Beam Amplifier. It's
      interesting that it can provide a conductive channel in the air to
      produce 5-foot long sparks from high voltage. A long time ago I
      made and tested the unbalanced capacitor (It consists of parallel
      conducting plates, with a plurality of pins or points on one set
      of plates, facing the opposite plate, and separated by a
      dielectric, and air gap. ). It didn't work, but I've just found
      that I connected it incorrectly, so I'll be testing it again.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <a

      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      "An interesting effect he mentions is to have two such devices
      aimed at each other, and separated by up to five feet, with one
      having all south poles inward, and the other all north poles
      inward.&nbsp; And place a high voltage source adjacent to one beam
      source (such as a Van De Graff generator - set to cause sparks to
      jump 3/4" - meaning approx 7,500 volts in standard air) that there
      will be an arc extending along this beam for the entire five feet,
      to the other beam device!<br>
      <br>
      I find this claim to very interesting, as the PE theory, indicates
      this energy is responsible for matter formation, and gravity, and
      that there is implied in the theory a method to generate
      electrical power directly from a "gravity beam". &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This is due to the Tendency for nuclei and electrons to remain in
      their respective nodes and antinodes of this PE, and a
      preferential drift of these nodes/antinodes results in what we
      observe as the attraction of gravity.&nbsp; If you have some free
      electrons in a conductor or in a semi or quasi conductor - they
      would be influenced by this anti nodal drift. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      If the mass of this material (either conductor or quasi conductor)
      is not free to move under the influence of this nodal/anitnodal
      drift (gravity), there would then be a tendency to produce an
      electric charge separation, as the free electrons would be induced
      to drift.&nbsp; This charge separation would result in an excess
      negative charge in the direction of the gravity - for example: the
      preferential drift near the earth is towards the planet, and thus
      one should expect that free electrons in the atmosphere (a quasi
      conductor and dielectric) would drift towards the planet under
      this influence.<br>
      <br>
      The bulk mass of the atmosphere is pushed towards the planet, but
      reaches an equilibrium from the "pressure" of the air molecules
      against each other.&nbsp; The free electrons are not necessarily
      subject to this same equilibrium, and would continue to drift
      towards the planet.&nbsp; This results in the natural (and not
      fully explained by conventional science) electric field in the
      atmosphere!<br>
      <br>
      This mechanism may explain the natural electric field of the
      atmosphere, as being due to gravity.&nbsp; And it follows that if
      one can create an isolated gravity beam of this nodal drift - that
      if you fix a conductor, or quasi conductor in this beam, that a
      charge separation will occur.&nbsp; You could then harness this
      energy directly as electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      So if this magnetic beam amplifier is actually a concentrated PE
      beam, then perhaps this anomalous arcing effect is due to the
      gravitic nature of the "beam", in a similar manner as noted above.

      <br>
      Seriously do you really need to know a sixty year old secret? I
      think it is time for us to know the truth. We flew out first anti
      gravity craft in the fifties a decade after the Roswell crash.
      Yeah it was tethered to a power cable but we are way beyond that
      first working model today in 2012. Boyd Bushman has built the
      Apparatus and Method for amplifying a magnetic beam – US Patent
      Issued on July 27, 1999. The technology involves the careful
      spinning of the liquid metal Mercury. In this video Boyd Bushman
      demonstrates the spinning CELT I think he called it. Its about the
      three thirty minute mark. It is an incredible display of energy
      and when you couple that with mercury you are able to generate
      huge magnetic forces and propulsion. His experiments on the
      Hutchinson effect show that magnetism can cancel gravity.
      Basically he took two rocks one with a pair of super magnets
      bolted together inside the rock and the other without the magnets.
      The one with bolted super magnets produced a three foot radius
      magnetic field around the rock. that is the increases the
      repulsive force. The result of dropping these two items from some
      height within the gravitational pull of the earth was that the
      rock with the magnets arrived later. This is incredibly
      significant in the world pf physics and shows the link between
      magnetic and gravity. An incredibly important step in finding the
      unified field theories that Relativity have somewhat led us away
      from. Boyd Bushman was a major leading player in the work done at
      the SKUNK Works over the last few decades. This is another high
      ranking official trying to release the skepticism in Americans so
      we can open our borders and our minds to the Visitors. Boyd
      Bushman confirms that we have nuclear powered magnetic propulsion
      craft that can reach heights of 60,000 feet and operate with
      distance specifications in the thousands of miles. Once again
      there are no Aliens because America does not believe in them and
      the true Exo-Political party in charge is not yet ready to take a
      step forward. Sixty years of darkness is too long already. Most
      Americans are UFO skeptics, have not really researched what is
      going on and don’t want to be laughed at. I must be crazy but I
      think this is the scientist who created the craft and is
      describing parts of the technological road map from finding the
      craft, to measuring the craft dynamics, duplicating the dynamics
      and prototyping working models. Less than 10K hits on youtube for
      a man who built the magnetic propulsion technology. Then again I
      am not a skeptic anymore. <br>

      kind, represented by the series of dotted line circles extending
      out from the device. The author claims it is magnetic energy, but
      my own magnetic field analysis, and experiments show the magnetic
      field, while enhanced in this direction, does not appear to extend
      out to five feet as is claimed in the patent. (the magnetic flux
      does not appear to go this far at any appreciable strength, but a
      subtle energy effect does!) <br>

      This is a plot of the magnetic field given off by a Beamer<br>
      <br>
      The unusual properties of this beam, as described by the author,
      are very similar to the properties of a Primary Energy beam. And
      as the inert gases do exist as natural components of air, perhaps
      this beam he speaks of is a concentrated PE beam? (note in the
      next chapter a more powerful "Beamer" device is constructed, and
      it has a PE emanation all the time - and more so when you insert
      inert gas tubes into the "beam" area.)<br>
      <br>
      He further claims that if you place a conductive coil (60) in the
      beam, and connected in series with a special unbalanced capacitor
      (65), and a voltmeter; that a voltage is produced which will vary
      if any object is in the beam, or any movement occurs in the beam.
      (yet to be tested)<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, if you place just the special capacitor in the beam
      (70),it will register a voltage if any movement occurs in the
      beam.<br>
      <br>
      He further claims that if you place a coil over the unopposed
      magnet (80), and apply an ac current at various frequencies, you
      can modulate this beam, causing various effects at a distance. <br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BUSHMAN BOYD B <br>
      <br>
      An apparatus and method for creating a magnetic beam wherein a
      focusing magnet assembly (45) is comprised of a first opposing
      magnet pair (20) and a second opposing magnet pair (30) disposed
      in a focusing plane, each magnet of the respective opposing magnet
      pairs having a like pole directed towards the geometric center of
      the focusing magnet assembly (45) to form an alignment path, two
      like magnetic beams extending from the alignment path on each side
      of the focusing magnet assembly (45), each beam being generally
      perpendicular to the focusing plane. A like pole of an unopposed
      magnet (10) can be directed down the alignment path from one side
      of the focusing magnet assembly (45) to produce a single magnetic
      beam extending generally perpendicular from the focusing magnet
      assembly opposite unopposed magnet (10).<b> This beam is a
        magnetic monopole which emits pulses, levitates, degausses,
        stops electronics and separates materials.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to the field of magnetic
      devices, and more particularly to focusing a magnetic field to
      increase the efficiency of a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Magnets have a variety of commercial uses. For instance, magnets
      perform a variety of physical tasks by attracting ferric
      materials, and magnets also perform a variety of electrical tasks,
      such as creating an electric current in a generator or alternator
      or enhancing the performance of electromagnetic devices such as
      inductors. However, the creation of a strong magnetic field to
      perform these functions generally entails the use of a large
      permanent magnet or a powerful electromagnet. Such magnets are
      often physically large and heavy, and tend to produce wide
      magnetic fields which can interfere with equipment near the
      magnet. Thus, commercial devices that include magnets must be
      designed around the physical size of the magnet needed to produce
      a desired magnetic field and around the width of the magnetic
      field produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Therefore, a need has arisen for an apparatus and method for
      manipulating and focusing the magnetic field of a magnet to reduce
      the size and strength required for a given magnet to perform a
      function.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus and method
      is provided that substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages
      and problems associated with previously used unfocused magnets.
      The present invention uses opposing magnetic pairs to direct a
      magnetic field along an alignment axis.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the present invention focuses a magnetic beam
      along an alignment axis by providing a focusing magnet assembly
      having at least three opposing magnets spaced apart in a focusing
      plane, the space between the opposing magnets forming an alignment
      path, and by further providing an unopposed magnet generally
      directed along the alignment axis towards the alignment path. Each
      opposing magnet has a like pole facing across the alignment path.
      The alignment axis corresponds to the alignment path formed by the
      spacing between the focusing assembly of magnets. In one
      alternative embodiment, the unopposed magnet can be placed in the
      focusing plane to form opposing magnet pairs which direct a
      magnetic beam from the alignment path along the alignment axis
      from each side of the focusing assembly.<br>
      <br>
      In one alternative embodiment, a coil of conducting material is
      disposed in the magnetic beam near the exit of the beam from the
      focusing magnet assembly. An unbalanced capacitor and a voltmeter
      connected in series with the coil allow the detection of movement
      through the magnetic beam by measuring variations in the AC
      voltage of the coil. Alternatively, AC voltage can be measured
      from a pin array disposed in the beam as a substitute for the coil
      and unbalanced capacitor. In yet another embodiment, electric
      power, such as an alternating current, can be passed through coils
      arranged around one or more of the magnets of the assembly to
      allow the generation of a magnetic pulse.<br>
      <br>
      The focused magnetic beam or beams produced by the present
      invention provides important technical advantages by focusing a
      magnetic field. The focused field may perform functions using less
      total magnetic force than is generally used by an unfocused
      magnet. This allows for the use of smaller permanent magnets, or
      alternatively, electromagnets that use lower amounts of electric
      power. Thus, a commercial device built with magnets according to
      the present invention<b> can be built smaller and with less of a
        need for power consumption</b> than devices using standard
      magnets. For instance, the present invention <b>can be used to
        more effectively separate ferric materials from non-ferric
        materials</b>, and can more effectively<b> induce propulsion or
        levitation</b> in systems that use magnetic fields, such as
      electric motors or levitating trains that use opposing magnetic
      fields. The present invention can also interact with
      electromagnetic devices such as computers by <b>stopping the
        operation of analog circuits from a distance, degaussing and
        otherwise interfering with digital circuits and memories, and
        emitting high powered electromagnetic pulses (EMP) at such
        circuits when induction coils are energized around the magnets
        with an alternating current. The present invention can also
        direct or transport electromagnetic charges through a distance.</b><br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in
      the figures, like numerals being used to refer to like and
      corresponding parts of the various drawings.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 1, one embodiment of the present invention
      is depicted creating a south magnetic beam 5. A single unopposed
      magnet 10 is aligned along an alignment axis 15 so that the south
      pole 11 of magnet 10 points substantially in the direction of the
      intended magnetic beam. The alignment axis 15 in FIG. 1 is labeled
      as the "X" axis. A first opposing magnet pair 20 is disposed along
      a first or "Y" axis 25 substantially perpendicular to the
      alignment axis 15. Opposing magnet pair 20 is comprised of two
      magnets, 21 and 23, substantially aligned along the "Y" axis 25 so
      that the south pole 22 of magnet 21 and the south pole 24 of
      magnet 23 face each other. Magnets 21 and 23 are arranged to have
      a space between them which coincides with the path of alignment
      axis 15.<br>
      <br>
      A second opposing magnet pair 30 is disposed along a second or "Z"
      axis 35, which is substantially perpendicular to the alignment
      axis 15 and also substantially perpendicular to the "Y" axis 25,
      the first and second magnet pairs forming a focusing magnet
      assembly 40. Second opposing magnet pair 30 is comprised of two
      opposing magnets, 31 and 33, each substantially aligned along the
      "Z" axis 35 so that the south pole 32 of magnet 31 faces the south
      pole 34 of magnet 33. Magnets 31 and 33 are arranged with a space
      between them, the space coinciding with the path of the alignment
      axis 15. The spaces of first and second opposing magnet pairs 20
      and 30 coincide to form an alignment path 45 through which the
      alignment axis 15 is disposed. The first axis 25 and second axis
      35 intercept within alignment path 45 at the approximate geometric
      center of the magnet assembly to form a focusing plane.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment depicted by FIG. 1, each magnet has
      approximately the same magnetic force, and each magnet is a
      niosyum magnet constructed in the form of a cylinder with a hole
      50 down its center. Nonferric bolts 51 are inserted through each
      hole and intersect at the geographic center of the magnetic pairs,
      where the Nonferric bolts can be coupled to hold the magnets in
      place. In alternative embodiments, any other convenient means of
      coupling the magnets in place can be used, and alternative means
      of producing a magnetic force, such as electromagnets, can be
      used. In another embodiment, unopposed magnet 10 can be removed so
      that a magnetic beam extends along the alignment axis 15 from each
      side of the focusing plane.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of FIG. 1 depicts a like pole of each magnet
      directed towards the geographic center of the focusing magnet
      assembly 40. In FIG. 1, the south pole of each magnet is depicted
      as directed at the alignment path 45 and at the geographic center
      of the focusing magnet assembly 40. In other embodiments, the
      north pole of each magnet can be directed at the geographic
      center. In either case, the coupling of like poles in a plane and
      the introduction of a like pole perpendicular to the plane acts to
      focus the magnetic fields of each magnet into a beam extending
      perpendicular from the focusing plane along the alignment axis 15
      of the single unopposed magnet 10. Thus, an unopposed magnet that
      would ordinarily have a measurable magnetic field of four to six
      inches extending outward from a pole can have a beam extending
      five to seven feet outward from the pole. The focused magnetic
      beam 5 extends along the alignment axis 15 beyond the magnetic
      field that would occur if each magnetic field of the beam assembly
      were combined into a single magnetic field, such as would happen
      if each of the magnets were combined end-to-end. The direction and
      intensity of the beam can be altered by changing the alignment of
      the single opposing magnet 10, or by changing the position or
      strength of the magnets in the focusing magnet assembly relative
      to the focusing plane, or by changing the shape or configuration
      of individual magnets. Thus, for instance, the beam could be made
      to rotate around alignment axis 15 by sequentially altering the
      strength of each magnet in the focusing magnet assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The increased magnetic field of the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1
      can be demonstrated by its physical effects. For instance, an
      unopposed magnet 10 that can lift a ferric object at a distance of
      approximately one inch can lift the same ferric object through a
      distance of approximately six inches when coupled to a magnetic
      assembly comprised of two pairs of opposing magnets as is depicted
      in FIG. 1. The same assembly<b> can cause cathode tube distortions
        at a distance of approximately two feet, can make electronic
        systems inoperable at a distance of approximately six inches,
        and can double the performance of an inductor at a distance of
        approximately eight inches.</b><br>
      <br>
      In another example of the physical effects of an embodiment such
      as that depicted in FIG. 1, a VanDeGraaff generator with a spark
      potential of approximately three quarters of an inch from its bell
      can be placed between an assembly of north opposing magnets and an
      assembly of south opposing magnets, the north opposing magnets
      located eight inches from the bell, and the south opposing magnets
      located five feet from the bell, with the bell located one foot
      from its base. This configuration will produce a large spark from
      the VanDeGraaff to the south opposing magnets, indicating the<b>
        potential for the present invention to perform electron transfer
        through a distance.</b><br>
      <br>
      In alternative embodiments, various numbers of magnets or opposing
      magnet pairs can be arranged around the alignment axis 15 to focus
      the magnetic beam 5. For instance, three opposing magnets could be
      used instead of the four opposing magnets depicted in FIG. 1.
      Alternatively, a greater number of magnets or magnet pairs can be
      arranged offset to the focusing plane to alter the focus or
      strength of the magnetic beam 5. In yet another embodiment, a
      plurality of focusing magnet assemblies can be disposed along the
      alignment axis in a plurality of focusing planes.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, two alternative embodiments of the
      present invention are depicted. First, a coil 60 comprised of a
      conducting material, such as copper, is disposed within a magnetic
      beam 5. An unbalanced capacitor 65 is coupled in series with the
      coil 60 and a voltmeter 66. Unbalanced capacitor 65 can be an
      electrical device such as the electrical device disclosed in U.S.
      patent application Ser. No. 08/144,814, by Boyd Bushman,
      abandoned, now issued as a continuation-in-part as <b>U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,637,946</b>, which is incorporated herein by reference.
      Voltmeter 66 is any conventional voltmeter capable of measuring an
      electric current, such as an alternating current. Movement, and
      even just the presence of objects, through the beam produces an AC
      voltage in coil 60 which can be detected by unbalanced capacitor
      65 and measured by voltmeter 66.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, a pin array 70 disposed in the magnetic beam 5 can
      also be used to measure disturbances, such as movement through the
      magnetic beam, which cause an AC voltage in pin array 70 that can
      be measured by voltmeter 66. Pin array 70 is any device such as
      the device disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      08/144,814, by Boyd Bushman, abandoned, now issued as a
      continuation-in-part as U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,946, which is
      incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, any other means
      of measuring a disturbance through a magnetic field can be used.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 3, a coil 80 comprised of a conducting
      material, such as copper, is depicted disposed around single
      unopposed magnet 10. An electric power source, such as an AC
      generator 85 supplies an alternating current to coil 80 at a
      variety of frequencies. The strength of the magnetic beam 5 varies
      according to the frequency of the alternating current through coil
      80 due to the magnetic field created by coil 80. Thus, a magnetic
      pulse beam is generated according to the frequency of the current
      passing through coil 80. When the frequency of the AC current is
      high, such as ten to the fifteenth power hertz, the magnetic pulse
      emitted simulates the effect of a destructive electromagnetic
      pulse. In alternative embodiments, coils can be disposed around
      each magnet or around the magnet assembly as a whole to create a
      magnetic field and pulse according to the frequency of a current
      applied to the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides several technical advantages
      related to the application of a magnetic field. For instance, by
      focusing a magnetic field, the present invention allows for a
      decrease in the size of magnets used in commercial devices. Thus,
      in commercial applications such as where a magnet is used to
      increase the efficiency of an inductor, the present invention
      allows for greater miniaturization with smaller magnets than would
      be allowed with the magnetic field of an unfocused magnet. Where
      the present invention is used with electromagnets, such as for the
      lifting of ferric materials, a smaller electric power source can
      be used to create a lifting magnetic force.<br>

      A radar cross-section reduction system utilizes a charging device
      for creating a high positive DC static potential on an object such
      as an aircraft. The charging system is mounted to the object so
      that this DC potential would be applied to the outer skin or
      surface of the object. The charging system includes Van de Graaf
      generators located in housings attached to the object. Each Van de
      Graaf generator has two pulleys about which a belt is rotated. One
      of the pulleys and the belt are nonconductors, while the other
      pulley is a conductor. This results in a buildup of positive
      charges at one end of the belt and negative charges at the other
      end. The negative charges are picked off and applied to a ground
      section. The positive charges are picked off and applied to a
      collector. The collector is in electrical continuity with the
      outer structure of the object. Negative dissipators attached to
      the ground section dissipate the excess negative charges during
      flight. Positive dissipators may be selectively switched into
      engagement with the skin to dissipate the positive charge on the
      skin prior to landing.<br>

      region which is proximate to the focal point and causes molecules
      within the air which are at the region to disassociate.
      Disassociation of the molecules generates pressure waves which
