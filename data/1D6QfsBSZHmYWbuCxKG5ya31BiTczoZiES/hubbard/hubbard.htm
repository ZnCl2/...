            Generator” Without Visible Source of Energy</i><i><br>
          </i><i>Alfred M. Hubbard, inventor of the machine he calls the

            the world of power and motion. He says:</i> "It will junk

          <br>
          <i>SEATTLE DEC 20 </i>– Has a 19-year-old Seattle boy solved
          the problem of the ages and realized the dream of science
          since electrical invention had birth? Has Alfred M. Hubbard,
          son of Mr. and Mrs. William Hubbard tapped the inexhaustible
          reservoirs of nature’s energy and harnessed to the use of man
          the illimitable power that permeates the universe?<br>
          <br>
          Hubbard has announced the perfection of an invention he terms
          an “atmospheric power generator” and made claims that last
          night caused Seattle’s leading electrical engineers to doubt
          the evidences of their senses and to pause before they
          condemned as folly the assertions of the youth. With the
          apparatus, in appearance a small coil of wire about six inches
          in diameter surrounding a permanently magnetic core eight
          inches long, the entire contrivance easily carried in a man’s
          hand. Hubbard gave a demonstration yesterday afternoon miles
          from his laboratory that, regardless of the principals
          involved, several Seattle engineers declared without parallel
          in electrical history.<br>
          <br>
          <b>MARVELOUS ANYWAY</b><br>
          An ordinary incandescent electric light connected with the two
          terminals of the atmospheric power generator glowed a cherry
          red for nearly one hour, and Hubbard volunteered to permit the
          lamp to burn for as many hours as was necessary to satisfy the
          most skeptical.<br>
          <br>
          The young inventor claims that there are no moving parts
          connected with his generator; that there are no hidden
          batteries, storage or primary; and those who witnessed the
          demonstration made sure that there was no outside connection
          with any source of power.<br>
          <br>
          Hubbard’s explanation of the phenomenon is that he has
          succeeded in transforming the earth lines of magnetic force
          into electrical energy available for use. While electrical
          engineers were highly skeptical last night, and held to the
          possibility of fraud, as George Quinan, superintendent of the
          electrical operations of the Puget Sound Traction Light and
          Power company, said “no matter what the lad has done, it is a
          marvelous demonstration”. All of the experts agreed that if as
          Hubbard declares, there are no moving parts and no concealed
          batteries, the invention was revolutionary. They had no
          explanation to offer for its operation.<br>
          <br>
          J.D. Ross, superintendent of the municipal lighting
          department, and one of the foremost authorities on
          experimental electricity in the northwest, declared it
          possible that Hubbard had stumbled upon the answer to the
          question of the ages – can the power of the atmosphere be
          utilized?<br>
          <br>
          <b>ALWAYS POSSIBLE</b><br>
          “It is hard to believe”, said Ross, “that this boy has done
          what the world’s scientists have failed to do, yet there is
          much in the statement that in the field of electricity nothing
          is impossible. I am inclined to believe, since I have not seen
          the device, that there is some trickery, but those who have
          seen it tell me that such is apparently not the case, and I
          must confess that I have no alternative but to admit the
          demonstration is almost unbelievable”.<br>
          <br>
          Carl Edward Magnusson, acting dean of the University of
          Washington college of engineering declined to even hazard a
          guess as to the principal involved in the device. “It sounds
          like trickery to me and I can hardly believe that the
          experiment as it has been described to me actually took place”
          he said. “I will not venture an opinion until I have seen
          it”.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          C.F. Uhden, special engineer of the city, in charge of the
          Skagit River power development, declared himself intently
          interested in the invention and after canvassing the
          possibilities of chicanery, admitted that he wouldn’t dare
          form an opinion until he has seen the apparatus in operation.
          “It’s always possible” he said, “though there have been many
          to make the claim and no one to substantiate it in the past”.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DENIES PERPETUAL MOTION</b><br>
          But Hubbard, because his device has not been patented, owing
          to complications arising with his backers, it is said, has
          refused to allow technical men more than a glimpse at the
          apparatus. Hubbard appears untrained in business, and like
          many inventors, cautious. He has no appearance of the
          charlatan and made the blanket statement that any of the
          seemingly extravagant claims for his invention he was willing
          to prove by operation under test conditions. All that could be
          learned from Hubbard regarding the construction of the
          instrument follows:<br>
          <br>
          <b>BURNS LAMP LONG TIME</b><br>
          Hubbard’s claims for the invention bring into being a host of
          dreams. If, as he says, he can obtain four kilowatts,
          equivalent to more than five horse power, from a contrivance
          weighing less than twelve pounds, then his claim that he can
          build a generator less than eighteen feet in length to develop
          18,000 horse power of sufficient electrical energy to drive
          the new battleship New Mexico is not unreasonable, in the
          opinion of the engineers.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Hubbard offers to build for $50 a generator large enough to
          drive an automobile and much smaller than present engines (it
          ended up costing $90). He offers also to build a generator and
          equip it with a motor to drive an airplane and to weigh about
          as much as the present motor without fuel. The tank and
          gasoline at present are one of the greatest weight factors of
          the airplane. The Hubbard generator, according to its
          inventor, would give the airplane unlimited flying range.
          Hubbard, who says he has a laboratory at his home with
          apparatus valued at $10,000, declares that he worked 18 hours
          a day for two years before he came to Seattle and (has
          continued working) during the year since perfecting the
          apparatus. His first model was built a year and a half ago, he
          said. Hubbard asserts that his four-kilowatt machine has
          continuously excited the equivalent of 120 ordinary 25watt
          house lamps to full brilliancy for three months. The device
          during this time, (he says he is ready to take an oath on it),
          did not receive outward stimulus, and at the time of the test
          was completed the lights were burning at the same brilliancy.
          The machine, he said, is composed of several layers of wire
          about a steel core, which is magnetized after the construction
          is complete. Once magnetized, the core needs no further
          attention, he said, and the entire device will deliver energy
          unremittingly for an indefinite length of time. “I place a
          maximum of fifty years on the life of the generator” said
          Hubbard, “simply because one must fix a maximum. I know no
          reason why it would not last until time rots the insulation
          away from the wires”. Hubbard denies that his device is a
          perpetual motion machine. He maintains that it taps the vast
          storehouses of cosmic energy and the apparatus is founded upon
          sound scientific principles. (Which ones are those?)<br>
          <br>
          <b>GOT THE IDEA FROM A SPARK</b><br>
          “I have hitched my wires to the tail of the universe you might
          say”, he said. Hubbard has a high school education. His father
          is an electrical engineer, he said, and the family formerly
          lived in Spokane. It was while he was in charge of the air
          compressor at the Hercules mine near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho,
          that he first became interested in the problem. “I watched a
          great belt flit by me day after day, he related, and I noted
          thousands before me had that I could draw an electrical spark
          from the belt with my finger. I had always been interested in
          electricity and had studied a great deal from books since I
          was a small boy. The spark of the belt fascinated me. One
          night I conceived the idea that developed later into the
          generator. I will not say that it utilizes in any way the
          current derived by friction as from the belt. That is not
          accurate. I am not prepared to divulge the nature of the
          actual translation of energy. <br>
          <br>
          <b>SMALL SIZE PUZZLES</b><br>
          He also said that eight such lights had been kept burning from
          electricity furnished by the apparatus while locked into a
          safety deposit box for seventy-two hours. This is an
          unheard-of feat, according to the men of science. Hubbard was
          reticent concerning the whole matter, declining to tell more
          than a little under pressure and consenting to a demonstration
          only after much persuasion. Electrical engineers who were not
          privileged to witness the demonstration last night ventured
          theories at the operation. They said that while there were
          theories that the apparatus seemed to coincide with, if
          Hubbard has what he says that he has, he has accomplished what
          most hard-nosed savants have believed impossible. Most of the
          engineers inquired as to the possibility of hidden springs
          driving a small dynamo, but most of them abandoned this when
          they learned that approximately 85V had been delivered by the
          machine under test conditions for almost one hour. Other
          believed that a varying of a powerful magnetic field by a
          paraffin or fiber disc might produce this effect but admitted
          this highly improbable. They doubted that so great a pressure
          could be obtained from a contrivance of so small a size.<br>

          SEATTLE, Wash. – Experiments even more baffling than those
          witnessed by local electrical experts recently when Alfred M.
          Hubbard, 19-year old inventor, demonstrated his atmospheric
          power generator, were shown later when the young man threw the
          switch into place on a twenty-five horse power electric motor
          and instantly the motor jumped to life , developing its full
          capacity of power. Skeptics present said the motor was
          connected by unseen wires. Hubbard hoisted his motor with a
          block and tackle and allowed those present to make
          examinations and tests to assure themselves that no wires
          extended from the motor. The result of the demonstration was
          an even greater mystery regarding the young man’s discovery,
          if it is one. Hubbard went even further. He told how the motor
          was made to operate, took it apart and showed those present
          just what it consisted of. He would not tell, however, how he
          had arranged the parts to change the polarity at the rate of
          120 times per second, which he says is the secret of his
          invention.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>ORDINARY MOTOR USED</b><b><br>
          </b>The motor was an ordinary alternating current motor of
          twenty-five horse power, equipped with the usual armatures and
          fields. Hubbard’s change on the motor was to insert six rods
          of manganese steel wrapped with wire in the head of each of
          the two armatures and a change in the wrapping of the two
          fields. This is the same principal upon which he says his
          small model works. In the center of the inserted wrapped rods
          Hubbard places a steel core which, when first put in place, is
          then magnetized. These rods and the steel core make up the
          physical construction of the power unit. Hubbard says the
          secret of his discovery lies in the wrapping of the coils.
          Last July 4th, Hubbard says he had a boat equipped with a
          similar twenty-five horse power motor. With this power it was
          much faster than a gasoline engine boat. He entered races at
          Union City on Hood’s canal. He won by a big margin. His
          success attracted the attention of many boat owners who were
          curious as to the engine that drove his craft. Hubbard told
          them freely he says, of his discovery and inventions, knowing
          the secret could not be read from an exhibition of the motor.
          Hubbard says his backers became alarmed at his free-handed
          manner of displaying his invention and insisted that he
          dismantle the boat. <br>
          <br>
          <b>NEW MODEL PROMISED</b><br>
          Hubbard is loath to give a public demonstration, as many here
          want him to do, until he has completed his patents, he says.
          He will, however, show his new model on its completion within
          the next two weeks. Hubbard’s mail since his announcement of
          the invention has contained several bona-fide offers from
          large corporations in the east now using gasoline motors, to
          adopt his device if it proves satisfactory. Hubbard smiles at
          these letters and replies courteously and remarks to his
          friends that the day is not far distant when the writers will
          be forced by competition to adopt his device. <br>
          <br>
          Hubbard’s smiles are not saved alone for enterprising
          corporation representative’s letters. He smiles at the experts
          and university professors when they accuse his of having a
          battery somewhere in the device. Hubbard’s mail also contains
          letters from women, accompanied by photographs, offering
          proposals of marriage. Several attorneys have written offering
          legal advice. One letter offers the theory that Hubbard’s
          device is operate by personal magnetism. <br>
          <br>
          While engineers have not yet given Hubbard’s device their
          endorsement, scientific circles here have been aroused to a
          discussion of age-old master problems of science. Theories
          unnumbered are offered to account for the performance of
          Hubbard’s device, but Hubbard persists that he has told and
          shown all there is to tell and see about. Within the next two
          months, Hubbard says, he will fit one of his discoveries to an
          automobile. He says the device will continue in operation
          until shut-off by a switch, or if left running continuously,
          until the metal it is composed off disintegrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          was a well-known local capitalist, the inventor's
          father,William H. Hubbard, and a Post Intelligencer reporter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The boat traveled at a speed of
          between eight and ten knots--silently, except for the whirring
          of a chain belt which connected the motor with the propeller
          shaft.&nbsp; When the chain belt was removed, the motor ran
          free at a speed estimated at 3,500 revolutions [the rest of
          this line is unreadable] </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>No Hidden Wires Found</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To guard against the possibility of
          ordinary storage batteries concealed about the boat as a power
          source, instead of the Hubbard coil, both electric motor and
          coil were lifted free from their blocks, but no hidden wiring
          was revealed.&nbsp; The coil used as a power unit was eleven
          inches in diameter and fourteen inches in length.&nbsp;
          According to Hubbard, tests of the coil show a&nbsp; current
          of 280 amperes and 125 volts, which, he pointed out was
          equivalent to approximately forty-five horse power, or
          sufficient to drive an automobile.&nbsp; The current is
          pulsating. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The electric motor was
          approximately twelve inches in diameter eighteen inches in
          length.&nbsp; It had been reconstructed in order to be used
          with the Hubbard coil. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After his ride in the strange
          powered craft the capitalist declared that he was frankly
          puzzled, but that he desired an electrical engineer in his
          employ to make an examination of the coil before he felt free
          to discuss it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Since last December, when the
          Post-Intelligencer first made public the claims of the
          youthful inventor, he has been more or less in retirement,
          perfecting his coil.&nbsp; He took up his residence in Everett
          where, with the assistance of Everett backers he worked on his
          device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A local capitalist agreed to
          witness a demonstration of the coil to determine its
          practicability as a power source.&nbsp; The motorboat was
          fitted with blocks on which to rest the motor and the
          propeller shaft geared for a chained belt. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the motor was first tried out
          after its installation in the boat it ran backwards.&nbsp; So
          involved are the connections between the motor and the coil
          that fully a half-hour's experimentation was necessary before
          the motor shaft revolved in the right direction. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">That the capitalist was frankly
          skeptical of the device was plain when he,with two other
          passengers, boarded the boat at the Seattle Yacht Club
          wharf.&nbsp; All the machinery that was visible was the coil
          and the motor, the latter plainly geared to the propeller
          shaft.&nbsp; The boat shoved off, Hubbard threw the switch,
          and instantly the boat began to pick up speed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It circled about the bay and
          returned to the wharf, with never a slackening of speed. The
          wires connecting coil and motor had begun to heat under the
          excessive current, and, fearing that some part of the coil
          might give way under the extra heavy strain put on it, Hubbard
          declined to permit the motor to be run continuously for any
          length of time. It was tried out later several times, after
          brief periods which allowed the wires to cool, and its power
          apparently showed no diminution.&nbsp; No instruments were
          used to test its wattage. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The capitalist admitted that the
          demonstration intrigued his interest, but that he would wait
          for his expert's opinion before discussing it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Following the demonstration, the
          young inventor declared that within a few days he expected to
          drive an automobile with the coil as a power unit. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Coil used yesterday had been
          built especially for the demonstration, and is nearly twice
          the size of the coil Hubbard used in his demonstration last
          winter.&nbsp; The large coil cost approximately $90 to
          construct.&nbsp; The inventor says that so far as he has been
          able to learn its life as a power unit is indefinite.&nbsp; He
          declared that a coil large enough to drive an airplane would
          be no more than three times the size of the coil used
          yesterday, and that a machine thus equipped could fly around
          the world without stopping, so far as the power supply is
          concerned. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While the device has been patented,
          the claims for it are so broad that Hubbard says he does not
          feel safe in making public his secret.&nbsp; In general, he
          says, it is made up of a group of eight electro-magnets, each
          with primary and secondary windings of copper wire, which are
          arranged around a large steel core.&nbsp; The core likewise
          has a single winding.&nbsp; A coil thus constructed, he says,
          is lifeless until given an initial impulse.&nbsp; This is done
          by connecting the ends of its windings for a fraction of a
          second to an ordinary[two words unreadable R.L.R.] -ing
          circuit, he says. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The manner of this momentary
          charging, however, constitutes the principal secret of the
          device, according to the inventor, who says that while
          machinists have built a number of coils for him under his
          direction, they have been unable to "start" them.&nbsp; In the
          event the power of the coil should diminish, it can be
          rejuvenated in less than a second, Hubbard says. </p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Alfred M. Hubbard, the youthful
          stormy petrel of the Seattle branch of the federal prohibition
          office, may possibly be the discoverer of at least the basic
          principle behind the [Hendershot] "fuelless motor" which was
          demonstrated for the first time in Detroit last week, and
          which is attracting the attention of such aeronautical experts
          as Col. Charles A. Lindbergh and Maj. Thomas G. Lanphier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This was claimed by Hubbard himself
          yesterday. While he said that he has been able to learn none
          of the details in connection with the Detroit demonstration,
          he declared that he was inclined to suspect very strongly that
          the motor was simply a development of the apparatus which e
          himself demonstrated in Seattle as early as 1919. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Driven By Radium</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1919 Hubbard represented the
          apparatus as being capable of extracting electrical energy
          directly from the air, but he admitted yesterday that this had
          been merely a subterfuge to protect his patent rights, and
          that, as a matter of fact, it had been a device for extracting
          electrical energy from radium, by means of a series of
          transformers which stepped up the rays. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He declined to go into detail in
          regard to the exact manner in which he managed to extract
          power from radium -- but said that, so far as he had been able
          to determine, there was no great difference between the
          Detroit machine and his. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I never heard of this Lester J.
          Hendershot, the Pittsburgh electrical engineer who is
          demonstrating the motor", Hubbard said, "but it must be
          remembered that I worked on the invention for two years in
          Pittsburgh -- in 1921 and 1922. It was a Dr. Greenslade who
          represented the people who were financing me at the time --
          but, of course, if the people who bought out most of my
          interest in the invention were to bring it out as their own
          machinery, they would probably do it through a man with whom I
          had never worked. I was employed by the radium Chemical
          Company at the time I was working in Pitsburgh". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Sold Interest</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While Hubbard declined to disclose
          the exact amount that he had received for his invention, he
          made it clear that he had sold out a 75% interest in what may
          prove to be the greatest scientific revelation of the ages for
          little more than a mess of potage. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"When I made my discovery", he
          said, "I was only 16 years old and, until that time, I’d never
          even had an ice cream soda. So you can imagine that a couple
          of thousand dollars looked mighty big to me. I never hesitated
          for an instant when the people who were financing me insisted
          on taking a [missing text] kept demanding more and more of my
          rights. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Just Quit Cold</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"But, at last, along in 1922, I
          suddenly came to the realization that if I acceded to their
          latest demand I’d have only 20% interest left, so I just quit
          them cold". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard asserted that he has no
          intention of bringing any legal action against Hendershot or
          his associates for the present, at least. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"If he really is using my idea",
          Hubbard said, "and if it proves practical, it’s so big that
          25% -- or 2% -- will bring in more money than I can ever
          possibly use. So I am not worried ... [missing text] when he
          went to work for the Pittsburgh people. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard went into retirement along
          with his motor for some time, but he made a dramatic return to
          Seattle and public attention a few years ago, when he was
          indicted for liquor conspiracy with Roy Olmstead, then
          acclaimed as the bootleg king of the Northwest. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard was duly arrested but, on
          the eve of his trial, the indictment against him was dismissed
          and it later came out that, while associated with Olmstead, he
          had turned government informer. Some time after this he came
          out in the open as a frankly avowed prohibition agent.<br>

                Notes on the Hubbard Coil by George Van Tassel</font></b>
          </p>
          <p>College of Universal Wisdom (Yucca Flats, CA) ~
            Unidentified article</p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1952, in a paper entitled "The
          World of the Secret Forces", a group of Austrian scientists
          disclosed the segmented energy pattern of the surface of the
          Earth. Their research was carried on at 48° N Latitude. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The segmented checkerboard pattern
          of positive and negative squares on the surface of the Earth,
          at the magnetic equator, was about 32 meters on each side and
          becomes zero at both magnetic poles. At the 48° N Latitude the
          squares were 15.9 meters. They also discovered that the Cheops
          Pyramid in Egypt is about 30° N Latitude and the diagonal of
          the pyramid magnetic field was circa 30 meters. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is amazing that they discovered
          each of the squares had positive and negative poles in their
          centers, and that these poles conform to "Hubbard's Energy
          Generator" in 1919, Cater's Energy Generator in 1971, and the
          Chinese "Cosmic Flower", the source of all energy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The poles in these checkerboard
          squares are 2.45 meters diameter in the center pole and the
          eight surrounding poles are 60 cm diameter at 48° N Latitude.
          We are convinced that Hubbard tapped the energy from these
          Earth surface poles in Seattle, Washington in 1919. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Alfred M. Hubbard was front page
          news on December 17, 1919, in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
          newspaper. Hubbard was only 19 years old when he powered an
          18-foot boat around Portage Bay with a 35-horsepower electric
          motor hooked to his energy generator, which was only 11 inches
          in diameter and 14 inches long. There were no batteries in the
          boat and the boat ran for hours beyond the life of batteries.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard's generator was a central
          coil wound on a tube, with eight coils around it, wound on
          iron cores. Here is real power without smog, or fumes and at
          no cost to operate. This explains why the "authorities"
          stepped in and stopped the experiments as in other cases
          through the years. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A Finnish citizen, who worked with
          Hubbard, gave some additional data to Art Aho, and we have the
          original tubes that were part of Hubbard's equipment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard ran wires North, South East
          and West, 1200 feet in each direction from his coil generator
          in the center. These wires passed over 18 of the Earth's
          square poles in each direction and ended connected to a steel
          tube with some mercury in it, in the center of the 19th pole
          in each direction. The alternate polarity, from each pole
          crossed, perpendicular to the wire created a wave pattern from
          one end of the wire to the center coil assembly creating a
          pulse of electrical energy. This fixed generator transmitted a
          resonant energy to the generator in the boat. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Can you picture these "no
          maintenance, no cost" devices, set up around cities, supplying
          power to the present circuits, with no radiation from
          reactors, no smoke from steam-plant generators, and no danger
          from dams that break and change the ecology around rivers.
          This is the power principle hidden by "authority" since 1919
          that has made the cost of electricity what it is now, from
          expensive maintenance-hungry sources. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We hope we can set up a separate
          research on this principle when we finish the "Integratron". </p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Recently I spent an evening with a
          scientist close to atomic energy developments, and to be
          perfectly frank I guided the conversation to the subject of
          changing radioactive ways directly into useable electrical
          energy. I was told it has not been done. That atomic
          scientists have tried every thing they can think of to
          accomplish this neat little trick, but so far have failed.
          Many an atomic researcher has believed such an arrangement
          possible, but the right combination has not been found. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I mentioned that I had heard of a
          young man named Albert Hubbard who in 1919 was credited with
          having accomplished something approaching this. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">My atomic scientist acquaintance
          was immediately interested. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The conversation changed from me
          asking all the questions to him asking most of them. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What will become of it? Who knows!
          Ever since mankind invented the wheel he has been searching
          for a means to keep his wheel turning - indefinitely and at
          small costs "perpetual motion machines are seldom invented
          these days". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Perpetual motion seemingly has
          become the impossible. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A few men have- or think they have
          seen the way to untapped power sources. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Alfred Hubbard seems to be on of
          these, around him and his device as around other such men and
          devices a mystery has been spun. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I choose to call the Hubbard device
          a transformer because it appears to transform and turn one
          sort of energy into another. The apparatus is now more than 35
          years old . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Alfred M. Hubbard is still alive.
          He is a man in his late 50's.He does not live in this country.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He continues to be secretive about
          his efforts, but it is known that he is still interested in
          atomic energy materials. There are many rumors afloat. Alfred
          M. Hubbard was a Seattle, Washington boy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He was only sixteen when he began
          work on his device and only nineteen when he perfected it to a
          demonstrable machine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard's announcement of his
          transformer set Seattle a buzzing. On Wednesday December 17
          1919 the <i>Post Intelligencer</i> carried a first page
          spread entitled&nbsp; "Hubbards New Energy Device No Fake"
          says Seattle college man. That college man was Rev. Father
          William E. Smith professor of physics at Seattle College, a
          Catholic institution. Professor Smith was quoted as stating he
          had examined the Hubbard Device carefully and&nbsp; had tested
          it as fully as his means would allow. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Father Smith said, "I
          unhesitatingly say that Hubbards Invention is destined to take
          the place of existing power generators and that within a few
          years it will have advanced the whole theory and practice of
          electricity beyond the dreams of present day scientists." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But it hasn't! Why hasn't it?
          Atomic energy recently has become the power of electricity,
          but it is used to heat water, to make stream, which turns a
          turbine, which turns a most conventional generator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This is a long way from converting
          atomic energy or radioactive energy directly into electricity
          as the Hubbard Device was reported to do. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are rumours that there are
          several other devices similar to Hubbard's. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Rumour says that devices reached a
          most interesting point of development and the "Authorities"
          stepped in and stopped the experiments and in some cases
          confiscated the apparatus. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This under the guise of "improper
          and dangerous use of atomic energy ". Dangerous to whom? </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Electricity as we know is generally
          is derived from two accepted means </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By cutting the lines of magnetic
          force set up in coils of wire carrying an electric current to
          produce strong magnetic fields. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By reactive chemical means which
          requires chemicals to be burned reacted upon and destroyed and
          thus frequently replaced as in wet and dry batteries. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Recently another device has been
          developed which will manufacturer electricity directly from
          sunlight. As yet this device has a small output and is no
          threat to present generators. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard's transformer uses none of
          these. It appears not to be within the laws of conservation of
          energy. At first Hubbard claimed he was getting his energy
          from out of the air. Father Smith soon put an end to that. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He did agree however the inventor
          had stumbled upon something new. The word stumbled which seems
          to disregard Hubbard's three years of work. Professor Smith
          declined to reveal anything regarding the construction of the
          device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He did say its energy output was a
          steady and that it produced an alternating current. It's
          frequency or charge was not mentioned. It's voltage and amp
          limits were not given. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Photographs published in the <i>Intelligence</i>
          indicated that the apparatus or at lest one of them operated a
          light bulb of about 900 watts capacity. The picture shows this
          lamp brightly aglow. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The lamp was atop a small device of
          which could have been held in two hands. In this case the
          cycle would be relatively unimportant but the voltage would be
          have to be within rather close limits. The amperage required
          could be slight. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Father Smith said, " I hardly think
          this apparatus will operate indefinitely though I could not
          place a maximum length of operation at this time." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He said he believed the apparatus
          constructed " would continue to function for an unheard of
          period and he was of the opinion it could be easily
          rejuvenated after a long use." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Professor Smith also said he did
          not think that there was any limit to the size such a device
          might be built nor a limit to its output capacities. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One of the interesting experiments
          made with the Hubbard transformer was the propelling of a 18
          feet boat around the Portage Bay near Seattle. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A 35 horse power electric motor was
          hooked up to a Hubbard transformer measuring maybe 12- 14
          inches in diameter and 14 inches in length. It furnished
          enough energy to drive the boat and a pilot at a good clip
          around the bay. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The demonstration lasted several
          hours and created a sensation. The test required enough
          current for a long enough time to rule out any sort of
          battery, being housed in the device. Even a battery of such
          strength and durability would certainly be something new. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">From this test we may make some
          surmises. The cycle was probably 50 or 60 cycles per second. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are 25 cycle motors but they
          are a few and probably the boats motor was not rewound to take
          either higher or lower frequency commercial electricity in US
          is 60 cycles. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The voltage could be 440 or 220
          volts, probably 220 volts. It seems unlikely a 35 horsepower
          motor would have as a low voltage of 110 volts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is possible of course or it
          could have been rewound for a higher voltage 600 volts or
          1,000 volts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Ampere or quality of current would
          have to be considerably less at higher voltage input greater
          at a lower voltage input. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If the horsepower was to be
          maintained anywhere near that recorded. Thus we can suppose
          the Hubbard Transformer was no baby. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Soon after the demonstration,
          Hubbard's name dropped from the Seattle paper and he went to
          work for the Radium Chemical Company of Pittsburgh -- now of
          New York. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But on Monday, February 27, 1928
          Hubbard and his transformer again made Seattle's <i>Post
            Intelligencer</i> headline. This time in connection with the
          "Fuelless Motor" designed and built by Lester J. Hendershot,
          then of Selfridge Field Detriot. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In an interview with R.B. Berman at
          this time, Hubbard revealed for the first time that his
          transformer was powered with radioactive substances. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard admitted he had used the
          idea of power from the air to protect his real idea for patent
          and that this machine created electrical energy directly from
          rays of force or particles emitted from radioactive materials.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He did not name the materials. They
          remain a secret today. According to Hubbard's statement in the
          newspaper he sold a 50% interest in his device to the Radium
          Chemical Company and went to Pittsburgh to continue developing
          the device for them. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard related that the company
          had demanded more and more equity in the machine until finally
          he retained only a 25% interest. Evidently pressure was bought
          upon him to sign over an additional 5%. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This Hubbard refused to do, and in
          1922 he severed connection with Radium Chemical Company and
          returned to Seattle. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At the present time Hubbard is not
          inclined to discuss his employment period with the Radium
          Chemical Company nor will he discuss this device or his
          experiences with it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">My first letter to the Radium
          Chemical Company was not answered. A second letter a few
          months later brought a reply from Mr. Grange Taylor, vice
          president of the concern. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He stated that none of the
          employees presently with the company and also with it in the
          early 1920's could remember anything about the device or about
          Hubbard himself. Mr. Taylor letter said "there is no
          information available on the device you mention." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A poor description of the device
          may be better than none at all. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Around a hollow centred probably a
          non-magnetic tube insulated copper wire is wrapped. The size
          of the wire and the number of turns are not known. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This winding could correspond to
          the primary of a transformer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the hollow of this tube are a
          series of small diameter preferably magnetic iron rods. The
          radioactive materials are packed snugly about these rods to
          form a compact mass. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">These bars do not touch one
          another. If they are magnetic their poles might be all alike
          or they may be alternated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Circulating the central tube and
          its appendages are eight coils of wire wound upon what appears
          to be eight cores of magnetic upon iron. These eight coils
          stand parallel to the central tube. Their outer windings
          appear to be connected in series and probably form something
          corresponding to the secondary of the transformer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As there seems to be more windings
          on this secondary than the primary one would suspect following
          ordinary electrical practice. That the transformer was a step
          up variety rather than a step down. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">That is the secondary voltage would
          be higher than its primary voltage and consequently its
          amperage would be less. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Four leads out wires are showing.
          How they are connected together -- if they are remains a
          secret. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Around the outside of the windings
          appears to be a wrapping of some dense material, probably
          meant to shield or turn aside the rays from the radio active
          materials within. Such a shield would be necessary so to
          protect those working with the apparatus. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">All of this is set between the roll
          ends that make the device look like a giant spool. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are no moving parts. The
          machine operates silently. The radioactive materials probably
          would have to be replaced from time to time. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Whether the coils have to be
          excited once before the device will operate, I don't know. It
          may be they have to excite each time the machine is started to
          establish the directional flow of the current. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If Father Smith made any records of
          his findings in connection with Hubbard's transformer, they
          are not available at present. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Recent inquiry at the college
          disclosed that Professor Smith has passed away and the college
          library contains no notes covering this matter. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As far as can be determined no US
          patents ever were issued to Hubbard's covering the device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Radium Chemical Company list of
          patents is long but no title in their list appears to cover
          such an apparatus as Hubbard's. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Either the device was not developed
          to a point where a patent could be obtained or because of
          seeming friction which developed between the company and
          Hubbard it was impossible for either to obtain a patent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It was possible that patents exist
          in other countries. </p>

          <p><b>Alfred M. Hubbard</b> <br>
            Assignor to Radium Spark Plug Corporation</p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">My invention relates to the art of
          spark plugs. More particularly, my invention relates to a
          spark plug the terminals of which, that are disposed within
          the cylinder of an internal combustion engine, are provided
          with radium for ionizing the space between said terminals. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While I will describe my invention
          as applied to spark plugs for use in internal combustion
          engines, nevertheless, it is to be expressly understood that
          my invention is not to be construed as limited to such
          specific application, but is applicable to all uses where like
          conditions and like problems obtain. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Spark plugs, as heretofore designed
          for use in automobiles, are provided with a gap between the
          terminals of approximately one-thirty-second of an inch
          (1/32"). The aim of automobile engineers is to provide as
          great a gap as possible, in order to provide as prolonged an
          exposure of the fuel to the ignition spark as possible.
          However, the length of this exposure to the ignition means is
          definitely limited by the factors obtaining in the timing
          mechanism. If too large an amperage is employed, the breaker
          points in the timing mechanism are burned off. Therefore, it
          has been found that a compromise in the time during which the
          fuel may be exposed to the ignition spark and the ability of
          said breaker points to support the current is necessary, and,
          as a result, the gap between the terminals of the ordinary
          spark plug, as used in automobile engines, has been
          established as about 1-32nd of an inch. A primary object of my
          invention is to extend the period of exposure of the fuel to
          the ignition spark, and at the same time take into due
          consideration the weakness or limitations imposed by the
          breaker points of the timing mechanism. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A further difficulty that obtains
          in the ignition of fuel in internal combustion engines, by
          means of spark plugs of present practice design, resides in
          the fact that while under compression the spaced relation is
          limited to about 1-32nd of an inch., the same spark would jump
          a gap of some ten times the said space when exposed to
          pressures no greater than atmospheric pressure. In other
          words, it seems that subjecting the fuel gases to compression,
          as obtains in the ordinary internal combustion engine as used
          in automobiles, greatly reduces the space that may be provided
          between the terminals. That is, in the ordinary internal
          combustion engine, the necessity of compressing the fuel gases
          militates against providing the best condition for providing
          the ignition spark with spark plugs of ordinary practice
          design; that is, the said compression militates against
          providing a spark which will ignite any other than the more
          volatile parts of the fuel. A primary object of my invention
          is to provide a spark plug which overcomes this objection. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A further primary object of my
          invention is to provide a spark plug which will reduce the
          period of combustion of the fuel charge of the internal
          combustion engine, by providing an ignition means of a higher
          degree of heat. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The above-mentioned general objects
          of my invention, together with others inherent in the same,
          are attained by the device illustrated in the following
          drawings, the same being merely preferred exemplary forms of
          embodiment of my invention, throughout which drawings lie
          reference numerals indicate like parts: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figure 1 is a preferred form, in
          side elevation, of a spark plug embodying my invention, having
          its terminals provided with radioactive matters; </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p><img src="0usp1.gif" width="155" height="328"><img
              src="0usp2.gif" width="148" height="331"><img

              src="0usp4.gif" width="184" height="147"></p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figure 2 is a view of such a spark
          plug, having the radioactive matter disposed in a pocket
          within the end portion of the terminals; </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figure 3 is a fragmentary view of
          such a spark plug having the radioactive matter applied to the
          end portions of the terminals; and </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figure 4 is a view of still another
          modified form embodying my invention, where the spark plug has
          but one terminal and the engine piston constitutes the other
          terminal for the ignition means. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In constructing a spark plug
          embodying my invention, preferably one or both of the
          terminals 5 and 6 are provided with radioactive matter 7 such
          as, for example, radium zinc sulphite. Preferably, one
          terminal 5, which is the positive terminal, is provided with
          said radioactive matter. These terminals, it will be noted,
          are in spaced relation, -- the space 8 is provided between the
          same. The dotted lone 9 indicates the relative position of the
          terminal of the present practice design of spark plug for use
          in automobile internal combustion engines. The radioactive
          matter is disposed throughout the material constituting the
          terminal in the preferred form shown in Figure 1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The providing of such a terminal
          may be accomplished by heating the material constituting the
          said terminal to a very high degree of temperature in an
          electric furnace, and then when the molecules of said terminal
          material are in expanded form, the same may be dipped in
          radioactive matter, thereby impregnating the terminal
          substance with the radioactive matter. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Figure 2, the terminal may be
          provided with pocket 10, and this pocket supplied with
          radioactive matter. Then the said pocket may be closed by
          suitable plugging material 11. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the modified form shown in
          Figure 3, the radioactive matter is applied to the end
          portions of the terminal by coating the same with material
          containing radioactive matter 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the modified form shown in
          Figure 3, the radioactive matter is applied to the end
          portions of the terminal by coating the same with material
          containing radioactive matter 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the modified form shown in
          Figure 4, a spark plug having but one terminal 12, which is
          the positive terminal, may be provided with radioactive
          matter, and the piston 13 itself in cylinder 14 may be
          employed to constitute the negative terminal. The use of the
          piston for such a purpose is rendered possible owing to the
          fact that the space between the terminals may be greatly
          increased as compared to the present practice design of spark
          plug, so that the spark may be caused to pass from the
          terminal 12 to the piston 13, when the said piston is at its
          topmost position, or as it approaches its topmost position. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The mode of operation of a spark
          plug embodying my invention is as follows. The radioactive
          matter provided on one or both of the terminals of the spark
          plug facilitates the current passing between said terminals by
          ionizing the space therebetween. Hence, instead of the short
          interval of 1/32" which normally obtains between the terminals
          of spark plugs used in automobile internal combustion engines,
          I provide a much greater space. Said space may be 1/4" or
          more. My experiments and use of the spark plug so constructed
          have proven that the spark thus provided is of much greater
          degree of brightness, and is characterized by a much greater
          degree of heat. Thus, I provide for a much longer exposure of
          the fuel to the ignition spark, so that parts of said fuel,
          which are of less volatility that others, may be ignited by
          the spark, owing to its high degree of heat, as well as the
          heat developed by the burning of the more volatile parts of
          the fuel charge. This results in providing for a more complete
          combustion of the fuel in a much briefer period of time than
          has heretofore been possible, and also the more nearly
          complete elimination of all the unburnt fuel left in the
          cylinder. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By providing for the more complete
          combustion, I also provide for the reduction of carbon, which
          results from imperfect combustion, and which is very
          objectionable in that it dilutes the lubricating qualities of
          the oil in the crank casing. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, a distinct advantage
          is noted in that a leaner fuel mixture may be employed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To secure the same amount of power
          due to the more complete combustion provided by my invention.
          In other words, an advantage results by reason of my invention
          in the economizing of fuel. My experiments have shown that an
          engine, which may be very slow to start with spark plugs as
          heretofore designed, operates forthwith when provided with
          spark plugs embodying my invention, i.e., it is not necessary
          to "heat up" before the engine is able to move the car. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The same principles hereinabove set
          forth, as respects the spark plug embodying my invention,
          applies to the other modified forms illustrated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The modified form shown in Figure 4
          manifestly overcomes any difficulty of the carbon collecting
          between the terminals, not only by the elimination of one of
          the terminals in the form of a small terminal wire, but the
          comlpeteness of the combustion reduces the amount of carbon
          which is developed. The necessity of providing a carefully
          adjusted space interval is not requisite when the said
          interval is ionized, and, therefore, the care and attention
          now required to maintain said space is eliminated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Obviously, changes may be made in
          the forms, dimensions, an arrangement of the parts of my
          invention, without departing from the principle thereof, the
          above setting forth only preferred forms of embodiment. </p>

          <p align="center"><a name="who"></a><b><font size="+1">Who Was
                Alfred M. Hubbard?</font></b> <br>
            by <b>Todd Fahey</b></p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Before Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
          Hearts Club Band...before Timothy Leary...before Ken Kesey's
          band of Merry Pranksters and their Electric Kool-Aid Acid
          Tests...before the dawn of the Grateful Dead, there was Alfred
          M. Hubbard: the Original Captain Trips. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">You will not read about him in the
          history books. He left no diary, nor chatty relatives to
          memorialize him in print. And if a cadre of associates had not
          recently agreed to open its files, Captain Alfred M. Hubbard
          might exist in death as he did in life--a man of mirrors and
          shadows, revealing himself to even his closest friends only on
          a need-to-know basis. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">They called him "the Johnny
          Appleseed of LSD." He was to the psychedelic movement nothing
          less than the membrane through which all passed to enter into
          the Mysteries. Beverly Hills psychiatrist Oscar Janiger once
          said of Hubbard, "We waited for him like a little old lady for
          the Sears-Roebuck catalog." Waited for him to unlock his
          ever-present leather satchel loaded with pharmaceutically-pure
          psilocybin, mescaline or his personal favorite, Sandoz LSD-25.
          Those who will talk about Al Hubbard are few. Oscar Janiger
          told this writer that "nothing of substance has been written
          about Al Hubbard, and probably nothing ever should." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He is treated like a demigod by
          some, as a lunatic uncle by others. But nobody is ambivalent
          about the Captain: He was as brilliant as the noonday sun,
          mysterious as the rarest virus, and friendly like a golden
          retriever. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The first visage of Hubbard was
          beheld by Dr. Humphry Osmond, now senior psychiatrist at
          Alabama's Bryce Hospital. He and Dr. John Smythies were
          researching the correlation between schizophrenia and the
          hallucinogens mescaline and adrenochrome at Weyburn Hospital
          in Saskatchewan, Canada, when an A.M. Hubbard requested the
          pleasure of Osmond's company for lunch at the swank Vancouver
          Yacht Club. Dr. Osmond later recalled, "It was a very
          dignified place, and I was rather awed by it. [Hubbard] was a
          powerfully-built man...with a broad face and a firm hand-grip.
          He was also very genial, an excellent host." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Captain Hubbard was interested in
          obtaining some mescaline, and, as it was still legal, Dr.
          Osmond supplied him with some. "He was interested in all sorts
          of odd things," Osmond laughs. Among Hubbard's passions was
          motion. His identity as "captain" came from his master of sea
          vessels certification and a stint in the US Merchant Marine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At the time of their meeting in
          1953, Al Hubbard owned secluded Daymen Island off the coast of
          Vancouver--a former Indian colony surrounded by a huge wall of
          oyster shells. To access his 24-acre estate, Hubbard built a
          hangar for his aircraft and a slip for his yacht from a fallen
          redwood. But it was the inner voyage that drove the Captain
          until his death in 1982. Fueled by psychedelics, he set sail
          and rode the great wave as a neuronaut, with only the white
          noise in his ears and a fever in his brain. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His head shorn to a crew and
          wearing a paramilitary uniform with a holstered long-barrel
          Colt .45, Captain Al Hubbard showed up one day in '63 on the
          doorstep of a young Harvard psychologist named Timothy Leary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"He blew in with that
          uniform...laying down the most incredible atmosphere of
          mystery and flamboyance, and really impressive bullshit!"
          Leary recalls. "He was pissed off. His Rolls Royce had broken
          down on the freeway, so he went to a pay phone and called the
          company in London. That's what kind of guy he was. He started
          name-dropping like you wouldn't believe...claimed he was
          friends with the Pope." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Did Leary believe him? </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Well, yeah, no question." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The captain had come bearing gifts
          of LSD, which he wanted to swap for psilocybin, the synthetic
          magic mushroom produced by Switzerland's Sandoz Laboratories.
          "The thing that impressed me," Leary remembers, "is on one
          hand he looked like a carpetbagger con man, and on the other
          he had these most-impressive people in the world on his lap,
          basically backing him." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Among Hubbard's heavyweight
          cheerleaders was Aldous Huxley, author of the sardonic novel
          Brave New World. Huxley had been turned on to mescaline by
          Osmond in '53, an experience that spawned the seminal
          psychedelic handbook The Doors of Perception. Huxley became an
          unabashed sponsor for the chemicals then known as
          "psychotomimetic"--literally, "madness mimicking." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But neither Huxley nor Hubbard nor
          Osmond experienced madness, and Dr. Osmond wrote a rhyme to
          Huxley one day in the early 1950s, coining a new word for the
          English language, and a credo for the next generation: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To fathom hell or soar angelic,
          just take a pinch of psychedelic <br>
          Those who knew Al Hubbard would describe him as just a
          "barefoot boy from Kentucky," who never got past third grade.
          But as a young man, the shoeless hillbilly was purportedly
          visited by a pair of angels, who told him to build something.
          He had absolutely no training, "but he had these visions, and
          he learned to trust them early on," says Willis Harman,
          director of the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Sausalito, CA.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1919, guided by other-worldly
          forces, Hubbard invented the Hubbard Energy Transformer, a
          radioactive battery that could not be explained by the
          technology of the day. The Seattle Post- Intelligencer
          reported that Hubbard's invention, hidden in an 11" x 14" box,
          had powered a ferry-sized vessel around Seattle's Portico Bay
          nonstop for three days. Fifty percent rights to the patent
          were eventually bought by the Radium Corporation of Pittsburgh
          for $75,000, and nothing more was heard of the Hubbard Energy
          Transformer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard stifled his talents briefly
          as an engineer in the early 1920s, but an unquenchable streak
          of mischief burned in the boy inventor. Vancouver magazine's
          Ben Metcalfe reports that Hubbard soon took a job as a Seattle
          taxi driver during Prohibition. With a sophisticated
          ship-to-shore communications system hidden in the trunk of his
          cab, Hubbard helped rum-runners to successfully ferry booze
          past the US and Canadian Coast Guards. He was, however, caught
          by the FBI and went to prison for 18 months. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After his release, Hubbard's
          natural talent for electronic communications attracted scouts
          from Allen Dulles's Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Also
          according to Metcalfe, Hubbard was at least peripherally
          involved in the Manhattan Project. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The captain was pardoned of any and
          all wrongdoing by Harry S. Truman under Presidential Pardon
          #2676, and subsequently became agent Captain Al Hubbard of the
          OSS. As a maritime specialist, Hubbard was enjoined to ship
          heavy armaments from San Diego to Canada at night, without
          lights, in the waning hours of World War II--an operations of
          dubious legality, which had him facing a Congressional
          investigation. To escape federal indictment, Hubbard moved to
          Vancouver and became a Canadian citizen. Parlaying connections
          and cash, Hubbard founded Marine Manufacturing, a Vancouver
          charter-boat concern, and in his early 40s realized his
          lifelong ambition of becoming a millionaire. By 1950 he was
          scientific director of the Uranium Corporation of Vancouver,
          owned his own fleet of aircraft, a 100-foot yacht, and a
          Canadian island. And he was miserable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Al was desperately searching for
          meaning in his life," says Willis Harman. Seeking
          enlightenment, Hubbard returned to an area near Spokane, WA,
          where he'd spent summers during his youth. He hiked into the
          woods and an angel purportedly appeared to him in a clearing.
          "She told Al that something tremendously important to the
          future of mankind would be coming soon, and that he could play
          a role in it if he wanted to," says Harman. "But he hadn't the
          faintest clue what he was supposed to be looking for." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1951, reading a scientific
          journal, Hubbard stumbled across an article about the behavior
          of rats given LSD. "He knew that was it," says Harman. Hubbard
          went and found the person conduction the experiment, and came
          back with some LSD for himself. After his very first acid
          experience, he became a True Believer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Hubbard discovered psychedelics as
          a boon and a sacrament," recalls Leary. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A 1968 resume states that Hubbard
          was at various times employed by the Canadian Special
          Services, the US Justice Department and, ironically, what is
          now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Whether he
          was part of the CIA mind-control project known as MK-ULTRA,
          might never be known: all paperwork generated in connection
          with that diabolical experiment was destroyed in '73 by
          MK-ULTRA chief Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, on orders from then-CIA
          Director Richard Helms, citing a "paper crisis." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Under the auspices of MK-ULTRA the
          CIA regularly dosed its agents and associates with powerful
          hallucinogens as a preemptive measure against the Soviets' own
          alleged chemical technology, often with disastrous results.
          The secret project would see at least two deaths: tennis pro
          Harold Blauer died after a massive injection of MDA; and the
          army's own Frank Olson, a biological-warfare specialist,
          crashed through a closed window in the 12th floor of New
          York's Statler Hotel, after drinking cognac laced with LSD
          during a CIA symposium. Dr. Osmond doubts that Hubbard would
          have been associated with such a project "not particularly on
          humanitarian grounds, but on the grounds that it was bad
          technique." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But Hubbard's secret connections
          did allow him to expose over 6,000 people to LSD before it was
          effectively banned in '66. He shared the sacrament with a
          prominent Monsignor of the Catholic Church in North America,
          explored the roots of alcoholism with AA founder Bill Wilson,
          and stormed the pearly gates with Aldus Huxley (in a session
          that resulted in the psychedelic tome Heaven and Hell). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Laura Huxley met Captain Hubbard
          for the first time at her and her husband's Hollywood Hills
          home in the early 1960s. "He showed up for lunch one
          afternoon, and he brought with him a portable tank filled with
          a gas of some kind. He offered some to us," she recalls, "but
          we said we didn't care for any, so he put it down and we all
          had lunch. He went into the bathroom with the tank after
          lunch, and breathed into it for about ten seconds. It must
          have been very concentrated, because he came out revitalized
          and very jubilant, talking about a vision he had seen of the
          Virgin Mary." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I was convinced that he was the
          man to bring LSD to planet Earth," remarks, Myron Stolaroff,
          who was assistant to the president of long-range planning at
          Ampex Corporation when he met the captain. Stolaroff learned
          of Hubbard through philosopher Gerald Heard, a friend and
          spiritual mentor to Huxley. "Gerald had reached tremendous
          levels of contemplative prayer, and I didn't know what in the
          world he was doing fooling around with drugs." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Heard had written a letter to
          Stolaroff, describing the beauty of his psychedelic experience
          with Al Hubbard. "That letter would be priceless -- but
          Hubbard, I'm sure, arranged to have it stolen.... He was a
          sonofabitch: God and the Devil, both there in full force." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Stolaroff was so moved by Heard's
          letter that, in '56, he agreed to take LSD with Hubbard in
          Vancouver. "After that first LSD experience, I said 'this is
          the greatest discovery man has ever made.'" </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He was not alone. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Through his interest in aircraft,
          Hubbard had become friends with a prominent Canadian
          businessman. The businessman eventually found himself taking
          LSD with Hubbard and, after coming down, told Hubbard never to
          worry about money again: He had seen the future, and Al
          Hubbard was its Acid Messiah. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard abandoned his uranium
          empire and, for the next decade, traveled the globe as a
          psychedelic missionary. "Al's dream was to open up a worldwide
          chain of clinics as training grounds for other LSD
          researchers," says Stolaroff. His first pilgrimage was to
          Switzerland, home of Sandoz Laboratories, producers of both
          Delysid (trade name for LSD) and psilocybin. He procured a
          gram of LSD (roughly 10,000 doses) and set up shop in a
          safe-deposit vault in the Zurich airport's duty-free section.
          From there he was able to ship quantities of his booty without
          a tariff to a waiting world. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Swiss officials quickly detained
          Hubbard for violating the nation's drug laws, which provided
          no exemption from the duty-free provision. Myron Stolaroff
          petitioned Washington for the Captain's release, but the State
          Department wanted nothing to do with Al Hubbard. Oddly, when a
          hearing was held, blue-suited officials from the department
          were in attendance. The Swiss tribunal declared Hubbard's
          passport invalid for five years, and he was deported.
          Undeterred, Hubbard traveled to Czechoslovakia, where he had
          another gram of LSD put into tablet form by Chemapol -- a
          division of the pharmaceutical giant Spofa--and then flew
          west. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Procuring a Ph.D. in biopsychology
          from a less-than-esteemed academic outlet called Taylor
          University, the captain became Dr. Alfred M. Hubbard, clinical
          therapist. In '57, he met Ross MacLean, medical superintendent
          of the Hollywood Hospital in New Westminster, Canada. MacLean
          was so impressed with Hubbard's knowledge of the human
          condition that he devoted an entire wing of the hospital to
          the study of psychedelic therapy for chronic alcoholics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to Metcalfe, MacLean was
          also attracted to the fact that Hubbard was Canada's sole
          licensed importer of Sandoz LSD. "I remember seeing Al on the
          phone in his living room one day. He was elated because the
          FDA had just given him IND#1," says one Hubbard confidante
          upon condition of anonymity. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His Investigational New Drug permit
          also allowed Hubbard to experiment with LSD in the USA. For
          the next few years, Hubbard -- together with Canadian
          psychiatrist Abram Hoffer and Dr. Humphry Osmond -- pioneered
          a psychedelic regimen with a recovery rate of between 60% and
          70% -- far above that of AA or Schick Hospital's so-called
          "aversion therapy." Hubbard would lift mentally-disturbed
          lifelong alcoholics out of psychosis with a mammoth dose of
          liquid LSD, letting them view their destructive habits from a
          completely new vantage point. "As a therapist, he was one of
          the best," says Stolaroff, who worked with Hubbard until 1965
          at the International Federation for Advanced Study in Menlo
          Park, California, which he founded after leaving Ampex. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Whereas many LSD practitioners were
          content to strap their patients onto a 3' x 6' cot and have
          them attempt to perform a battery of mathematical formulae
          with a head full of LSD, Hubbard believed in a comfortable
          couch and throw pillows. He also employed icons and symbols to
          send the experience into a variety of different directions:
          someone uptight may be asked to look at a photo of a glacier,
          which would soon melt into blissful relaxation; a person
          seeking the spiritual would be directed to a picture of Jesus,
          and enter into a one-on-one relationship with the Savior. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But Hubbard's days at Hollywood
          Hospital ended in 1957, not long after they had begun, after a
          philosophical dispute with Ross MacLean. The suave hospital
          administrator was getting fat from the $1,000/dose fees
          charged to Hollywood's elite patients, who included members of
          the Canadian Parliament and the American film community.
          Hubbard, who believed in freely distributing LSD for the world
          good, felt pressured by MacLean to share in the profits, and
          ultimately resigned rather than accept an honorarium for his
          services. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His departure came as the Canadian
          Medical Association was becoming increasingly suspicious of
          Hollywood Hospital in the wake of publicity surrounding
          MK-ULTRA. The Canadian Citizen's Commission on Human Rights
          had already discovered one Dr. Harold Abramson, a CIA contract
          psychiatrist, on the board of MacLean's International
          Association for Psychedelic Therapy, and external pressure was
          weighing on MacLean to release Al Hubbard, the former OSS
          officer with suspected CIA links. Compounding Hubbard's plight
          was the death of his Canadian benefactor, leaving Hubbard with
          neither an income nor the financial cushion upon which he had
          become dependent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His services were eventually
          recruited by Willis Harman, then-Director of the Educational
          Policy Research Center within the Stanford Research Institute
          (SRI) of Stanford University. Harman employed Hubbard as a
          security guard for SRI, "although," Harman admits, "Al never
          did anything resembling security work." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard was specifically assigned
          to the Alternative Futures Project, which performed
          future-oriented strategic planning for corporations and
          government agencies. Harman and Hubbard shared a goal "to
          provide the [LSD] experience to political and intellectual
          leaders around the world." Harman acknowledges that "Al's job
          was to run the special [LSD] sessions for us." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to Dr. Abram Hoffer, "Al
          had a grandiose idea that if he could give the psychedelic
          experience to the major executives of the Fortune 500
          companies, he would change the whole of society." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard's tenure at SRI was uneasy.
          The political bent of the Stanford think-tank was decidedly
          left-wing, clashing sharply with Hubbard's own
          world-perspective. "Al was really an arch-conservative," says
          the confidential source. "He really didn't like what the
          hippies were doing with LSD, and he held Timothy Leary in
          great contempt." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Humphry Osmond recalls a particular
          psilocybin session in which "Al got greatly preoccupied with
          the idea that he ought to shoot Timothy, and when I began to
          reason with him that this would be a very bad idea...I became
          much concerned that he might shoot me..." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"To Al," says Myron Stolaroff, "LSD
          enabled man to see his true self, his true nature and the true
          order of things." But, to Hubbard, the true order of things
          had little to do with the antics of the American Left. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Recognizing its potential psychic
          hazards, Hubbard believed that LSD should be administered and
          monitored by trained professionals. He claimed that he had
          stockpiled more LSD than anyone on the planet besides
          Sandoz--including the US government--and he clearly wanted a
          firm hand in influencing the way it was used. However, Hubbard
          refused all opportunities to become the LSD Philosopher-King.
          Whereas Leary would naturally gravitate toward any microphone
          available, Hubbard preferred the role of the silent curandero,
          providing the means for the experience, and letting voyagers
          decipher its meaning for themselves. When cornered by a video
          camera shortly before this death, and asked to say something
          to the future, Hubbard replied simply, "You're the future." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In March of 1966, the cold winds of
          Congress blew out all hope for Al Hubbard's enlightened Mother
          Earth. Facing a storm of protest brought on by Leary's
          reckless antics and the "LSD-related suicide" of Diane
          Linkletter, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Drug
          Abuse Control Amendment, which declared lysergic acid
          diethylamide a Schedule I substance; simple possession was
          deemed a felony, punishable by 15 years in prison. According
          to Humphry Osmond, Hubbard lobbied Vice-President Hubert
          Humphrey, who reportedly took the cause of LSD into the Senate
          chambers, and emerged un-victorious. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"[The government] had a deep fear
          of having their picture of reality challenged," mourns Harman.
          "It had nothing to do with people harming their lives with
          chemicals--because if you took all the people who had ever had
          any harmful effects from psychedelics, it's minuscule compared
          to those associated with alcohol and tobacco." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FDA chief James L. Goddard ordered
          agents to seize all remaining psychedelics not accounted for
          by Sandoz. "It was scary," recalls Dr. Oscar Janiger, whose
          Beverly Hills office was raided and years' worth of clinical
          research confiscated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hubbard begged Abram Hoffer to let
          him hide his supply in Hoffer's Canadian Psychiatric Facility.
          But the doctor refused, and its believed that Hubbard sent
          most of his LSD back to Switzerland, rather than risk
          prosecution. When the panic subsided, only five
          government-approved scientists were allowed to continue LSD
          research--none using humans, and none of them associated with
          Al Hubbard. In 1968, his finances in ruins, Hubbard was forced
          to sell his private island sanctuary for what one close friend
          termed "a pittance." He filled a number of boats with the
          antiquated electronics used in his eccentric nuclear
          experiments, and left Daymen Island for California. Hubbard's
          efforts in his last decade were effectively wasted, according
          to most of his friends. Lack of both finances and government
          permit to resume research crippled all remaining projects he
          may have had in the hopper. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After SRI canceled his contract in
          1974 Hubbard went into semiretirement, splitting his time
          between a 5-acre ranch in Vancouver and an apartment in Menlo
          Park. But in 1978, battling an enlarged heart and never far
          away from a bottle of pure oxygen, Hubbard make one last run
          at the FDA. He applied for an IND to use LSD-25 on terminal
          cancer patients, furnishing the FDA with two decades of
          clinical documentation. The FDA set the application aside,
          pending the addition to Hubbard's team of a medical doctor, a
          supervised medical regimen, and an AMA-accredited hospital.
          Hubbard secured the help of Oscar Janiger, but the two could
          not agree on methodology, and Janiger bowed out, leaving Al
          Hubbard, in his late 70s, without the strength to carry on
          alone. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Says Willis Harman: "He knew that
          his work was done." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Captain lived out his last days
          nearly broke, having exhausted his resources trying to harness
          a dream. Like the final fleeting hour of an acid trip --- when
          the edge softens and a man realizes that he will not solve the
          secrets of the Universe, despite what the mind had said
          earlier --- Hubbard smiled gracefully, laid down his
          six-shooter, and retired to a mobile home in Casa Grande,
          Arizona. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">On August 31, 1982, at the age of
          81, Al Hubbard was called home, having ridden the dream like a
          rodeo cowboy. On very quiet nights, with the right kind of
          ears, you can hear him giving God hell. </p>
