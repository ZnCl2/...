          <p>Abstract --- Water is recovered from air by a process
            utilizing the differences in the day-time and night
            temperatures of such air. The process is especially useful
            in subtropical desert areas. It consists in alternately
            removing the moisture from the cool night air by adsorption
            on suitable adsorbing agents and especially on silica gel
            and by utilizing the hot day-time air and, if desired and
            available, the radiation energy of the sun for desorption of
            the water stored in the adsorbing agent and for condensing
            the desorbed water by means of the cold stored during the
            night. An especially suitable silica gel is used for
            adsorption of the water contained in the air. The energy
            required for operating the plant is produced by passing the
            recovered water through energy producing installations such
            as turbines before it is used as drinking water or for
            irrigation. The process is very economical and, in contrast

                such as residential dwellings. More particularly, the
                heating and cooling system includes one or more conduits
                disposed approximately six (6) feet underground and
                having opposite end extremities communicatively
                connected to the structure so as to define a closed air
                circulation system through the structure and one or more
                conduits. A fan assembly including appropriate controls
                is provided to induce and circulate air through the
                structure and through the one or more conduits such that
                a system of air may be continuously circulated from the
                structure through the underground disposed conduits and
                back through the structure. When the temperature of
                ambient air is significantly greater than or less than
                the temperature of the earth or ground around the
                conduits, a temperature gradient is established and the
                earth around and in the vicinity of the conduits becomes
                a medium of heat exchange relative to air passing
                through the one or more conduits. Thus, depending on the
                ambient air temperature, the system of the present
                invention will either heat or cool the structure. In a
                preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is

          <p>Abstract --- An atmospheric water harvester extracts water
            from high relative humidity air. The temperature of the
            surface of a condensation member is lowered in the presence
            of moist air to promote condensation of water vapor on its
            surface, and the water so obtained by condensation is
            collected. The atmospheric water harvester includes a
            photovoltaic member that generates electricity to power the
            refrigeration of the condensation member. At least as much
            electrical power is produced as is used to condense the
            water vapor so that no additional sources of electrical
            power are required. Each atmospheric water harvester (or
            array of harvesters) is rapidly installed and then operated
            in an unattended state for considerable periods of time.
            Arrays of autonomous atmospheric water harvesters can be
            installed as free-standing units or as roofs on either new
            or existing buildings. </p>

            of a discharge line (536) the liquid water is filtered
            through an activated-carbon porous VOC filter-absorber (532)
            and treated in a UV treatment zone (534) where it is
            continually exposed to radiation of sufficient energy and
            appropriate wavelength to kill adventitious bacteria and
            viruses. If there is insufficient liquid water in the
            combined condensate collection and storage vessel (522) then
            municipal water (564) can be introduced to an external
            appliance or dispenser through the temporarily deactivated
            pump (530), the activated-carbon porous VOC filter-absorber
            (532) and the UV treatment zone (534). A check valve (566)
            prevents the municipal water (564) from entering the
            condensate collection and storage vessel. </p>

          <p>Abstract --- An apparatus for obtaining service water or
            drinking water from the air moisture in the vicinity of a
            body of water, in particular in the vicinity of the sea, has
            a U-shaped condenser which dips into the body of water
            during operation. Above the body of water, said condenser is
            provided with a supply line, having an inlet opening, and a
            discharge line having an outlet opening. In this
            arrangement, the outlet opening is situated at a higher
            level than the inlet opening and, between the condenser and
            the outlet opening, there is arranged a vertical
            discharge-line portion which is sheathed by a layer which
            absorbs solar radiation. During operation, the vertical
            discharge-line portion is heated up by solar radiation, with
            the result that a convection current is obtained and air,
            containing water vapour, from the surroundings is sucked
            through the condenser. The water vapour is then liquefied in
            the condenser and pumped upwards by means of a pump. </p>

          <p>Abstract --- A Gust Water Trap Apparatus comprises means
            (9, 42, 52) for receiving air from ambient wind and means
            for feeding the received air into a compression chamber (46,
            56). Restriction means (21, 41) leads from the compression
            chamber into a condensation chamber (18). The apparatus
            leads to an increase in the pressure of air from wind gusts
            so that the air loses energy and is cooled further in the
            condensation chamber so as to deposit liquid water in the
            condensation chamber. </p>
