            Captures Heat From a Candle</b></big><br>

      The Kandle Heeter Candle Holder is an attractive ceramic radiator
      suspended above a candle flame on a solid steel frame. The
      radiator collects and concentrates the heat from the candle flame
      and then gently radiates the heat into your room. It conserves
      energy and saves money.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HEAT FROM A CANDLE? YES! YES! YES!</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      The Kandle Heeter(tm) Candle Holder is an attractive ceramic
      radiator suspended above a candle flame on a solid steel frame.
      And it really works! The steel and ceramic radiator collects and
      concentrates the heat from the candle flame, becomes hot (but not
      burning), and gently radiates the heat from the candle into your
      room. (Add essential oil to the top plate for aromatherapy.)<br>
      <br>
      Invented and manufactured in Fortuna, California from solid steel
      and ceramic components the candle heater is just over 9 inches
      tall and just under 7 inches wide and deep. It weighs over four
      pounds and ships in a 200 lb test cardboard box.<br>
      <br>
      The steel and ceramic radiator is comprised of three nested
      ceramic modulators held together and separated by a solid steel
      inner core. The steel inner core is positioned directly above the
      candle and is driven to very high temperatures by the flame. It
      gets very, very hot!<br>
      <br>
      The nested ceramic modulators transfer and moderate the high
      temperature of the inner core, one to another, until the outer
      ceramic modulator becomes a gently radiating thermal body that
      releases the concentrated heat from the candle into your home or
      office. If you burn candles, it only makes environmental and
      economical practical sense to capture the heat that is normally
      lost to the ceiling and use this heat in your own environment. (A
      typical 4.5 oz. jar candle contains over 1,000 Btu's!)<br>
      <br>
      "The Kandle Heeter(tm) Candle Holder makes a real difference in a
      small room or bedroom," says inventor Doyle Doss. "And if there is
      a temporary power outage you will be able to create a warm room
      for your family and friends." Light and warmth (both from the same
      source!) makes an encouraging difference while you wait for the
      storm to pass.<br>
      <br>
      Jim Osborn (Eureka, Ca.) purchased a candle heater for his wife.
      "It actually takes the chill off in a room. It's amazing," Jim has
      commented, with just a slight hint of incredulity. "The surface of
      the radiator can get as warm as an old fashioned steam radiator,"
      says Mr. Doss, It is very surprising how much heat is actually in
      a candle, and if you have a recreational vehicle or camping
      trailer the candle heater can help you conserve propane while you
      are enjoying the Great Outdoors.<br>
      <br>
      "We specialize in energy and environment invention," says Mr. Doss
      of his company, DOSS Products. "We want to help America stay
      warmer in winter by making practical use of wasted and overlooked
      heat sources." Additional information and photographs are

        <b>CANDLE FIREPLACE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A system, apparatus, and method for heating air with a space
      heater is presented. The space heater includes a space heater
      cabinet and a plurality of candles. The space heater cabinet is
      more than three times as wide as it is tall. The space heater
      cabinet has a top wall and a bottom wall. The space heater cabinet
      houses a heating unit, an intake vent, and an exhaust vent. The
      heating unit can heat air within the space heater cabinet. The
      intake vent allows air to enter the cabinet and the exhaust vent
      allows warmed air to exit the cabinet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>[0001] 1. Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The current invention relates generally to apparatus,
      systems and methods for heating air. More particularly, the
      apparatus systems and methods relate to heating air with a space
      heater. Specifically, the apparatus, systems and methods provide
      for heating a space with a space heater that is attractive and
      that appears as if the space is being heated with candles and that
      is still relatively portable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] 2. Background Information</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Space heaters can be used to heat one area of a building or
      a home without requiring the central heating system to heat the
      entire home or building to a high temperature. This can reduce the
      overall heating cost because one room or a couple of rooms may be
      heated by space heaters to 70 degrees Fahrenheit while the rest of
      the building may be heated to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Space heaters
      are also popular because they are portable, are generally
      inexpensive, and can be moved from room-to-room. Even though space
      heaters are useful, they do have certain drawbacks and can cause
      problems. For example, the grill at the rear of the space heater
      may become clogged with dust and the space heater may overheat or
      may catch fire. Even though some space heaters have anti-tipping
      devices that turn off the space heater if it is tipped over, some
      space heaters may tip over and overheat and still start a fire.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Space heaters are generally a rectangular-shaped box made
      out of plastic or metal. The box generally houses electrical coils
      that are heated with electricity to warm air passing through the
      coils. A fan is generally used to push more air through the coils
      to create a flow of warm air. Knobs on the exterior of the box are
      used to control the space heater to adjust temperature and to turn
      the space heater on and off. Other space heaters may have electric
      or automatic controls to automatically turn on and off the space
      heater at desired times. Even though current space heaters have
      desirable and undesirable characteristics, a better space heater
      is desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present invention provides a system, apparatus, and
      method for heating air. In one embodiment for heating air, an
      apparatus includes a space heater. The space heater includes a
      space heater cabinet and a plurality of candles. The space heater
      cabinet is more than three times as wide as it is tall. The space
      heater cabinet has a top wall and a bottom wall. The space heater
      cabinet houses a heating unit, an intake vent, and an exhaust
      vent. The heating unit can heat air within the space heater
      cabinet. The intake vent allows air to enter the cabinet and the
      exhaust vent allows warmed air to exit the cabinet. The space
      heater can include glass plates extending vertically between the
      candles and outside edges of the top wall of the cabinet.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The top wall of the cabinet can be formed with various
      pieces of wood. For example, wood edge pieces can be used to form
      a generally rectangular perimeter of the top wall and these pieces
      may be mitered or curved to create attractive edges on the top
      wall or top surface of the portable space heater. The top
      perimeter pieces of wood can form an interior area which can be
      filled with a center piece of wood. The center piece of wood can
      be formed with elongated notches along its perimeter. The plates
      of glass can be fitted between the elongated notches and the
      perimeter pieces of wood. A supporting piece of wood can be
      located beneath the edge pieces of wood and the center piece of
      wood. The support piece of wood will prevent the glass plates from
      sliding beneath the edge pieces of wood and the center piece of
      wood.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The space heater may include other useful features and
      contain other components. For example, the space heater can
      include a chassis that supports a heating unit or heating coils, a
      fan, and a motor to turn the fan. The fan can be used to force air
      through the heating coils and to blow warm air out of the portable
      heater. Standard alternating current or batteries may be used to
      power the candles and alternating current may be used to supply
      power to the heating coils. A control unit can be built into one
      of the sides of the space heater cabinet for controlling the space
      heater. Alternatively, a remote control can be used to control the
      space heater and to operate the electric candles. The glass plates
      may be clear glass plates between 1/8thand 3/16thof an inch in
      thickness. An exhaust manifold may transport air from the heating
      unit to exhaust vents. The exhaust manifold may be an elongated
      trapezoidal shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The preferred embodiment may be configured as a method
      which includes placing a space heater in a first location. The
      space heater has a cabinet housing that is at least three times as
      wide as it is tall. The method lights candles located on top of
      the space heater. The method includes turning on the space heater
      so that it heats air at the first location and then later turning
      off the space heater. The space heater is then relocated to a
      second location and the space heater is turned on at the second
      location so that air is heated at the second location. The space
      heater can be turned on or off with a remote control or through a
      control panel located on the space heater.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a decorative space heater 1 that
      includes a base unit 2, five candle units 3, and six glass plates
      4. FIG. 3 illustrates an example remote control 40 that can be
      used to control the space heater 1. FIG. 4 illustrates a bottom of
      a candle 3 used in a space heater 1. FIGS. 5, 6, 7, and 8
      illustrate the front, top, bottom and back views of the space
      heater 1, respectively. As discussed further below, the base unit
      2 of the space heater 1 includes a heating assembly 6 that blows
      warm air from the base unit 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The candles 3 on top of the base 2 provide for a space
      heater 1 that is more attractive than a traditional space heater.
      As a best seen in FIG. 4, the candles 3 can be formed with plastic
      internal cores 52 and with a wax 50 exterior. The candles 3 in the
      preferred embodiment are light yellow paraffin wax pillar candles
      3. The candles 3 may have a battery compartment 54 to supply
      battery power to lights 60 that resemble natural candlelight. The
      battery compartment 54 includes a door 55 to hold a battery in the
      battery compartment 54. A switch 58 is used to turn on/off the
      candle 3 when the candle 3 is powered by the battery compartment
      54. In the preferred embodiment, the lights 3 can be switch
      between battery power and alternating current that is provided
      through an electrical cord 38 that supplies the current to
      electrical pins 47 protruding from the base unit 2. The candles 3
      include electrical sockets 56 that can be mounted to the
      electrical pins 47 to supply alternating current to the candle
      lights 60. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that
      more than five candles 3 may be used or that less than five
      candles 3 may be used. Additionally, the candles 3 may be
      different shapes and different sizes than what is shown in the
      figures, and the candles 3 may be different colors than light
      yellow. In the preferred embodiment, the candles 3 are about 31/2
      inches in diameter and about 5 inches tall. In the preferred
      embodiment, the candle units 3 contain lights and the lights in
      the candles 3 are configured to appear as if the candle 3 is
      burning with a wick. Electrical circuits can be used to make it
      appear as if the candles 3 are flickering randomly to appear more
      like a real candle.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] To create a more realistic image that candles 3 are
      creating heat, the candles 3 are surrounded by plates of glass 4.
      The plates of glass form a chamber 45 around the candles 3. The
      plates of glass 4 are mounted vertically on a top surface 46 of
      the base unit 2. As discussed further below, the plates of glass 4
      are mounted between a center member 7 and top edge members 8 of
      the base unit 2. The glass plates 4 are generally clear glass
      plates 4 that are between 1/8thof an inch and 3/16thof an inch
      thick. In the preferred embodiment, the glass plates 4 are
      approximately 10 inches wide and approximately 6 inches tall. One
      of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that more or less
      than six glass plates 4 may be used in the space heater 1. For
      example, one, three, or more glass plates 4 may be used on the
      front of the space heater 1 or the back of the space heater 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The base unit 2 contains several components that can be
      best seen in the exploded views of FIGS. 2A and 2B. In general,
      the base unit 2 is rectangular-shaped with a front 10, a left end
      11, a right end 12, and back 13. The base unit 2 is formed with
      several wooden components that form a chamber to hold the heating
      assembly 5. The wood portions of the base unit 2 include the
      center member 7, the top edge members 8, a wood support 14, a
      right side panel assembly 15 and a left side panel assembly 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] An upper portion of the base unit 2 is formed by the center
      member 7, the top edge members 8, and the wood support 14. The
      center member 7 may be formed out of a sheet of wood so that it
      has elongated notches 9 on the perimeter edges of the center
      member 7. The top edge members 8 are formed with a left portion
      20, a right portion 21, a front portion 22, and a back portion 23.
      These portions form a rectangular shape with a chamber 24. In the
      preferred embodiment, these portions are formed out of wood and
      the outside edges of these portions may be routered to form a
      decorated curved edge. The center member 7 is placed into the
      chamber 24 of the top edge members 8 and the wood support 14 is
      located under the center member 7 and the top edge member 8 to
      prevent the glass panels 4 from falling below the wood support 14.
      The glass plates 4 are positioned in the notches 9 between the
      center member 7 and the top edge members 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Both the left and right side panel assemblies 16 and 15 are
      formed with a front wall 17, a rear wall 18, and a side wall 19.
      In the preferred embodiment, these walls are formed out of wood
      and are connected together with screws, nails, or other fasteners.
      The right and left side panel assemblies 15 and 16 form bases upon
      which the upper assembly 25 can be rested on and be mounted to.
      The upper assembly 25 may be attached to the right and left side
      panel assemblies 14 and 15 with screws, nails, or other fasteners.
      The upper assembly 25 and the right and left side panel assemblies
      15 and 16 form an internal base unit chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A heating unit chassis 27 is located within the internal
      base unit chamber of the base unit 2. The heating unit chassis 27
      can be bolted with one or more bolts to the right and left side
      panel assemblies 15 and 16. Of course, the chassis 27 can be
      connected to the base unit 2 by other fasteners as understood by
      those of ordinary skill in the art. The heating unit chassis 27
      supports the heating assembly 5. Heating assembly 5 includes a
      motor 29, a blower assembly 30, an electrical box 63 and a duct
      assembly 31. The motor 29 is configured to turn a fan within the
      blower assembly 30 to blow heated air from the heating assembly 5
      through the duct assembly 31 and out a front side of the space
      heater 1. Electrical heating coils 65 within the blower assembly
      30 are configured to heat air within the blower assembly 30. The
      duct assembly 31 is generally an elongated trapezoidal shape that
      may have a tapered opening that increases from the blower assembly
      30 toward the front side of the base unit 2. The duct assembly 31
      is generally trapezoidal-shaped with four sides. The electrical
      box 63 may contain electrical components used to control the
      heating assembly 5. A bottom cover 28 may be attached to the
      bottom of the base unit 2 to protect the heating assembly 5 and to
      prevent excess dust from entering the heating assembly 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A rear intake grill 32 and a front exhaust grill 33 are
      attached to the heating unit chassis 27 for safety reasons and to
      improve the overall appearance of the space heater 1. The front
      exhaust grilled 33 can be a snap in type of grill so that
      different types of grills can be installed in the space heater 1.
      Both grills 32 and 33 are generally rectangular-shaped with
      elongated horizontal openings for the intake and expelling of
      heated air. The front grill 33 may contain arrays of vents 36 with
      horizontal and/or vertical bars. The front grill 33 can be formed
      of a polished metal such as brass, or can be composed of plastic
      or any another suitable material and finished with a paint or
      other material so that it appears to be formed of a polished metal
      such as brass to increase the attractiveness of space heater 1.
      The exhaust vent grill 33 may include a decorative emblem. The
      decorative emblem can be included to make the space heater 1 more
      attractive so that it does not look like a traditional space
      heater.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In the preferred embodiment, a control panel 34 is attached
      to one of the right or left side panel assemblies 15 or 16. The
      control panel 36 may include one or more buttons 35. The preferred
      embodiment of the space heater 1 also includes a remote control 40
      with one or more buttons 42. Both the remote control 40 and the
      control panel 34 are configured to respond to user inputs to turn
      off and turn on the space heater 1 or to adjust how warm the space
      heater 1 is to heat air passing through the space heater 1. In one
      configuration of the preferred embodiment, the control panel 34 is
      configured to operate based upon a timer configured to turn on the
      space heater at certain times and to turn off the space heater at
      specified times.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Space heater 1 can provide additional advantageous features
      and components. For example, the space heater can have rubber feet
      37 positioned beneath the base unit 2 so that the space heater
      does not scratch a surface the space heater 1 is sitting on.
      Additionally, the space heater may have an electrical cord 38 of
      sufficient length so that as the space heater is moved to
      different locations at different times, the electrical cord 38 may
      easily be plugged into an ordinary electrical outlet.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In the preferred embodiment, the base unit 2 of the space
      heater 1 has a front width of approximately 22.5 inches and a side
      width of about 8.5 inches. These dimensions allow the space heater
      1 to sit upon a shelf or a fireplace without taking up a lot of
      room. Because the space heater 1 has candle units 3 and a
      wood-finished cabinet base 2, the space heater 1 may be placed on
      a shelf or another elevated location within a room so that it
      appears as part of the room and not as a traditional metallic
      block-like space heater that is generally placed on the floor.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Having described the components and the assembly of the
      decorative space heater 1, we will now discuss the use and
      operation of the space heater 1. As discussed earlier in the
      preferred embodiment, the space heater 1 has relatively small
      dimensions. This allows an ordinary person to pick up and relocate
      the space heater 1 to a different location without difficulty.
      Also, the candles 3 and the general shape of the space heater 1
      create the appearance that the space heater 1 is part of the room
      or the environment where the space heater 1 is located as opposed
      to a traditional space heater that does not appear to be part of
      the room.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A user can use either the control panel 34 or the remote
      control 40 to turn on and turn off the space heater 1. The user
      can also increase or decrease the temperature the space heater 1
      is heating air to through the control panel 34 and/or the remote
      control 40. In one configuration of the preferred embodiment, the
      user can set a timer in the control panel 34 or via the remote
      control 40 to turn off and turn on the space heater 1 at certain
      times. In another configuration of the preferred embodiment, a
      user can remove the candle units 3 and replace them with different
      candle units 3 or candle units 3 of a different color to
      periodically change the appearance of the space heater 1. Also,
      the electric lights in the candle units 3 can be turned on and
      turned off with the control panel 34 or remote control 40. As
      shown in FIG. 9, the candles 3 can be moved in the direction of
      arrows A and B two pivot the candles 3 about the connection pins
      47 to alter the appearance of the space heater 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Example methods may be better appreciated with reference to
      flow diagrams. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation,
      the illustrated methodologies are shown and described as a series
      of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not
      limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in
      different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from that
      shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated
      blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Blocks
      may be combined or separated into multiple components.
      Furthermore, additional and/or alternative methodologies can
      employ additional, not illustrated blocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 9 illustrates a method of using a space heater where
      the space heater is housed in a cabinet housing that is at least
      three times as wide as it is tall. For example, the front of the
      housing cabinet can be about 221/2 inches wide and about 4 inches
      tall. The method 900 begins by placing space heater at a first
      location, at 902. Next, candles located on top of the space heater
      are lit, at 904. The candles can be standard 110 Voltage or
      battery operated and can be turned on with a remote control. Next,
      the space heater is turned, at 906, on so that it heats air at the
      first location. Electric coils in the space heater can be heated
      by electricity so that as air is forced through the coils the air
      is heated.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The space heater is turned off, at 908. The space heater is
      then relocated to a second location that is different than the
      first location, at 910. Even though the space heater is about
      three times as wide as it is tall, the space heater is still small
      enough to be portable and relocated to different locations. The
      space heater is again turned on at 912, so that it heats air in
      the second location.<br>

          <b>Heater fashioned from a rock</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method of fashioning a heater from a rock. A first step involves
      providing a rock having an exterior surface. A second step
      involves cutting the rock into at least two segments that are
      capable of being reassembled to reform the rock and maintained in
      the reassembled condition by force of gravity. A third step
      involves forming a interior cavity in at least one of the
      segments. The cavity is spaced inwardly from the exterior surface
      of the rock and is adapted to conceal a heat source, such as a
      candle, when the segments are reassembled. A fourth step involves
      reassembling the segments to reform the rock.<br>
