      </div>
      <i> </i><br>
      RIVERSIDE, Calif. — Technology that hampers mosquitoes’
      host-seeking behavior, identified at the University of California,
      Riverside in 2011, has led to the development of the world’s first
      product that blocks mosquitoes’ ability to efficiently detect
      carbon dioxide, their primary method of tracking human blood
      meals.<br>
      <br>
      The initial research was performed in the laboratory of
      Anandasankar Ray, an associate professor of entomology, and was
      featured on the cover of the journal Nature.&nbsp; Ray’s lab
      identified volatile odor molecules that can impair, if not
      completely disrupt, mosquitoes’ carbon dioxide detection
      machinery.<br>
      <br>
      The intellectual property was licensed to Olfactor Laboratories
      Inc., a company that grew around the technology, expanded the
      research, filed additional patents, and developed related
      technologies that led to the mosquito-warding product.<br>
      <br>
      Called the Kite Mosquito Patch, the product marks a significant
      advancement in the global fight against mosquito-borne diseases
      such as malaria, West Nile virus and dengue fever.&nbsp; The patch
      delivers mosquito-repelling compounds in a simple, affordable and
      scalable sticker that can be used by individuals in regions
      impacted by malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.<br>
      <br>
      “UCR is committed to strengthening and expanding its ties with
      industry partners,” said Michael Pazzani, the vice chancellor for
      research and economic development.&nbsp; “Olfactor Laboratories
      Inc. is a great example of how UCR innovations result in new
      industries, which, in turn, lead to the development of products
      impacting the lives of people around the globe.”<br>
      <br>
      Simple and affordable, Kite is a colorful sticker, small enough to
      be worn virtually without notice.&nbsp; It disburses the non-toxic
      compounds that provide individuals with up to 48 hours of
      protection from mosquitoes. Estimated to cost a fraction of
      existing repellents, Kite is applied to clothing and can be used
      by people of all ages, including infants and pregnant mothers.<br>
      <br>
      “I am very excited to see how Olfactor Labs has rapidly taken our
      initial discovery to a product that can have great value in the
      war against mosquitoes and disease,” Ray said. “I am most
      impressed that they have designed something affordable and
      convenient for use in Africa and around the world. I am rooting
      for this to become a game changer in lowering instance of malaria,
      dengue, filariasis and other dangerous diseases.”<br>
      <br>
      Kite’s technology is the culmination of years of development work
      on a class of odor molecules, all of which are non-toxic compounds
      approved for human consumption by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration.<br>
      <br>
      “The Kite Mosquito Patch isn’t just another mosquito product, but
      a powerful alternative to most products on the market, enabling
      people to live normal lives with a new level of protection against
      contracting mosquito-borne diseases,” said Michelle Brown, the
      chief scientist and vice president of Olfactor Laboratories, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      Initial funding for the technology came to Ray’s lab from the Bill
      and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Institutes of
      Health.&nbsp; Olfactor Laboratories Inc. has funding from the
      National Institute of Health, agreements with the Walter Reed Army
      Institute for Research and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
      test a range of technologies developed at the company relating to
      mosquito and other vector insects.&nbsp; The Kite Mosquito Patch
      is one of a number of new products with the ‘Kite’ product family,
      all of which use non-toxic compounds to repel, kill or lure vector
      insects.<br>
      <br>
      “Kite will provide a new level of protection to, for example,
      children in Uganda, for the elderly in Mali, and hikers in Seattle
      or Sarasota seeking a safer, socially responsible solution,” said
      Grey Frandsen, project lead and chief marketing officer at
      Innovation Economy Crowd (ieCrowd), a crowd-powered platform aimed
      at transforming innovations into solutions. Olfactor Laboratories
      Inc. is an ieCrowd company.<br>
      <br>
      The first Kite Mosquito Patches will be tested in districts of
      Uganda hardest hit by malaria. In 2010 an estimated 219 million
      cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 660,000 people died, 91
      percent in the African Region.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      Development of a novel class of spatial, non-insecticidal insect
      repellents that manipulates the primary mechanism used in
      host-seeking is underway at Olfactor Laboratories, Inc. (OLI), an
      ieCrowd Company. Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, which
      spread malaria, dengue and filariasis, track their prey through
      carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in breath using their olfactory
      neurons (sense of smell). Researchers from the University of
      California, Riverside (UCR) demonstrated in the internationally
      renowned scientific journal Nature (2011) that the CO2 receptor in
      mosquito can be activated or inhibited by small molecules. After
      licensing this technology from UCR, OLI has generated its own
      patent-pending library of compounds that activate or inhibit the
      carbon dioxide receptor neuron. This patent-pending technology,
      which is supported by the National Institute of Health, represents
      a revolutionary paradigm shift in the war against vector insects
      and the diseases they transmit.<br>
      <br>
      With the ability to activate as well as inhibit the CO2 receptor
      with small molecules, OLI is focused on two separate applications
      to be utilized in vector control:<br>
      <br>
      1) Development of spatial, non-insecticidal repellents that will
      block the ability of the insect to sense CO2.<br>
      <br>
      2) Development of cost-effective, efficient lures that will mimic
      CO2 for use in surveillance traps.<br>
      <br>
      Due to our stringent safety profile prescreening process, OLI
      active ingredients for non-insecticidal repellents and CO2 mimics
      are approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      as flavors and fragrances. Many of these active ingredients are
      highly aromatic which will allow greater flexibility for use in
      delivery devices, making our products amenable for use throughout
      the world.<br>

      [0002] The disclosure provides compounds useful as insect
      repellents and compositions comprising such repellents. The
      disclosure further provides compounds useful as insect attractants
      and compositions comprising such attractants. The disclosure
      further provides compounds useful as insect traps.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Numerous insects are vectors for disease. Mosquitoes in the
      genus Anopheles are the principle vectors of malaria, a disease
      caused by protozoa in the genus Trypanosoma. Aedes aegypti is the
      main vector of the viruses that cause Yellow fever and Dengue.
      Other viruses, the causal agents of various types of encephalitis,
      are also carried by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. Wuchereria bancrofti
      and Brugia malayi, parasitic roundworms that cause filariasis, are
      usually spread by mosquitoes in the genera Culex, Mansonia, and
      Anopheles.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Horse flies and deer flies may transmit the bacterial
      pathogens of tularemia (Pasteurella tularensis) and anthrax
      (Bacillus anthracis), as well as a parasitic roundworm (Loa loa)
      that causes loiasis in tropical Africa.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Eye gnats in the genus Hippelates can carry the spirochaete
      pathogen that causes yaws (Treponema pertenue), and may also
      spread conjunctivitis (pinkeye). Tsetse flies in the genus
      Glossina transmit the protozoan pathogens that cause African
      sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense and T. rhodesiense). Sand
      flies in the genus Phlebotomus are vectors of a bacterium
      (Bartonella bacilliformis) that causes Carrion's disease (oroyo
      fever) in South America. In parts of Asia and North Africa, they
      spread a viral agent that causes sand fly fever (pappataci fever)
      as well as protozoan pathogens (Leishmania spp.) that cause
      Leishmaniasis.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Most blood feeding insects, including mosquitoes,
      sandflies, Testse flies, use olfactory cues to identify human
      hosts. This group of hematophagous insects can transmit a wide
      assortment of deadly human diseases that together cause more
      suffering and deaths globally than any other disease condition.
      Diseases transmitted by such insects include malaria, dengue
      fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus, filariasis, river blindness,
      epidemic polyarthritis, Leshmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, Japanese
      encephalitis, St.Louis Encephalitis amongst others.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The olfactory system can detect and discriminate amongst an
      extremely large number of volatile compounds in the environment,
      and this is critical for important behaviors like finding hosts,
      finding food, finding mates, and avoiding predators. To detect
      this wide variety of volatiles, most organisms have evolved
      extremely large families of receptor genes that typically encode
      7-transmembrane proteins expressed in the olfactory neurons.
      Little is known, however, about what structural characteristics of
      small volatile molecules are important for behavior modification.
      The predicted odors provided herein are able to manipulate the
      olfactory-based behavior of an organism by making use of
      computationally identified important structural characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Volatile chemical space is immense. Odors in the
      environment that have been catalogued in some plant sources alone
      number more than a couple thousand. A very small proportion of
      chemical space has been systematically tested for the ability to
      modify behavior, and a very small fraction of odor receptors,
      whose sequences are known, have been tested for their ability to
      be affected by behavior modifying odors. The complete 3-D
      structures of odor receptor proteins have not yet been determined,
      thus modeling of odor- protein interactions is not yet possible
      except in rare instances. Furthermore, were a 3-D receptor
      structure to become available, application of one odor-receptor
      interaction to study others may be confounded by the possibility
      of multiple ligand binding sites in a single receptor, as well as
      the sequence divergence amongst different odor receptors. The
      disclosure was identified by intelligent and rapid screening of
      untested volatile chemical space through computational
      identification of important characteristics shared between known
      behavior modifying compounds, circumventing many of the previously
      described obstacles. Additionally, one can screen potential odors
      for toxicological safety. The disclosure has been used to identify
      molecular features important in mosquito avoidance. The identified
      features were then used to screen a vast chemical space,
      predicting odors that interrupt host- seeking behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Several repellent compounds have been identified to date.
      These compounds range from naturally occurring extracts to
      commercially manufactured compounds. The degree of protection,
      duration of protection, and safety of these odors varies greatly.
      The gold standard of these compounds generally considered DEET.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) has been used for
      insect repellency for over 50 years. Protection is generally
      provided by direct application to the skin in concentrations
      ranging from 3 to 100 percent (Household products database of
      NLM). While results vary across experiments, DEET has been shown
      to act as an irritant and in some cases may cause skin reactions.
      In a recent study DEET has also just recently been shown to
      inhibit acetylcholinesterase in humans, which is an important
      neurotransmitter. DEET is also known to dissolve several products
      including certain plastics, synthetic fabrics, painted or
      varnished surfaces. How DEET is detected by arthropods is
      currently unknown. Several candidate methods have been proposed,
      but sufficient evidence that any of these methods is the direct
      avoidance-inducing pathway has not been demonstrated. As an
      example, it has been demonstrated that Culex quinquefasciatus are
      able to directly detect DEET through a short trichoid sensillum in
      a dose dependent manner. It has also been proposed that Drosophila
      are able to detect DEEN through gustatory receptors. It is
      possible that mosquitoes recognize this compound through a
      combination of olfactory and gustatory pathways.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Several other terpenoid compounds with repellent properties
      including thujone, eucalyptol, and linalool have also been
      identified. These compounds were shown to directly activate a
      trichoid sensillum housed odor receptor, which is also activated
      by DEET, only more strongly than DEET itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Icaridin, which is also called picaridine, is also used as
      an insect repellent.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly to DEET it&nbsp; acts as a repellent to several
      different insect species. Icaridin has the added benefit of not
      melting plastics. It has been found to be as effective as DEET at
      repelling insects, while being less irritating than DEET.<br>
      <br>

      [0002] The disclosure relates methods and compositions for
      attracting and repelling psyllids, such as, for example, Asian
      Citrus Psyllids (ACPs), and inhibiting the spread of Huanglongbing
      disease in plants and trees.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Citrus greening, also called Huanglongbing (HLB) or yellow
      dragon disease, is a disease of citrus. This bacterial disease is
      thought to have originated in China in the early 1900's. The
      disease is primarily spread by two species of psyllid insects. One
      species, the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, has been
      present in Florida since 1998. The bacteria that cause HLB itself
      are not harmful to humans but the disease is damaging to the
      citrus crops. There are three strains of the bacteria: an Asian
      version, an African version, and a recently described American
      strain discovered in Brazil.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The Asian strain, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, was
      found in Florida in early September, 2005. As a result, HLB is
      becoming a major threat to the U.S. citrus industry. Other than
      tree removal, there are no known effective controls once a tree is
      infected and there has been no known cure for the disease.
      Infected trees may produce misshapen, unmarketable, bitter fruit.
      HLB reduces the quantity and quality of citrus fruits, eventually
      rendering infected trees useless. In areas of the world affected
      by HLB the average productive lifespan of citrus trees has dropped
      from 50 or more years to 15 or less. The trees in the orchards
      usually die 3-5 years after becoming infected and require removal
      and replanting. An infected tree produces fruit that is unsuitable
      for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. <br>

      [0005] Citrus plants infected by the HLB bacteria may not show
      symptoms for years following infection. Initial symptoms
      frequently include the appearance of yellow shoots on a tree. As
      the bacteria move within the tree, the entire canopy progressively
      develops a yellow color.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The most characteristic symptoms of HLB are a blotchy leaf
      mottle and vein yellowing that develop on leaves attached to
      shoots, providing the overall yellow appearance. These foliar
      symptoms may superficially resemble a zinc deficiency although the
      green and yellow contrast is not as vivid with greening as it is
      with zinc deficiency or another disease, citrus variegated
      chlorosis. Leaves with HLB have a mottled appearance that differs
      from nutrition-related mottling in that greening-induced mottling
      usually crosses leaf veins. Nutrition related mottles usually are
      found between or along leaf veins and leaves may be small and
      upright.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Fruit from diseased trees are small, often misshapen, and
      typically some green color remains on ripened fruit. On Mandarin
      orange, fruit may develop an uneven ripening such that they appear
      half orange and half yellow. This symptom is the origin of the
      common name "greening." Yields are almost minimal, and any
      developed fruit is rendered worthless due to small size, poor
      color, and bad taste.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Among the volatiles released by guava and garlic chive
      leaves that induce repellence to ACP, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS)
      has been assayed in a small plot field trial and led to reduction
      in ACP densities for up to three weeks. This field trial was
      performed on an low psyllid density area (average: 3-4 ACP/10
      trees) and resulted in only 65% reduction in ACP densities which
      indicates DMDS treatment may not be effective as a repellent to
      effectively control ACP in citrus plantations. Additionally, DMDS
      has strong and unpleasant odor and its toxic effect (DMDS-MSDS)
      may also preclude deployment of DMDS in citrus producing areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Methyl salicylate is another compound that has been
      identified as both an ACP attractant and repellent. Methyl
      salicylate is a chemical released in high amounts by citrus plants
      under physical stress, leading to ACP repellency in laboratory
      behavioral assays. On the other hand, at lower concentration ACP
      is attracted to it in lab behavior assays. It is not known whether
      this compound will serve as an attractant or repellent in the
      field. [0010] Therefore, there is a need for psyllid (e.g. , Asian
      Citrus Psyllid) trapping, repelling, and control agents that are
      environmentally safe, inexpensive, and usable in conjunction with
      other control methods. This is the object of the methods disclosed
      herein.<br>

      </b><b> BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Numerous insects are vectors for disease. Mosquitoes in the
      genus Anopheles are the principle vectors of malaria, a disease
      caused by protozoa in the genus Trypanosoma . Aedes aegypti is the
      main vector of the viruses that cause Yellow fever and Dengue.
      Other viruses, the causal agents of various types of encephalitis,
      are also carried by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. Wuchereria bancrofti
      and Brugia malayi, parasitic roundworms that cause filariasis, are
      usually spread by mosquitoes in the genera Culex, Mansonia, and
      Anopheles .<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Horse flies and deer flies may transmit the bacterial
      pathogens of tularemia (Pasteurella tularensis) and anthrax
      (Bacillus anthracis) , as well as a parasitic roundworm (Loa loa)
      that causes loiasis in tropical Africa.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Eye gnats in the genus Hippelates can carry the spirochaete
      pathogen that causes yaws (Treponema pertenue) , and may also
      spread conjunctivitis (pinkeye) . Tsetse flies in the genus
      Glossma transmit the protozoan pathogens that cause African
      sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense and T. rhodesiense) .
      Sand flies in the genus Phlebotomus are vectors of a bacterium
      (Bartonella bacilli formis) that causes Carrion's disease (oroyo
      fever) in South America. In parts of Asia and North Africa, they
      spread a viral agent that causes sand fly fever (pappataci fever)
      as well as protozoan pathogens (Leishmania spp.) that cause
      Leishmaniasis . <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0035] The disclosure provides a class of volatile odorants that
      can inhibit the electrophysiological response of the CO2 neuron in
      various insect disease vectors including Drosophila melanogaster,
      Culex qumquefasciatus, An. gambiae and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
      In some embodiment, the odorants can completely inhibit the
      electrophysiological response of the CO2 neuron at very low
      concentrations .<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The compounds and compositions of the disclosure can be
      used as antagonist to mask the chemoattractant activity of CO2.
      The compounds and compositions can be used as attractants alone or
      in combination with an insecticide, trap, or other mechanical,
      electrical or chemical that kills the insect or prevents its
      escape . [0051] Compounds useful in the methods, compositions and
      devices of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, 4 to 6
      carbon aldehydes (e.g., butanal, penatanal, hexanal) , 5 to 8
      carbon alcohols (e.g., pentanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol,
      Z3-hexen-l-ol, Z2- hexen-1-ol, l-hexen-3-ol, l-hepten-3-ol,
      3-hexanol, 2-hexanol and the like), and 3 to 8 carbon mono- or
      di-ketones (e.g., butanedione (2, 3-butanedione) , pentanedione
      and the like) . Additional related compounds having similar
      structure can be assayed using the methods described herein to
      determine if they have antagonistic effects or agonistic effects.
      For example, compounds having 2-8 carbon atoms and an aldehyde,
      ketone or alcohol can be assayed using electrophysiology
      measurement described herein.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      0060] The volatile compounds of the disclosure have masking and
      repellant effects by impairing the ability to find a host via
      long-range cues from CO2 plumes emitted from human breath will be
      exploited to protect larger area. [0061] The disclosure provides a
      method of controlling insect attraction to a subject, the method

      3-hexanol, 2-hexanol and the like) , and 3 to 8 carbon mono- or
      di-ketones (e.g., butanedione (2, 3-butanedione) , pentanedione
      and the like) , wherein inhibiting expression alters insect
      responsiveness to carbon dioxide, thereby controlling insect
      attraction to the subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In one embodiment, the gustatory receptor is Gr21a, Gr63a,
      or a homologue or ortholog thereof, or a combination thereof. In
      another embodiment, the gustatory receptor is GPRgr22, GPRgr24, or
      a homologue thereof, or a combination thereof<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In another embodiment, this disclosure provides a method of
      inhibiting, preventing or reducing the incidence of insect-borne
      disease in a subject, the method comprising the step of
      overstimulating or antagonizing a CO2 receptor in an insect with a
      compounds or combination of compounds selected from the group
      consisting of 4 to 6 carbon aldehydes (e.g., butanal, penatanal,
      hexanal), 5 to 8 carbon alcohols (e.g., pentanol, hexanol,
      cyclohexanol, Z3-hexen-l-ol, Z2-hexen-l-ol, l-hexen-3-ol,
      l-hepten- 3-ol, 3-hexanol, 2-hexanol and the like) , and 3 to 8
      carbon mono- or di-ketones (e.g., butanedione (2, 3-butanedione) ,
      pentanedione and the like) , wherein the receptor response to
      carbon dioxide is modified and attraction to the subject
      inhibited, thereby inhibiting, preventing or reducing the
      incidence of insect-borne disease in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In one embodiment, the disease is malaria, dengue, yellow
      fever, river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, sleeping sickness,
      leishmaniasis, epidemic polyarthritis, West Nile virus disease or
      Australian encephalitis.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In one embodiment, the method of inhibiting, preventing or
      reducing the incidence of insect-borne disease is via exposing the
      insect to an agent the antagonizes the C02 receptor or neuron in
      the insect.<br>
      [0066] An active compounds or compounds of the disclosure (e.g., 4
      to 6 carbon aldehydes (e.g., butanal, penatanal, hexanal) , 5 to 8
      carbon alcohols (e.g., pentanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, Z3-
      hexen-1-ol, Z2-hexen-l-ol, l-hexen-3-ol, l-hepten-3-ol, 3-hexanol,
      2-hexanol and the like) , and 3 to 8 carbon mono- or di-ketones
      (e.g., butanedione (2, 3-butanedione) , pentanedione and the
      like)) may be produced in accordance with techniques known to
      those skilled in the art, or where novel may be produced by
      variations of known techniques which will be apparent to those
      skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The compositions may comprise various combinations of
      compounds as well as varying concentrations of the compound
      depending upon the insect to be repelled or masked, the type of
      surface that the composition will be applied to, or the type of
      trap to be used. Typically the active ingredient compound of the
      disclosure (e.g., 4 to 6 carbon aldehydes (e.g., butanal,
      penatanal, hexanal) , 5 to 8 carbon alcohols (e.g., pentanol,
      hexanol, cyclohexanol, Z3-hexen-l-ol, Z2-hexen-l-ol, l-hexen-3-ol,
      l-hepten-3-ol, 3-hexanol, 2-hexanol and the like) , and 3 to 8
      carbon mono- or di-ketones (e.g., butanedione (2, 3-butanedione) ,
      pentanedione and the like) ) will be present in the composition in
      a concentration of at least about 0.0001% by weight and may be 10,
      50, 99 or 100% by weight of the total composition. The repellant
      carrier may be from 0.1% to 99.9999% by weight of the total
      composition. The dry formulations will have from about 0.0001-95%
      by weight of the pesticide while the liquid formulations will
      generally have from about 0.0001-60% by weight of the solids in
      the liquid phase.<br>

      ...Using a T-maze choice assay the experiment demonstrated that
      wild-type Drosophila show a robust avoidance behavior to 0.67% CO2
      (Figure 15a) . Inclusion of either 1-hexanol or 2, 3-butanedione
      with CO2 results in a reduction in mean avoidance behavior,
      although to varying degrees; avoidance to CO2 is abolished in the
      presence of 2, 3-butanedione (Figure 15a) . In wild-type
      Drosophila, however, a number of ORN classes are activated by
      1-hexanol and 2, 3-butanedione . This raises the possibility that
      behavioral avoidance to CO2 may be overcome by activation of these
      other classes of ORNs, rather than by inhibition of C02-responsive
      neurons. To distinguish between these possibilities, the behavior
      of 0r83b&lt;2&gt; mutant flies in which most of the ORNs are
      non-functional, but electrophysiological responses to CO2 are not
      affected were examined (Figures 15b, lla) . Consistent with the
      electrophysiological analysis, flies lacking Or83b have a robust
      avoidance response to CO2 (Figure 15b) , which is comparable to
      the level observed for wild type flies (Figure 15a) . Avoidance is
      significantly reduced with the addition of either 1-hexanol or 2,
      3-butanedione with CO2 (Figure 15b) . Taken together these results
      demonstrate that 1-hexanol and 2, 3-butanedione can effectively
      inhibit CO2-mediated innate avoidance behavior by inhibiting the
      CO2 receptor .<br>
