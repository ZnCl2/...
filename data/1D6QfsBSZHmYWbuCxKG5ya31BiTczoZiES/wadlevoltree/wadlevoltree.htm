            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      One freezing day in February 2006, physicist Andreas Mershin
      huddled with others around a tree on the Massachusetts Institute
      of Technology campus to watch an unlikely demonstration. An
      engineering company claimed it could produce electricity simply by
      wiring a nail in the trees trunk to a metal rod in the ground.
      Sure enough, the demo worked but nobody knew exactly why.<br>
      <br>
      Two years later, Mershin and MIT undergraduate Christopher Love
      have not only figured out the source of the trees electricity,
      they've joined a new company Voltree Power that wants to use that
      energy to power wireless networks of environmental sensors.<br>
      <br>
      As reported in PLoS ONE, the electricity stems from an acidity
      difference between trees and soil. The area that is more acidic
      contains a higher concentration of positively charged hydrogen
      ions. Those ions attract electrons, generating a tiny current that
      travels between the tree and the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Using a device that extends probes underground, Voltrees invention
      harvests the energy and uses it to continuously recharge a
      battery, which in turn powers radio-equipped sensors. Voltree is
      now working to assemble a wildfire alert network that can feed
      sensor data to a central location. The devices could also monitor
      climate conditions or even detect illegal radioactive materials at
      the border.<br>
      <br>
      While other monitoring tools have been hampered by the need for
      costly solar panels or frequent battery replacements, tree-powered
      sensors could be deployed over vast areas with little maintenance.
      And not to worry, Mershin says: the amount of energy harvested is
      so tiny that the trees wont feel a thing.? <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Since the late-nineteenth century the use of, and uses for,
      electricity has increased tremendously, becoming a fundamental
      part of everyday life for most people. One only has to look at
      remote parts of the world to see how drastically different life is
      without electricity. Most electric devices in use today typically
      draw between a few milliwatts to several megawatts of power,
      depending on the application. Higher costs for the fuels needed to
      generate electricity, and a higher electrical demand in general,
      however, have led to increased electricity costs, thereby
      increasing the attractiveness of alternative power sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One typical use of electricity is a light emitting diode
      (LED). LEDs have seen increasing popularity in recent times due to
      a lower per unit cost and a greater number of available colors.
      LEDs are more energy efficient (i.e., less power is consumed) and
      generally have a much longer life expectancy than conventional
      filament-based light bulbs. In general, LEDs draw approximately 20
      mA at 2V (i.e., 40 mW) when illuminated, which is far less than
      conventional light bulbs.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Distribution of electricity from a generation plant to the
      end-user is not a trivial problem. Thousands of miles of wires and
      cables creating a transmission network are involved in delivering
      power to consumers. The transmission network adds costs such as
      material costs and the cost of lost energy due to the resistance
      of the transmission wires. For the average consumer of
      electricity, the transmission costs generally equal the cost of
      the electricity itself. Furthermore, portions of the world have no
      electricity because it is simply too far from the nearest
      transmission line or the terrain itself prohibits installation of
      transmission lines.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br

      indicative of a second, future weather condition as a function of
      the differences.<br>

      <br>
      [0010] In general, in another aspect, the invention provides a
      system including a non-animal organism, a first electrical
      conductor electrically coupled to the non-animal organism, a

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] Embodiments of the invention provide techniques for drawing
      electricity from non-animal organisms such as members of the plant
      and/or fungi kingdom, and providing the electricity to a load.
      Non-animal, non-mammal organisms such as spermatophytes,
      pteridophytes, succulents, Marattiales ferns, Ophioglossales
      ferns, Leptosporangiate ferns, Mycophycota fungi, Zygomycota
      fungi, Basidiomycota fungi, and Ascomycota fungi may be used.
      Specifically, electricity can be drawn from vegetative matter such
      as a living tree. The amount of available electricity has been
      found to depend on the location and type of non-animal organism,
      and to be approximately 0.5-2 volts DC, plus some AC current. For
      example, an apparatus for using this energy includes a conductor
      inserted into a tree and connected to a positive terminal of a
      load. A negative conductor of the load is connected to a grounded
      conductor, thereby completing a circuit. Other circuitry, such as
      charging circuits and/or voltage step-up circuits, may also be
      used. Other embodiments are within the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Referring to FIG. 1, an apparatus 1 for deriving
      electricity from a tree 25 includes a tap 5, a conductor 10, wires
      15, 20, and 25, a circuit 30, and a load 35. The tap 5 is
      configured to attach to, and to conduct current flow from, the
      tree 25. For example, the tap 5 may be configured to be inserted
      into the tree 25, although other configurations are possible
      (e.g., a non-invasive transformer core that surrounds the
      circumference of the tree 25). The wire 15 is electrically coupled
      to the tap 5 and the circuit 30. The wire 20 is electrically
      coupled to the circuit 30 and the load 35. The wire 25 is
      electrically coupled to the load 35 and the conductor 10. The
      conductor 10 is electrically conductive and is configured to be
      inserted approximately two feet into the ground while protruding
      above the ground, although the conductor 10 may be configured to
      be inserted to other depths. By increasing the depth that the
      conductor 10 is inserted into the ground and/or using multiple
      conductors 10, the load 35 can draw more current from the tree 25.
      The conductor 10 is preferably a tinned copper rod. Other
      materials and/or configurations of the conductor 10 are possible.
      For example the conductor 10 may be aluminum and/or connected to a
      "ground" connection of a typical household electrical system. The
      circuit 30 is electrically conductive and is configured to filter
      the power provided by the tree, to step-up (or step-down) the
      voltage supplied by the tree 25, and/or to store the power
      provided by the tree 25. The circuit 30 may perform functions
      other than those listed above. Also, embodiments of the apparatus
      1 without the circuit 30 are possible (e.g., connecting a load
      directly between the tree 25 and the conductor 10).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The load 35 can be any of a number of different devices
      used for a variety of purposes. For example, the load 35 can
      include a lithium battery that is charged by the tree 25, a sensor
      (e.g., capable of sensing temperature, air speed, humidity,
      barometric pressure, video, audio, light, vibration, altitude,
      oxygen levels), a remote sensor (e.g., over a LAN, WAN, the
      Internet, WiFi), a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip, a
      transmitter, and/or a receiver. The load 35 can be a device for
      use with a global positioning system (GPS) such as a GPS receiver,
      a GPS transmitter, a GPS guidance system, and/or a GPS navigation
      system. The load 35 can include a fire and/or smoke detection
      system, a system configured to charge a battery powered device
      (e.g., a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a portable GPS system, a
      flashlight, a radio), a lighting system (e.g., for recreational
      use, for military use)(including, e.g., one or more light emitting
      diodes (LEDs) such as infrared LEDs), a fire ignition system
      (e.g., for campground use), a weather detection and/or monitoring
      system, an emergency alert/assistance beacon, a solar lighting
      backup system, and/or a wireless transmission system for use with
      a computer. The load 35 can include a plant (e.g., as described
      below in Experiment 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Various embodiments of the tap 5 are possible. Preferably,
      the tap 5 is a stainless steel rod, e.g., a nail, having an
      outside diameter of about 0.125 inches, but other materials and
      sizes are possible. For example, brass plated or aluminum rods
      having an outside diameter of about 0.06 inches may be used. The
      tap 5 is electrically conductive material and is preferably of a
      material (e.g., stainless steel) that has a relatively high
      corrosion resistance, thus inhibiting increased resistance caused
      by corrosion. For extended use, the tap 5 is preferably not copper
      (at least on its exterior) as this can negatively affect (e.g.,
      kill) many types of trees. The tap 5 is preferably configured to
      be inserted between about 0.375 inches and about 0.75 inches into
      the tree 25, although other depths are possible. In trees with
      thick bark, the tap 5 may be inserted further into the tree 25.
      For example, if a tree has bark 1 inch thick, the tap 5 may be
      inserted about 1.5 inches into the tree 25. The tap 5 is
      preferably inserted into the tree 25 between about one and about
      six feet above ground level, although other heights may be used.
      While the apparatus 1 includes the one tap 5, multiple taps may be
      used. Using multiple taps in a single tree has been found to
      increase the amount of current available from the tree. The taps
      may all be the same, or one or more taps may be different (e.g., a
      different material, configured for different insertion depth,
      etc.) than another tap.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Referring also to FIG. 2, an exemplary embodiment 40 of the
      apparatus 1 including an LED load 115, and an exemplary circuit 30
      that is a charging circuit 50, which includes switches 55, 60, 65,
      70, 75, 80, and 85, and capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105. The
      switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are single-pole
      double-throw (SPDT) switches. The switch 55 includes selective
      connections 56 and 57. The switch 57 is connected on one side to
      the switch 56 and the capacitor 90 and on its other side to an
      output 125 configured to be connected to the load 115. The switch
      60 also includes selective connections 61 and 62. When the
      switches 55 and 60 are in a first state, the connections 56 and 61
      are closed and the connections 57 and 62 are open, thereby
      coupling the capacitor 90 between a power source 110 (here, a
      tree) and a ground 120. When the switches 55 and 60 are in a
      second state, the connections 56 and 61 are open, and the
      connections 57 and 62 are closed, thereby coupling the capacitor
      90 between the load LED 115, and the switch 65. Each of the
      switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 are coupled to the tree 110 via the
      tap 107. The switches 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 operate as described
      with respect to the switches 55 and 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 are coupled to the
      switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 such that when the
      switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are in a first state, the
      circuit 50 is in a charging state and each of the capacitors 90,
      95, 100, and 105 are coupled between the power source 110 and the
      ground 120. When the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are
      in the first state the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 accumulate
      an electrical charge. The capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 are
      further coupled to the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85
      such that when the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are in
      a second state, the circuit 50 is in a discharging state and the
      capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 are coupled in series between the
      ground 120 and a load 115 thus providing power to the load 115.
      The voltage provided to the load 115 is substantially equal to the
      sum of the voltages across each of the capacitors 90, 95, 100 and
      105. The capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 are preferably about
      10,000 [mu]F, but other capacitances are possible. While an LED is
      shown as the load 115, other loads may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] While the charging circuit 50 is shown coupled to a single
      tree (i.e., the tree 110), other configurations are possible. For
      example, each of the switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 may be connected
      to separate trees. The switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 could each be
      connected to multiple trees (or other non-animal organisms). One
      or more of the switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 could each be connected
      to a single tree with multiple taps 107. One of the switches 55,
      65, 75, and 85 could be connected to a single tree with a single
      tap, with the remainder of the switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 being
      connected to multiple trees, each with multiple taps. One of the
      switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 could be connected to a single tree
      with multiple taps, with the remainder of the switches 55, 65, 75,
      and 85 being coupled to a single tree with multiple taps. Each of
      the switches 55, 65, 75, and 85 may be coupled to a single tree or
      multiple trees using more than one of the tap 107.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In operation, referring to FIG. 3, with further reference
      to FIG. 2, a process 260 for providing power derived from a tree
      to a load using the apparatus 40 includes the stages shown. The
      process 260, however, is exemplary only and not limiting. The
      process 260 may be altered, e.g., by having stages added, removed,
      or rearranged.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] At stage 264, the charging circuit 50 is coupled to the
      living non-animal organism power source 110, such as a tree, a
      plant, etc. Preferably, the tap 107 is inserted into the power
      source 110. The tap 107 is inserted approximately 0.375 inches to
      0.75 inches into the tree. Alternatively, a non-invasive tap may
      be used, e.g., a transformer core can be placed around a
      circumference of the tree.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] At stage 268, the charging circuit 50 is grounded.
      Preferably, the charging circuit 50 is coupled to a ground rod, or
      other suitable electrical ground, such as a ground connection in a
      typical residential power system. More current may be drawn from
      the living non-animal organism by the load 115 by increasing the
      depth that the ground rod is inserted into the ground and/or using
      multiple ground rods.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] At stage 272, the load 115 is coupled between the charging
      circuit 50 and the ground 120. The load 115 is coupled on one side
      to the output 125 of the charging circuit 50 and on its other side
      to the ground 120.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] At stage 276, the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85
      are actuated into the first (charging) state. The connections 56
      and 61 of the switches 55 and 60 are closed, the connections 57
      and 62 of the switches 55 and 60 are opened, and likewise for the
      switches 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85. This couples the capacitors 90,
      95, 100, and 105 to the taps 107.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] At stage 280, the power is provided from the tree 110 to
      the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105. The capacitors 90, 95, 100,
      and 105 store energy received from the taps 107.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] At stage 284, the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 are
      allowed to charge. The amount of time the capacitors 90, 95, 100,
      and 105 are charged may vary to suit a specific application. For
      example, to provide sufficient power to illuminate the LED, each
      of the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 is charged to 0.5 Vdc. The
      amount of time for the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 to reach
      0.5 Vdc may vary depending on the amount of power supplied by a
      particular power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] At stage 288, the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85
      are changed from the first state to the second state to discharge
      the power accumulated in the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105,
      thereby providing power to the load 115.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The power from the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 is used
      to operate the load 115, here causing the LED to emit light. The
      process 260 returns to stage 276 where the switches 55, 60, 65,
      70, 75, 80, and 85 are changed from the second state to the first
      state, thereby providing power from the taps 107 to the capacitors
      90, 95, 100, and 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 4, a filtered charging circuit 200
      includes a filter circuit 205 and the charging circuit 50, which
      are coupled to a power input 215, a load 220 (in FIGS. 2 and 4 an
      LED), and a ground connector 250. The filter circuit 205 is
      coupled between the power input 215 and the charging circuit 50,
      and is configured to provide substantially DC power to the
      charging circuit 50. The power input 215 is coupled to multiple
      taps 225 configured to be inserted into one or more trees. As
      described above with reference to FIG. 2, the charging circuit can
      provide the load 220 with a stepped-up, substantially DC voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The filter circuit 205 includes inductors 230 and 235, and
      capacitors 240 and 245. The inductors 230 and 235 are coupled in
      series between the power input 215 and the charging circuit 50 to
      inhibit high-frequency power produced by the tree from reaching
      the charging circuit 50. The capacitor 240 is coupled between the
      junction of the inductors 230 and 235 and the ground 250. The
      capacitor 245 is coupled between the junction of the inductor 235
      and the charging circuit 50 and the ground 250. For example, the
      inductors 230 and 235, and the capacitors 240 and 245 are arranged
      in a 2-stage pie filter configuration. The capacitors short-out
      (e.g., ground) high-frequency power produced by the tree, further
      inhibiting non-DC power from being conducted to the charging
      circuit 50. The inductors 230 and 235 are preferably about 10 mH,
      although other inductances are possible. The capacitors 240 and
      245 are preferably about 470 [mu]F, although other capacitances
      are possible. The charging circuit 50 is configured to receive
      substantially DC power from the filter circuit 205, and to output
      intermittent DC power to the load 220 similar to the description
      provided above with respect to FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In operation, referring to FIG. 5, with further reference
      to FIG. 4, a process 500 for providing power derived from a tree
      to the load 220 using the filtered charging circuit 200 includes
      the stages shown. The process 500, however, is exemplary only and
      not limiting. The process 500 may be altered, e.g., by having
      stages added, removed, or rearranged.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] At stage 505, the filtered charging circuit 200 is coupled
      to the power input 215 such as a tree, a fungus, or other suitable
      non-animal organism, here by inserting the taps 225 into a single
      tree. Each of the taps 225 is inserted approximately 0.375 inches
      to approximately 0.75 inches into the tree. If any of the taps 225
      are non-invasive, then that (those) taps(s) 225 (e.g., a
      transformer core) is (are) mounted accordingly. (e.g., placed
      around the circumference of a tree).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] At stage 510, the filtered charging circuit 200 is coupled
      to ground. The filtered charging circuit 200 is connected to the
      ground connector 250, such as a rod, or other suitable electrical
      ground connector (e.g., a ground connection in a typical
      residential power system). More current may be drawn from the
      living non-animal organism by the load 220 by increasing the depth
      that the ground rod is inserted into the ground and/or using
      multiple ground rods.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] At stage 515, the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85
      are actuated into a first (charging) state coupling the capacitors
      90, 95, 100, and 105 to the filter circuit 205. Power flows from
      the filter circuit 205 to the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] At stage 520, the power derived from the tree is filtered
      to substantially remove alternating current (AC). At stage 520 the
      filter circuit 205 filters the power derived from the taps 225
      into substantially DC power. The combination of the inductors 230
      and 235 and the capacitors 240 and the 245 substantially filters
      out non-DC frequencies produced by the tree. The inductors 230 and
      235 choke the high-frequencies produced by the tree. The
      capacitors 240 and 245 inhibit low frequency power and conduct
      high-frequency power to the ground connector 250. The filter
      circuit 205 provides the filtered substantially DC power to the
      charging circuit 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] At stage 525 the filtered substantially DC power from the
      filter circuit 205 is provided to the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and
      105. The switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are put in the
      first state to couple the circuit 205 to the capacitors 90, 95,
      100, and 105 to provide power to, and charge, the capacitors 90,
      95, 100, and 105. At stage 530, the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and
      105 are allowed to charge. The amount of time the capacitors 90,
      95, 100, and 105 are charged varies, and may be tailored to suit a
      specific application. For example, to provide sufficient power to
      illuminate the load 220, each of the capacitors is charged to 0.5
      Vdc. The amount of time required to reach 0.5 Vdc may vary
      depending on the amount of power supplied by a particular power
      source.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] At stage 535, the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85
      are changed from the first state to the second state to discharge
      the power accumulated in the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105,
      thereby providing power to the load 220.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] After stage 535, the switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and
      85 are actuated from the second state to the first state, thereby
      providing filtered substantially DC power from the filter circuit
      205 to the charging circuit 50. The stages 515, 520, 525, and 530
      may be repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] At stage 540, the power from the capacitors 90, 95, 100,
      and 105 is used to operate the load 220, here causing the LED to
      emit light. The process 500 returns to stage 515 where the
      switches 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 85 are changed from the second
      state to the first state, thereby providing power from the taps
      225 to the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Referring to FIG. 6, a filtered charging circuit 300
      includes a filter circuit 305 and a charging circuit 310, which
      are coupled to a power input 315 and a load 320 (in FIG. 6, an
      LED). The filter 305 is coupled between the power input 315 and
      the charging circuit 310, and is configured to provide
      substantially DC power to the charging circuit 310. The power
      input 315 is coupled to multiple taps 325 that are each configured
      to be inserted into a tree. The load 320 is preferably a
      SSL-DSP5093UWC LED (manufactured by Lumex Incorporated, of
      Palatine, Ill.), although other LEDs, and other types of loads,
      may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The filter circuit 305 includes inductors 330 and 335,
      capacitors 340 and 345, and an output node 347. The inductors 330
      and 335 are coupled in series between the power input 315 and the
      output node 347 and are of inductances to serve as chokes of any
      high-frequencies received at the power input 315. The capacitor
      340 is coupled between the junction of the inductors 330 and 335
      and the ground 348. The capacitor 345 is coupled between the
      output node 347 and the ground 348. For example, the inductors 330
      and 335, and the capacitors 340 and 345 are arranged in a 2-stage
      pie filter configuration. The inductors 330 and 335 are preferably
      about 10 mH, although other inductances are possible. The
      capacitors 340 and 345 work in conjunction with the inductors 330
      and 335 shorting-out high frequency signals that may have passed
      through the inductors 330 and 335, respectively. The capacitors
      340 and 345 are preferably about 470[deg.] F., although other
      capacitances are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The charging circuit 310 includes capacitors 350, 355, 360,
      and 365, diodes 370, 375, and 380, a switch 385, a battery 390,
      and a ground connection 349 connected to the ground 348. Coupled
      between the output node 347 and the ground connection 349 are the
      capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365, and the diodes 370, 375, and
      380, in an alternating series of capacitors and diodes. Anodes
      371, 376, and 381 of the diodes 370, 375, and 380, respectively,
      are coupled to the output node 347. Cathodes 372, 377, and 382 of
      the diodes 370, 375, and 380, respectively, are coupled to the
      ground connection 349. The capacitor 350 is coupled between the
      cathode 372 of the diode 370 and the output node 347. The
      capacitor 365 is coupled between the anode 381 of the diode 380
      and the ground connection 349. The capacitors 350, 355, 360, and
      365, and the diodes 370, 375, and 380 act as a voltage multiplier
      circuit to allow filtered substantially DC power to charge the
      capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365 (e.g., by summing the voltages
      across the capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365). Using the
      capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365, and the diodes 370, 375, and
      380, a higher voltage (e.g., 2-2.5 V) is produced to charge the
      battery 390. The capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365are 5,000 [mu]F,
      although other capacitances are possible, such as 10,000 [mu]F.
      The diodes 370, 375, and 380 are preferably 1N5417 diodes, but
      other diodes are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The battery 390 is coupled between the output node 347 and
      the ground 348 such that it may receive power from the output node
      347. The battery 390 is preferably a lithium-ion battery, but
      other batteries may be used. A positive terminal 391 of the
      battery 390 is coupled to the output node 347 and the switch 385.
      A negative terminal 392 of the battery 390 is coupled to the
      ground 348. Other configurations are possible (e.g., coupling the
      negative terminal 392 to the output node 347, and coupling the
      positive terminal 391 to the ground 348).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The switch 385 is coupled between a terminal 322 of the
      load 320 and output node 347 to control a power flow to the load
      320. When the switch 385 is in an open state (as shown), power is
      inhibited (and preferably prevented) from flowing to the load 320.
      When the switch 385 is in a closed state, power may flow to the
      load 320. A terminal 321 of the load 320 is coupled to the ground
      348.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In operation, referring to FIG. 7, with further reference
      to FIG. 6, a process 600 for providing power derived from a tree
      to the load 320 using the filtered charging circuit 300 includes
      the stages shown. The process 600, however, is exemplary only and
      not limiting. The process 600 may be altered, e.g., by having
      stages added, removed, or rearranged.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] At stage 605, the filtered charging circuit 300 is coupled
      to the power input 315 such as a tree, a fungus, or other suitable
      non-animal organism, here by inserting the taps 325 into a single
      tree. Each of the taps 325 is inserted approximately 0.375 inches
      to approximately 0.75 inches into the tree. If any of the taps 325
      are non-invasive, then that (those) taps(s) 325 (e.g., a
      transformer core) is (are) mounted accordingly. (e.g., placed
      around the circumference of a tree).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] At stage 610, the filtered charging circuit 300 is coupled
      to ground. The filtered charging circuit 300 is connected to the
      ground connector 349, such as a rod, or other suitable electrical
      ground connector (e.g., a ground connection in a typical
      residential power system). More current may be drawn from the
      living non-animal organism by the load 320 by increasing the depth
      that the ground rod is inserted into the ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] At stage 615, the switch 385 is actuated into the first
      state (i.e., open) where the load 320 is disconnected from the
      filtered charging circuit 300 and current is inhibited/prevented
      from reaching/operating the LED 320.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] At stage 620, the power derived from the tree is filtered
      to substantially remove alternating current (AC). At stage 620 the
      filter circuit 305 filters the power derived from the taps 325
      into substantially DC power. The combination of the inductors 330
      and 335 and the capacitors 340 and the 345 substantially filters
      out non-zero frequencies produced by the tree. The inductors 330
      and 335 choke the high-frequencies produced by the tree. The
      capacitors 340 and 345 inhibit low frequency power and conduct
      high-frequency power to the ground connector 349. The filter
      circuit 305 provides the filtered substantially DC power to the
      charging circuit 310.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] At stage 625, the filtered substantially DC power is
      provided to the charging circuit 310 via the output node 347.
      Power provided from the output node 347 is conducted through the
      capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365, and the diodes 370, 375, and
      380. The configuration of the diodes 370, 375, and 380 allows
      substantially only filtered DC power to charge the capacitors 350,
      355, 360, and 365.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] At stage 630, the battery 390 is charged using power from
      the output node 347 and the capacitors 350, 355, 360, and 365. The
      amount of time the battery 390 is charged varies, and may be
      tailored to suit a specific application. The battery 390 may be
      charged for a specific predetermined amount of time, or may be
      charged until a certain power threshold is reached.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] At stage 635 the switch 385 is actuated into the second
      state (e.g., closed) coupling the load 320 across the terminals
      391 and 392 of the battery 392, thereby providing power from the
      battery 390 to the LED 320. Power may also be provided to the load
      320 from the output node 347 and/or the capacitors 350, 355, 360,
      and 365. The stages 615, 620, 625, 630, and 635 may be repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] At stage 640, the power from the capacitors 350, 355, 360,
      and 365, and the battery 390 is used to operate the load 320, here
      causing the LED to emit light. The process 600 returns to stage
      615 where the switch 385 is changed from the second state to the
      first state, thereby decoupling the load 320 from the positive
      terminal 391 of the battery 390, the output node 347, and the
      capacitor 350. The switch 385 thus alternates between the first
      state and the second state to provide intermittent power to the
      LED 320. Alternatively, the switch 385 can remain in the second
      state to provide substantially constant power to the LED 320.
      Other modes of operation are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In operation, referring to FIG. 8, with further reference
      to FIG. 1, a process 1000 for determining storm distance and/or
      severity by measuring the voltage provided by the tree 25 includes
      the stages shown. The process 1000, however, is exemplary only and
      not limiting. The process 1000 may be altered, e.g., by having
      stages added, removed, or rearranged.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] At stage 1005, the voltage provided by the tree 25 is
      measured using the apparatus 1. Voltage values are recorded, e.g.,
      at regular time intervals such as every 30 seconds, although other
      intervals are possible. Preferably, the apparatus 1 is not used to
      provide power to a load (e.g., the load 35) during stage 1005,
      although the apparatus 1 can provide power to a load
      simultaneously with the voltage measurements. The voltage can be
      measured, for example, by a computer and/or manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] At stage 1010, the voltage measurements are tracked. For
      example, a computer system can collect the voltage readings at
      regular intervals and store the values in a data table with each
      entry in the table representing a discrete voltage measurement at
      a known time. Alternatively, a person taking manual measurements
      can record the measurements manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] At stage 1015, the voltage measurements are compared to a
      baseline voltage for the tree 25 (e.g., a voltage value collected
      on a clear day). If the voltage measurements decrease relative to
      the baseline voltage of the tree 25, then a conclusion can be
      reached and an indication can be provided that a storm (e.g., a
      lightning storm) is approaching. The amount of the voltage drop
      and/or the speed of the voltage drop when compared to the baseline
      voltage can be used to determine the severity and/or the distance
      of an approaching storm. For example, a 0.5V drop in twenty
      minutes (with the baseline voltage as a reference point) can
      result in a determination that a more severe storm is approaching
      than a 0.2V drop in an hour (with the baseline voltage as a
      reference point). The voltage readings collected and tracked at
      stages 1005 and 1010 can be used at stage 1015 to determine
      information about an approaching storm alone (e.g., distance
      and/or severity), or can be combined with other weather tools,
      such as Radar and/or satellite imagery, used in predicting weather
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0067] Referring to Appendix A, exemplary results of voltage yield
      tests from different trees using different tap configurations,
      different ground rod quantities, and different numbers of taps are
      shown. The tests were performed using the configuration shown in
      FIG. 1, and described in the corresponding written description,
      where the load was a voltmeter. The circuit 30, however, as shown
      in FIG. 1, was omitted in the tests. The tests were performed
      selecting different geographic locations of the trees, different
      types of trees, different tap materials, different tap depths,
      different tap diameters, different tap heights (i.e., height from
      ground level), different tree altitudes, varying numbers of taps,
      and varying soil conditions. As shown in Appendix A, factors such
      as the species and/or the variety of a particular plant, e.g.,
      tree, affects the available voltage and/or current. For example,
      an oak tree located 40 feet above sea level and a maple tree
      located 200 feet above sea level provided differing amounts of
      voltage and/or current. Trees produced a substantially constant DC
      voltage (and some AC voltage), while other plants produced a
      less-constant DC voltage than trees. Furthermore, two trees,
      providing about 0.75V and 0.8V (DC), respectively, were coupled in
      series. Approximately 0.8V was measured from the second of the two
      tree coupled in series.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment 2</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0068] The charging circuit 50 (of FIG. 2) was used to
      successfully power an LED. The charging circuit 50, using four
      10,000 [mu]F (35 Vdc) capacitors, successfully illuminated an
      SSL-DSP5093UWC LED (manufactured by Lumex Incorporated, of
      Palatine, Ill.) for approximately one second. The charging circuit
      50 was placed in the charging state for approximately 1.75 hours,
      thereby charging the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105. At the end
      of the charging period, there was approximately a 0.5 Vdc
      potential in each of the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105, storing
      approximately 0.0125 Joules of energy in each of the capacitors
      90, 95, 100, and 105. To light the LED, the switches 55, 60, 65,
      70, 75, 80, and 85 were actuated, changing the switches 55, 60,
      65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 from the first (charging) state, to the
      second (discharge) state, thereby providing 2 Vdc to the LED
      (4*0.5 Vdc) and illuminating the LED. After approximately one
      second of the LED being illuminated, the voltage across the LED
      dropped to 1.5 Vdc and the LED no longer illuminated (the lower
      operating threshold of the SSL-DSP5093UWC LED is approximately
      1.5V). The capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105 were allowed to
      recharge for approximately one hour to again reach a 0.5 Vdc
      potential across each of the capacitors 90, 95, 100, and 105.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment 3</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0069] The apparatus was used to collect weather related
      information (exemplary data is shown in Appendix B). Voltage
      readings were collected as a lightning storm approached from the
      West of a test site including a tree. As the storm approached the
      test site, a voltage provided by the tree decreased relative to
      prior levels. The closer the storm was relative to the test site,
      the larger the voltage drop. For example, when the storm was
      several miles away, the voltage provided by the tree dropped about
      0.2V compared to a voltage measured from the tree on a clear day.
      As the storm had substantially reached the test site, the voltage
      provided by the tree had dropped approximately 0.5V compared to
      the voltage measured from the tree on a clear day. The approaching
      storm was an intense lightning storm, including positive
      lightning. Data consistent with the above description was recorded
      during other lightning storms. Observations indicate that stronger
      electrical activity (e.g., lightning) produced by a storm caused a
      quicker and larger voltage drop. Thus, by measuring the voltage
      provided by the tree 25, it was possible to gather information
      regarding the severity of an approaching storm. After a storm had
      passed over the test site, the voltage provided by the tree would
      return to "normal" levels within about thirty-five to forty
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment 4</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0070] A modified version of the apparatus 1 shown in FIG. 1 was
      used to stimulate/enhance the growth of plants including tomato
      and broccoli plants. Providing electricity produced by a tree to a
      plant was found to increase growth of the plant, to increase the
      plant's resistance to pests, and to increase the plant's
      resistance to frost. A tree was coupled to a plant using the tap 5
      and the wire 15, with the plant being the load 35. The plant's
      root system replaced the conductor 10.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Broccoli Plant</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0071] One of several broccoli plants in a group near each other
      was coupled to an apple tree as described above during an entire
      growing season. Prior to coupling the apple tree to the broccoli
      plant, the apple tree produced about 1.1 Vdc and the broccoli
      plant produced an average of about 0.3 Vdc. As the growing season
      progressed, the "energized" broccoli plant showed increased growth
      and increased resistance to pests relative to the other
      neighboring broccoli plants. For example, the energized broccoli
      plant grew taller than the other neighboring broccoli plants, and
      produced a larger center head and more side heads than the other
      neighboring broccoli plants. An additional experiment was
      performed by energizing the smallest and weakest broccoli plant of
      the group of broccoli plants. Within about two to three days of
      being energized, the newly-energized broccoli plant was about the
      same size and height as the neighboring non-energized broccoli
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The energized broccoli plant was not bothered by pests,
      whereas the non-energized broccoli plants were attacked by pests.
      As determined by several visual inspections during the growing
      season, the energized broccoli plant was substantially untouched
      by pests, whereas the non-energized broccoli plants' leaves were
      eaten by pests. As a further experiment, a worm was placed on the
      energized broccoli plant and then onto one of the other broccoli
      plants. After being placed on the "energized" broccoli plant, the
      worm did not eat the broccoli plant and fell off. When the same
      worm was placed on the non-energized broccoli plant, the worm
      began eating the broccoli plant soon thereafter. An additional
      experiment was performed by energizing a pest-inhabited broccoli
      plant. Within about one hour of being energized, the pests
      inhabiting the broccoli plant vacated the plant.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tomato Plant</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0073] One of several Cherokee Purple tomato plants in a group
      near each other was coupled to an elm tree. Prior to coupling the
      elm tree to the tomato plant, the elm tree produced about 1.2 Vdc.
      The energized/connected tomato plant included four shoots, each of
      which were coupled to the elm tree. Visual inspections of the
      tomato plant revealed that the energized tomato plant grew
      approximately thirty-three percent higher than the non-energized
      plants. The energized tomato plant also produced more tomatoes
      than the non-energized tomato plants. Furthermore, the energized
      tomato plant survived the first two frosts of the winter season,
      whereas the non-energized tomato plants died after the first
      frost.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Other embodiments are within the scope and spirit of the
      invention, including the appended claims. Features implementing
      functions may be physically located at various positions,
      including being distributed such that portions of functions are
      implemented at different physical locations. Loads other than LEDs
      may be used, such as a transmitter, receiver, microchip,
      incandescent light source, infrared light source, a laser, a DC/DC
      voltage converter, a DC/AC inverter, etc. Power may be drawn from
      non-animal organisms other than trees. For example, broccoli
      plants, tomato plants, soybean plants, and mushrooms may be used.
      Also, potted plants, and potted trees may be used. The tap may be
      inserted into a branch of the tree. The load can draw more current
      from the tree using multiple ground rods.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] While the tap has been disclosed as a nail, other
      configurations are possible such as a staple. Non-invasive
      embodiments of the tap are possible, e.g., a donut-shaped
      transformer core placed around the circumference of a tree. The
      surface area of a tap may be increased by, for example, being
      threaded (e.g., being a screw) and/or placing outwardly disposed
      barbs on the tap. A tap may have a flange disposed around the
      circumference of the tap to help a user insert the tap correctly
      into a tree (e.g., to the correct depth). A tap may include a
      handle to help in insertion into the tree and/or removal from the
      tree.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] While the terms "connected," "connector," "coupled," and
      "connection" have been used to indicate a direct connection, other
      configurations are possible. For example, referring to FIG. 6,
      when the diode 380 is "coupled" to the capacitor 360, this may
      include indirect connection through another component (e.g., a
      resistor coupled between the cathode 382 of the diode 380 and the
      capacitor 360).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The word "or" is to be construed as including the
      conjunctive and disjunctive definition.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Further, while the description refers to the invention, the
      description may include more than one invention.<br>
