      <br>
      Based on the principles outlined in 'The New Physics Derived from
      a Disinverted Metaphysics ' by Norberto Keppe, especially the idea
      that energy doesn’t come from matter. According to Keppe, the
      process is actually the opposite, meaning that matter comes from a
      previous, primary energy called Essential Energy, which is
      infinite and exists everywhere in the entire universe.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The New Physics</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In his landmark book, The New Physics, Dr. Norberto Keppe outlines
      the basis for a new physics that transcends the postulates of
      Newton and Einstein and even the proposals coming from the realm
      of quantum physics. Keppe’s book is a bold and prophetic
      re-thinking of the essential building blocks of science that
      promises to lead humanity to profoundly higher levels of
      technological and social development.<br>
      <br>
      Keppe’s findings were the inspiration needed for STOP engineers
      Cesar Soos and Roberto Frascari to discover the method by which to
      capture the scalar energy perceived by Tesla (also refered to as
      essential or divine energy by Keppe), thereby side-stepping the
      traditional means used by all motors to this point. To learn more
      about this revolutionary science, purchase the book.<br>
      <br>
      The Keppe Motor is a highly efficient motor that was developed by
      Cesar Soos and Roberto Frascari, two Brazilian engineers who based
      this motor on totally new principles described in a book written
      by the scientist Norberto Keppe called, “The New Physics”. This
      motor significantly reduces the consumption of electricity to
      generate the same mechanical power (torque) when compared to
      conventional electric motors that operates in the range up to 200
      Watts (Dec/08.)<br>
      <br>
      Based on studies made with existing working models*, the Keppe
      Motor saves between 70% and 93% of electric energy when compared
      to conventional electrical motors.<br>

      Following up on the successful launch of the Keppe Motor Manual in
      late 2008, the STOP the Destruction of the World Association has
      announced the release of the Keppe Motor KIT to begin 2009.<br>
      <br>
      Containing all the parts necessary to build your very own
      introductory version of the Keppe Motor, the Kit also contains an
      illustrated manual with all the step-by-step instructions you’ll
      need to put the Motor together. Inside the Manual is a detailed
      exploration of the theory behind the Keppe Motor – Norberto
      Keppe’s New Physics. This is a must read for anyone interested in
      the scientific basis behind this revolutionary Motor. The Manual
      also contains a number of experiments that you can conduct with
      this version of the Keppe Motor.<br>
      <br>
      The Keppe Motor uses 5 times less energy than a conventional
      electric motor because it captures Scalar Energy from space. The
      STOP Association has decided to release this technology to the
      world in the hopes that many interested individuals will
      contribute to the study and development of this landmark
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      Build and test your very own model and contribute to the
      development of the Motor.<br>
      <br>
      An excellent gift for young people to teach them the new
      principles behind capturing energy that make this such a
      revolutionary technology<br>

      <br>
      I have received my Kit,<br>
      <br>
      Opening it, it look nice. So I printed the manual (beside the typo
      mistakes) and read it. And started to check parts.<br>
      <br>
      I was surprised to see the spool with two red connectors. The
      battery connector (black) was a flat male instead of a female one
      !<br>
      <br>
      So I went on corrected this in order to be able to mount the kit.
      When finished, NOTHING RUNS !<br>
      <br>
      Can you tell me more on this ! where to diag and what to find ?<br>
      <br>
      I am more than disappointed it is a very expensive kit for having
      in final a 9v battery !<br>
      <br>
      Hope to have a quick answer.<br>

      Thank you<br>

      It's a toy version of the Newman motor&nbsp; Roll Eyes<br>

      Will Lajeunesse of Canada traveled to Brazil where he witnessed
      numerous demonstrations of the Keppe Motor.&nbsp; He also attended
      their demo in San Diego.&nbsp; Recommends their manual and kit.<br>
      <br>
      The first Keppe Motor public demonstration in Cambuquira Brazil,
      July 6, 2008.&nbsp; They wrapped the motor in foil because this
      was the first time the motor was shown in public, and the also the
      first time the media was present. The patents had not been secured
      at this time, so it was decide not to allow public photos of the
      inside workings of the motor.<br>
      <br>
      Will Lajeunesse of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and his friend,
      Susan Berkley, who has been a member of the group for over 20
      years and lives in New York City.<br>
      <br>
      The following is an email received on Jan. 24, 2009.&nbsp; The
      Keppe motor purportedly consumes just 7% of the energy to put out
      as much torque as conventional motors.<br>
      <br>
      Dear Mr. Allan,<br>
      <br>
      I enjoyed very much your interview on Coast to Coast AM and it is
      very good to hear of a person doing such good work, helping
      humanity find solutions to one of its largest problems. <br>
      <br>
      I am not sure if you have heard of the Keppe Motor yet, but there
      have been some discussions about it at overunity.com.
      Unfortunately some folks there do not do their proper research and
      jump to unfair and even destructive conclusions about the Keppe
      Motor and the scientists behind it. <br>
      <br>
      The Keppe Motor is not a rip off of the Bendini, Newman motor nor
      any other motor for that matter. Yes, it is similar to these
      motors but it is very different in key ways. In addition, the
      Brazilian Government asked the Keppe Motor team to accompany a
      Brazilian delegation to Poznan, Poland for the UN Climate Change
      Conference in Poznan, Poland.<br>
      <br>
      I have done my proper research and traveled to Sao Paulo Brazil
      &amp; San Diego to see this fantastic device and especially to
      meet the people behind it. I can tell you Sir, that this group of
      researchers is one of the finest in the world and they are not
      trying to deceive anyone. I have seen demonstrations of the Keppe
      motor many, many times and I can confirm and prove that it is what
      they say it is and they have the data to back it up. They have
      many working prototypes and even offer the manual &amp; small
      experimental kit for sale online. <br>
      <br>
      The Keppe Motor Manual is only $50.00 and it's over 44 pages long,
      full of scientific explanations and how to build your own Keppe
      Motor step-by-step. It is very cheap to build and takes little
      effort, very simple concepts and design. However this is a working
      model only and needs much more development before it is integrated
      into everyday uses. The pre-assembled kit is also for sale, and
      considering what this motor can do, it is a bargain at $350.00 US.
      However it is not necessary to spend that much money to own your
      own Keppe Motor as one should consider first building their own
      motor via the manual. They even include a parts list for free on
      their web site before you buy the manual. This is to show that
      they have nothing to hide and that they are honest.<br>
      <br>
      The Keppe Motor stands apart from all other electromagnetic motors
      thus far. It has both the torque &amp; high RPMs needed to be
      practical, and it runs cold! Yes sir, I have touched the motor
      directly many times after lengthy demonstrations, and it was cold
      every time. As you know, this violates the laws of physics that we
      are taught in school, yet I experienced it for myself many times.
      In addition, when one Keppe Motor is running next to another, the
      second motor begins to turn as well, at a lower speed. If you
      connect multiple Keppe Motors together they become much more
      efficient, and I have also seen this many times.<br>
      <br>
      I own a copy of the Keppe Motor Manual and I am also currently
      building my own for testing/development purposes. I have become
      good friends with many of the people behind this new technology
      and I am now helping them promote it. I would like to send you the
      Keppe Motor Manual PDF for your review. Due to the legal terms of
      use, I cannot just send you a copy for free, so I am paying for it
      out of my own pocket. I also do not wish to steal from this
      beautiful group of people who work very hard every day to help
      humanity and need our support. I ask only that you please do not
      distribute this manual as they need to raise funds for further
      development.<br>
      <br>
      I look forward to your opinion of the manual and the device if you
      choose to build it. We could certainly use your help getting the
      word out. Please see my Google Video link for the first Keppe
      Motor public demonstration located in Cambuquira Brazil. I took
      this footage myself, at approx 6:20 into the demonstration, you
      will see and hear this motor run.<br>
      <br>
      The demo was on July 6, 2008, the first time the motor was
      released for public demos. I was there. The media was also there
      including local TV stations and newspapers. The public was very
      interested; and the motor was received very well. The group of
      scientists who created the Keppe Motor, including Dr. Keppe, are
      very well known in their communities and throughout Latin America.

      <br>
      Hello everyone,<br>
      <br>
      I have viewed all of the videos presented here and I am sad to say
      that what is being presented is a very cleverly devised promotion
      of another inventor's work. The air-core stator designs are not
      new and the switching technique is one in which I am very familiar
      with. Does this mean I am saying that they are indeed mine? No
      they most certainly are not.<br>
      <br>
      In the midst of an energy and economic crisis of epic proportions,
      it is with great disappointment for me to see people trying to
      take advantage of a vulnerable public desperately seeking out new
      more affordable and cleaner energy solutions. <br>
      <br>
      Is the Keppe book "The New Physics" being given out for free? No
      it is not. Obviously Dr. Keppe is trying to promote his book as
      are the editors of this book as well. The Keppe Motor is merely a
      ploy to generate interest in his books. Books he intends to make a
      great deal of profit off of. <br>
      <br>
      What does one of the real inventors think of "The Keppe Motor"? I
      will allow him to speak for himself. <br>

      "Rick,<br>
      <br>
      Here is my response to the copy Window motor.<br>
      <br>
      It would be nice if you would give credit where it is due. As I
      and Ron Cole are the real inventor's of this motor, it's called
      the window motor as I have shown for many years. If you think not,
      just type Window Motor into Google under Bedini Window Motor. Why
      don't you show the switching circuit or explain it? Also it could
      only be MY circuits that capture this energy for recovery into the
      second or third battery. The second switching circuit could only
      be the bi-polar switcher circuit on the internet. Let's get real,
      it's not a<br>
      good deal to take others work and call it your own!!!!!<br>
      <br>
      The only other motor is Joe Newman's energy machine which uses
      contact switching which you do not have, so the only other way to
      capture Radiant or Scalar energy is the Bedini SG circuit, why
      because you can stop it without any current input or heating.The
      funny thing is everybody knows who put all the diagrams on the
      internet, my patents clearly show the switching in the Mono Pole
      motor and all the documentation on the internet surely shows no
      capacitor but a diode or bridge collecting the excess energy.<br>
      <br>
      This is what is wrong with humanity as to why you are very limited
      in what can be done with your re-invented machine, the world will
      know the truth some day. If you find you are in disagreement with
      what I have said here it can be worked out as to who the real
      inventor's are. It really burns my ass what great men of science
      do with others work.You can not call this your motor at all, and
      it is plain theft of my circuits and motor which are protected in
      my patents. I would have wished we could have started on a better
      foot, post your circuit's and rotor magnet arrangement let's
      see!!!!!!!!! It's been on my internet pages forever.<br>

      <br>
      On Oct. 20, 2008 Sterling D. Allan conducted a live, 1-hour
      interview with Cesar Soos, Eduardo Castela, and Richard Jones from
      the Keppe Motor group as part of the Free Energy Now radio show.
      The interview turned into a business brainstorming discussing
      about how the technology can be rolled out in an open source
      model.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">How it Works</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      According to the company, in the Keppe Motor the movement is
      mainly caused by the secondary component of electrical energy,
      which comes directly from the energetic scalar field of space,
      being that the electrical energy used is only to give a start to
      the process of capturing this energy. And as a consequence,
      because it has little consumption of electrical energy, the motor
      does not heat and because the energy it uses is in accordance with
      nature, it can benefit from it.<br>
      <br>
      To move a fan that generally uses 60-80 watts, the Keppean motor
      utilizes only 3 watts, an energy consumption 20 times less than
      normal. The Keppe Motor never heats up even when using high
      voltage such as 110 and 220 volts. It can greatly reduce the
      consumption of the motor adding spirals in its solenoid being that
      a small battery of 12 volts and 1.3 amps lasted 48 hours turning a
      fan.<br>
      <br>
      A larger model that was built began to spin with only .6 watts and
      reaches a velocity of 3,000 RPMs comsuming only 15 watts and with
      a good comparison to other motors.<br>
      <br>
      Primary source of energy: scalar or essential energy (from space).<br>
      Secondary source of energy: battery or electrical current used
      only to give the initial start.<br>
      Motor heating: none.<br>
      Environmental pollution: none.<br>
      Operating area: any place on the planet because it is not
      dependent on other sources of energy such as atomic,
      hydroelectric, eolic (wind) or coal.<br>
      RPM: adjustable in accordance with the applied voltage. 3500 RPMs
      has already been accomplished with a motor whose rotor weighs 400
      grams and consumes 15 watts and 4500 RPMs with a 250 gram rotor.<br>
      Torque: a minimum of 5 times greater than the best conventional
      motors.<br>
      Efficiency: depending on the dimensions can be 20 times greater
      than normal motors. <br>
      <br>
      Iron cores of conventional electric motors are no longer
      necessary, eliminating hysteresis loss;<br>
      Heat loss caused by electrical currents flowing through the coils
      (Joule effect) is minimized;<br>
      Heat loss from induced currents (eddy currents) caused by the
      movement of magnetic fields inside the metallic body of the motor
      is eliminated. <br>

      motor able to considerably increase the electromagnetic and/or
      mechanic potential energy available to be used in any piece of

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention refers to a cold and high efficiency
      electromagnetic motor capable of increasing considerably the
      electromagnetic and/or mechanical potential energy available to be
      utilized in any piece of equipment supplied with primary forms of
      energy. More specifically, the invention refers to a motor, or
      even a generator, which comprises structure and functioning
      characteristics that reduce the consumption of electrical energy
      and, at the same time, produces similar mechanical potential
      energy and torque to conventional motors. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the motor, object of the present invention has a more
      simplified structure that can be applied to any electrical device,
      specially those called electrical receptors, designed to produce,
      at least, the same power efficiency, but consuming less energy,
      without risks of overheating the equipment and, yet, reducing
      manufacture costs of the said devices. <br>
      <br>
      Besides, the electromagnetic motor of the present invention solves
      a number of today's problems related to the use of conventional
      energy sources and the scarceness of electric energy, for it has
      the ability to deliver the same power, consuming less energy. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Many types of electromagnetic motors are known today, and they are
      designed to deliver mechanical power - torque, from the
      interaction of magnetic components of a closed circuit supplied
      with electric current. All these motors known at the present state
      of the art are developed according to scientific principles, laws
      and theories pertaining to traditional physics and electricity,
      and considered universal, natural and inflexible laws, i.e.,
      immutable. Nevertheless, scientific theories are limited to the
      understanding of the scientists who elaborated them, for example:
      Newton's laws, Ohm's laws, etc. <br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it must be clear that a different perspective of the
      conventional scientific philosophy can lead to a new understanding
      of physics and an upgraded technology, which is able to give a
      practical solution to problems which are, so far, considered as
      intrinsic factors to a specific physical process. <br>
      <br>
      More precisely, the most utilized electromagnetic motors today are
      the induction motors and the electric motors with rotor coils. <br>
      <br>
      In general, the induction motors comprise a cylinder rotor made of
      metal (aluminum, for example) - or shorted out coils mounted on
      the said metallic cylinder, surrounded by electromagnets which are
      fed with electric AC current to generate a first variable magnetic
      field, so as to obtain electromagnetic induction. The magnetic
      field produces a current on the surface of the metallic cylinder
      (or shorted out coils), which, in turn, produces its own magnetic
      field. These two magnetic fields interact, by pulling and pushing
      each other, causing the cylinder to rotate and, consequently,
      deliver the mechanical power to the rotor shaft. <br>
      <br>
      The electric motors with rotor coils comprise a number of copper
      wire coils mounted both on a metallic cylinder rotor and a stator,
      through which, usually flows an alternating electric current (AC),
      generating magnetic fields that attract and repel each other in
      semi cycles of 180[deg.], describing a typical sinusoidal wave
      function. Due to the polarity alternation of the magnetic field,
      the rotor spins and delivers mechanical power. <br>
      <br>
      According to the state of the art the electromagnetic motors are
      usually based on two phenomena, as follows: 1) when we apply
      electric current through a conducting wire, the magnetic field is
      generated by the conducting material; and 2) if a conducting wire
      is exposed to a variable magnetic field, it will present an
      electric potential difference in both of its ends, and the
      electric current generated inside the conductor generates, in
      turn, a magnetic field which opposes to the external field that
      caused it. <br>
      <br>
      In addition to that, the electric motors of the present state of
      the art are constantly fed with electricity, in order to generate
      the polarity alternation of the magnetic components intending to
      obtain the attraction/repulsion effect. Obviously, this process,
      in order to keep the rotor spinning under load (torque applied to
      the shaft), requires high energy consumption. As consequence, heat
      losses are inevitable. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, as exposed hereinbefore, particularly due to the action-
      reaction interactions, one verifies that the electromagnetic
      motors are said to have intrinsic heat losses, which are
      impossible to be avoided. In other words, the alternating magnetic
      fields produced by the passage of alternating electric current
      through the stator and rotor coils of the motors cause them to
      heat up in the same proportion to the intensity and variation rate
      of these fields. Because of that, when an electric motor is fed by
      any kind of power supply - either battery or AC power public grid
      - the simple free-load spin of the shaft involves some mechanical
      torque, which reacts to the electric power supply circuit and
      represents a line voltage drop, against the feeding energy of the
      motor, tending to stop it. This voltage drop is technically known
      as counter electromotive force (back emf). <br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, to each mechanical load added to the line of the
      motor, the extra electric power required to overcome it will
      represent an increase in the back emf, i.e., a resistance
      increase. As consequence to that, the temperature of the windings
      rises and causes the efficiency of the motor to drop. In case the
      mechanical load is too high and exceeds its design limit value,
      overheating takes place and the motor burns. <br>
      <br>
      In this sense, one can remark that the continuous supply of
      electricity (AC or DC) to the conventional motors involves a
      series of problems, especially those related to overheating and
      performance drop. <br>
      <br>
      According to the scientific theories utilized to develop these
      electromagnetic motors, four intrinsic and opposing forces to the
      movement of the motor are considered, as follows: counter
      electromotive force, magnetic drag, hysteresis and eddy currents.
      All of these resistive forces result in heating and possible
      burning of the motors when they are subjected to heavy loads, for
      they demand continuous electric supply from the power source. <br>
      <br>
      After the above explanations, the inventors claim, in spite of
      acknowledging the theoretical concepts known today, and complement
      that the same are incomplete, because they ignore the essential
      physical characteristics of the magnetic matter and/or electric
      conductive matter in regard to its function of capturing energy
      from the environment, as well as the structure of the
      electromagnetic fields, the concepts of voltage and electric
      current and their deficiencies. Taking into consideration that the
      motors of the present state of the art are said to have these
      resistive forces as intrinsic to their functioning, today's
      projects are oversized and their electric consumption is more
      elevated than they should, which contributes to cause negative
      impact over the environment. As technicians in the field are
      aware, one of the main problems in the world today is the
      scarceness of natural resources for power generation, besides the
      quantity of pollutants sent off to the atmosphere caused by the
      burning of fossil fuels. <br>
      <br>
      In order to briefly clarify the bases of the invention, according
      to the theories and concepts researched and developed by Keppe
      (refer to "The New Physics Derived From A Disinverted
      Metaphysics", Keppe, Norberto da Rocha, published 1996, Proton
      Publishing House, Paris) the present invention is based on the
      hypothesis that matter captures and transforms immaterial energy,
      called essential energy, into secondary forms of energy, namely
      electricity and magnetism. <br>
      <br>
      In short, besides other concepts explored by Keppe, the author
      holds that the essential energy, in the case of the magnetic
      fields, is twofold and bidirectional, i.e., it always acts in two
      equal components, but in opposite and complimentary directions. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically, what we know as voltage according to
      traditional concepts, for Keppe, means essential energy itself, so
      that when electric current flows through a conducting wire, caused
      by an electric potential difference between its terminals, in
      fact, just one component of the essential energy is in use. One
      simply ignores the power of the second component of the essential
      energy. As consequence to that, because this second component is
      totally discarded, the motors of the present state of the art
      present heat loss inconveniences. In other words, the
      electromagnetic motors of the present state of the art utilize the
      energy generated by the magnetic field during the electric current
      input, ignoring or discarding the second component of the
      essential energy, i.e., the back energy derived from the
      collapsing of the magnetic field, which also involves higher
      voltage/current peaks in opposite direction to those supplied by
      the power supply. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Therefore, intending to overcome deficiencies and solve the
      problems hereinbefore mentioned in relation to the electric motors
      of the state of the art, the electromagnetic motor, object of the
      present invention, was developed. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically, it is the goal of the present invention an
      electromagnetic motor that can replace any other motor powered by
      primary forms of energy such as electric, electromagnetic,
      mechanic, nuclear, piezoelectric, sonic, thermal, luminous,
      hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, electromagnetic induction,
      combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, etc., preferably those
      designed to deliver torque. <br>
      Yet, another goal of the invention is an electromagnetic motor
      with technical and functional characteristics that can diminish,
      or even eliminate in specific cases, the resistive forces acting
      against the movement of the rotor through the application of the
      concepts developed by Keppe. <br>
      <br>
      Yet, the present invention has for goal an electromagnetic motor
      which, besides utilizing the energy generated by the electric
      current flow inside the wires of a coil, captures and uses the
      essential energy in its complete form, i.e., a motor designed to
      capture and use the two components of the essential energy trapped
      in the magnetic fields. <br>
      <br>
      In this way, it is the goal of the invention an electromagnetic
      motor that does not heat up and makes it possible for the
      manufacture of wireless versions of many electric household
      appliances which are traded only with wires and currently designed
      be plugged to 110/220V domestic electric outlets, like for
      example, fans, vacuum cleaners, mixers, etc. <br>
      <br>
      It is also object of the invention an electromagnetic motor that
      enhances the useful life of conventional batteries utilized in
      wireless devices and power tools, without diminishing their
      mechanical power. <br>
      Yet, the electromagnetic motor of the invention is more efficient,
      which reduces considerably the manufacturing costs of electric
      equipment that embodies motors, for it is possible to reduce their
      size and, consequently use less material to manufacture them.
      Additionally, it is the objective of the invention a motor that
      can be adapted to work as a power generator, small or big, and
      help save energy in electric power plants based on primary driving
      energies such as radioactive material, water potential, wind
      potential, sun, coal etc. The electromagnetic motor according to
      the invention can, still, be easily adapted to replace hybrid
      (fuel/electricity) motors currently developed for the car,
      nautical and aircraft industry, for its capacity and work
      potential are considerably superior to those of the conventional
      motors, in addition to consuming less electric energy. <br>
      <br>
      In order to reach the goals hereinbefore proposed, the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention is equipped to
      utilize the essential energy in its integrality, particularly its
      second component, here called back component, or back energy,
      which is obtained both 1) through the collapse of the magnetic
      field caused by draining off the energy trapped inside the stator
      coils when the electric current input ceases and 2) the high
      voltage peaks caused by switching on and off the input current to
      the coils. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the electromagnetic motor of the present
      invention works with electric current pulses provided by a power
      supply in closed circuit that feeds the wires of stator coils,
      inside which there is a magnetic rotor. The pulses are controlled
      by means of sensors duly positioned so as to determine the exact
      instant of the pulses, making possible the capturing and
      harnessing of the said back energy. <br>

      integrality. Besides the energy generated to power the stator coil
      during the electric current input, it also captures and uses the
      back energy derived from the collapse of the magnetic field when
      the energy supply is switched off and the magnetic energy of the
      said stator coil is drained off. <br>
      <br>
      More precisely, the electromagnetic motor of the present invention
      is equipped with simple structure features which were developed
      according to principles outlined by Norberto da Rocha Keppe, in
      the book hereinbefore mentioned. <br>
      <br>
      The present invention has for goal an electromagnetic motor that
      generates work and mechanical torque with potential, at least
      equivalent to that of the conventional motors of the state of the
      art, but consuming less electric energy, for the electric power
      supply is not constant. <br>
      <br>
      More preferably, in the first working model of the invention, the
      electromagnetic motor shown in Figure 1 is comprised of a stator 1
      constituted by a coil 2 made with conducting wires whose terminals
      T1 and T2 are respectively connected to the positive pole P1 and
      negative P2 of a power supply 3, so that between the terminal T2
      and the negative pole P2 there is a on/off switch 4 properly
      positioned on the side and close to the end of the shaft 5 of the
      magnetic rotor 6. <br>
      <br>
      The said shaft 5 is positioned at the center and forming a right
      angle with the body of the stator 1 , through the ball bearings 7,
      so that inside the body of the said stator 1 , the shaft 5
      supports the rotor 6, which is comprised of at least one permanent
      magnet. <br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the coil 2 is formed by the windings of a conducting
      wire, such as copper or aluminum, in two sectors with preferably
      the same number of turns and axially positioned apart from one
      another. Figure 1 shows the said sectors A and B connected to each
      other and winded apart around the stator body 1. <br>
      <br>
      The number of turns of each sector A and B of the coil 2 is set
      according to the specifications of the design, for this factor is
      essential to create the magnetic field desired and, consequently,
      the power of the motor to be developed. <br>
      <br>
      Yet, according to the attached sketches and a specific design of
      the invention, the electromagnetic motor is powered by pulses of
      DC current (from batteries or rectified AC current) with duration
      times depending on the design. This arrangement is different from
      the electromagnetic motors of the state of the art that use the
      alternation of AC sinusoidal signals to produce the magnetic field
      and, consequently the incompatibility of the magnetic polarities
      and rotation of the rotor shaft. In addition to that, in one of
      the shaft ends 5, outside the stator body 1 , an actuator 8 is
      properly positioned to turn on and off the on/off switch 4 when
      the shaft 5 rotates. Preferably, the said actuator 8 is a
      permanent magnet whose magnetic field lies at right angle to the
      rotation shaft 5, and the said on/off switch 4 is a Reed-type
      switch that responds to the presence of the said magnetic field.
      The actuator 8 can be replaced to suit other switches 4 like Hall
      sensors, optic sensors or even discarded in the case of PWM
      pulsating circuits. Thus, when the shaft 5 of the rotor 6 rotates,
      the said actuator 8 turns on the switch 4, opening and closing the
      electric circuit of the electromagnetic motor of the invention, so
      as to provide electric current pulses to power the stator coil. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, one (or more) synchronous pulsating electromagnet 9
      can be properly positioned to help speed up the rotation of the
      rotor 6. The said electromagnet 9 is preferably made of a soft
      iron core enveloped by a number of turns of conducting wire which
      generates a magnetic field to help the incompatibility between the
      polarities and the magnetic poles of the rotor 6, thus causing
      them to repel one another. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically in regard to the sequence of sketches shown in
      Figures 2A, 2B and 2C, the electromagnetic motor of the invention
      works in the following way: the actuator 8, attached to the end of
      the shaft 5 of the rotor 6 is positioned and adjusted so that its
      magnetic field, when closing the on/off switch 4, is at a precise
      point where the angle of the shaft of the rotor 6, in relation to
      the magnetic field lines of the stator coil, is [alpha] =
      -X&lt;0&gt;, as shown in Figure 2A. In this exact position, the
      magnet of the rotor 6 starts its cycle of attraction, tending to
      its neutral point, where [alpha] = 0[deg.] in relation to the
      magnetic field lines of the stator coil, to immediately afterwards
      enter the drag region, whose tendency is to stop it due to the
      polarity of the magnetic field generated by the coil 2 and the
      polarity of the rotor 6. At the moment the rotor 6 reaches its
      neutral point, i.e., where [alpha] = 0[deg.], as indicated in
      Figure 2B and is ready to enter the drag region, the on/off switch
      4 is switched off. <br>
      <br>
      At this moment when the on/off switch 4 is off, the force of the
      magnetic drag ceases. Nevertheless, immediately after this neutral
      point, where [alpha] = +X[deg.], indicated in Figure 2C, the
      opposing force or back energy caused by the collapse of the
      magnetic field inside the stator coil 2 acts upon the rotor 6,
      inverting the polarity of the magnetic field and forcing the rotor
      6 to move away in the attempt to reach equilibrium or the neutral
      point of the movement of the rotor. It must be clarified that such
      effect is a combined effect between the energy gained by the
      observed negative peaks of voltage (and current) provoked by
      turning on and off the switch 4, and the magnetic energy derived
      from the collapse of the magnetic field, which inverts polarity of
      the field trapped in the coil, thus exerting a force of repulsion
      upon the magnetic rotor 6. As indicated in Figures 2A and 2C the
      representative lines X of magnetic field invert direction,
      provoking the polarity inversion of the magnetic field of the coil
      2. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, according to the construction described above, the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention provokes two
      phenomena almost at the same time due to the short time interval
      between the electric current pulses generated. First, when the
      on/off switch 4 is turned on, the battery feeds the stator coil of
      the motor that builds up a magnetic field proportional to the
      supplied voltage, which attracts the magnet of the rotor to the
      position of equilibrium - immediately after that, the second
      phenomenon takes place, when the on/off switch 4 is turned off,
      causing the magnetic field of the coil to collapse, which is
      responsible, together with the extra energy caused by the negative
      voltage peaks mentioned before, for the generation of the back
      energy, i.e., the second component of the essential energy trapped
      inside the coil and built up by the first component supplied by
      the power source. One can easily verify with the help of a scope,
      that the voltage corresponding to this back energy ranges from 10
      to 20 times more than the supply voltage of the first component. <br>
      <br>
      Besides this evident power gain due to the back energy, the fact
      of pulsating DC current, preferably supplied by a battery, without
      phase alternation like in the case of AC current supply, gives the
      following results: i) minimized counter electromotive force in the
      case of constant and low torque applications, for the magnetic
      rotor rotates freely along more than half the rotor cycle; ii)
      minimized drag, for the magnetic field of the stator coil is
      turned off immediately after the rotor magnet 6 passes the point
      of equilibrium, which lets it rotate freely until other pulses are
      applied at specific points; iii) zero hysteresis, for pulsed DC
      has no polarity alternation to affect the magnetic dipoles of iron
      cores. In addition, the motor of the present invention requires no
      iron cores in many applications; iv) minimized eddy currents,
      because the magnetic fields created inside the coil 2 - both
      during power supply and back energy supply are parallel to the
      body of the motor, thus yielding close-to-zero induced currents.
      In addition, the stator bodies of the motor of the present
      invention can be made of light non-metallic and/or plastic-like
      materials that greatly reduce the negative effects of eddy
      currents. <br>
      <br>
      Besides the reduction and/or elimination of hysteresis and eddy
      currents losses, the inventors remark that heat losses in the
      conductors caused by the Joule effect are also greatly minimized
      because the magnetic rotor in movement, builds up and maintains
      its own alternating magnetic field inside the stator coils, which,
      together with the second component of the essential energy,
      maintains more magnetic energy trapped in the stator coils, thus
      reducing the current flow necessary to apply the same torque to
      the shaft. Consequently, there is no considerable temperature
      rise, which improves both efficiency and useful life of the motor,
      for there is no risk of overheating. <br>
      <br>
      Besides this, as one can observe, during the functioning of the
      electromagnetic motor according to the invention, the power supply
      3 is not constantly active, for it only inputs energy into the
      circuit when the pulses are given by the actuator 8 upon the
      on/off switch 4. As result, the consumption of the battery is
      greatly reduced when compared to the motors of the state of the
      art, and this allows new battery-built-in designs for currently
      non-portable equipment. Thus, in short, the electromagnetic motor,
      object of the invention, is designed in principle to capture and
      harness energy generated by the collapse of the magnetic field
      which takes place when the energy contained in the coil 2 is
      drained off. Such energy is responsible for the inversion of
      polarity of the magnetic field that acts upon the magnetic rotor.
      <br>
      <br>
      Figures 3 and 4 illustrate alternative constructions comprised of
      a series of electromagnetic motors according to the present
      invention. Figure 3 shows the combination of a series of rotors
      6&lt;1&gt; sitting side by side along the same shaft 5'. Each
      rotor 6' rests inside its own stator coil, so as to add torque at
      the shaft ends. <br>
      <br>
      This design is particularly used for power equipment with
      longitudinal bodies, because the association of individual torques
      in the same shaft adds. This combination can work with lower
      voltages than those used for conventional motors and thus operate
      with batteries and reach high efficiency. In addition, the use of
      higher voltages increases torque considerably. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 is a sketch of another combination of motors
      interconnected by means of gears 10, which depending on their
      rate, can increase or diminish torque (or speed) at the ends of
      the rotating shaft. <br>
      <br>
      Through this alternative design, the phenomenon of resonance
      causes the motors to interact with one another at distance, still
      increasing the efficiency of the mechanical system as a whole. In
      other words, besides the action of the coils upon the magnetic
      rotors, the entire system benefits from the resonance between the
      magnetic rotors. As result, torque and consumption are optimized.
      More specifically Figures 5A, 5B and 5C depict alternative designs
      for the electromagnetic motor of the present invention, all of
      them with the purpose of achieving better efficiency and
      consequently work capacity. In these assemblies one observes that
      the disposition of the coils is altered to increase the number of
      pulses that generate voltage peaks and electric current along one
      cycle of the rotor. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 5A illustrates an assembly in which coil 2 is comprised of
      four sectors axially positioned and 90 degrees out of phase, so
      that two pulses are generated along the rotation cycle of rotor 6.
      This is called biphasic assembly. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 5B shows an assembly in which the coil comprises six
      sectors out of phase with each other, so that the feeding pulses
      of electric current are applied in three specific points of the
      rotation cycle of the rotor. In this case the electromagnetic
      motor is called triphasic assembly. Figure 5C shows a construction
      in which the coil 2 is divided into eight out-of-phase sectors,
      which requires four pulsation points along the rotation cycle of
      the rotor, being called tetraphasic assembly. <br>
      <br>
      These arrangements are more compact, and their configurations take
      advantage of more pulses (direct and back - in both directions of
      the coil) along the same cycle of the rotor, which speeds up the
      rotor and stabilizes torque when heavier loads are applied to the
      shaft. <br>
      <br>
      As a practical example of the advantages and technical effects
      given by the electromagnetic motor according to the present
      invention when compared to the conventional motors known in the
      state of the art, one can utilize any electrical receptor like for
      example a domestic fan. <br>
      <br>
      A typical and regular medium size domestic fan found in the market
      today is designed to consume around 120W of energy (P). The
      voltage (U) of the public power grid used for such devices is
      usually 127V (or 220V). Let's consider it 120V for easy
      calculation. Therefore, according to basic electrical theories,
      the electric current (i) flowing through the motor of this fan is
      1 Amp, because: i = P / U = 120W / 120V = 1A <br>
      <br>
      In other words, this electric appliance requires 1 Ampere of
      electric current to produce 120W power, which rotates the fan at a
      certain speed. When this motor of the state of the art was
      actually replaced by one equivalent electromagnetic motor of the
      present invention, it was possible to obtain the same mechanical
      work (i.e., the fan rotating at the same speed) with two 12V
      batteries in series (24V total voltage) and only 0.5 Amp flowing
      through the motor of the fan. Therefore, the power required by the
      motor of the fan to produce the same mechanical work was: <br>
      <br>
      P = U x i = 24 x 0.5 = 12W <br>
      <br>
      The comparison between the two fans, one with the conventional
      motor of the state of the art and the other with the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention, revealed that this
      latter is about ten times more efficient (consumed 10 times less
      energy) than the motor of the current state of the art, due to the
      fact that the electromagnetic motor of the present invention is
      able to harness the back energy captured by the voltage peaks
      together with the collapse of the magnetic field trapped inside
      the coil, when the electric power supply is turned on and off at
      precise positions, as mentioned hereinbefore. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the rotation shaft of the electromagnetic motor in
      concern can be attached to a mechanism that, through the
      mechanical torque generated by the motor, works as a power
      generator. In addition, the adaptation in concern can be attached
      to, or even replace generators ran on primary sources of energy.
      Although the present invention is described in relation to the
      motors utilized in devices called electric receptors, it is
      possible, also, to wind a second coil around the first coil, so
      that the second coil captures the back energy by induction and
      stores it in capacitors, recharges batteries or uses it for
      torque. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, in regard to all of what has been exposed hereinbefore, it
      is clear that the electromagnetic motor, object of the present
      invention, can obtain a substantial energy gain, due to voltage
      peaks and magnetic field collapses, as well as considerable
      reduction of losses, considered intrinsic to the motors of the
      current state of the art.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention refers to a cold and high efficiency
      electromagnetic motor capable of increasing considerably the
      electromagnetic and/or mechanical potential energy available to be
      used in all equipment supplied with energy in a primary forms.
      More specifically, the invention refers to a motor, or even a
      generator, which comprises structure and functioning
      characteristics that reduce the consumption of electrical energy
      and, at the same time, produces equivalent and even superior
      mechanical potential and torque in relation to conventional
      motors. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the motor, object of the present invention has a more
      simplified structure that can be applied to any electrical device,
      specially those called electrical receptors, designed to produce,
      at least, the same power efficiency, but consuming less energy,
      without risks of overheating the equipment and, yet, reducing
      manufacture costs of the said devices. <br>
      <br>
      Besides, the electromagnetic motor of the present invention solves
      a number of today's problems related to the use of conventional
      energy sources and the scarceness of electric energy, for it has
      the ability to deliver the same power, consuming less energy. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      Many types of electromagnetic motors are known today, and they are
      designed to deliver mechanical power - torque, from the
      interaction of magnetic components of a closed circuit supplied
      with electric current. All these motors known in the prior art are
      developed according to scientific principles, laws and theories
      pertaining to traditional physics and electricity, and considered
      universal, natural and inflexible laws, i.e., immutable.
      Nevertheless, scientific theories are limited to the understanding
      of the scientists who elaborated them, for example: Newton's laws,
      Ohm's laws, laws of thermodynamic, etc. <br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it must be clear that a different perspective of the
      conventional scientific philosophy can lead to a new understanding
      of physics and an upgraded technology, which is able to give a
      practical solution to problems which are, so far, considered as
      intrinsic factors to a specific physical process. <br>
      <br>
      In this context, it is worth to mention that the machines have
      basically, as a principle, the consumption and transformation of a
      certain type of energy in, basically energy considered as loss,
      usually heat, inherent to its functioning and, in the availability
      of any other type of energy that is considered useful to the aimed
      finality. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, it is also known that electric motors are defined as
      machines that are powered by energy in its electric form supplied
      by a power source, i.e., the mains power supply with alternating
      current (single-phase, bi-phase, three- phase) or batteries and
      solar cells with direct current, in such a way that the referred
      electric energy is transformed in energy in its heat form,
      denominated as a loss provoked by attrition, magnetic drag,
      hysteresis, eddy currents, joule effects, etc., and finally by the
      energy supply in its mechanical form, useful and available for
      work that is related to the torque and rotation of the motor
      shaft. Conversely, it is also known that electric generators are
      powered by some type of primary energy, as for example, chemical
      combustion (diesel, gasoline, gas, alcohol, etc) or mechanical
      (hydraulic power, wind power, etc.), and transform in losses in
      the form of heat and electric current in the output to feed other
      equipment. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, in machines of such a nature, its yield or efficiency is
      calculated by the ratio between the output and the input. Merely
      as an illustration, if a motor consumes 60W of the mains power
      supply and produces 3OW of mechanical work, its efficiency is
      given by the ratio 30W/60W, that corresponds to 0.5 or expressed
      in percentage, 50%. <br>
      <br>
      The same way, the generator that is powered by 1 KW of mechanical
      power that can be supplied by a waterfall with constant "Q" flow
      in m&lt;3&gt;/s, from a "h" height and that generates 850W of
      electric energy in the output will have an efficiency of
      850W/1.000W, that corresponds to an efficiency of 0.85, or in
      percentage, 85%. <br>
      <br>
      In this context, there are many types of electric motors, however
      the electromagnetic motors which are currently the most used due
      to its easy construction are known as induction motors that,
      however, have a squirrel-cage type rotor or a coil rotor. <br>
      <br>
      In general, the cage rotor induction motors comprise a cylinder
      rotor made of metal (aluminum, for example) - or shorted out coils
      mounted on the said metallic cylinder, surrounded by
      electromagnets which are fed with electric AC current to generate
      a first variable magnetic field, so as to obtain electromagnetic
      induction. The magnetic field produces a current on the surface of
      the metallic cylinder (or shorted out coils), which, in turn,
      produces its own magnetic field. These two magnetic fields (from
      the rotor and the stator) interact, by pulling and pushing each
      other, causing the cylinder to rotate and, consequently, deliver
      the mechanical power to the rotor shaft. The electric motors with
      rotor coils comprise a number of copper wire coils mounted both on
      a metallic cylinder rotor and a stator, through which, usually
      flows an alternating electric current (AC), generating magnetic
      fields that attract and repel each other the variable fields of
      the rotor. Due to the polarity alternation of the magnetic field
      in synchronicity, the rotor spins and delivers mechanical power. <br>
      <br>
      According to the prior art the electromagnetic motors are usually
      based on two phenomena, as follows: 1) when we apply electric
      current through a conducting wire, the magnetic field is generated
      by the conducting material; and 2) if a conducting wire is exposed
      to a variable magnetic field, it will present an electric
      potential difference in both of its ends, and the electric current
      generated inside the conductor forms, in turn, a magnetic field
      which opposes to the external field that caused it. In addition to
      that, the electric motors of the prior art are constantly fed with
      electricity, in order to generate the polarity alternation of the
      magnetic components intending to obtain the attraction/repulsion
      effect. Obviously, this process, in order to keep the rotor
      spinning under load (torque applied to the shaft), requires high
      energy consumption. As consequence, heat losses are inevitable,
      i.e., with the so-called losses or transformation in heat energy.
      <br>
      <br>
      Thus, in view of the foregoing, particularly due to the action-
      reaction interactions, it is possible to note that the prior art
      electromagnetic motors considering that the intrinsic heat losses
      are impossible to <br>
      be avoided. In other words, the alternating magnetic fields
      produced by the passage of alternating electric current through
      the stator and rotor coils of the motors cause them to heat up in
      the same proportion to the intensity and variation rate of these
      fields. <br>
      <br>
      Because of that, when an electric motor is fed by any kind of
      power source - either battery or AC power public grid - the simple
      free-load spin of the shaft involves some mechanical torque, which
      reacts to the electric power supply circuit and represents a line
      voltage drop, against the feeding energy of the motor, tending to
      stop it. This voltage drop is technically known as counter
      electromotive force (back emf). Nevertheless, to each mechanical
      load added to the line of the motor, the extra electric power
      required to overcome it will represent an increase in the back
      emf, i.e., a resistance increase, in such a way that the feeding
      source supply more power in order to overcome the load resistance.
      As consequence to that, the temperature of the windings rises and
      causes the efficiency of the motor to drop. In case the mechanical
      load is too high and exceeds its project limit value, overheating
      takes place and the motor burns. <br>
      <br>
      In this sense, again it is observed that the continuous supply of
      electricity (AC or DC) to the conventional motors involves a
      series of problems, especially those related to the overheating
      and performance drop. <br>
      <br>
      According to the scientific theories utilized to develop these
      electromagnetic motors, four intrinsic and opposing forces to the
      movement of the motor are considered, as follows: counter
      electromotive force, magnetic drag, hysteresis and eddy currents.
      All of these resistive forces result in heating and possible
      burning of the motors when they are subjected to heavy loads, for
      they demand continuous electric supply from the power source. <br>
      <br>
      After the above explanations, the inventors claim, in spite of
      acknowledging the theoretical concepts known today, and complement
      that the same are incomplete, because they ignore the essential
      physical characteristics of the magnetic matter and/or electric
      conductive matter in regard to its function of capturing energy
      from the environment, as well as the structure of the
      electromagnetic fields, the concepts of voltage and electric
      current and their deficiencies. <br>
      <br>
      Taking into consideration that the motors of the state of the art
      are said to have these resistive forces as intrinsic to their
      functioning, today's projects are oversized and their electric
      consumption is more elevated than they should, which contributes
      to cause negative impact over the environment. <br>
      <br>
      As technicians in the field are aware, one of the main problems in
      the world today is the scarceness of natural resources for power
      generation, besides the quantity of pollutants discharged to the
      atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels. <br>
      <br>
      In order to briefly clarify the bases of the invention, according
      to the theories and concepts researched and developed by Keppe
      (refer to "The New Physics Derived From A Disinverted
      Metaphysics", Keppe, Norberto da Rocha, published 1996, Proton
      Publishing House, Paris) the present invention is based on the
      hypothesis that matter captures and transforms immaterial energy,
      called essential energy, into secondary forms of energy, namely
      electricity and magnetism. <br>
      <br>
      Summarizing, besides other concepts explored by Keppe, the author
      holds that the essential energy, in the case of the magnetic
      fields, is twofold and bidirectional, i.e., it always acts in two
      components, but in opposite and complimentary directions. More
      specifically, what we know as voltage according to traditional
      concepts, for Keppe, means essential energy itself, so that when
      electric current flows through a conducting wire, caused by an
      electric potential difference between its terminals, in fact, just
      one component of the essential energy is in use, ignoring the
      power and capacity of the second component of the essential
      energy. As consequence to that, because this second component is
      totally discarded, the motors of the current prior art present
      inconveniences related to heat loss. <br>
      In other words, the electromagnetic motors of the present state of
      the art utilize the energy generated by the magnetic field during
      the electric current input, ignoring or discarding the second
      component of the essential energy, i.e., the back energy,
      expressed by transients in the line, direct and reverse peaks, at
      the moment of the building up and collapsing of the magnetic field
      of the motor coils.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Therefore, intending to overcome deficiencies and solve the
      problems hereinbefore mentioned in relation to the electric motors
      of the prior art, the electromagnetic motor, object of the present
      invention, was developed. More specifically, it is the objective
      of the present invention an electromagnetic motor that can replace
      any other motor powered by primary forms of energy such as
      electric, electromagnetic, mechanic, nuclear, piezoelectric,
      sonic, thermal, luminous, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical,
      electromagnetic induction, combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels,
      etc., preferably those designed to deliver torque. <br>
      <br>
      Yet, another objective of the invention is an electromagnetic
      motor with technical and functional characteristics that can
      overcome, or even eliminate in specific cases, the resistive
      forces acting against the movement of the rotor through the
      application of the concepts developed by Keppe. Yet, the present
      invention has the objective of an electromagnetic motor which,
      besides utilizing the energy generated by the electric current
      flow inside the wires of a coil, captures and uses the essential
      energy in its complete form, i.e., a motor designed to capture and
      use the two components, action and complementation, according to
      Keppe, of the essential energy trapped in the magnetic fields. <br>
      <br>
      In this way, it is the objective of the invention an
      electromagnetic motor that does not heat up and makes it possible
      for the manufacture of wireless versions of many electric
      household appliances which are traded only with wires and
      currently designed be plugged to 110/220V domestic electric
      outlets, like for example, fans, vacuum cleaners, mixers and many
      other low power home appliances. <br>
      It is also object of the invention an electromagnetic motor that
      enhances the useful life of conventional batteries used in
      wireless devices and power tools, without reducing their
      mechanical power. <br>
      Yet, the electromagnetic motor of the invention is more efficient,
      which reduces considerably the manufacturing costs of electric
      equipment that embodies motors, for it is possible to reduce their
      size and, consequently use less material to manufacture them. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, it is the objective of the invention a motor that
      can be adapted to work as a power generator, small or big, and
      help save energy in electric power plants based on primary driving
      energies such as radioactive material, water potential, wind
      potential, sun, coal etc. Besides, it is the scope of the present
      invention a motor that can be used in its generator mode in order
      to recuperate the electromagnetic energy accumulated in the
      coil(s) and send it back to the coil(s), generating a second power
      source independently from the first source, which can be a
      battery, the mains power supply or any other. Most precisely, this
      alternative performance of the motor in the present invention can
      be denominated as an electromagnetic feedback system or
      electromagnetic turbo system, which comprises the coupling of one
      or more capacitors in the output of one or more coils of the basic
      embodiment of the motor object of this invention. The
      electromagnetic motor according to the invention can, still, be
      adapted to replace hybrid (fuel/electricity) motors currently
      developed for the car, nautical and aircraft industry, for its
      capacity and work potential are considerably superior to those of
      the conventional motors, in addition to consuming less electric
      energy as well as it allows the generation of feedback energy. <br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the above indicated objectives, the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention is equipped to use
      the essential energy in its integrality, particularly its second
      component, here called back component, back peak or back energy,
      which is obtained both 1) through the collapse of the magnetic
      field caused by draining off the energy trapped inside the stator
      coils when the electric current input ceases and 2) the high
      voltage peaks caused by switching on and off the input current to
      the coils. More specifically, the electromagnetic motor of the
      present invention works with electric direct current pulses
      provided by a power supply in closed circuit that feeds the wires
      of stator coils, inside which there is a magnetic rotor, coiled
      and made of permanent magnets. The pulses are controlled by means
      of sensors duly positioned so as to determine the exact instant of
      the pulses, making possible the capturing and harnessing of the
      said back energy. In the alternative construction, capacitors can
      be added to the motor line so that its work resonance can be
      achieved. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically the increase of work power in the motor-
      generator proposed in the alternative construction of the present
      invention is obtained when the motor initiates its movement
      through the primary mains power supply (rectified current) or
      through one or more batteries, that power, respectively the motor
      coil(s) through a pulse of energy that interact, on its (their)
      turn, with one or more magnetic or electromagnetic rotors fixed in
      the rotation shaft, resulting in the rotation of said shaft. In
      this sense, the alternating current generated in the terminals of
      said coil(s) that involves one or more rotating magnetic or
      electromagnetic rotors is rectified, in a half wave or complete
      wave and deviated to one or more capacitors, or even to a
      capacitor bank, that on their turn are able to accumulate a
      voltage superior to the input primary power voltage of the first
      motor pulse. This amplified voltage in the capacitor(s) is used as
      a second direct current power source, being completely independent
      from the primary power source and corresponding to the power
      (electricity) generator aspect of the present invention. The
      capacitor(s) positive and negative outputs are dully connected to
      the motor coil terminals that supply sufficient current and
      electric charge to power one or more extra pulses in the coil(s)
      when the rotor is in the appropriate phases in relation to them,
      in order to contribute to the rotation of the rotor. Finally, by
      coupling one or more motors/generators in the same shaft, with two
      coils duly connected in a series or in parallel, one in able to
      increase indefinitely the gain of energy produced by the generator
      aspect of the present construction in relation to the energy
      consumed by the motor aspect of the present construction. In other
      words, with the proposed feedback, the efficiency of the present
      motor is not limited anymore to only 100%. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The electromagnetic motor, object of the present invention
      comprises a structure that can use the essential energy in its
      integrality. Besides the energy generated to power the stator coil
      during the electric current input, it also captures and uses the
      back energy derived from the collapse of the magnetic field when
      the energy supply is switched off and the magnetic energy of the
      said stator coil is drained off. <br>
      <br>
      More precisely, the electromagnetic motor of the present invention
      comprises simple structure features which were developed according
      to principles outlined by Norberto da Rocha Keppe, in the book
      mentioned above. The present invention has for objective an
      electromagnetic motor that generates work and mechanical torque
      with potential, at least equivalent to the conventional motors of
      the prior art, but consuming less electric energy, since the
      electric power supply is not constant, and yet it can promote the
      feedback of the motor. More preferably, in the first embodiment of
      the invention, the electromagnetic motor shown in Figure 1 is
      comprised of a stator 1 constituted by a coil 2 made with
      conducting wires whose terminals T1 and T2 are respectively
      connected to the positive P1 and negative P2 poles of a power
      supply 3, so that between the terminal T2 and the negative pole P2
      there is a on/off key 4, or switch properly positioned on the side
      and close to the end of the shaft 5 of the magnetic rotor 6. <br>
      <br>
      The said shaft 5 is positioned at the center and forming a right
      angle with the body of the stator 1 , through the bearings 7, so
      that inside the body of the said stator 1 , the shaft 5 supports
      the rotor 6, which is comprised of at least one permanent magnet.
      <br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the coil 2 is formed by the windings of a conducting
      wire, such as copper or aluminum, in two sectors with preferably
      the same number of turns and axially or radially positioned apart
      from one another. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows the said sectors A and B connected to each other
      and winded apart around the stator body 1. <br>
      <br>
      The number of turns of each sector A and B of the coil 2 is set
      according to the specifications of the motor design in order to
      reach the resonance of the rotor/coil(s) pair, depending on the
      characteristics and power desired. <br>
      <br>
      Yet, according to the attached drawings and a specific design of
      the invention, the electromagnetic motor is powered by pulses of
      DC current (from batteries or rectified AC current) with duration
      times depending on the design. This arrangement is different from
      the electromagnetic motors of the prior art that use the
      alternation of AC sinusoidal signals to produce the magnetic field
      (AC motors), or inversion of the direct current during the rotor
      cycle (DC motors) in order to obtain the magnetic fields and,
      consequently the incompatibility of the magnetic polarities to
      generate the movement of the rotor shaft. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, in one end of the shaft 5, outside the stator body 1
      , an actuator 8 is properly positioned to turn on and off the
      on/off key 4 or switch when the shaft 5 rotates. Preferably, the
      said actuator 8 is a permanent magnet whose magnetic field lies at
      right angle to the rotation shaft 5, and the said on/off switch 4
      is a reed-type switch that responds to the presence of the said
      magnetic field. The actuator 8 can be replaced to suit other
      switches 4 like Hall sensors, optic sensors or even discarded in
      the case of PWM pulsating circuits. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, when the shaft 5 of the rotor 6 rotates, the said actuator 8
      turns on the switch 4, opening and closing the electric circuit of
      the electromagnetic motor of the invention, so as to provide
      electric direct current pulses to power the stator coil. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, one electromagnet 9 can be properly positioned in
      order to determine the supply pulses of the electric power, making
      that the pulses be generated in the exact position of rotor 6
      pushing it yet more in its movement. <br>
      <br>
      The said electromagnet 9 is preferably made of a laminated silicon
      steel core enveloped by a number of turns of conducting wire which
      generates a magnetic field to help the incompatibility between the
      polarities and the magnetic poles of the rotor 6, thus causing
      them to repel one another. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically in relation to the sequence of drawings shown in
      Figures 2A, 2B and 2C, the electromagnetic motor of the invention
      works in the following way: the actuator 8, attached to the end of
      the shaft 5 of the rotor 6 is positioned and adjusted so that its
      magnetic field, when closing the on/off switch 4, is at a precise
      point where the angle of the shaft of the rotor 6, in relation to
      the magnetic field lines of the stator coil, is [alpha] =
      -X&lt;0&gt;, as shown in Figure 2A. In this exact position, the
      magnet of the rotor 6 starts its cycle of attraction, tending to
      its neutral point, where [alpha] = 0[deg.] in relation to the
      magnetic field lines of the stator coil, to immediately afterwards
      enter the drag region, whose tendency is to stop it due to the
      polarity of the magnetic field generated by the coil 2 and the
      polarity of the rotor 6. <br>
      <br>
      At the moment the rotor 6 reaches its neutral point, i.e., where
      [alpha] = 0[deg.], as indicated in Figure 2B and is ready to enter
      the drag region, the on/off switch 4 is switched off. <br>
      <br>
      At this moment when the on/off switch 4 is off, the force of the
      magnetic drag ceases. Nevertheless, immediately after this neutral
      point, where [alpha] = +X[deg.], indicated in Figure 2C, the
      opposing force or back energy caused by the collapse of the
      magnetic field inside the stator coil 2 acts upon the rotor 6,
      inverting the polarity of the magnetic field and forcing the rotor
      6 to move away in the attempt to reach equilibrium or the neutral
      point of the movement of the rotor. It must be clarified that such
      effect is a combined effect between the energy gained by the
      observed negative peaks of voltage (and current) provoked by
      turning on and off the switch 4, and the magnetic energy derived
      from the collapse of the magnetic field, which inverts polarity of
      the field trapped in the coil, thus exerting a force of repulsion
      upon the magnetic rotor 6. As indicated in Figures 2A and 2C the
      representative lines X of magnetic field invert direction,
      provoking the polarity inversion of the magnetic field of the coil
      2. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, according to the construction described above, the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention provokes two
      phenomena almost at the same time due to the short time interval
      between the electric current pulses generated. First, when the
      on/off switch 4 is turned on, the battery feeds the stator coil of
      the motor that builds up a magnetic field proportional to the
      supplied voltage, which attracts the magnet of the rotor to the
      position of equilibrium - immediately after that, the second
      phenomenon takes place, when the on/off switch 4 is turned off,
      causing the magnetic field of the coil to collapse, which is
      responsible for the generation of the back energy arising from the
      surrounding scalar field that corresponds to the complement of the
      first component of the essential energy trapped inside the coil
      and coming from the power source. One can easily verify that the
      voltage corresponding to this back energy is tenths times superior
      to the power supply voltage. <br>
      <br>
      Besides this evident power gain due to the back energy (or
      complementary energy), the fact of pulsating DC current,
      preferably supplied by a battery, without phase alternation like
      in the case of AC current supply, gives the following results: i)
      minimized counter electromotive force in the case of constant and
      low torque applications, for the magnetic rotor rotates freely
      along more than half the rotor cycle; ii) minimized drag, for the
      magnetic field of the stator coil is turned off immediately after
      the rotor magnet 6 passes over the point of equilibrium, which
      lets it rotate freely until other pulses are applied at specific
      points; iii) zero hysteresis, since the feeding current is a
      direct and pulsed current, so there is no polarity alternation of
      the source; iv) minimized eddy currents, because, either there are
      no iron or laminated silicon steel cores in the stator coils
      and/or the magnetic fields created inside the coil 2 - both during
      power supply and back energy supply are parallel to the body of
      the motor, thus yielding close-to-zero the induced currents.
      Besides the reduction and/or elimination of hysteresis and eddy
      currents losses, the inventors remark that heat losses in the
      conductors caused by the Joule effect are also greatly minimized
      and consequently, there is no considerable temperature rise, which
      improves both efficiency and useful life of the motor
      (insulation), since there is no risk of overheating. Besides this,
      as can noticed, during the functioning of the electromagnetic
      motor according to the invention, the power supply 3 is not
      constantly active, as it only inputs energy into the circuit when
      the pulses are given by the actuator 8 upon the on/off switch 4.
      As result, the consumption of the battery is greatly reduced when
      compared to the prior art motors, and this allows develop new
      battery-built-in for currently non-portable equipment, with higher
      efficiency and durability. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, in short, the electromagnetic motor, object of the
      invention, is develop take in consideration the principle of
      capture and harness energy generated by the collapse of the
      magnetic field which takes place when the energy contained in the
      coil 2 is drained off. Such energy is responsible for the
      inversion of polarity of the magnetic field that acts upon the
      magnetic rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The Figures 3 and 4 illustrate alternative embodiments comprising
      a series of electromagnetic motors according to the present
      invention. Figure 3 shows the combination of a series of rotors 6'
      disposed side by side along the same shaft 5'. Each rotor 6' rests
      inside its own stator coil, so as to add torque to the shaft ends.
      <br>
      <br>
      This embodiment is particularly used for power equipment with
      longitudinal bodies, because the association of individual torques
      in the same shaft adds. This combination can work with lower
      voltages than those used for conventional motors, and thus operate
      with batteries and reach high efficiency. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the use of higher voltages increases torque
      considerably. <br>
      <br>
      The Figure 4 is a drawing of another combination of motors
      interconnected by means of gears 10, which depending on their
      rate, can increase or diminish torque (or speed) at the ends of
      the rotating shaft. <br>

      Through this alternative embodiment, the phenomenon of resonance
      causes the motors to interact with one another at distance, still
      increasing the efficiency of the mechanical system as a whole. In
      other words, besides the action of the coils upon the magnetic
      rotors, the entire system benefits from the resonance between the
      magnetic rotors. As a result, the torque and the consumption are
      optimized. <br>
      In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, as
      illustrated especially in Figure 5, the motor of the present
      invention comprises a secondary circuit incorporated to the
      circuit of the motor illustrated in Figure 1 , being that its
      objective is to promote the feedback and increase the motor work
      power. <br>
      <br>
      Most specifically, the feedback circuit is aimed at powering the
      stator coil(s) and/or eventually the rotors made by electromagnets
      so that the motor of the present invention can work as a
      mechanical power output amplifier. This circuit basically consists
      in the addition of a full wave rectifying bridge, one or more
      parallel capacitors and a synchronized switch system made by
      relays, transistors, mechanical switch or any other one. <br>
      <br>
      The Figure 5 constitutes a schematic representation of how the
      secondary circuit is interrelated to the original basic circuit
      indicated in Figure 1. The circuit in black lines is the primary
      circuit, i.e., the one defined as basic original and similar to
      the one in Figure 1 , being powered by the external power source,
      battery or rectified mains power supply. The circuit in gray (or
      lighter) lines is the secondary feedback circuit by capacitive
      discharges, object of the present alternative embodiment. <br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in Figure 5, in addition to the one illustrated in
      Figure 1 , introduce firstly a second switch ChV, disposed between
      the positive terminal P 1 of the power source 3 and the positive
      terminal T1 of coil 2 of the primary circuit. The ChV switch is
      synchronized to the Ch1 4 switch, i.e., it shall be
      instantaneously switched in order to be always closed when the Ch
      1 4 switch is closed and it should be opened when the Ch1 4 switch
      is opened. <br>
      <br>
      The secondary feedback circuit starts with the alternating current
      rectification generated by rotor 6 turning magnet in terminals T1
      and T2 of coil 2. This alternating current is rectified from
      terminals P5 and P6 of the rectifying bridge 10, which supplies
      full wave direct current between the positive P3 and negative P4
      terminals. These terminals are connected, respectively, to the
      positive P7 and negative P8 terminals of a capacitor or,
      alternatively, to a capacitor bank disposed in parallel 11 ,
      configured adequately in order to meet the needs and objectives
      proposed herein. <br>
      <br>
      The capacitor (or capacitors) 11 accumulates enough energy to keep
      the voltage above the primary power voltage 3 due to the increase
      in voltage coming from the rotor 6 turning inside the coil 2. This
      characteristic allows it to work as a second independent and DC
      power source that feeds a second pulse, inverse to the first one,
      and/or other pulses in other coils coiled around the same rotor 6.
      This process is denominated as "capacitive discharge feedback" and
      constitutes the turbo-electromagnetic system described
      hereinbefore. <br>
      <br>
      The positive pole P7 of the capacitor 11 is connected to the
      opposite polarity terminal, i.e., the negative terminal T2 of the
      coil 2 through a third Ch2 switch, identical to the Ch1 4 switch
      of the first circuit. The capacitor's negative pole P8 is
      connected, on its turn, through a fourth Ch2' switch that is
      synchronized with Ch2, to the positive terminal T1 of the coil. <br>
      <br>
      This Ch2' switch shall be switched instantly in order to be always
      closed when the Ch2 switch is closed and the other switches Ch1 4
      and Ch1' of the other circuit are opened, and it shall always be
      opened when Ch2 switch is opened and the other switches Ch1 4 and
      Ch1' of the other circuit are closed. In other words, the primary
      and secondary circuits switch status work inversely, when one
      circuit is opened, the other should be always closed. <br>
      <br>
      The closing and opening of the Ch 1 4 and Ch2 switches are
      excluding, i.e., both should never be closed or opened at the same
      time during the motor functioning. <br>
      <br>
      The closing and opening of Ch 1' and Ch2' switches are
      synchronized with the closing and opening of Ch 1 4 and Ch2
      switches respectively. Always when Ch1 4 is opened, Ch1' will be
      opened and always when Ch1 4 is closed, Ch1' will be closed. The
      same is valid for Ch2', always when Ch2 is opened, Ch2' will be
      opened and always when Ch2 is closed, Ch2' will be closed. <br>
      <br>
      The closing moment of the main excluding switches Ch 1 4 and Ch2
      is defined by the passage of the referred actuator magnet 8 fixed
      in the turning shaft 5 of the rotor 6. Thus, one can obtain two
      pulses, one directly from the power source 3 of the primary
      circuit and another inverse coming from the secondary circuit
      capacitor 11. As a result, the switches Ch 1 4 and Ch2 shall be
      positioned with a discrepancy of 180 degrees one from another, in
      such a way that when the actuator magnet 8 passes by the switch
      Ch1 4, due to the turning of the shaft 5 and closes together with
      the switch Ch1', the synchronized switches of the second circuit
      Ch2 and Ch2' are opened, blocking the passage of current through
      the secondary circuit. After half a cycle of rotor 6, the switch
      Ch2 closes together with the switch Ch2', and the switches Ch1 and
      ChT are opened, in such a way that this cycle repeats itself
      indefinitely. <br>
      <br>
      This synchronicity of closing and opening of the pair of switches
      Ch1 4 and ChV and the pair of switches Ch2 and Ch2' guarantees
      that at each half a cycle of rotor 6 turn, the direction of the
      magnetic flow lines of the coil of the stator 1 alternates 180
      degrees due to the positive/negative polarity change of terminals
      T1 and T2 of the coil 2 and contributes to the turn of rotor 6. <br>
      <br>
      When the terminal T1 of coil 2 is positive and T2 is negative, the
      pulse is called "direct pulse", since the primary circuit is
      closed and the secondary circuit is opened. After half a cycle of
      rotor 6, the switches commute and terminal T1 becomes negative and
      T2 positive. In this latter case, the pulse is called "inverse
      pulse", since the primary circuit is opened and the secondary
      circuit is closed allowing the motor's feedback. <br>
      <br>
      In a more advantageous way, the rotor used in the motor object of
      the present invention comprises a sole compact piece manufactured
      from a neodymium magnet with a magnetization degree varying
      between N24 to N54. However, it becomes clear that the
      above-mentioned rotor can also be manufactured from other
      materials such as for example ceramic ferrite, or those that use
      rare earth elements as raw material such as neodymium, samarium-
      cobalt, praseodymium, cerium, etc. Also, preferably but not as a
      limitation to the present invention, the above-mentioned rotor
      comprises a sole and compact disc shape with a hole in the center,
      that is magnetized radially such as illustrated in Figure 6. <br>
      <br>
      However, it should be clear that this discoid aspect of the rotor
      is only preferable and do not discard other geometries and magnet
      configurations such as compacted cylindrical magnets with a hole
      in the middle and magnetized axially, stacked cylinder magnets,
      conic, ovoid and even spherical, the last ones being the most
      efficient ones, but, presently reveal complexity and high
      manufacture costs. Additionally, as illustrated in Figures 7A and
      7B, in order to increase the motor efficiency and capacity of the
      present invention, the coil that involves the radially magnetized
      neodymium discoid comprises an asymmetric format with a topology
      similar to a cone trunks, constituted by enameled or covered
      copper or aluminum wire, of any gauge, projected to work with
      tensions that vary from 9 to 12 volts, passing by the domestic
      voltages of 127 and 220 volts or superior up to industrial
      voltages. <br>
      <br>
      Similarly, it is worth to highlight the fact that the coil
      topology is also only preferable and does not discard the
      possibility of using coils with a symmetric cylindrical or annular
      topology, that are normally used in many applications known in the
      art. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically, Figures 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D and 8E depict
      alternative embodiments for the electromagnetic motor of the
      present invention, all of them with the purpose of achieving
      better efficiency and consequently work capacity. In these
      assemblies it is possible to noticed that the disposition of the
      coils is altered to increase the number of pulses that generate
      voltage peaks and electric current along one cycle of the rotor. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 8A illustrates an assembly in which coil 2 is comprised of
      four sectors positioned 90 degrees out of phase, so that two
      pulses are generated along the rotation cycle of rotor 6. This is
      called biphasic assembly. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 8B shows an assembly in which the coil comprises six
      sectors out of phase with each other, so that the feeding pulses
      of electric current are applied in three specific points of the
      rotation cycle of the rotor. In this case the electromagnetic
      motor is called tri-phase assembly. <br>
      <br>
      Figure 8C shows a construction in which the coil 2 is divided into
      eight out-of-phase sectors, which requires four pulsation points
      along the rotation cycle of the rotor, being called tetra-phase
      assembly. <br>
      These arrangements are more compact, and their configurations take
      advantage of more pulses (direct and inverse pulse - in both coil
      directions) along the same cycle of the rotor, which speeds up the
      rotor and stabilizes torque when heavier loads are applied to the
      shaft. <br>
      <br>
      The Figures 8D and 8E illustrate a coil configuration that is
      especially advantageous, in which the coil in the primary circuit
      holds an asymmetric format similar to the cone trunk. In the
      secondary circuit, the coil holds a similar format, even though it
      overlaps the spirals with a discrepancy of 90 degrees in relation
      to the first one forming a kind of beehive. <br>
      <br>
      As a practical example of the advantages and technical effects
      given by the electromagnetic motor according to the present
      invention when compared to the conventional motors known in the
      state of the art, it is possible to use any electrical receptor
      like a domestic fan, for example. <br>
      <br>
      A typical and regular medium size domestic fan found in the market
      today is manufactured to consume around 120W of energy (P). The
      voltage (U) of the public power grid used for such devices is
      usually 127V (or 220V). Let's consider it 120V for easy
      calculation. Therefore, according to basic electrical theories,
      the electric current (i) flowing through the motor of this fan is
      1A (let's consider this conventional motor's power factor = 1),
      because: <br>
      <br>
      = p / U = 120W / 120V = 1A In other words, this electric appliance
      requires 1 Ampere of electric current to produce the power of
      120W, which rotates the fan at a determined speed. <br>
      <br>
      When this motor of the prior art was actually replaced by one
      equivalent electromagnetic motor of the present invention, it was
      possible to obtain the same mechanical work (i.e., the fan blade
      rotating at the same speed) with two 12V batteries in series (24V
      total voltage) and only 0.5 Amp flowing through the motor of the
      fan. Therefore, the power required by the motor of the fan to
      produce the same mechanical work is: P = U x I = 24 x 0.5 = 12W <br>
      <br>
      The comparison between the two fans, one with the conventional
      motor of the state of the art and the other with the
      electromagnetic motor of the present invention, revealed that this
      latter is about ten times more efficient (consumed 10 times less
      energy) than the motor of the current prior art, due to the fact
      that the electromagnetic motor of the present invention is able to
      harness the back energy captured by the voltage peaks together
      with the collapse of the magnetic field trapped inside the coil,
      when the electric power supply is turned on and off at precise
      positions, as mentioned hereinbefore. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the rotation shaft of the present electromagnetic
      motor can be attached to a mechanism that, through the mechanical
      torque generated by the motor, works as a power generator. In
      addition, the present adaptation can be attached to, or even
      replace generators ran on primary sources of energy. <br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention is described in relation to the
      motors used in devices called electric receptors, it is still
      possible to wind a second coil around the first coil, so that the
      second coil captures the back energy or back voltage by induction.
      Through the adaptation of a filament equivalent to a diode, in
      such a way to be opposed to the back energy flow, it is possible
      to generate a resistance, which will be heat the said filament,
      such as happened in the water heater. <br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the electromagnetic motor, object of the present
      invention would be work as an heater device, which obtain heat
      through Joule effect, without consuming the energy from the
      primary source, since the consumed energy for heat is provided by
      the back voltage peaks. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, in regard to all of what has been exposed hereinbefore, it
      is clear that the electromagnetic motor, object of the present
      invention, can obtain a substantial energy gain, due to voltage
      peaks and magnetic field collapses, as well as considerable
      reduction of losses, considered intrinsic to the motors of the
      current prior art. Besides, in its alternative construction a
      circuit with feedback properties promoting a yet superior
      reduction of energy consumption and increase in the motor
      performance is obtained.<br>
