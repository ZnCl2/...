      <p>It might be worth your time to examine the Sanderson mechanism
        for plunger and piston pump design and to compare it to
        conventional crankshaft and connecting rod technology. You might
        appreciate an explanation of how the mechanism works and a brief
        discussion of the design and the reasoning behind it. </p>
      <p><b>Basic Operation and Configuration</b> </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows a perspective drawing of an engine to explain
        how the mechanism works. The figure has two double-ended
        pistons, which is actually a four-cylinder device. Only the
        moving parts are shown for clarity. </p>
      <p>The central piece of the mechanism — the transition arm — is
        centrally supported by a U-joint. Pins project radially outward
        from the center of the U-joint and are located 180 degrees
        apart. These pins project through the joints between the pistons
        and transmit linear motion to the pistons. </p>
      <p>The nose pin through which rotary motion is delivered to the
        transition arm is perpendicular to a line between the piston
        pins. The nose pin is about the same distance from the central
        pivot as are the piston pins and is supported by the transition
        arm. An offset bushing on the flywheel connects the nose pin t
        the rotating motion of the input shaft that in turn produces the
        reciprocating motion of the piston pins moving the pistons (or
        plungers). There can be anywhere from two to seven piston pins
        extending outward radially from the central pivot. </p>
      <p>Double-ended applications ca only have even numbers of pistons.
        Three double-ended pistons are equivalent to a conventional
        six-cylinder pump with 60-degree timing and six strokes per
        revolution. The maximum number fo single-sided cylinders is
        limited only by the space available. Seven cylinders would seem
        to the the practical limit although more are possible. </p>
      <p>From the seals on the pony rod (connecting from the crosshead
        to the plunger or piston) outward, the design requires no change
        in the plungers, stuffing boxes or valves, although some port
        distances will be longer. </p>
      <p><b>Variable Displacement Operation and Configurability</b> </p>
      <p>The single drive from the flywheel permits the stroke to be
        varied by changing the swing angle of the transition arm. Moving
        the main shaft and the flywheel laterally closer or further from
        the U-joint pivot changes the stroke of the plungers. This
        method was used on the prototype engine to vary the stroke from
        6-1 to 12-1 while operating. </p>
      <p>There are two additional methods for changing the stroke
        without lateral movement of the main shaft. The first duplicates
        the small stroke change needed for an engine; the second gives
        pumps a turndown to zero stroke. Adding this feature to a pump
        completely eliminates the need for a variable speed drive. </p>
      <p>The single point drive concept means that several versions of
        the same pump can achieve different strokes by changing only one
        part. A change in the offset distance of the bushing on the
        flywheel is all that is needed for a change in the stroke. This
        permits having one pump and several flywheels with different
        offset distances for handling a range of applications. </p>
      <p><b>Cost Savings</b> </p>
      <p>The Sanderson mechanism offers benefits, the first and most
        obvious being a reduction in size, weight and cost. The volume
        of the pump is only 40 percent and the footprint is one-third
        that of a conventional pump. This compactness derives from
        mounting the cylinders about the output shaft and having a
        mechanism that delivers straight-line motion to the rods thus
        avoiding the need for crank connecting rods and crossheads. The
        weight reduction comes from eliminating extraneous parts and
        using a smaller frame. Not having to machine so much metal
        produces cost savings. </p>
      <p>A six-throw crankshaft for a 750-hp pump is approximately 7 ft.
        long and costs between 15 and 20 percent of the total pump cost
        (see Figure 2). Most of this cost is for machining, but material
        cost is high since torque is transmitted to one end through the
        journals and throws where excess material must be provided to
        carry the torque. </p>
      <p>The force path in the Sanderson mechanism is the same from the
        drive shaft through the transition arm (see Figure 3) to each
        rod and plunger, requiring no added material to pass the torque
        to the other pistons or plungers. The nose pin of the transition
        arm must carry the torque for two plungers with the strength
        added only to the nose pin of the transition arm. The cost of
        the two-piece transition arm is about one-forth that of a
        crankshaft. The cost of the main shaft and flywheel with its
        bushing must be added, but it is merely a straight turning and
        just 2 ft. long. Add one low-cost item, the U-joint, and the
        total cost is still one-half of the cost of a crankshaft. </p>
      <p>A standard pump unit needs split-sleeve bearings for each
        connecting rod journal. The end journals may still need to be
        tapered roller bearings, but eight high-load split bearings
        would be needed, plus two end bearings. In contrast, the
        Sanderson mechanism uses no split bearings. All it uses are
        off-the-shelf bearings that press-fit in place. </p>
      <p><b>Reduction In Life Cycle Cost</b> </p>
      <p>The reduction in friction has not yet been mentioned. The three
        roller bearings on the main shaft and flywheel rotate
        completely, but the remaining bearings oscillate only 30 degrees
        to reduce frictional drag. </p>
      <p>The design of the center joint between the pistons where the
        drive pins connect further reduces friction. The force that
        drives the plungers through the rods does not generate a lateral
        resultant force like conventional connection rods. Lacking any
        side load, a crosshead is not needed. The remaining friction is
        from the weight of the rod assemblies supported by linear
        bushings that replace the crossheads. A connecting rod for a
        750-hp, six-plunger pump would induce over 3,000 lbs. of side
        load on a crosshead as compared with the 75 lb. assembly that
        generates friction in the Sanderson mechanism. Although this
        reduction in friction is significant and desirable, it has only
        a small effect on the power needed to drive the pump. The more
        important benefit for large horsepower mechanisms is the reduced
        operating temperature that extends the life of the bearings
        significantly. </p>
      <p>Vibration is another factor that affects bearing life to the
        extent that it adds to bearing loads. Well-balanced machinery
        lasts linger. The motion of standard crankshaft mechanisms is
        only within 7 to 13 percent of pure sinusoidal and cannot be
        balanced perfectly. TIn the Sanderson mechanism, balancing is
        nearly perfect because the reciprocating motion of the
        transition arm and the plungers is within 1 percent of being
        pure sinusoidal. This permits a single flywheel counterweight to
        generate sufficient balancing force. The ability to achieve
        nearly perfect balancing in a slow turning pump is not as
        significant as for higher speed machines. </p>
      <p>Another feature of the mechanism is its ability to generate
        longer strokes and operate at lower speeds in producing the same
        output. A 750-hp unit has an operating speed 20 percent lower
        than expected, due to its six-inch stroke. This will also extend
        the life of the bearings and the valves. </p>
      <p>The Sanderson mechanism, as applied to a 750-hp pump, reduces
        the footprint by 66 percent, the volume by 40 percent,
        eliminates 2,000 lb. in weight, saves thousands of dollars in
        manufacturing and facilities costs and provides a long-lasting
        low-vibration pump as compared with conventional reciprocating
        plunger pumps. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Where's the Innovation from US Automakers?</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>John Fox</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As the Big Three automakers were pleading their case before
        Congress and the American public this week for $25 billion in
        emergency financial aid, the fundamental question that remained
        was what happened to American ingenuity and innovation? </p>
      <p>The chief executives for Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors put
        the blame for their dire financial health on the deepening
        economic meltdown that has restricted credit for consumers who
        want to buy new cars and has frightened many others away from
        adding new debt. </p>
      <p>But it is the historic failure of the industry to innovate in a
        global economy that is the dead weight wrapped around its
        ankles. American ingenuity and innovation is, in fact, thriving,
        but you wouldn't know it as you drive past car dealerships that
        are stuffed with SUVs and V-8s that are the latest hangover of
        the spiking energy costs. And you just know that the softening
        of gas prices will cause carmakers to declare that happy days
        are here again. </p>
      <p>So, where is this ingenuity that is somehow not getting to
        Detroit? Locally it is in the town of Upton, where my company
        has been perfecting a hydraulic hybrid vehicle capable of
        getting more than 100 miles per gallon (city driving). </p>
      <p>A product engineer at Ford wrote a letter on the company's
        behalf stating emphatically: "I believe it is very likely that
        the Sanderson mechanism engine will enable significant
        efficiency and performance benefits for on-road vehicles," he
        wrote, adding, "With the economic and societal cost of energy
        and transportation fuels, funding technologies to substantially
        improve on-road fuel economy is critical." </p>
      <p>The project engineer for the highly successful Northstar engine
        that has been used in Cadillacs since 1993, who is now since
        retired from GM, said in a letter about our engine: "This is an
        exciting invention that holds the probability of improving the
        efficiency of future engine designs and power transfer
        mechanisms." </p>
      <p>And we're hardly alone on the innovation front. There are more
        than 20 official design and innovation teams competing for the
        prestigious Automotive X Prize with the goal of building the
        first car able to exceed the 100-mile-per-gallon barrier. </p>
      <p>You won't find the Big Three on the list of competitors, and
        you won't be surprised to learn that GM and Ford have largely
        ignored the enthusiastic endorsements of the Sanderson Engine by
        their own engineers and former engineers. </p>
      <p>These are smart guys in an industry that has been the bedrock
        of American soil for generations, so what could explain their
        failure to understand the "innovate or perish" 21st-century
        imperative? As one automotive engineer explained it to me, Rule
        Number One in the automotive manufacturing business is that if
        you are selling cars don't mess with success by changing what
        you are doing. Rule Number Two is that if your innovation nudges
        the price of that car up past your competition, you are in
        violation of Rule Number One. </p>
      <p>Earlier this fall, Congress appropriated $25 billion in loans
        for automakers to retool their factories and produce more
        fuel-efficient vehicles in 2009. It was apparent in their
        testimony this week that the Big Three are focused more on
        survival than retooling anything. </p>
      <p>In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this week,
        Rick Wagoner of General Motors Corp. commented that the auto
        industry "needs a bridge to span the financial chasm that has
        opened up before us." </p>
      <p>If Congress decides to build that bridge, it needs to extract
        guarantees from the auto industry that they can actually get to
        the other side of that bridge as an innovative industry capable
        of adapting to new technologies. And for their part, Congress
        needs to acknowledge that it has effectively enabled the
        industry's addiction to yesterday's technology by not mandating
        higher fuel efficiency standards in US vehicles. </p>
      <p>As Ford rolls out its 2010 Mustang at this weekend's car show
        in Los Angeles, one can only imagine what a buzz its unveiling
        would create if it were capable of getting 100 miles to the
        gallon. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract </b>---&nbsp; A variable compression piston
        assembly includes a plurality of pistons, a transition arm
        coupled to each of the pistons, and a rotating member mounted
        for pivoting movement to slide along an axis of the drive
        member. Movement of the rotating member relative to the drive
        member changes the compression ratio of the piston assembly. An
        engine assembly includes first and second piston assemblies
        mounted back-to-back and 180 DEG out of phase. A joint for
        positioning between first and second pistons includes an outer
        member and an inner member. The outer member is configured for
        movement relative to the pistons along a first axis
        perpendicular to the common axis of the pistons. The inner
        member is mounted within the outer member for rotation relative
        to the outer member about a second axis perpendicular to the
        first axis and the common axis. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to a variable compression piston
        assembly, and to an engine that has double ended pistons
        connected to a universal joint for converting linear motion of
        the pistons to rotary motion. </p>
      <p>Most piston driven engines have pistons that are attached to
        offset portions of a crankshaft such that as the pistons are
        moved in a reciprocal direction transverse to the axis of the
        crankshaft, the crankshaft will rotate. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,535,709, defines an engine with a double ended
        piston that is attached to a crankshaft with an off set portion.
        A lever attached between the piston and the crankshaft is
        restrained in a fulcrum regulator to provide the rotating motion
        to the crankshaft. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,842, defines a four cylinder piston engine
        that utilizes two double ended pistons connected to a T-shaped
        T-shaped connecting member that causes a crankshaft to rotate.
        The T-shaped connecting member is attached at each of the
        T-cross arm to a double ended piston. A centrally located point
        on the T-cross arm is rotatably attached to a fixed point, and
        the bottom of the T is rotatably attached to a crank pin which
        is connected to the crankshaft by a crankthrow which includes a
        counter weight. </p>
      <p>In each of the above examples, double ended pistons are used
        that drive a crankshaft that has an axis transverse to the axis
        of the pistons. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>According to the invention, a variable compression piston
        assembly includes a plurality of pistons, a transition arm
        coupled to each of the pistons, and a rotating member coupled to
        a drive member of the transition arm and mounted for pivoting
        movement to slide along an axis of the drive member. Movement of
        the rotating member relative to the drive member changes the
        compression ratio of the piston assembly. </p>
      <p>Embodiments of this aspect of the invention may include one or
        more of the following features. </p>
      <p>The pistons are double ended pistons. The transition arm is
        coupled to each of the double ended pistons at approximately a
        center of each double ended piston. There are two pistons and
        the axis of rotation of the rotating member and axes of the two
        pistons lie on a common plane. </p>
      <p>In certain illustrated embodiments, the rotating member is a
        flywheel. A counterweight is mounted to the rotating member. The
        rotating member is pivotably mounted to a main drive shaft. The
        axis of the main drive shaft is parallel to the axis of each of
        the pistons. </p>
      <p>A movable pressure plate is in contact with a peripheral region
        of the rotating member. A roller interfaces the pressure plate
        and the rotating member. A piston biases the rotating member
        into contact with the pressure plate. </p>
      <p>The drive member extends into an opening in the rotatable
        member adjacent to a periphery of the rotatable member. The
        drive arm extends into a pivot pin located in the rotatable
        member. A universal joint connects the transition arm to a
        support. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a method for
        varying the compression ratio of a piston assembly includes
        providing a plurality of pistons, a transition arm coupled to
        each of the pistons, and a rotating member coupled to a drive
        member of the transition arm and mounted for pivoting movement
        to slide along an axis of the drive member. The method includes
        pivoting the rotating member to change the compression ratio of
        the piston assembly. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a method of
        increasing the efficiency of a piston assembly includes
        providing a plurality of double ended pistons, a transition arm
        coupled to each of the double ended pistons at approximately a
        center of each of the pistons, and a rotating member coupled to
        a drive member of the transition arm and mounted for pivoting
        movement to slide along an axis of the drive member. The method
        includes pivoting the rotating member to change the compression
        ratio of the double ended piston assembly. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a joint for
        positioning between first and second elements arranged for
        linear motion along a common axis includes an outer member and
        an inner member. The outer member is configured for movement
        relative to the first and second elements along a first axis
        perpendicular to the common axis. The inner member is mounted
        within the outer member for rotation relative to the outer
        member about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis and
        the common axis. The outer and inner members each define an
        opening for receiving a drive arm. </p>
      <p>Embodiments of this aspect of the invention may include one or
        more of the following features. </p>
      <p>The outer member is configured for movement relative to the
        first and second elements along the second axis. The outer
        member defines first and second parallel flat sides each
        defining a plane perpendicular to the common axis. First and
        second sliding members are positioned between the first flat
        side and the first element and the second flat side and the
        second element, respectively. The flat sides have a polished
        surface. </p>
      <p>The first and second elements are pistons. Alternatively, the
        first element is a piston and the second element is a guided
        rod, e.g., of a compressor. </p>
      <p>The drive arm defines a longitudinal axis and the joint
        includes a mount, e.g., a cap screw, for holding the drive arm
        axially stationary while permitting the drive arm to rotate
        about its longitudinal axis. </p>
      <p>In an illustrated embodiment, the opening in the inner member
        for receiving the drive arm is a channel defining a channel axis
        perpendicular to the second axis. The opening in the outer
        member for receiving the drive arm is a slot for accommodating
        movement of the drive arm when the inner member rotates relative
        to outer member. </p>
      <p>A thrust bearing receives an axial load transferred to the
        drive arm by the first and second elements. A sleeve bearing
        receives a normal load transferred to the drive arm by the first
        and second elements. There is also a bearing located between the
        inner and outer members. </p>
      <p>The first and second elements are mounted to a connector and
        the connector defines a cavity within which the outer and inner
        members are positioned. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a piston assembly
        includes first and second elements configured for linear motion
        along a common axis and a joint positioned between the first and
        second elements. At least one of the first and second elements
        is a piston. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a method of
        reducing side load in a double ended member having first and
        second elements arranged for linear motion along an axis of the
        double ended member includes providing a joint located between
        the first and second elements, and transferring load between the
        first and second elements and a drive arm mounted to the joint
        through two opposed surfaces, e.g., flat surfaces, of an outer
        member of the joint. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, an engine
        assembly includes a first piston assembly including at least two
        engine pistons coupled by a transition arm, and a second piston
        assembly coupled to the first piston assembly. The second piston
        assembly including at least two engine pistons coupled by a
        transition arm. The first and second piston assemblies are
        mounted back-to-back and 180.degree. out of phase. </p>
      <p>Embodiments of this aspect of the invention may include one or
        more of the following features. The engine pistons are housed in
        cylinders with pairs of engine pistons from the first and second
        piston assemblies sharing a common cylinder. Each piston
        assembly includes compressor pistons mounted to move with
        respective engine pistons. Each piston assembly includes six
        pistons and two compressors. </p>
      <p>In an illustrated embodiment, a first rotating member is
        mounted to the transition arm of the first piston assembly, and
        a second rotating member is mounted to the transition arm of the
        second piston assembly. The second rotating member is coupled to
        the first rotating member. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a method of
        cancelling vibration in an engine assembly includes providing a
        first piston assembly including at least two engine pistons
        coupled by a transition arm, providing a second piston assembly
        including at least two engine pistons coupled by a transition
        arm, and coupling the first and second piston assemblies in a
        back-to-back relationship and 180.degree. out of phase. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a pictorial representation of a four piston engine 10
        of the present invention. Engine 10 has two cylinders 11 (FIG.
        3) and 12. Each cylinder 11 and 12 house a double ended piston.
        Each double ended piston is connected to transition arm 13 which
        is connected to flywheel 15 by shaft 14. Transition arm 13 is
        connected to support 19 by a universal joint mechanism,
        including shaft 18, which allows transition arm 13 to move up an
        down and shaft 17 which allows transition arm 13 to move side to
        side. FIG. 1 shows flywheel 15 in a position shaft 14 at the top
        of wheel 15. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows engine 10 with flywheel 15 rotated so that shaft
        14 is at the bottom of flywheel 15. Transition arm 13 has
        pivoted downward on shaft 18. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 3-6 show a top view of the pictorial representation,
        showing the transition arm 13 in four positions and shaft moving
        flywheel 15 in 900.degree. increments. FIG. 3 shows flywheel 15
        with shaft 14 in the position as illustrated in FIG. 3a. When
        piston 1 fires and moves toward the middle of cylinder 11,
        transition arm 13 will pivot on universal joint 16 rotating
        flywheel 15 to the position shown in FIG. 2. Shaft 14 will be in
        the position shown in FIG. 4a. When piston 4 is fired,
        transition arm 13 will move to the position shown in FIG. 5.
        Flywheel 15 and shaft 14 will be in the position shown in FIG
        5a. Next piston 2 will fire and transition arm 13 will be moved
        to the position shown in FIG. 6. Flywheel 15 and shaft 14 will
        be in the position shown in FIG. 6a. When piston 3 is fired,
        transition arm 13 and flywheel 15 will return to the original
        position that shown in FIGS. 3 and 3a. </p>
      <p>When the pistons fire, transition arm will be moved back and
        forth with the movement of the pistons. Since transition arm 13
        is connected to universal joint 16 and to flywheel 15 through
        shaft 14, flywheel 15 rotates translating the linear motion of
        the pistons to a rotational motion. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows (in partial cross-section) a top view of an
        embodiment of a four double piston, eight cylinder engine 30
        according to the present invention. There are actually only four
        cylinders, but with a double piston in each cylinder, the engine
        is equivalent to a eight cylinder engine. Two cylinders 31 and
        46 are shown. Cylinder 31 has double ended piston 32, 33 with
        piston rings 32a and 33a, respectively. Pistons 32, 33 are
        connected to a transition arm 60 (FIG. 8) by piston arm 54a
        extending into opening 55a in piston 32, 33 and sleeve bearing
        55. Similarly piston 47, 49, in cylinder 46 is connected by
        piston arm 54b to transition arm 60. </p>
      <p>Each end of cylinder 31 has inlet and outlet valves controlled
        by a rocker arms and a spark plug. Piston end 32 has rocker arms
        35a and 35b and spark plug 44, and piston end 33 has rocker arms
        34a and 34b, and spark plug 41. Each piston has associated with
        it a set of valves, rocker arms and a spark plug. Timing for
        firing the spark plugs and opening and closing the inlet and
        exhaust values is controlled by a timing belt 51 which is
        connected to pulley 50a. Pulley 50a is attached to a gear 64 by
        shaft 63 (FIG. 8) turned by output shaft 53 powered by flywheel
        69. Belt 50a also turns pulley 50b and gear 39 connected to
        distributor 38. Gear 39 also turns gear 40. Gears 39 and 40 are
        attached to cam shaft 75 (FIG. 8) which in turn activate push
        rods that are attached to the rocker arms 34, 35 and other
        rocker arms not illustrated. </p>
      <p>Exhaust manifolds 48 and 56 as shown attached to cylinders 46
        and 31 respectively. Each exhaust manifold is attached to four
        exhaust ports. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 is a side view of engine 30, with one side removed, and
        taken through section 8--8 of FIG. 7. Transitions arm 60 is
        mounted on support 70 by pin 72 which allows transition arm to
        move up and down (as viewed in FIG. 8) and pin 71 which allows
        transition arm 60 to move from side to side. Since transition
        arm 60 can move up and down while moving side to side, then
        shaft 61 can drive flywheel 69 in a circular path. The four
        connecting piston arms (piston arms 54b and 54d shown in FIG. 8)
        are driven by the four double end pistons in an oscillator
        motion around pin 71. The end of shaft 61 in flywheel 69 causes
        transition arm to move up and down as the connection arms move
        back and forth. Flywheel 69 has gear teeth 69a around one side
        which may be used for turning the flywheel with a starter motor
        100 (FIG. 11) to start the engine. </p>
      <p>The rotation of flywheel 69 and drive shaft 68 connected
        thereto, turns gear 65 which in turn turns gears 64 and 66. Gear
        64 is attached to shaft 63 which turns pulley 50a. Pulley 50a is
        attached to belt 51. Belt 51 turns pulley 50b and gears 39 and
        40 (FIG. 7). Cam shaft 75 has cams 88-91 on one end and cams
        84-87 on the other end. Cams 88 and 90 actuate push rods 76 and
        77, respectively. Cams 89 and 91 actuate push rods 93 and 94,
        respectively. Cams 84 and 86 actuate push rods 95 and 96,
        respectively, and cams 85 and 87 actuate push rods 78 and 79,
        respectively. Push rods 77, 76, 93, 94, 95, 96 and 78, 79 are
        for opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves of the
        cylinders above the pistons. The left side of the engine, which
        has been cutaway, contains an identical, but opposite valve
        drive mechanism. </p>
      <p>Gear 66 turned by gear 65 on drive shaft 68 turns pump 67,
        which may be, for example, a water pump used in the engine
        cooling system (not illustrated), or an oil pump. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 is a rear view of engine 30 showing the relative
        positions of the cylinders and double ended pistons. Piston 32,
        33 is shown in dashed lines with valves 35c and 35d located
        under lifter arms 35a and 35b, respectively. Belt 51 and pulley
        50b are shown under distributor 38. Transition arm 60 and two,
        54c and 54d, of the four piston arms 54a, 54b, 54c and 54d are
        shown in the pistons 32-33, 32a-33a, 47-49 and 47a-49a. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 is a side view of engine 30 showing the exhaust
        manifold 56, intake manifold 56a and carburetor 56c. Pulleys 50a
        and 50b with timing belt 51 are also shown. </p>
      <p>FIG. 11 is a front end view of engine 30 showing the relative
        positions of the cylinders and double ended pistons 32-33,
        32a-33a, 47-49 and 47a-49a with the four piston arms 54a, 54b,
        54c and 54d positioned in the pistons. Pump 67 is shown below
        shaft 53, and pulley 50a and timing belt 51 are shown at the top
        of engine 30. Starter 100 is shown with gear 101 engaging the
        gear teeth 69a on flywheel 69. </p>
      <p>A feature of the invention is that the compression ratio for
        the engine can be changed while the engine is running. The end
        of arm 61 mounted in flywheel 69 travels in a circle at the
        point where arm 61 enters flywheel 69. Referring to FIG. 13, the
        end of arm 61 is in a sleeve bearing ball bushing assembly 81.
        The stroke of the pistons is controlled by arm 61. Arm 61 forms
        an angle, for example about 15.degree., with shaft 53. By moving
        flywheel 69 on shaft 53 to the right or left, as viewed in FIG.
        13, the angle of arm 61 can be changed, changing the stroke of
        the pistons, changing the compression ratio. The position of
        flywheel 69 is changed by turning nut 104 on threads 105. Nut
        104 is keyed to shaft 53 by thrust bearing 106a held in place by
        ring 106b. In the position shown in FIG. 12, flywheel 69 has
        been moved to the right, extending the stroke of the pistons. </p>
      <p>FIG. 12 shows flywheel moved to the right increasing the stroke
        of the pistons, providing a higher compression ratio. Nut 105
        has been screwed to the right, moving shaft 53 and flywheel 69
        to the right. Arm 61 extends further into bushing assembly 80
        and out the back of flywheel 69. </p>
      <p>FIG. 13 shows flywheel moved to the left reducing the stroke of
        the pistons, providing a lower compression ratio. Nut 105 has
        been screwed to the left, moving shaft 53 and flywheel 69 to the
        left. Arm 61 extends less into bushing assembly 80. </p>
      <p>The piston arms on the transition arm are inserted into sleeve
        bearings in a bushing in piston. FIG. 14 shows a double piston
        110 having piston rings 111 on one end of the double piston and
        piston rings 112 on the other end of the double piston. A slot
        113 is in the side of the piston. The location the sleeve
        bearing is shown at 114. </p>
      <p>FIG. 15 shows a piston arm 116 extending into piston 110
        through slot 116 into sleeve bearing 117 in bushing 115. Piston
        arm 116 is shown in a second position at 116a. The two pistons
        arms 116 and 116a show the movement limits of piston arm 116
        during operation of the engine. </p>
      <p>FIG. 16 shows piston arm 116 in sleeve bearing 117. Sleeve
        bearing 117 is in pivot pin 115. Piston arm 116 can freely
        rotate in sleeve bearing 117 and the assembly of piston arm 116,
        Sleeve bearing 117 and pivot pin 115 and sleeve bearings 118a
        and 118b rotate in piston 110, and piston arm 116 can moved
        axially with the axis of sleeve bearing 117 to allow for the
        linear motion of double ended piston 110, and the motion of a
        transition arm to which piston arm 116 is attached. </p>
      <p>FIG. 17 shows how the four cylinder engine 10 in FIG. 1 may be
        configured as an air motor using a four way rotary valve 123 on
        the output shaft 122. Each of cylinders 1, 2, 3 and 4 are
        connected by hoses 131. 132, 133, and 144, respectively, to
        rotary valve 123. Air inlet port 124 is used to supply air to
        run engine 120. Air is sequentially supplied to each of the
        pistons 1a, 2a, 3a and 4a, to move the pistons back and forth in
        the cylinders. Air is exhausted from the cylinders out exhaust
        port 136. Transition arm 126, attached to the pistons by
        connecting pins 127 and 128 are moved as described with
        references to FIGS. 1-6 to turn flywheel 129 and output shaft
        22. </p>
      <p>FIG. 18 is a cross-sectional view of rotary valve 123 in the
        position when pressurized air or gas is being applied to
        cylinder 1 through inlet port 124, annular channel 125, channel
        126, channel 130, and air hose 131. Rotary valve 123 is made up
        of a plurality of channels in housing 123 and output shaft 122.
        The pressurized air entering cylinder 1 causes piston 1a, 3a to
        move to the right (as viewed in FIG. 18). Exhaust air is forced
        out of cylinder 3 through line 133 into chamber 134, through
        passageway 135 and out exhaust outlet 136. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 18a, 18b and 18c are cross-sectional view of valve 23
        showing the air passages of the valves at three positions along
        valve 23 when positioned as shown in FIG. 18. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 shows rotary valve 123 rotated 180.degree. when
        pressurized air is applied to cylinder 3, reversing the
        direction of piston 1a, 3a. Pressurized air is applied to inlet
        port 124, through annular chamber 125, passage way 126, chamber
        134 and air line 133 to cylinder 3. This in turn causes air in
        cylinder 1 to be exhausted through line 131, chamber 130, line
        135, annular chamber 137 and out exhaust port 136. Shaft 122
        will have rotated 360.degree. turning counter clockwise when
        piston 1a, 3a complete it stroke to the left. </p>
      <p>Only piston 1a, 3a have been illustrated to show the operation
        of the air engine and valve 123 relative to the piston motion.
        The operation of piston 2a, 4a is identical in function except
        that its 360.degree. cycle starts at 90.degree. shaft rotation
        and reverses at 270.degree. and completes its cycle back at
        90.degree.. A power stroke occurs at every 90.degree. of
        rotation. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 19a, 19b and 19c are cross-sectional views of valve 123
        showing the air passages of the valves at three positions along
        valve 123 when positioned as shown in FIG. 19. </p>
      <p>The principle of operation which operates the air engine of
        FIG. 17 can be reversed, and engine 120 of FIG. 17 can be used
        as an air or gas compressor or pump. By rotating engine 10
        clockwise by applying rotary power to shaft 122, exhaust port
        136 will draw in air into the cylinders and port 124 will supply
        air which may be used to drive, for example air tool, or be
        stored in an air tank. </p>
      <p>In the above embodiments, the cylinders have been illustrated
        as being parallel to each other. However, the cylinders need not
        be parallel. FIG. 20 shows an embodiment similar to the
        embodiment of FIGS. 1-6, with cylinders 150 and 151 not parallel
        to each other. Universal joint 160 permits the piston arms 152
        and 153 to be at an angle other than 90.degree. to the drive arm
        154. Even with the cylinders not parallel to each other the
        engines are functionally the same. </p>
      <p>Still another modification may be made to the engine 10 of
        FIGS. 1-6. This embodiment, pictorially shown in FIG. 21, may
        have single ended pistons. Piston 1a and 2a are connected to
        universal joint 170 by drive arms 171 and 172, and to flywheel
        173 by drive arm 174. The basic difference is the number of
        strokes of pistons 1a and 2a to rotate flywheel 173 360.degree..
      </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 22, a two cylinder piston assembly 300
        includes cylinders 302, 304, each housing a variable stroke,
        double ended piston 306, 308, respectively. Piston assembly 300
        provides the same number of power strokes per revolution as a
        conventional four cylinder engine. Each double ended piston 306,
        308 is connected to a transition arm 310 by a drive pin 312,
        314, respectively. Transition arm 310 is mounted to a support
        316 by, e.g., a universal joint 318 (U-joint), constant velocity
        joint, or spherical bearing. A drive arm 320 extending from
        transition arm 310 is connected to a rotatable member, e.g.,
        flywheel 322. </p>
      <p>Transition arm 310 transmits linear motion of pistons 306, 308
        to rotary motion of flywheel 322. The axis, A, of flywheel 322
        is parallel to the axes, B and C, of pistons 306, 308 (though
        axis, A, could be off-axis as shown in FIG. 20) to form an axial
        or barrel type engine, pump, or compressor. U-joint 318 is
        centered on axis, A. As shown in FIG. 28.alpha., pistons 306,
        308 are 180.degree. apart with axes A, B and C lying along a
        common plane, D, to form a flat piston assembly. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 22 and 23, cylinders 302, 304 each include
        left and right cylinder halves 301a, 301b mounted to the
        assembly case structure 303. Double ended pistons 306, 308 each
        include two pistons 330 and 332, 330a and 332a, respectively,
        joined by a central joint 334, 334a, respectively. The pistons
        are shown having equal length, though other lengths are
        contemplated. For example, joint 334 can be off-center such that
        piston 330 is longer than piston 332. As the pistons are fired
        in sequence 330a, 332, 330, 332a, from the position shown in
        FIG. 22, flywheel 322 is rotated in a clockwise direction, as
        viewed in the direction of arrow 333. Piston assembly 300 is a
        four stroke cycle engine, i.e., each piston fires once in two
        revolutions of flywheel 322. </p>
      <p>As the pistons move back and forth, drive pins 312, 314 must be
        free to rotate about their common axis, E, (arrow 305), slide
        along axis, E, (arrow 307) as the radial distance to the center
        line, B, of the piston changes with the angle of swing, a, of
        transition arm 310 (approximately .+-.15.degree. swing), and
        pivot about centers, F, (arrow 309). Joint 334 is constructed to
        provide this freedom of motion. </p>
      <p>Joint 334 defines a slot 340 (FIG. 23a) for receiving drive pin
        312, and a hole 336 perpendicular to slot 340 housing a sleeve
        bearing 338. A cylinder 341 is positioned within sleeve bearing
        338 for rotation within the sleeve bearing. Sleeve bearing 338
        defines a side slot 342 shaped like slot 340 and aligned with
        slot 340. Cylinder 341 defines a through hole 344. Drive pin 312
        is received within slot 342 and hole 344. An additional sleeve
        bearing 346 is located in through hole 344 of cylinder 341. The
        combination of slots 340 and 342 and sleeve bearing 338 permit
        drive pin 312 to move along arrow 309. Sleeve bearing 346
        permits drive pin 312 to rotate about its axis, E, and slide
        along its axis, E. </p>
      <p>If the two cylinders of the piston assembly are configured
        other than 180.degree. apart, or more than two cylinders are
        employed, movement of cylinder 341 in sleeve bearing 338 along
        the direction of arrow 350 allows for the additional freedom of
        motion required to prevent binding of the pistons as they
        undergo a FIG. 8 motion, discussed below. Slot 340 must also be
        sized to provide enough clearance to allow the FIG. 8 motion of
        the pin. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 35-35B, an alternative embodiment of a
        central joint 934 for joining pistons 330 and 332 is configured
        to produce zero side load on pistons 330 and 332. Joint 934
        permits the four degrees of freedom necessary to prevent binding
        of drive pin 312 as the pistons move back and forth, i.e.,
        rotation about axis, E, (arrow 905), pivoting about center, F,
        (arrow 909), and sliding movement along orthogonal axes, M (up
        and down in the plane of the paper in FIG. 35) and N (in and out
        of the plane of the paper in FIG. 35), while the load
        transmitted between joint 934 and pistons 330, 332 only produces
        a force vector which is parallel to piston axis, B (which is
        orthogonal to axes M and N). </p>
      <p>Sliding movement along axis, M, accommodates the change in the
        radial distance of transition arm 310 to the center line, B, of
        the piston with the angle of swing, .alpha., of transition arm
        310. Sliding movement along axis, N, allows for the additional
        freedom of motion required to prevent binding of the pistons as
        they undergo the figure eight motion, discussed below. Joint 934
        defines two opposed flat faces 937, 937a which slide in the
        directions of axes M and N relative to pistons 330, 332. Faces
        937, 937a define parallel planes which remain perpendicular to
        piston axis, B, during the back and forth movement of the
        pistons. </p>
      <p>Joint 934 includes an outer slider member 935 which defines
        faces 937, 937a for receiving the driving force from pistons
        330, 332. Slider member 935 defines a slot 940 in a third face
        945 of the slider for receiving drive pin 312, and a slot 940a
        in a fourth face 945a. Slider member 935 has an inner wall 936
        defining a hole 939 perpendicular to slot 940 and housing a
        slider sleeve bearing 938. A cross shaft 941 is positioned
        within sleeve bearing 938 for rotation within the sleeve bearing
        in the direction of arrow 909. Sleeve bearing 938 defines a side
        slot 942 shaped like slot 940 and aligned with slot 940. Cross
        shaft 941 defines a through hole 944. Drive pin 312 is received
        within slot 942 and hole 944. A sleeve bearing 946 is located in
        through hole 944 of cross shaft 941. </p>
      <p>The combination of slots 940 and 942 and sleeve bearing 938
        permit drive pin 312 to move in the direction of arrow 909.
        Positioned within slot 940a is a cap screw 947 and washer 949
        which attach to drive pin 312 retaining drive pin 312 against a
        step 951 defined by cross shaft 941 while permitting drive pin
        312 to rotate about its axis, E, and preventing drive pin 312
        from sliding along axis, E. As discussed above, the two addition
        freedoms of motion are provided by sliding of slider faces 937,
        937a relative to pistons 330, 332 along axis, M and N. A plate
        960 is placed between each of face 937 and piston 330 and face
        937a and piston 332. Each plate 960 is formed of a low friction
        bearing material with a bearing surface 962 in contact with
        faces 937, 937a, respectively. Faces 937, 937a are polished. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 36, the load, P.sub.L, applied to joint 934 by
        piston 330 in the direction of piston axis, B, is resolved into
        two perpendicular loads acting on pin 312: axial load, A.sub.L,
        along the axis, E, of drive pin 312, and normal load, N.sub.L,
        perpendicular to drive pin axis, E. The axial load is applied to
        thrust bearings 950, 952, and the normal load is applied to
        sleeve bearing 946. The net direction of the forces transmitted
        between pistons 330, 332 and joint 934 remains along piston
        axis, B, preventing side loads being applied to pistons 330,
        332. This is advantageous because side loads on pistons 330, 332
        can cause the pistons to contact the cylinder wall creating
        frictional losses proportional to the side load values. </p>
      <p>Pistons 330, 332 are mounted to joint 934 by a center piece
        connector 970. Center piece 970 includes threaded ends 972, 974
        for receiving threaded ends 330a and 332a of the pistons,
        respectively. Center piece 970 defines a cavity 975 for
        receiving joint 934. A gap 976 is provided between joint 934 and
        center piece 970 to permit motion along axis, N. </p>
      <p>For an engine capable of producing, e.g., about 100 horsepower,
        joint 934 has a width, W, of, e.g., about 35/16 inches, a
        length, L.sub.1, of, e.g., 35/16 inches, and a height, H, of,
        e.g., about 31/2 inches. The joint and piston ends together have
        an overall length, L.sub.2, of, e.g., about 95/16 inches, and a
        diameter, D.sub.1, of, e.g., about 4 inches. Plates 960 have a
        diameter, D.sub.2, of, e.g., about 31/4 inch, and a thickness,
        T, of, e.g., about 1/8 inch. Plates 960 are press fit into the
        pistons. Plates 960 are preferably bronze, and slider 935 is
        preferably steel or aluminum with a steel surface defining faces
        937, 937a. </p>
      <p>Joint 934 need not be used to join two pistons. One of pistons
        330, 332 can be replaced by a rod guided in a bushing. </p>
      <p>Where figure eight motion is not required or is allowed by
        motion of drive pin 312 within cross shaft 941, joint 934 need
        not slide in the direction of axis, N. Referring to FIG. 37,
        slider member 935a and plates 960a have curved surfaces
        permitting slider member 935a to slide in the direction of axis,
        M, (in and out of the paper in FIG. 37) while preventing slider
        member 935a to move along axis, N. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 24 and 24a, U-joint 318 defines a central
        pivot 352 (drive pin axis, E, passes through center 352), and
        includes a vertical pin 354 and a horizontal pin 356. Transition
        arm 310 is capable of pivoting about pin 354 along arrow 358,
        and about pin 356 along arrow 360. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 25, 25a and 25b, as an alternative to a
        spherical bearing, to couple transition arm 310 to flywheel 322,
        drive arm 320 is received within a cylindrical pivot pin 370
        mounted to the flywheel offset radially from the center 372 of
        the flywheel by an amount, e.g., 2.125 inches, required to
        produce the desired swing angle, .alpha. (FIG. 22), in the
        transition arm. </p>
      <p>Pivot pin 370 has a through hole 374 for receiving drive arm
        320. There is a sleeve bearing 376 in hole 374 to provide a
        bearing surface for drive arm 320. Pivot pin 370 has cylindrical
        extensions 378, 380 positioned within sleeve bearings 382, 384,
        respectively. As the flywheel is moved axially along drive arm
        320 to vary the swing angle, .alpha., and thus the compression
        ratio of the assembly, as described further below, pivot pin 370
        rotates within sleeve bearings 382, 384 to remain aligned with
        drive arm 320. Torsional forces are transmitted through thrust
        bearings 388, 390, with one or the other of the thrust bearings
        carrying the load depending on the direction of the rotation of
        the flywheel along arrow 386. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 26, to vary the compression and displacement
        of piston assembly 300, the axial position of flywheel 322 along
        axis, A, is varied by rotating a shaft 400. A sprocket 410 is
        mounted to shaft 400 to rotate with shaft 400. A second sprocket
        412 is connected to sprocket 410 by a roller chain 413. Sprocket
        412 is mounted to a threaded rotating barrel 414. Threads 416 of
        barrel 414 contact threads 418 of a stationary outer barrel 420.
      </p>
      <p>Rotation of shaft 400, arrow 401, and thus sprockets 410 and
        412, causes rotation of barrel 414. Because outer barrel 420 is
        fixed, the rotation of barrel 414 causes barrel 414 to move
        linearly along axis, A, arrow 403. Barrel 414 is positioned
        between a collar 422 and a gear 424, both fixed to a main drive
        shaft 408. Drive shaft 408 is in turn fixed to flywheel 322.
        Thus, movement of barrel 414 along axis, A, is translated to
        linear movement of flywheel 322 along axis, A. This results in
        flywheel 322 sliding along axis, H, of drive arm 320 of
        transition arm 310, changing angle, .beta., and thus the stroke
        of the pistons. Thrust bearings 430 are located at both ends of
        barrel 414, and a sleeve bearing 432 is located between barrel
        414 and shaft 408. </p>
      <p>To maintain the alignment of sprockets 410 and 412, shaft 400
        is threaded at region 402 and is received within a threaded hole
        404 of a cross bar 406 of assembly case structure 303. The ratio
        of the number of teeth of sprocket 412 to sprocket 410 is, e.g.,
        4:1. Therefore, shaft 400 must turn four revolutions for a
        single revolution of barrel 414. To maintain alignment, threaded
        region 402 must have four times the threads per inch of barrel
        threads 416, e.g., threaded region 402 has thirty-two threads
        per inch, and barrel threads 416 have eight threads per inch. </p>
      <p>As the flywheel moves to the right, as viewed in FIG. 26, the
        stroke of the pistons, and thus the compression ratio, is
        increased. Moving the flywheel to the left decreases the stroke
        and the compression ratio. A further benefit of the change in
        stroke is a change in the displacement of each piston and
        therefore the displacement of the engine. The horsepower of an
        internal combustion engine closely relates to the displacement
        of the engine. For example, in the two cylinder, flat engine,
        the displacement increases by about 20% when the compression
        ratio is raised from 6:1 to 12:1. This produces approximately
        20% more horsepower due alone to the increase in displacement.
        The increase in compression ratio also increases the horsepower
        at the rate of about 5% per point or approximately 25% in
        horsepower. If the horsepower were maintained constant and the
        compression ratio increased from 6:1 to 12:1, there would be a
        reduction in fuel consumption of approximately 25%. </p>
      <p>The flywheel has sufficient strength to withstand the large
        centrifugal forces seen when assembly 300 is functioning as an
        engine. The flywheel position, and thus the compression ratio of
        the piston assembly, can be varied while the piston assembly is
        running. </p>
      <p>Piston assembly 300 includes a pressure lubrication system. The
        pressure is provided by an engine driven positive displacement
        pump (not shown) having a pressure relief valve to prevent
        overpressures. Bearings 430 and 432 of drive shaft 408 and the
        interface of drive arm 320 with flywheel 322 are lubricated via
        ports 433 (FIG. 26). </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 27, to lubricate U-joint 318, piston pin
        joints 306, 308, and the cylinder walls, oil under pressure from
        the oil pump is ported through the fixed U-joint bracket to the
        top and bottom ends of the vertical pivot pin 354. Oil ports
        450, 452 lead from the vertical pin to openings 454, 456,
        respectively, in the transition arm. As shown in FIG. 27A, pins
        312, 314 each define a through bore 458. Each through bore 458
        is in fluid communication with a respective one of openings 454,
        456. As shown in FIG. 23, holes 460, 462 in each pin connect
        through slots 461 and ports 463 through sleeve bearing 338 to a
        chamber 465 in each piston. Several oil lines 464 feed out from
        these chambers and are connected to the skirt 466 of each piston
        to provide lubrication to the cylinders walls and the piston
        rings 467. Also leading from chamber 465 is an orifice to squirt
        oil directly onto the inside of the top of each piston for
        cooling. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 28-28c, in which assembly 300 is shown
        configured for use as an aircraft engine 300a, the engine
        ignition includes two magnetos 600 to fire the piston spark
        plugs (not shown). Magnetos 600 and a starter 602 are driven by
        drive gears 604 and 606 (FIG. 28c), respectively, located on a
        lower shaft 608 mounted parallel and below the main drive shaft
        408. Shaft 608 extends the full length of the engine and is
        driven by gear 424 (FIG. 26) of drive shaft 408 and is geared
        with a one to one ratio to drive shaft 408. The gearing for the
        magnetos reduces their speed to half the speed of shaft 608.
        Starter 602 is geared to provide sufficient torque to start the
        engine. </p>
      <p>Camshafts 610 operate piston push rods 612 through lifters 613.
        Camshafts 610 are geared down 2 to 1 through bevel gears 614,
        616 also driven from shaft 608. Center 617 of gears 614, 616 is
        preferably aligned with U-joint center 352 such that the
        camshafts are centered in the piston cylinders, though other
        configurations are contemplated. A single carburetor 620 is
        located under the center of the engine with four induction pipes
        622 routed to each of the four cylinder intake valves (not
        shown). The cylinder exhaust valves (not shown) exhaust into two
        manifolds 624. </p>
      <p>Engine 300a has a length, L, e.g., of about forty inches, a
        width, W, e.g., of about twenty-one inches, and a height, H,
        e.g., of about twenty inches, (excluding support 303). </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 29 and 29a, a variable compression
        compressor or pump having zero stroke capability is illustrated.
        Here, flywheel 322 is replaced by a rotating assembly 500.
        Assembly 500 includes a hollow shaft 502 and a pivot arm 504
        pivotally connected by a pin 506 to a hub 508 of shaft 502. Hub
        508 defines a hole 510 and pivot arm 504 defines a hole 512 for
        receiving pin 506. A control rod 514 is located within shaft
        502. Control rod 514 includes a link 516 pivotally connected to
        the remainder of rod 514 by a pin 518. Rod 514 defines a hole
        511 and link 516 defines a hole 513 for receiving pin 518.
        Control rod 514 is supported for movement along its axis, Z, by
        two sleeve bearings 520. 7ink 516 and pivot arm 514 are
        connected by a pin 522. Link 516 defines a hole 523 and pivot
        arm 514 defines a hole 524 for receiving pin 522. </p>
      <p>Cylindrical pivot pin 370 of FIG. 25 which receives drive arm
        320 is positioned within pivot arm 504. Pivot arm 504 defines
        holes 526 for receiving cylindrical extensions 378, 380. Shaft
        502 is supported for rotation by bearings 530, e.g., ball,
        sleeve, or roller bearings. A drive, e.g, pulley 532 or gears,
        mounted to shaft 502 drives the compressor or pump. </p>
      <p>In operation, to set the desired stroke of the pistons, control
        rod 514 is moved along its axis, M, in the direction of arrow
        515, causing pivot arm 504 to pivot about pin 506, along arrow
        517, such that pivot pin 370 axis, N, is moved out of alignment
        with axis, M, (as shown in dashed lines) as pivot arm 504
        slides-along the axis, H, (FIG. 26) of the transition arm drive
        arm 320. When zero stroke of the pistons is desired, axes M and
        N are aligned such that rotation of shaft 514 does not cause
        movement of the pistons. This configuration works for both
        double ended and single sided pistons. </p>
      <p>The ability to vary the piston stroke permits shaft 514 to be
        run at a single speed by drive 532 while the output of the pump
        or compressor can be continually varied as needed. When no
        output is needed, pivot arm 504 simply spins around drive arm
        320 of transition arm 310 with zero swing of the drive arm. When
        output is needed, shaft 514 is already running at full speed so
        that when pivot arm 504 is pulled off-axis by control rod 514,
        an immediate stroke is produced with no lag coming up to speed.
        There are therefore much lower stress loads on the drive system
        as there are no start/stop actions. The ability to quickly
        reduce the stroke to zero provides protection from damage
        especially in liquid pumping when a downstream blockage occurs.
      </p>
      <p>An alternative method of varying the compression and
        displacement of the pistons is shown in FIG. 33. The mechanism
        provides for varying of the position of a counterweight attached
        to the flywheel to maintain system balance as the stroke of the
        pistons is varied. </p>
      <p>A flywheel 722 is pivotally mounted to an extension 706 of a
        main drive shaft 708 by a pin 712. By pivoting flywheel 722 in
        the direction of arrow, Z, flywheel 722 slides along axis, H, of
        a drive arm 720 of transition arm 710, changing angle, .beta.
        (FIG. 26), and thus the stroke of the pistons. Pivoting flywheel
        722 also causes a counterweight 714 to move closer to or further
        from axis, A, thus maintaining near rotational balance. </p>
      <p>To pivot flywheel 722, an axially and rotationally movable
        pressure plate 820 is provided. Pressure plate 820 is in contact
        with a roller 822 rotationally mounted to counterweight 714
        through a pin 824 and bearing 826. From the position shown in
        FIG. 33, a servo motor or hand knob 830 turns a screw 832 which
        advances to move pressure plate 820 in the direction of arrow,
        Y. This motion of pressure plate 820 causes flywheel 722 to
        pivot in the direction of arrow, Z, as shown in the FIG. 34, to
        decrease the stroke of the pistons. Moving pressure plate 820 by
        0.75" decreases the compression ratio from about 12:1 to about
        6:1. </p>
      <p>Pressure plate 820 is supported by three or more screws 832.
        Each screw has a gear head 840 which interfaces with a gear 842
        on pressure plate 820 such that rotation of screw 832 causes
        rotation of pressure plate 820 and thus rotation of the
        remaining screws to insure that the pressure plate is adequately
        supported. To ensure contact between roller 822 and pressure
        plate 820, a piston 850 is provided which biases flywheel 722 in
        the direction opposite to arrow, Z. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 30, if two cylinders not spaced 180.degree.
        apart (as viewed from the end) or more than two cylinders are
        employed in piston assembly 300, the ends of pins 312, 314
        coupled to joints 306, 308 will undergo a FIG. 8 motion. FIG. 30
        shows the FIG. 8 motion of a piston assembly having four double
        ended pistons. Two of the pistons are arranged flat as shown in
        FIG. 22 (and do not undergo the FIG. 8 motion), and the other
        two pistons are arranged equally spaced between the flat pistons
        (and are thus positioned to undergo the largest FIG. 8 deviation
        possible). The amount that the pins connected to the second set
        of pistons deviate from a straight line (y axis of FIG. 30) is
        determined by the swing angle (mast angle) of the drive arm and
        the distance the pin is from the central pivot point 352 (x axis
        of FIG. 30). </p>
      <p>In a four cylinder version where the pins through the piston
        pivot assembly of each of the four double ended pistons are set
        at 45.degree. from the axis of the central pivot, the figure
        eight motion is equal at each piston pin. Movement in the piston
        pivot bushing is provided where the figure eight motion occurs
        to prevent binding. </p>
      <p>When piston assembly 300 is configured for use, e.g., as a
        diesel engines, extra support can be provided at the attachment
        of pins 312, 314 to transition arm 310 to account for the higher
        compression of diesel engines as compared to spark ignition
        engines. Referring to FIG. 31, support 550 is bolted to
        transition arm 310 with bolts 551 and includes an opening 552
        for receiving end 554 of the pin. </p>
      <p>Engines according to the invention can be used to directly
        apply combustion pressures to pump pistons. Referring to FIGS.
        32 and 32a, a four cylinder, two stroke cycle engine 600 (each
        of the four pistons 602 fires once in one revolution) applies
        combustion pressure to each of four pump pistons 604. Each pump
        piston 604 is attached to the output side 606 of a corresponding
        piston cylinder 608. Pump pistons 604 extend into a pump head
        610. </p>
      <p>A transition arm 620 is connected to each cylinder 608 and to a
        flywheel 622, as described above. An auxiliary output shaft 624
        is connected to flywheel 622 to rotate with the flywheel, also
        as described above. </p>
      <p>The engine is a two stroke cycle engine because every stroke of
        a piston 602 (as piston 602 travels to the right as viewed in
        FIG. 32) must be a power stroke. The number of engine cylinders
        is selected as required by the pump. The pump can be a fluid or
        gas pump. In use as a multi-stage air compressor, each pump
        piston 606 can be a different diameter. No bearing loads are
        generated by the pumping function (for single acting pump
        compressor cylinders), and therefore, no friction is introduced
        other than that generated by the pump pistons themselves. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 38-38B, an engine 1010 having vibration
        cancelling characteristics and being particularly suited for use
        in gas compression includes two assemblies 1012, 1014 mounted
        back-to-back and 180.degree. out of phase. Engine 1010 includes
        a central engine section 1016 and outer compressor sections
        1018, 1020. Engine section 1016 includes, e.g., six double
        acting cylinders 1022, each housing a pair of piston 1024, 1026.
        A power stroke occurs when a center section 1028 of cylinder
        1022 is fired, moving pistons 1024, 1026 away from each other.
        The opposed movement of the pistons results in vibration
        cancelling. </p>
      <p>Outer compression section 1018 includes two compressor
        cylinders 1030 and outer compression section 1020 includes two
        compressor cylinders 1032, though there could be up to six
        compressor cylinders in each compression section. Compression
        cylinders 1030 each house a compression piston 1034 mounted to
        one of pistons 1024 by a rod 1036, and compression cylinders
        1032 each house a compression piston 1038 mounted to one of
        pistons 1026 by a rod 1040. Compression cylinders 1030, 1032 are
        mounted to opposite piston pairs such that the forces cancel
        minimizing vibration forces which would otherwise be transmitted
        into mounting 1041. </p>
      <p>Pistons 1024 are coupled by a transition arm 1042, and pistons
        1026 are coupled by a transition arm 1044, as described above.
        Transition arm 1042 includes a drive arm 1046 extending into a
        flywheel 1048, and transition arm 1044 includes a drive arm 1050
        extending into a flywheel 1052, as described above. Flywheel
        1048 is joined to flywheel 1052 by a coupling arm 1054 to rotate
        in synchronization therewith. Flywheels 1048, 1052 are mounted
        on bearings 1056. Flywheel 1048 includes a bevel gear 1058 which
        drives a shaft 1060 for the engine starter, oil pump and
        distributor for ignition, not shown. </p>
      <p>Engine 1010 is, e.g., a two stroke natural gas engine having
        ports (not shown) in central section 1028 of cylinders 1022 and
        a turbocharger (not shown) which provides intake air under
        pressure for purging cylinders 1022. Alternatively, engine 1010
        is gasoline or diesel powered. </p>
      <p>The stroke of pistons 1024, 1026 can be varied by moving both
        flywheels 1048, 1052 such that the stroke of the engine pistons
        and the compressor pistons are adjusted equally reducing or
        increasing the engine power as the pumping power requirement
        reduces or increases, respectively. </p>
      <p>The vibration cancelling characteristics of the back-to-back
        relationship of assemblies 1012, 1014 can be advantageously
        employed in a compressor only system and an engine only system.
