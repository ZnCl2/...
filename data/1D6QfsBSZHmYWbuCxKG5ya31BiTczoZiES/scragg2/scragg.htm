      <b>Turbine-based Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      Invented by Robert L. Scragg, the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine
      (DCGT) engine, with its patented cyclical detonation technology,
      is poised to revolutionize the heavy-duty truck engine market.<br>
      <br>
      The cylinders in the DCGT don’t have pistons. Rather, the engine
      uses a near continuous spark to detonate the air/fuel mixture in
      each cylinder and it directs the force of the explosion to the
      turbine which spins a shaft equivalent to a car’s crankshaft.<br>
      <br>
      The TTE DCGT engine utilizes a unique Electromagnetic Isothermal
      Combustion (EIC) Process that produces complete combustion of
      fuel-oxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations which minimizes
      unwanted NOx and CO emissions.<br>
      <br>
      The EIC Process enables the TTE DCGT engine to operate with blower
      air at low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing
      and preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. By
      eliminating the compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures, the TTE
      DCGT achieves higher thermal efficiencies in a simplified
      mechanical structure, and provides the following advantages over
      current diesel, gasoline and gas turbine engines.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the features and benefits of the engine are:<br>
      <br>
      * Reduces fuel consumption by about 30%<br>
      * Significantly reduces "greenhouse" exhaust gas emissions<br>
      * Operates on all hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen and synthetic fuels<br>
      * Flex-fuel and mixed fuels capability<br>
      * Fewer moving parts - less maintenance, no pistons, no valves<br>
      * High power-to-weight ratio<br>
      * Lightweight - less than 2 pounds per horsepower<br>
      * Air cooled<br>
      * No lube oil, filters or pumps<br>
      * Cold start capability<br>
      <br>
      In comparing the DCGT with other turbine systems such as the
      Brayton Cycle engine, which work on high pressure, TTE’s DCGT
      works at low pressure at high volume of air/fuel. Also, the
      detonations are intermittent, i.e. pulse detonations versus
      continuous detonations, which saves fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The engine is weighs less and has fewer moving parts, and the
      company expects that the engine will be competitively priced. In
      addition it offers the advantage of fuel economy and emissions
      reduction, as well as flex fuel capabilities...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span>the engine could have
      an efficiency rating as high as 40% when it is optimized with a
      few small changes. This compares favorably with Brayton Cycles
      engines whose efficiency rating is around 10%, and Otto Cycle and
      Diesel engines whose efficiency ratings are around 25 and 30%
      respectively. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mw-headline"> How it Works
      </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "The DCGT is powered by an innovative new electromagnetic
      isothermal combustion process that produces complete combustion of
      fuel-oxidized mixtures in cyclic detonations. <br>
      <br>
      The high-pressure gasses produced by these detonations drive a
      unique turbine producing shaft horsepower. The engine’s unique
      combustion process allows the DCGT to operate with blower air at
      low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing and
      preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. Once the
      compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures has been eliminated, the
      engine both achieves higher thermal efficiency in a simplified
      mechanical structure, and provides significant advantages over
      current diesel, gasoline, and gas turbine engines. <br>
      <br>
      A Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine engine includes a turbine rotor
      contained within a housing. Exhaust ports of respective valveless
      combustion chambers located on opposite sides of the rotor direct
      combustion gasses towards the turbine, which operates in similar
      fashion to a Pelton Water Wheel. <br>
      <br>
      Turbine blades are positively displaced through a blade race
      (tangentially to the turbine shaft) by kinetic impact and
      expansion of gasses exiting from the combustion chambers via
      nozzles, rather than pistons, axial flow, or radial inflo
      expanders. <br>
      <br>
      The combustion chambers are connected by a valveless manifold fed
      with fuel and oxidizer. When combustible gasses are detonated by
      an igniter (via the EIC Process) in one of the combustion
      chambers, the back pressure from the detonation shuts off the fuel
      and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the fuel and
      oxidizer to the opposite chamber, where detonation occurs. The
      process repeats cyclically. Power is taken off the rotor shaft
      mechanically or electrically.<br>

      A conventional rotary blower supplies low pressure air to the
      manifold. (Using a blower rather than a compressor provides many
      benefits, including less exhaust gas per horsepower hour and
      higher thermo mechanical efficiencies than gas turbine or piston
      engines) Low pressure Gaseous Fuel from a throttle regulator is
      injected into the venturis in the manifold, which is adjacent to
      the constant volume combustion chamber. In the combustion chamber,
      a high power electric arc (300 Joules) produces photolytic and
      radiolytic particles and waves, which disassociates oxygen and
      hydrocarbon molecules throughout the chamber, producing complete
      detonation and high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress
      the remaining inert gases. Detonation pressures exceed 80
      atmospheres and produce mean chamber pressures of 20 atmospheres
      to drive the turbine.<b><br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <b>How does the DCGT work?</b><span></span><br>
      <span></span><br>
      <span></span>The Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine (DCGT) engine is
      unique in its operation cycle; simple yet robust and reliable at
      the same time. A cross-section of the engine shows its internal
      components. At the heart of the engine is the turbine wheel which
      consists of a series of blades installed on a disk attached to the
      main drive shaft. Two combustion chambers (CC), that are
      staggered, direct the high-energy detonation gases onto the
      turbine blades. Thermodynamic expansion of the hot gas causes the
      turbine to spin, and low energy gas is discharged from the turbine
      assembly via the exhaust outlets (EO). <br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from the sketch, the air/fuel supply pipes to the
      CC are of different lengths. This is crucial to the successful
      operation of the DCGT. As fuel/air is supplied to both Combustion
      Chambers (CC-1 and CC-2), the path to CC-1 which is shown by the
      blue arrow is shorter than that to CC-2 (green arrow). Detonation
      occurs in CC-1 first. <br style="clear: right;">
      <br>
      When detonation occurs (as shown), two events take place. The
      first event is to introduce high-energy gases to the turbine wheel
      assembly. This will cause the drive shaft to spin delivering
      useful work. The second event which is equally important is to
      create a pressure-based blockage in the supply pipe, as shown.
      This pressure-based blockage allows the next “dose" of fuel/air to
      be delivered to CC-2. Detonation next occurs in CC-2. As a result,
      more high-energy gas is introduced to the turbine wheel with
      additional net gain of useful work. Pressure-based blockage then
      builds up in the supply pipe to CC-2 diverting fuel/air to CC-1,
      and the cycle continues. <br style="clear: right;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="floatright"><span></span>This
      cyclic detonation has several benefits. First, the discontinuous
      use of fuel leads to significant fuel savings and increased
      efficiency. Second, the intermittent introduction of
      high-temperature events (detonation) leads to an overall reduction
      in equilibrium temperature, and thus, longer part life and longer
      maintenance intervals.<br style="clear: right;">

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention described hereinafter is directed to the field of
      detonation cycle gas turbines and to the methods and apparatus
      constituting said turbine system. <br>
      <br>
      In the field of gas turbines and piston engines, there are
      different methods and apparatus which are utilized to convert the
      kinetic and thermal energy of gas reactions in combustion chambers
      to extract useful work. The design of the combustion chambers, the
      expanders, the type of fuel, the fuel-air ratio, the pressure of
      the fuel-air mixture prior to ignition, and the type of ignition,
      all determine the rate of oxidation. The rate of oxidation
      determines and defines whether the fuel and the oxidizer produce a
      constant propagating flame, a deflagrating explosion and
      accelerated flame front, or a detonation and high velocity shock
      waves. In either case, the oxidizer must be activated or raised to
      a higher energy level by some means to initiate the oxidation
      reaction. The manner of the activation will vary the rate of the
      reaction and produce the variation in result from a flame, to a
      deflagrating explosion, to a detonation. <br>
      <br>
      The methods and apparatus utilized in an Otto cycle spark ignition
      gasoline piston engines are variable volume--constant
      pressure--combustion chambers, that induce and compress air and
      fuel mixtures to 6 or more atmospheres reducing the atmospheric
      ignition temperature from 1,000 degree F to 500 degree F, then
      ignite the mixture with an electric spark producing low power
      photolytic and radiolytic radiation, typically 80 millijoules,
      that activates and disassociates oxygen and hydrocarbon molecules
      in the immediate proximity of the electric spark, resulting in a
      deflagrating explosion with an accelerated flame front. The
      thermal energy of the flame front propagates throughout the
      mixture, thermally activating and chemically combining remaining
      reactants in a "chain burn" with typical mean pressures of 90
      pounds per square inch gauge over a time period of 8 to 16
      milliseconds while expanding the pistons down the chambers. The
      methods and apparatus utilized in Otto cycle engines are not
      useable with Diesel cycle engines, Brayton cycle or Detonation
      cycle turbines. Otto cycle engines in the 200 horsepower range
      typically utilize 9 pounds of air and 0.6 pounds of fuel per
      horsepower hour while producing 9.6 pounds of exhaust gas per
      horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      The methods and apparatus utilized in Diesel cycle compression
      ignition diesel fuel piston engines are variable volume --
      constant pressure -- combustion chambers, that induce and compress
      air to 15 or more atmospheres, and injects compressed fuel in the
      top of the chamber at the top of the compression stroke. Molecules
      of oxygen and hydrocarbons disassociate when compressed against
      the hot head of the combustion chambers resulting in free radicals
      that chemically combine exothermally in a deflagrating explosion
      with an accelerated flame front. The thermal energy of the flame
      front probagates throughout the mixture, thermally activating and
      chemically combining remaining reactants in a "chain burn" with
      mean pressures typically in excess of 90 pounds per square inch
      gauge over a time period of 12 to 24 milliseconds while expanding
      the pistons down the chambers. The methods and apparatus utilized
      in in Diesel cycle engines, are not useable with Otto cycle
      engines, Brayton cycle or Detonation cycle turbines. Diesel cycle
      piston engines in the 200 horsepower range typically utilize 11
      pounds of air and 0.55 pounds of fuel per horsepower hour while
      producing 11.55 pounds of exhaust gas per horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      The methods and apparatus utilized in Brayton cycle compression
      ignition turbine fuel gas turbines are constant volume -- constant
      flow -- constant pressure combustion chambers; a compressor that
      compresses air from 3 to 6 atmospheres; a pump that compresses
      fuel up to 40 atmospheres; and an axial flow or radial inflow
      turbine expander. Compressed air is fed into the combustion
      chamber and combined with the hot compressed fuel. An Infrared
      glow plug is often utilized to increase the thermal activation of
      the oxygen and hydrocarbon molecules, at the surface of the plug,
      to bring the mixture to the ignition temperature. Ignition occurs
      as a very low pressure deflagrating explosion with a constant
      pressure flame front. The thermal energy produced by the flame
      front radiates thermal waves with sufficient energy to
      continuously ignite the constant flowing high pressure fuel-air
      mixture and expand the surplus air in the burn plennum to drive
      the turbine while maintaining a constant pressure. Maintaining
      constant pressure is critical. Variation of pressures in the
      combustion chambers will cause flame out. Over pressure in the
      plennum will stall the compressor. The methods and apparatus
      utilized in a Brayton cycle turbine are not useable with Otto
      cycle or Diesel cycle engines, nor Detonation cycle turbines.
      Brayton cycle gas turbines In the 200 horsepower range, operated
      in an open cycle configuration at sea level, typically utilize 40
      pounds of air and 1.2 pounds of fuel per horsepower hour, while
      producing 41.2 pounds of exhaust gas per horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The methods and apparatus utilized in this invention, a Detonation
      Cycle Gas Turbine, are two constant volume--cyclic
      flow--combustion chambers connected by a common manifold; a blower
      that produces and supplies low pressure air to the manifold; a
      fuel pump that supplies low pressure gaseous fuel to the
      combustion chambers; and a constant visible arc ignition; and a
      positive displacement turbine. The blower supplies air to the
      combustion chambers via the manifold. Fuel is Injected into
      venturis in the manifold next to the combustion chambers. The high
      power, 300 joule, arc ignitions, producing photolytic and
      radiolytic particles and waves disassociates oxygen and
      hydrocarbon molecules throughout the combustion chambers,
      producing complete detonation and high velocity shock waves that
      kinetically compress the remaining inert gases in the combustion
      chambers. Detonation pressures exceed 80 atmospheres and produce
      mean chamber pressures of 20 atmospheres to drive the turbine. The
      methods and apparatus utilized in Detonation cycle gas turbine are
      not useable with Brayton cycle gas turbines, nor Otto cycle and
      Diesel cycle engines. The Detonation cycle gas turbine, operated
      in an open cycle configuration at sea level in the 200 horsepower
      range, typically utilizes 5.2 pounds of air and 0.3 pounds of fuel
      per horsepower hour while producing 5.5 pounds of exhaust gas per
      horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a modified Pelton Water Wheel, as the
      turbine wheel, with blades that are positively displaced through a
      blade race by kinetic impact and expansion of gases exiting from
      combustion chambers via nozzles, rather than pistons, axial flow,
      or radial inflow expanders. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a turbine housing with a turbine wheel
      chamber that directs expanding gases through a positive
      displacement blade race tangentially followed by an expanded blade
      race to an exhaust port. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
      supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing gas
      turbines or piston engines, thereby producing less exhaust gas per
      horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
      supply low pressure air, less than 2 atmospheres, via a single
      manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
      supply less air at lower pressure; thereby consuming less work to
      complete a detonation cycle, resulting in higher thermomechanical
      efficiencies than gas turbines or piston engines. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes manifolds, combustion chambers and
      ignition systems that have the capability of cyclically detonating
      fuel-air mixtures without utilizing valves. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes fuel pumps and vaporizers to gasify wet
      fuels prior to mixing with combustion air to produce more complete
      combustion of fuel-air mixtures in the detonation process. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes venturis in the manifolds to uniformly mix
      gaseous fuels with combustion air prior to injection in the
      combustion chambers to produce complete combustion of fuel-air
      mixtures in the detonation process. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a plasma arc ignition, a visibly constant
      illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes, to detonate fuel
      air mixtures and does not require critical Ignition timing. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes low pressure air and fuel mixtures that
      are detonated instanteously, in less than one millisecond,
      producing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress
      inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the
      pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in
      Brayton cycle turbines, Otto and Diesel cycle piston engines. <br>
      <br>
      This invention utilizes a detonation cycle that utilizes less
      working fluid and produces significantly less exhaust gas per
      horsepower hour than Brayton cycle turbines, Otto or Diesel cycle
      piston engines. <br>
      <br>
      At least one turbine is provided in driving relation to a shaft
      supported in bearings mounted in opposite end walls of a housing
      for the turbine. The side walls of the housing are ported to
      accommodate combustion chambers, expansion chambers and exhaust
      ports. The combustion chambers are secured to the housing over
      each respective port, with the firewall end of the chamber facing
      the periphery of the turbine. Expansion chambers and exhaust ports
      are positioned downstream from the combustion chambers. Nozzles
      are ported in the firewalls of the combustion chambers, extend and
      are directed to the periphery of the turbine. High-voltage
      electrodes are positioned in the wall of each combustion chamber
      and are continuously fired by high frequency high-voltage
      transformer and capacitor networks. A low static pressure rotary
      blower is driven by the turbine shaft to supply air as an oxidizer
      via a common manifold feeding two combustion chambers. Fuel gas,
      injected into venturi turbes on the downstream end of the
      manifold, mixes with the oxidizer and is fed into the combustion
      chambers at low static pressure. Both radiolytic and photolytic
      radiation produced by the high voltage-high frequency plasma arcs
      in the combustion chambers atomizes and ionizes oxygen molecules
      initiating instantaneous oxidization and detonation producing
      high-pressure shock waves that kinetically compress Inert gas
      molecules in the chambers. The resulting high-pressure compressed
      gases are directed from the combustion chambers to the periphery
      of the turbine via nozzles. The high pressure compressed gases,
      when exhausted from the nozzles, kinetically impact positive
      displacement blades on the periphery of the turbine, imparting
      momentum to the turbine. As the turbine rotates, the compressed
      gases expand across the periphery of the turbine blades into an
      expansion chamber further accelerating the turbine. The compressed
      gases continue to expand via the respective exhaust ports. The
      torque produced by the acceleration of the turbine and shaft is
      converted to work or power by conventional mechanical or
      electrical means. Acceleration, torque, and resulting power output
      can be increased or decreased by the volumes of combustion
      chambers, the number of combustion chambers and turbines, the
      radius of the turbines, and the amount of air and fuel utilized. <br>
      <br>
      The principles of the invention will be further discussed with
      reference to the drawings wherein preferred embodiments are shown.
      The specifics illustrated in the drawings are intended to

        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the Detonation Cycle Gas
      Turbine is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. Referring to FIGS. 1 and
      2, the turbine system includes a straight drive shaft 12 on which
      are mounted for rotation with the drive shaft, a positive
      displacement turbine wheel 11, a conventional rotary blower 48, a
      conventional flywheel 49 and a conventional power take-off unit 35
      operatively connected to a conventional alternator 37. <br>
      <br>
      The turbine engine further includes a block 30 (FIG. 1) having end
      walls in which the drive shaft 12 is journalled for rotation. The
      block 30 has an internal cavity in which the turbine 11 is housed,
      this cavity includes two axially opposite end walls and an outer
      peripheral wall. The block 30 is suitably air, water or chemical
      cooled. <br>
      <br>
      The turbine wheel 11 (FIG. 2) has a plurality of blades mounted on
      the radially outer periphery thereof at a plurality of
      equiangularly spaced sites. The individual blades extend axially
      from end wall to end wall of the internal cavity, and from the
      outer peripheral wall of the turbine wheel to the outer peripheral
      wall of the internal cavity. Suitable slide bearing surface are
      provided between the turbine blades and cavity walls. Accordingly,
      a succession of chambers is defined in a series about the turbine
      wheel 11 between angularly successive turbine blades. <br>
      <br>
      The turbine engine has two combustion chambers, chambers 14 and 15
      having respective firewalls 24, 25, provided at the inner end
      walls thereof. Fuel-oxidizer manifold ports are provided through
      the outer end walls thereof. A common inlet manifold 47 for
      low-pressure oxidizer gas, is intersected at inlet venturi throats
      20, 21 by fuel inlet orifices 18, 19. <br>
      <br>
      In accordance with principles of the invention, the combustion
      chambers are intersected between the inlet and firewall thereof by
      electrodes 22, 23, the inner ends of which are disposed within the
      combustion chambers, for providing a visible plasma arc therein
      during operation of the turbine engine. Through each firewall,
      directional nozzles 16, 17 communicate through the radially outer
      peripheral wall of the internal cavity of the block 30. <br>
      <br>
      Generally, one-eighth of the way around the internal cavity of the
      block 30 from where nozzles 16, 17 intersects the outer peripheral
      wall of the internal cavity, the internal cavity is provided with
      expansion chambers 26, 27 leading outward to exhaust ports 32, 33.
      <br>
      <br>
      The turbine, block, combustion chambers, inlets and outlets may be
      made of materials and using constructional techniques that are
      utterly conventional in the manufacture of piston and turbine
      engines. <br>
      <br>
      The fuel supply (FIG. 1) for the turbine engine includes two fuel
      tanks. Fuel tank 42 is for gaseous fuels and fuel tank 43 for wet
      fuels. Both are connected by a fuel line to both orifices 18,19,
      via a throttle regulator valve 44. Fuel tank 43 has a motor 54
      that drives a wet fuel pump 52 and sprays fuel into a fuel
      vaporizer 53 that converts the wet fuel to gas which is fed to
      throttle regulator valve 44. <br>
      <br>
      The oxidizer supply for the turbine engine includes a manifold 47
      connecting both venturi inlets 20, 21 with the output side of the
      rotary blower 48. At an upstream end of the manifold 47, a check
      valve 45 is provided for preventing compressed oxidizer backflow
      towards the blower. <br>
      <br>
      The electrical system for the turbine engine system includes a
      battery 36, a starter motor 34, a voltage rectifer 31, a voltage
      regulator 28, an alternator 37, a power switch 46, and two high
      voltage ignition transformers 40,41. In operation, the power
      switch 46 is turned on to actuate the system, and engages the
      starter motor 34 with the battery 36. The starter motor 34 engages
      the flywheel 49 thus turning the drive shaft 12, power take off
      35, alternator 37, and the air blower 48. The air blower 48,
      driven by the drive shaft 12, produces low pressure air that is
      fed via the check valve 45 and manifold 47 to the inlet venturis
      20,21. Fuel gas from fuel tank 42 or 43 is throttled via regulator
      valve 44 into the low pressure air stream via orifices 18,19 and
      into the chambers 14,15, via the venturis 20,21. The alternator 37
      provides electrical power to high voltage transformers 40,41, that
      supply high voltage to arc electrodes 22,23. <br>
      <br>
      According to the preferred design, the low pressure air manifold
      piping to the combustion chamber 14 is shorter in length than that
      to the combustion chamber 15. Accordingly, the fuel-air detonation
      occurs in combustion chamber 14, closely followed by one in
      combustion chamber 15 and so, in alternation. The cyclic
      detonations in combustion chambers 14 and 15 produce high pressure
      gases that expand, and via the respective nozzles 16, 17,
      kinetically impact and expand across respective ones of the blades
      of the turbine wheel 11, thereby turning the drive shaft 12 to
      provide rotary output to the power take-off unit 35. The power
      take-off unit 35 turns the alternator 37 that generates DC power
      via the voltage rectifier 31 and voltage regulator 28 to maintain
      a full charge on the battery 36, and provides continuous AC power
      to the high voltage transformers 44,41. The air blower 48 rotation
      is sustained by the drive shaft 12. <br>
      <br>
      By preference, the rotary blower 48, produces static air pressure
      in the range of 3.5 to 15 pounds per square inch gauge, at the
      output side of the blower. <br>
      <br>
      The gaseous fuel contained in the fuel tank 42 preferably
      comprises propane. However, other gaseous fuels such as hydrogen,
      acetylene, butane, compressed natural gas can be utilized. The
      liquid (wet) fuels contained in fuel tank 43 preferably comprises
      gasoline, however, other wet fuels such as diesel fuel, methanol,
      ethanol, or liquid natural gas can be utilized. The fuel delivery
      pressure (obtained by pressurizing the fuel tank and/or by using a
      wet fuel pump 52 and fuel vaporizer 53 for boosting fuel pressure
      in the fuel delivery line to the orifices 18,19) is preferably in
      the range of 7.5 to 20 pounds per square inch gauge, and at least
      slightly higher than the aforementioned air oxidizer pressure. <br>
      <br>
      The high voltage transformers 40,41 preferably includes a 60 to
      400 cycle, 120 volts AC, primary winding with a 15,000 volt AC
      center-tapped secondary winding with capacitors in parallel across
      each winding, creating an electrical tank circuit that oscillates
      at high frequency and supplies electrical power to the arc
      electrodes 22 and 23. Each 7,500 volt secondary transformer
      winding and capacitor network oscillates at 100,000 cycles per
      second at 40 milliamperes, delivering 300 joule to each of the arc
      electrodes 22,23. <br>
      <br>
      Each arc electrode 22,23 produces electromagnetic radiation, both
      photolytic and radiolytic, from the high frequency plasma arc
      gaps. The density and power of the radiated photons and charged
      radiolytic particles produced by the arcs at electrodes 22 and 23
      scatter throughout the chamber and the low pressure air fuel
      mixture, kinetically impact and split oxygen molecules. The oxygen
      atoms, oxidize the fuel molecules instantaneously throughout the
      chamber producing a detonation and high velocity shock waves
      through the chamber. <br>
      <br>
      The pressure of the shock waves resulting from the detonations
      compress remaining inert gases in the chambers into high pressure
      masses. At the time of each detonation, the overpressure
      momentarily shuts off the air and fuel flow at respective orifice
      18, 19 and venturi turbe 21,22. The compressed gases that exhaust
      via the respective directional nozzle 16,17 disposed in the
      firewall section 24,25 of respective combustion chamber 14,15
      kinetically impact the elliptical blades in the peripheral
      cavities 13 on the outer radial surface of the turbine wheel 11.
      The turbine wheel 11 rotates on and turns the drive shaft 12 in
      the direction of the impact of the pressurized gas masses. The
      expanding gases expand over the tops of the turbine blades which
      are positioned on the radial surface of the turbine at intervals
      that permit impulse and expansion of the compressed gases into the
      expansion chamber 27, further accelerating the turbine. During the
      cut off period of orifice 18 and venturi 21, the blower air or
      other oxidizer is redirected via the manifold 47 to combustion
      chamber 15 via venturi 20 and fuel orifice 19 where the detonation
      process is repeated. <br>
      <br>
      The blower 48 volume, manifold 47 volume, combustion chambers 14,
      15 volumes and nozzles 16, 17 volumes are preferably balanced to
      produce an average displacement that results in fifteen
      detonations per second per chamber. <br>
      <br>
      The mean inlet temperature at the outlets of nozzles 16 and 17 are
      the average temperatures of the compressed gases impacting the
      turbine 11 and elliptical bladed cavities 13 and are controlled by
      the number of detonations per second per chamber. The temperature
      drop across the turbine 11 is equal to the inlet temperature at
      the outlet of nozzle 16 less the outlet temperature at exhaust
      port 32, plus the inlet temperature at the outlet of nozzle 17,
      less the outlet temperature at exhaust port 33. <br>
      <br>
      The speed of rotation of the turbine 11 during operation can be
      regulated by changing the fuel flow input into the combustion
      chamber 14 and 15 via orifices 18 and 19 with fuel valve 44. As
      the fuel is leaned, the detonations become less powerful,
      therefore slowing the turbine 11 and blower 48. As the fuel is
      enriched, the detonations become more powerful and the turbine 11
      and blower 48 increases speed. The greater the range of the
      flammability of the fuel, the greater the range of control over
      the speed of the turbine 11 rotation. <br>
      <br>
      Typical input requirements, at mean operating power, for the
      preferred embodiment of the system are as follows: <br>
      <br>
      Fuel 0.3 pound propane per horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      Air 5.3 pounds per horsepower hour. <br>
      <br>
      This is about one-half the air and fuel needed per horsepower of
      output for Otto cycle and Diesel cycle piston engines, and about
      one-eighth that required for the same output by Brayton cycle
      turbine engines. <br>
      <br>
      Operation of the Detonation cycle turbine is terminated by closing
      fuel regulator valve 44 and disengaging switch 46. <br>
      <br>
      It is within the contemplation of the invention that a plurality
      of the turbines, all in the same block, or in a succession of
      blocks be constructed and jointly operated in the same manner to
      drive the same drive shaft 12. <br>
      <br>
      Reiterating the cyclic operation, and the methods and apparatus
      utilized in the invention; the switch is engaged connecting the
      starter to the battery; the starter engages the flywheel and
      rotates the shaft, the power take-off, the air blower, and the
      alternator. Air is fed into the common manifold connecting the two
      combustion chambers. Gaseous fuel is injected into the venturis
      and mixed with air. The fuel-air mixture is injected into both
      chambers. Photolytic and radiolytic radiation produced by the
      plasma arcs across the high voltage electrodes in the chambers
      atomizes the oxidizer and produces a detonation in one of the
      combustion chambers. The overpressure of the first detonation, in
      the respective combustion chamber, momentarily shuts off the fuel
      and oxidizer flow at the combustion chamber input orifice and
      venturi tube and the fluid flow reverts to the opposing combustion
      chamber, via the manifold, where the second detonation occurs. The
      overpressure mass, compressed gases, products of the cyclic
      deonations, are cyclically exhausted via nozzles into elliptical
      bladed cavities on the peripheral surface of the turbine. After
      each detonation, the pressure in the respective combustion chamber
      and manifold drops below the air and fuel injection pressure on
      completion of exhausting the combusted gases via the nozzle, and a
      new charge of air and fuel is injected by the manifold and
      respective venturi tube, into the respective combustion chamber,
      and the detonation repeats. The impulse of the high-pressure
      high-velocity mass kinetically impacts the elliptical blades of
      the turbine forcing it to rotate. As the turbine rotates the
      compressed gases expand out of the cavity and across the periphery
      of the elliptical blades into the expansion chamber and out the
      exhaust pushing the turbine into faster rotation. The torque
      produced by the acceleration of the turbine and shaft is converted
      mechanically and/or electrically. Acceleration and torque are
      determined by various volumes of fuel-oxidizer mixes, volumes of
      combustion chambers and nozzles, number of combustion chambers and
      number and radius of turbines. <br>
      <br>
      The invention may be further understood with reference to the
      concrete example, a prototype engine test, that is illustrated and
      graphically presented in FIGS. 3-7. <br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 3, there is shown a turbine engine system of FIGS. 1 and
      2, incorporated in an acceleration testing system, results of the
      operation of which are described below in relation to the charts
      shown in FIGS. 4-7. <br>
      <br>
      The engine and test system used in the system of FIG. 3 had the
      following configuration: <br>
      <br>
      BLOCK: Made of machined aircraft aluminum. Measured
      14".times.14".times.14". <br>
      <br>
      TURBINE ASSEMBLY: Two 6.7" diameter turbines, 3" wide, weight
      19.35 lbs., each mounted on 2".times.26"- 10-lb. shaft supported
      by ball bearings. Total weight of turbines 38.7 lbs. Total weight
      of turbine assembly--48.7 lbs. <br>
      <br>
      COMBUSTOR ASSEMBLY: Four 140 ci combustors connected by two
      crossover manifolds. Each combustor was fired by a single
      electrode powered by the electrical device described herein. Each
      had an exhaust nozzle orifice measuring 563/1000", with a
      cross-sectional area of 0.248378 square inches, a total of 0.9935
      square inches for four nozzle orifices. <br>
      <br>
      ENGINE ASSEMBLY TOTAL WEIGHT: Total weight: 262 lbs. <br>
      <br>
      AIR SUPPLY ASSEMBLY: A Roots blower, driven by a 10 HP electric
      motor turning 1760 RPM, produces 17.5 lbs. of air/min., 231 SCFM.
      <br>
      <br>
      FUEL SUPPLY ASSEMBLY: Two 30-lb. propane tanks with pressure
      regulators and control valves supply fuel to each combustor via an
      intake port on each manifold. For safety, only two combustors were
      fuel by each tank by separate fuel lines. Mean combustion heat of
      the propane was 20,500 BTU/lb. <br>
      <br>
      TEST EQUIPMENT: A standard pounds scale was used for weighing
      propane tanks. A Photo-Tachometer was used to measure motor and
      Roots blower RPM and shaft RPM of the engine. A stop watch was
      used for timing acceleration run time. A pyrometer was used for
      measuring inlet gas temperatures at nozzles and outlet
      temperatures at exhaust. <br>

      Fuel tank #1 weight: 51 lbs., 2 oz. <br>
      <br>
      Fuel tank #2 weight: 51 lbs., 4 oz. <br>
      <br>
      Both fuel tanks were then connected to their respective fuel
      lines. <br>
      <br>
      The power switch was engaged, activating the air supply assembly,
      producing 17.5 lbs. of air/min., 231 SCFM, at a velocity of 558
      fps at 1.2 Atms. <br>
      <br>
      Simultaneously, the ignition switch was engaged; the fuel valves
      on both tanks were opened; and the stop watch was started. The
      engine shaft acceleration was measured by the photo-tachometer at
      30, 60 and 90 second intervals. At an elapsed time of 90 seconds,
      the shaft RPM was recorded at 12,587 RPM. The fuel valves were
      closed. The ignition switch was turned off. The air supply
      assembly continued to operate for 3 minutes, cooling the engine.
      The air supply assembly was switched-off and the turbines wound
      down to stop. <br>
