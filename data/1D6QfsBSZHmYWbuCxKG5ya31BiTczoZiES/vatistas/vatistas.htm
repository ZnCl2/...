        <div align="left"> The current global energy crisis means that
          sustainability now supplants necessity as the mother of all
          invention. Concordia University's Georgios Vatistas, professor
          in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering,
          has taken this adage to heart with his reinvention of an
          industrial staple: the heat exchanger.<br>
          <br>
          Used in large-scale commercial settings such as refrigeration
          systems, power plants and petroleum refineries, heat
          exchangers are massive machines that transfer heat from one
          medium to another in order to regulate the temperature of
          industrial processes. Because of the massive scale, this heat
          transfer results in enormous energy demands and huge drains on
          environmental resources.<br>
          <br>
          With the research portion of the project now complete,
          Vatistas has high hopes that his design will be met with
          enthusiastic industrial development. "Ultimately," he says,
          "this heat exchanger will have broad use across countless
          sectors. By responding to industrial needs with a more
          sustainable solution, we're showing that the future of
          engineering can be a green one."<br>
          <br>
          The innovation behind Vatistas's unique design comes from over
          two decades of research into vortex flows. "Growing up in
          southern costal Greece," recalls Vatistas, "I became familiar
          with the concept of vortices at an early age when my elders
          would warn me of the dangers of swimming near whirlpools!"
          Youthful fascination evolved into research passion as Vatistas
          performed advanced theoretical work into how vortices alter
          the flow of fluid substances like air or water. He later went
          on to gain international renown for proving Nobel Prize winner
          J.J. Thomson's 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex
          rings.<br>
          <br>
          But it is on the practical side of things where Vatistas's
          work resonates loudest. When Vatistas realized that swirling
          flow could dramatically increase heat transfer exchange, the
          commercial application of his research quickly became evident.
          He then partnered with Gestion Valéo to investigate new
          designs of heat exchangers and received a prestigious "Idea to
          Innovation" grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering
          Research Council in support of the work.<br>
          <br>
          With the collaboration of PhD student and doctoral fellow <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Mohammed Fayed</span>, Vatistas
          reengineered this widely used device to produce a prototype
          that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">40 times more
            efficient</span> than the traditional model. This
          reinvention represents enormous energy savings, lower
          operating costs and far-reaching industrial implications.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- A heat
          exchanger comprises a first plate. A second plate is spaced
          apart from the first plate and defines a first gap between
          inner surfaces of the first plate and the second plate in
          which a first fluid circulates. A major portion of the first
          gap is free of obstructions. A second fluid contacts an outer
          surface of the first or second plate for heat exchange with
          the first fluid. A first peripheral wall on the periphery of
          the first gap has a curved profile inside the first gap. At
          least one inlet is radially positioned with respect to the
          first gap and injects the first fluid in the gap. At least one
          outlet is centrally positioned in one of the first and the
          second plate to enable the first fluid to exit the first gap.
          The first fluid circulates in a swirling flow in the major
          portion of the first gap.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE APPLICATION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The present application pertains to heat exchangers and, more
          particularly, to a heat-exchanger design for reducing the
          pressure drop of fluids across the heat exchanger.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE ART</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Heat exchangers are commonly used in order to transfer energy
          from one fluid to another through a solid surface. Typical
          heat exchangers feature tubes, ducts or paths (hereinafter
          tubes) in which a first fluid circulates as a result of action
          from a pump, pressure source or the like. A second fluid is in
          contact with an exterior surface of the tube so as to exchange
          energy with the first fluid circulating in the tubes. The tube
          may be shaped in a coil, provided with fins or the like,
          depending on the heat-exchanger configuration (e.g., shell and
          tube, heat-exchanger coil, radiator, etc.)<br>
          <br>
          One of the issues with such heat exchangers is that the tubes
          are costly in terms of material and space. Moreover, because
          of the friction of the first fluid against the surface of the
          tube, there is a substantial fluid pressure drop in the heat
          exchanger. Accordingly, a substantial amount of energy is
          required to maintain a suitable flow of the first fluid in
          heat exchangers . <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE APPLICATION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>

          disk-type heat exchanger in which circulates a fluid or
          combination of fluids, fluid and solid (i.e., liquid and/or
          gas, with solids m suspension) . Another fluid, combination of
          fluid/solid or fluids is m contact with an exterior surface of
          the heat exchanger 10. For simplicity purposes, reference will
          be made to fluids hereinafter. The heat exchanger 10 of Fig. 1
          is therefore said to have a single stage 11.<br>
          <br>
          The heat exchanger 10 of Fig. 1 has a pair of disks 12.
          Typically, the disks 12 are circular m shape, although other
          shapes are considered, preferably with rounded or arcuate
          peripheries. The disks 12 are spaced apart, so as to define a
          gap therebetween, m which the fluid will flow. A peripheral
          wall bounds the gap between the disks 12, and inlets 13 (i.e.,
          one or more) are provided m this peripheral wall or m the
          disks 12, for the injection of fluid into the gap. The
          peripheral wall 13 has a curved inner profile to def me the
          curved inner periphery of the gap In an embodiment, the curved
          inner profile of the peripheral wall 13 is circular. As a
          radial periphery of the gap m which the fluid circulates is
          defined by the pe[pi]pneral wall 13, the disks may be replaced
          by plates or walls of different shapes, etc.<br>
          <br>
          A central outlet 14 projects upwardly from one of the disks
          12, although both disks 12 may be provided with a central
          outlet 14. As the inlet (s) 13 are provided on the periphery
          of the heat exchanger 10, and the outlet 14 is centrally
          positioned, the fluid injected into the gap exits centrally.
          However, it is desired to have the fluid flow m a swirling
          pattern Therefore, when fluid is injected into the inlets 13,
          the inlets 13 may be oriented so as to give a generally
          tangential direction, to cause a swirling pattern of the fluid
          m the gap. Due to the area reduction, the fluid is accelerated
          (i.e., accelerating flow or m-sirik flow) Accordingly, the
          fluid m the heat exchanger 10 adopts the swirling pattern and
          remains between the disks 12 until it exits through the
          central outlet 14. It is observed that the gap between the
          disks 12 is generally free of obstructions. While the fluid
          swirls to the central outlet 14, the fluid contacts the inner
          surfaces of the disks 12 in the gap, thereby exchanging heat
          with fluid on the outside of the disks 12. The residence time
          of the fluid in the stage 11 may be controlled by adjusting
          the flow of the fluid in the stage 11, for instance by
          adjusting the intensity of the pump(s) whether upstream or
          downstream of the heat exchanger 10.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Fig. 2, a configuration similar to that of the
          heat exchanger 10 of Fig. 1 is illustrated, but with two
          stages 11. Accordingly, a first fluid circulates in stage HA,
          whereas a second fluid circulates in stage HB. For clarity
          purposes, the components of the stage HA have been affixed
          with the letter A, whereas the components of stage HB have
          been affixed with the letter B. Therefore, in the case of Fig.
          2, two fluids are in heat exchange using the heat-exchanger
          configuration 10 of Fig. 1, through common disk 12A/B. One of
          the fluid absorbs heat released by the other fluid. The disk
          12A/B is made of a material preferably having high heat
          conductivity, such as metal (e.g., aluminum) . Throughout the
          description, the nomenclature using affixed letters separated
          by a slash (e.g., 12A/B) will refer to a disk separating two
          stages (A and B) . Coatings may be added to the surfaces of
          the disks to minimize the friction of fluids against the
          surfaces of the disks.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Fig. 3, the heat exchanger 10 is shown having a
          multi-disk configuration having five different stages, namely
          stages HA, HB, HC, HD and HE. Accordingly, five different
          fluids may flow in the separate stages of the heat exchanger
          10. Alternatively, some of the stages are combined as
          different passes for a same fluid, or parallel stages for a
          same fluid. As an example, a first fluid may circulate in
          stages HA, HC and HE, while a second fluid circulates in
          stages HB and HC. As another example, the fluid collected at
          the outlets 14A may be subsequently circulated in stages HC
          and HE, amongst other possibilities. It is observed that stage
          HA may have a pair of central outlets 14A, as illustrated.
          Moreover, the outlets of stages HB, HC, HD and HE are
          concentrically positioned with respect to the central outlet
          14A, with the outlets 14 of stages HB- HD forming annular
          geometries.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Fig. 4, a sectional view of the heat exchanger 10
          of Fig. 3 is illustrated, showing that the outlets 14B and 14C
          may comprise outlet pipes projecting radially from the annular
          central outlets 14B and 14C, although various other
          configurations may be used as well. Referring concurrently to
          Figs. 5 and 6, another embodiment of the heat exchanger 10 is
          illustrated, with vanes 15 provided in the gap between disks
          12 (i.e., vanes 15A-15C for stages HA-HC in Fig. 5) . More
          specifically, the vanes 15 are provided adjacent to the
          peripheral wall and thus adjacent to the inlets 13. The vanes
          15 are narrow rigid plates used to guide the flow of fluid in
          adopting a swirling pattern in the gap. A leading edge of each
          vane 15 is closer to the periphery than the trailing edge of
          the adjacent vane 15. Other devices or deflectors may be used
          to guide the flow of fluid into the swirling pattern.
          According to an embodiment, the vanes 15 are radially
          arranged, and may be equidistantly spaced from a center of the
          gap and from one another. In an embodiment, the vanes 15 are
          provided on a ring plate (i.e., annular plate) coplanar
          disposed on one of the disks, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
          Accordingly, all vanes 15 are installed/removed by the simple
          manipulation of the ring plate (e.g., plexiglass) . Another
          similar ring plate with vanes 15 may be provided with a
          smaller diameter and hence be closer to the center of the heat
          exchanger 10. In an example, the vanes are at an 80 degree
          angle from a radius of the gap between the disks 12. Other
          materials may be used as well (e.g., mesh) . Despite the
          presence of vanes 15, a major portion of the gap is free of
          obstructions, whereby the fluid adopts a swirling pattern
          without a spiral-type conduit in the gaps, resulting in
          relatively low friction. The heat exchanger 10 of Figs. 1 to 6
          is also relatively simple to maintain, as the disks 12 may
          readily be separated from one another for maintenance. As is
          shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the inlets 13 and peripheral wall may
          be one integral piece interconnecting the disks 12. The
          applications using the heat exchanger 10 may range from
          domestic heating systems, to steam power plants, to
          refineries, amongst numerous possibilities.<br>
