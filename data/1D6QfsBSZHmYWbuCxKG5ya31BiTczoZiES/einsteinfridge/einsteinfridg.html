      An early invention by Albert Einstein has been rebuilt by
      scientists at Oxford University who are trying to develop an
      environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Modern fridges are notoriously damaging to the environment. They
      work by compressing and expanding man-made greenhouse gases called
      freons - far more damaging that carbon dioxide - and are being
      manufactured in increasing numbers. Sales of fridges around the
      world are rising as demand increases in developing countries.<br>
      <br>
      Now Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford who works
      on green technologies, is leading a three-year project to develop
      more robust appliances that can be used in places without
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      His team has completed a prototype of a type of fridge patented in
      1930 by Einstein and his colleague, the Hungarian physicist Leo
      Szilard. It had no moving parts and used only pressurised gases to
      keep things cold. The design was partly used in the first domestic
      refrigerators, but the technology was abandoned when more
      efficient compressors became popular in the 1950s. That meant a
      switch to using freons.<br>
      <br>
      Einstein and Szilard's idea avoids the need for freons. It uses
      ammonia, butane and water and takes advantage of the fact that
      liquids boil at lower temperatures when the air pressure around
      them is lower. 'If you go to the top of Mount Everest, water boils
      at a much lower temperature than it does when you're at sea level
      and that's because the pressure is much lower up there,' said
      McCulloch.<br>
      <br>
      At one side is the evaporator, a flask that contains butane. 'If
      you introduce a new vapour above the butane, the liquid boiling
      temperature decreases and, as it boils off, it takes energy from
      the surroundings to do so,' says McCulloch. 'That's what makes it
      cold.'<br>
      <br>
      Pressurised gas fridges based around Einstein's design were
      replaced by freon-compressor fridges partly because Einstein and
      Szilard's design was not very efficient. But McCulloch thinks that
      by tweaking the design and replacing the types of gases used it
      will be possible to quadruple the efficiency. He also wants to
      take the idea further. The only energy input needed into the
      fridge is to heat a pump, and McCulloch has been working on
      powering this with solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      'No moving parts is a real benefit because it can carry on going
      without maintenance. This could have real applications in rural
      areas,' he said.<br>
      <br>
      McCulloch's is not the only technology to improve the
      environmental credentials of fridges. Engineers working at a
      Cambridge-based start-up company, Camfridge, are using magnetic
      fields to cool things. 'Our fridge works, from a conceptual point
      of view, in a similar way [to gas compressor fridges] but instead
      of using a gas we use a magnetic field and a special metal alloy,'
      said managing director Neil Wilson.<br>
      <br>
      'When the magnetic field is next to the alloy, it's like
      compressing the gas, and when the magnetic field leaves, it's like
      expanding the gas.' He added: 'This effect can be seen in rubber
      bands - when you stretch the band it gets hot, and when you let
      the band contract it gets cold.'<br>
      <br>
      Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said creating greener
      fridges was hugely important. 'If you look at developing
      countries, if they're aspiring to the lifestyles that we lead,
      they're going to require more cooling - whether that's air
      conditioning, food cooling or freezing. Putting in place the
      technologies that are both low greenhouse-gas refrigerants and low
      energy use is critical.'<br>
      <br>
      McCulloch's fridge is still in its early stages. 'It's very much a
      prototype; this is nowhere near commercialised,' he said. 'Give us
      another month and we'll have it working. <br>
