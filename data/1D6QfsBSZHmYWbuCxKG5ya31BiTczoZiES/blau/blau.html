      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      We recently demonstrated a novel, uniquely-enabling drug for
      telomere extension: nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding telomerase.
      <b>Our mRNA drug extends telomeres in six days by approximately
        the amount by which telomeres shorten over 15 years of normal
        human aging on average, and our drug is transient, being turned
        over within a few days.</b> <br>
      <br>
      Uniquely, this approach has the potential to enable safe telomere
      extension therapy, because it extends telomeres so rapidly that
      the treatment can be very brief (a few days), leaving the normal
      anti-cancer telomere-shortening mechanism intact immediately after
      the brief treatment ends. Our drug does not integrate with the
      genome, is non-immunogenic as it comprises the same modified
      nucleosides recently discovered to comprise mature mammalian mRNA,
      and can encode forms of telomerase which avoid post- translational
      regulation enabling telomere extension even in slowly-cycling cell
      populations such as some progenitors. <br>
      <br>
      We and our collaborators are applying our drug to several
      age-related conditions mediated by short telomeres: hypertension
      and heart failure (Cooke and Blau labs), immunosenescence (Weyand
      lab), and vascular dementia (Yesavage lab) (see supporting
      letters). Each of these applications will be facilitated by this
      project: here we propose to initiate translation of our drug
      toward human studies by optimizing its intravenous delivery and
      demonstrating its safety and efficacy. To optimize i.v. delivery
      of our drug we will compare the best current and cutting-edge RNA
      vehicles. In 2007 it was discovered that in the human body,
      exosomes transport mRNA between cells via body fluids including
      blood, and in 2011 autologous exosomes were used to deliver
      nucleic acid via i.v. injection. We will test autologous exosomes
      as vehicles for i.v. delivery of our drug. We will use our best
      i.v. delivery method to extend telomeres of vascular endothelial
      cells to prevent or treat hypertension in the short-telomere
      mTERC-null mouse model of hypertension. Hypertension is the major
      risk factor in heart failure, and mice with short telomeres
      exhibit both hypertension and heart failure, and short telomeres
      predict both conditions in humans. In both mice with short
      telomeres and in humans, a key causative mechanism of hypertension
      is excess endothelin-1 production by senescent endothelial cells,
      and we (the Cooke lab) have shown that telomere extension prevents
      endothelial cell senescence. Thus there is strong evidence
      supporting the hypothesis that extension of endothelial cell
      telomeres by our drug will help prevent or treat hypertension. We
      will also test the safety of our drug by quantifying immune
      response, tumor formation, and effect on lifespan in the
      short-telomere hypertensive mice. <br>
      <br>
      If successful, this work will initiate translation of our rapid,
      safe telomere extension therapy toward the clinic for prevention
      and treatment of hypertension and other age-related conditions by
      us and our collaborators... <br>

      Compounds and compositions for the transient expression of
      exogenous telomerase activity in a cell are provided. The
      compounds and compositions, which relate to a ribonucleic acid
      coding for a telomerase reverse transcriptase, are useful in the
      extension of telomeres in cells needing such treatment. Such cells
      include, for example, cells that contain shortened telomeres and
      cells from subjects that may benefit from telomere extension, for
      example subjects that suffer from, or are at risk of suffering
      from, age-related or other illnesses. Also provided are methods of
      extending telomeres through the administration of the provided
      compounds and compositions to animal cells, either in vitro or in
      vivo, and kits including the compounds and compositions and
      instructions for use.<b><br>

      <br>
      The mission of CELLSCRIPT is to provide the best products and
      technologies for making and using RNA for translation in cells for
      clinical research and therapeutics.<br>
      <br>
      Current products include kits for in vitro transcription, 5' RNA
      capping using either a cap analog or capping enzymes, and 3' RNA
      polyadenylation, as well as all-in-one kits for making capped,
      poly(A)-tailed mRNA for translation in cells.<br>
      <br>
      As documented in journal articles1–3 and patent applications, the
      technologies on which INCOGNITO RNA kits and other products are
      based were invented by Professors Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman
      at the University of Pennsylvania and exclusively licensed to
      CELLSCRIPT for all fields of use. Drs. Weissman and Karikó showed
      that INCOGNITO mRNA, besides being less immunogenic, is translated
      into protein at much higher levels than the corresponding mRNA
      that does not contain modified nucleosides, both in cultured cells
      and in whole organisms. INCOGNITO-type - and m5C-modified mRNA
      encoding KLF4, LIN28, cMYC, OCT4 and SOX2 that was repeatedly
      transfected into somatic cells, such as fibroblasts and
      keratinocytes, resulted in highly efficient generation of induced
      pluripotent stem cells.<br>
      <br>
      The delivery of protein-encoding INCOGNITO mRNA to cells in
      culture or in vivo to an organism has the potential to produce a
      therapeutic effect by compensating for a missing or defective
      protein, overexpressing a desired protein, inducing a change in
      cellular phenotype, or triggering a disease-specific immune
      response. Thus, we believe INCOGNITO mRNAs will have many uses in
      regenerative medicine, such as for: cell reprogramming; cell
      therapies; cell, tissue or organ transplantation or repair; tissue
      or organ engineering; enzyme replacement therapies; and
      immunotherapies or immunomodulation therapies...<br>
      <br>
      CELLSCRIPT recently introduced INCOGNITO™ RNA Transcription Kits
      for in vitro synthesis of RNA that contains modified nucleosides,
      such as pseudouridine (?) and/or 5-methylcytidine (m5C) in place
      of the corresponding U or C canonical nucleosides (Figure 1).
      These kits are so-named because the capped, polyadenylated and
      nucleoside-modified RNA products (called "INCOGNITO mRNAs") are
      disguised so they do not induce innate immune responses to the
      same extent as the corresponding unmodified mRNAs when transfected
      into mammalian cells that express a variety of RNA sensors...<br>
