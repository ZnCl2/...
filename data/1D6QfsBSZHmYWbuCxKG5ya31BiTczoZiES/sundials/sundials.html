              your Hand</b><br>
            <b>Richard J.A. Talbert</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In an unscientific era when maps were rarities, how did
          ancient Romans envisage their far flung empire? This was done
          by various means for certain, including with the aid of an
          ingenious type of portable sundial that has barely attracted
          notice. As the Romans understood before the first century BCE,
          to track the passage of the sun across the sky hour-by-hour
          one needed to know one's latitude and the time of year, and
          that, furthermore, sundials did not have to be fixed objects.
          These portable instruments, crafted in bronze, were adjustable
          for the changes of latitude to be expected on long
          journeys--say, for instance, from Britain to Spain, or from
          Alexandria to Rome, or even on a Mediterranean tour. For
          convenient reference, these sundials incorporated lists of
          twenty to thirty names of cities or regions, each with its
          specific latitude. One of the insights of Roman Portable
          Sundials is that the choice of locations offers unique clues
          to the mental world-map and self-identity of individuals able
          to visualize Rome's vast empire latitudinally.<br>
          <br>
          The sixteen such sundials known to date share common features
          but designers also vied to create enhancements. Comparison
          with modern calculations shows that often the latitudes listed
          are incorrect, in which case the sundial may not perform at
          its best. But then the nature of Romans' time-consciousness
          (or lack of it) must be taken into consideration. Richard
          Talbert suspects that owners might prize these sundials not so
          much for practical use but rather as prestige objects
          attesting to scientific awareness as well as imperial mastery
          of time and space. In retrospect, they may be seen as Roman
          precursors to comparable Islamic and European instruments from
          the Middle Ages onwards, and even to today's luxury watches
          which display eye-catching proof of their purchasers' wealth,
          sophistication, and cosmopolitanism. Richly enhanced with
          detailed photographs, line drawings, maps, a gazetteer, and a
          table of latitudes and locations, Roman Portable Sundials
          brings these overlooked gadgets out of the shadows at last to
          reveal their hitherto untapped layers of meaning.<br>

      A self-orienting platform device is provided having a platform
      that is rotatably adjustably attached to a body. The device is
      provided with adjustable weights to ensure even rotation. The
      attachment between the platform and the body is such that when the
      body rotates, the platform rotates with it, but the attachment can
      be adjusted such that the user can rotate the platform relative to
      the body when desired. The device comprises a magnet with an
      attached magnetic north indicator, and can be set by rotating the
      platform relative to the body so that when the magnet points to
      magnetic north, the magnetic north indicator points to a selected
      marking or other feature on the platform. The platform can be
      rotated with respect to the body to account for the difference
      between magnetic and true north, so that the selected marker is
      aligned with true north. The device can be used as a
      self-orienting sundial to tell the time of day by the sun, and
      because it is portable and does not have to be reset for different
      locations (within the same general latitude and longitude and time
      period), the sundial can be moved from place to place and used as
      a teaching aid in classrooms, and an interactive decorative object
      in homes and gardens.<br>

      <b> </b>A portable sundial comprises' a graduated dial adjustable
      means for positioning or supporting the dial at any required angle
      to the horizontal and a shadow-casting style or gnomon in the form
      of a pin or rod engageable in a hole in the dial so as to be
      removable therefrom. In one example the sundial comprises a holder
      1, Fig. 3, having a time scale 4 and a hole 7 for the pin 8
      forming the gnomon and the support. The pin 8 is marked with
      latitude graduations so that the holder 1 may be adjusted for the
      correct inclination for the place of use. When not in use the pin
      8 is retained in a tubular recess 12. In another example, Fig. 4
      (not shown), the holder 1 is hinged at its top edge to a plate
      which is hinged to a base plate along which the lower edge of the
      holder is adjustable. In another example, Fig. 6, the scale 4 is
      on a member which is rotatable with respect to the holder 1 so as
      to be adjustable for longitude with respect to a reference mark 5.
      The holder 1 has clamping screws 19 which engage slotted quadrants
      17 on a base 18. If desired the base 18 may be dispensed with and
      the inclination of the holder determined by the pin 8 as before.
      In another example for use in Britain the scale 4, Fig. 1, is on a
      member rotatably carried by a collar 3 which is rotatable with
      respect to the holder 1. The reference mark. 5 is again on the
      holder 1 and the collar 3 has a scale including a reference mark 6
      so that the scale 4 may be adjusted to allow for the difference
      between solar time and G.M.T. at the place of use. The pin 8 is
      retained by a screw 10 and a latitude scale 11 is marked on the
      edge 13 of the holder 1. Insertion of the pin 8 in the hole 12
      locks the parts 1, 3 and 4. A movable cursor may be provided.
      Where the scale 4 is rotatable with respect to the holder 1 the
      instrument may be used in association with a watch as a direction
      finder or to determine longitude. Two scales 4 may be provided,
      one for summer time and the other for winter time.<br>

          In a portable sundial for the mean time at the locality of
          erection or for other meridians (e.g. the standard meridian of
          the country), the dials carrying the hour curves and day
          circles are arranged parallel to the equitorial plane and can
          be turned through 360 about a gnomon, which passes through the
          centres of the dials and is arranged parallel to the earth's
          axis. There are four dials used, two at a time, one pair for
          June to December and the other pair for December to June. Fig.
          1 shows a pair of dials in section, the device being set for
          the 42nd degree of latitude. The two dials are on concave
          plates, one facing upwardly and one downwardly, about a
          central gnomon 8. A triangular base plate 1 secured in a
          horizontal position to a wall has a threaded shaft 2 ending in
          a nut 3. This base plate 1 is so mounted on its support that
          one of its points is directed substantially towards the North
          Pole, for the northern hemisphere. A frame mounted on a plate
          4 is clamped in position by tightening nut 3 on to plate 4 as
          soon as the latter has been adjusted horizontally. In the
          frame is a shaft 5, to the end 5&lt;1&gt; of which is pivoted
          an arm 6 carrying the pair of dials 7. Integral with arm 6 is
          a graduated quadrant 16 which, when the correct mark (42 in
          this case) coincides with the axis of shaft 5, is clamped by a
          screw 17. The device is set to the meridian of the locality as
          follows :-the plate 4 carries a slate 11 with rod 12, eye 13
          and plumb-bob 14. The point indicated on this slate by bob 14
          is marked and from this point as centre two or three circles
          are drawn. The points at which a ray of light through eye 13
          cuts these circles, are marked and the resulting chords are
          bisected. These points of bisection are joined to the common
          centre of the circles, this straight line indicating the
          meridian. The next day when the ray through eye 13 intersects
          this meridian line the dial plates are so adjusted that the
          shadow of gnomon 8 falls on the 12-24 line. Nut 15 is then
          tightened to hold the shaft 5 in its adjusted position. A
          scale on the frame and a pointer 19 rigid with shaft 5
          indicate, after the device. has been adjusted, whether any
          further adjustment has been made. In order to read the time of
          some meridian other than that of the locality of the device,
          it is only necessary to move the dial about the gnomon by an
          amount corresponding to the difference of the meridians. For
          this the edges of the, dials may be graduated.<br>

      <b> </b>A portable sundial is so constructed that at any
      geographical position it may, by a simple adjustment, be adapted
      to give the apparent or mean solar time of that, or any other,
      position. A first gnomon A coacts with the hour lines marked on
      the dial and a second gnomon B coacts with a map also marked on
      the dial and covering the area within which the dial may be used
      correctly. In the construction' described, when the dial is
      horizontal and correctly orientated it is adjusted for Tremoli, 42
      N. and 15 E. In this position the plumb line from the hole g in
      the gnomon A meets the dial at p, on the 42 line for latitude and
      on the 15 line for longitude marked thereon, and the plumb line
      from the gnomon B falls on Tremoli on the map. Passing through the
      point e and at right-angles to the meridian line c-e is the
      equinoctial line. c is the dial's centre and g, c lies along the
      polar axis. If the dial be taken to a place of different latitude
      on the same meridian, say 50 E., the dial is orientated as above
      and then rotated about the equinoctial line 8 , the difference
      between the latitudes of Tremoli and the new place; the
      plumb-lines falling then on the correct latitude and longitude

      different longitude to Tremoli, say 50 N. and 30 E., the dial is
      first orientated and rotated 8 about the equinoctial line as
      above, and then rotated about the line g-c until the plumb line
      from g falls on the line corresponding to the new meridian, 30 E.
      The dial may also be so adjusted as to give the time for a

      <b> </b>A&nbsp; sundial consists of a gnomon which serves to cast
      a shadow, and a face on which the shadow is cast, which is marked
      so that when the sundial is illuminated by sunlight, the position
      of the shadow indicates the time. In a conventional sundial, the
      face has a curve with times marked on it, and the gnomon casts a
      shadow which has a straight edge so that the time is indicated by
      the position on the curve where the curve is crossed by the
      straight edge of the shadow. Such a sundial indicates time in
      solar time so that to ascertain the time in standard time, it is
      necessary to add to or subtract from the solar time a correction
      amount which varies throughout the year. This invention is a
      sundial in which the part of the gnomon's shadow that indicates
      the time is not an edge but a single point, and every point on the
      face indicates a time instead of just points on one curve. The
      face of this invention ca.n be marked so that it indicates the
      time accurately in standard time. I call this invention a

      <b> </b>A spontaneous azimuth orientation mechanism by which a
      line connecting the horizontal component direction of the
      projection axis line of a time projection plate or a projection
      rod at a sundial to the magnetic pole of the earth or the
      south-north of the earth's axis is set simply to be horizontal,
      and by which the face of a time display board is set simply so as
      to be held horizontally. SOLUTION: The sundial as a whole is
      constituted of a float-type pedestal 4 in which a magnet 4 is
      built in a magnet mounting part formed under the face of the time
      display board 11, and it is made to float on a liquid such as

      <b> </b>PURPOSE:To improve decorative appearance of a sundial
      thereby to increase the attention of a user by memorizing
      holographic interference fringes agreeing in number to reference
      lights in directions corresponding to a plurality of time points
      onto a photosensitive material. CONSTITUTION:A laser light is
      divided into two, one being projected to an object 4. A reflecting
      light or passing light of the one light projected to the object 4
      is made an object light 2 and interfered with the other divided
      reference light 1. Accordingly, a photosensitive material 3 as
      exposed. Thereafter, an object light 7 and a reference light 5
      from another object 6 are interfered to expose the material 3
      which remains undeveloped. The direction of incidence of the first
      reference light 1 upon the photosensitive material 3 is made
      coincident with the direction of the sun beam at a specific time
      of a certain season. Moreover, the direction of incidence of the
      second reference light 5 is agreed with the direction of the sun
      beam at a different time. The number of times of the multiplied
      exposure is set for each time by dividing the radiating time of
      the sun. The recorded hologram becomes reproduced lights 1', 5'
      under the sun beam and the images of the objects recorded by the
      reference lights 1, 5 corresponding in direction to the sun beam
      at that time are reproduced as virtual images<br>

      <b> </b>PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To obtain a top type sundial which
      can be understood easily by specifying the intersection of a
      projection rod and a dial, and the graduation equal to those
      obtained by translating a flat sundial at a latitude remote from
      the pole thereby eliminating the difficulty at the time of reading
      the graduation. SOLUTION: The top type sundial comprises a dial 1
      where the north face side (summer season side) is perpendicular to
      a projection rod 4 just like a conventional one but the south face
      side (winter season side) is inclining by 70 deg. against the
      projection rod 4. The south face dial 1 is provided with
      graduations at latitude of 70 deg.. When the sundial is installed
      in accordance with the latitude and longitude of setting point, an
      adjusting screw 3 is fixed to a surface 2 being cut off in order
      to eliminate substantially upper half of the dial 1 having no
      relation with the projection rod 4. The length from a point 6
      where one end of the projection rod 4 touches a horizontal base 5
      to the point 7 of screw 3 is adjusted such that the angle between
      the projection rod 4 and a horizontal plane matches the latitude
      at an installing place and then the screw 3 is tightened. More
      specifically, a flat sundial at a different latitude is translated
      thus eliminating the difficulty at the time of reading the
      graduation thus facilitating the understanding.<br>

      <b> </b>Greenwich mean time is read on a sun-dial by means of a
      director OP adjustably fixed to a rotatable disc H and having a
      curve, Fig. 2, marked on the vane 0, on which curve the image of
      the aperture Q is brought before reading time on the scale A
      against the pointer K. The disc H is graduated in intervals of 14
      22 and reads as a vernier against the 15 graduations on the fixed
      plate A, the reading being the nearest hour to the pointer plus or
      minus the minutes marked on the vernier at the coincident marks of
      the two scales. The displacement of the image right or left from
      the median line R when the pointer is at mean time is d tan #, d
      being the distance between Q and 0 and # being the angle in
      degrees corresponding to the equation of time. The value of # is
      obtained by multiplying the difference of time in minutes by 4.
      The displacement above or below the equinoctional position S due
      to declination is arrived at by multiplying the tangent of the
      angle of declination by d. The curve constructed from these
      displacement values is marked in months and provided with arrows
      showing the direction of motion. The director may be adjusted by a
      scale and pointer N for reading summer time. The position of the
      director pivot I on the disc may be varied. The equatorial plate A
      is adjustably connected to the fixed plate B by hinges C and
      telescopic arms D, graduations E being provided for different
      latitudes if desired. A lens may be fitted in the hole Q to give a
      brighter image, the focal length of the lens being the average
      distance Q to R. The director vane 0 may be curved and the diagram
      correspondingly modified.<br>

                </b></b></b></b></b></b>A horizontal sundial ( 1 ) that
      can be used to find standard time accurately and be manufactured
      on a commercial basis for any specific location, incorporating a
      gnomonic projection map ( 1 M), a wire gnomon ( 1 a) to indicate
      the time on a scale ( 1 b), and the point of noon on the map ( 1
      c), and a bead ( 1 d) located directly above the center of the
      dial for indicating the Sun's overhead position on the map ( 1 e),
      and marking special occasions and special dates<br>

                </b><b>SUNDIAL </b></b><br>
            </b></b></b></b>Various embodiments of the sundial disclosed
      herein may be used to determine the time of day based on the
      position of the sun. The sundial may comprise an at least
      substantially spherical curved reflector that may be at least
      partially transparent and at least partially reflective such that
      light from the sun can pass through a surface of the reflector and
      be reflected off of an internal surface of the reflector to
      reflect an image of the sun from the internal surface. The sundial
      may further comprise a dial face for viewing of a reflected image
      of the sun to provide at least an approximate indication of the
      time based on the position of the reflected image of the sun on
      the dial face.<br>

      A horizontal plate graduated after the manner of a sundial has a
      style which is angularly adjustable by means of a knob and
      gearing. The altitude of the style is indicated on a scale. The
      instrument is intended for the determination of latitude and local
      time.<br>

      The inside of the hemisphere of the sundial described in the
      parent Specification, or of a hemisphere supporting a
      sunshine-recorder, is lined with a map of the terrestial
      hemisphere so that the instrument can be adjusted for any place by
      a central plumbline.<br>
