        <p><b>The Discovery</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the Fall of 1990, two medical
          researchers, Drs.William Lyman and Steven Kaali, working at
          Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City made an
          important discovery. They found that they could inactivate the
          HIV virus by applying a low voltage direct current electrical
          potential with an extremely small current flow to AIDS
          infected blood in a test tube. Initially, they discovered this
          in the lab by inserting two platinum electrodes into a glass
          tube filled with HIV-1 (type 1) infected blood. They applied a
          direct current to the electrodes and found that a current flow
          in the range of&nbsp; 50-100 microamperes (uA) produced the
          most effective results. Practically all of the HIV viral
          particles were adversely affected while normal blood cells
          remained unharmed. The viral particles were not directly
          destroyed by the electric current, but rather the outer
          protein coating of the virus was affected in such a way as to
          prevent the virus from producing reverse transcriptase, a
          necessary enzyme needed by the virus to invade human cells.
          Reverse transcriptase allows the virus to enter a human T cell
          line (called CEM-SS) and commandeer the DNA reproduction
          machinery. After using the host cell to reproduce itself into
          thousands of new virii, the swollen host cell (now called
          syncytia or giant cell) will burst and spew the contents into
          the bloodstream or lymph system. This is how the virus
          spreads, but lacking reverse transcriptase, the HIV virus
          can't invade the host cell and it becomes vulnerable to
          destruction by the body's immune system. (The details of this
          experiment can be read from Kaali's patent application.) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Getting the Word Out?</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A brief announcement of this
          discovery appeared in The Houston Post&nbsp; (Mar 20, 1991),
          then in Science News (Mar. 30, 1991 pg. 207) and later
          in&nbsp; Longevitymagazine: (Dec.1992 pg. 14). Following their
          work in the Fall of 1990, Kaali and Lyman presented their
          findings at the First International Symposium on Combination
          Therapies (an AIDS conference) in Washington DC on March 14th,
          1991. Kaali outlined two methods for treating an AIDS patient
          with this new therapy: One method involved removing a small
          amount of blood, electrifying it and then returning it to the
          patient's body. The second method involved sewing a miniature
          electrifying power supply along with two tiny electrodes
          directly into the lumen of an artery. For long term treatment,
          the mini electrifying unit needed to be removed and relocated
          to a new artery site after 30-45 days since scar tissue and
          calcification forming around the implant unit would lead to
          artery blockage. Kaali (along with co-inventorPeter Schwolsky)
          filed for a patent on this implantable electrifying device on
          Nov 16, 1990 and nine months later was granted patent
          #5,139,684&nbsp; on August 18, 1992. It's interesting to note
          two things here: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">1. In order to obtain a patent from
          the United States Patent Office, Kaali and Schwolsky had to
          prove that the device works as claimed. Lacking solid proof,
          US patents are simply not granted. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">2. Very often it takes years to
          obtain a patent, yet this patent was granted in only nine
          months; a further indication to me of the strength of their
          demonstrated claims </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It's also interesting to note that
          other than the 3 publications mentioned above and the March
          '91 AIDS conference, nothing again appeared in print, radio,
          or TV about this important discovery as a potential treatment
          and cure for AIDS from Kaali and company. Most knowledgeable
          observers feel that Kaali and Lyman's discovery was
          intentionally suppressed following the March '91 AIDS
          conference presentation. If AIDS research was on the level and
          not the sham that it actually is, this should have made front
          page news around the world. (Around 1999, I was contacted by a
          woman with AIDS who had managed to reach Dr. William Lyman
          over the phone. She asked him about his experiments with Kaali
          regarding blood electrification and if she could obtain the
          treatment through them. Lyman denied any knowledge of any AIDS
          treatment or cure. He said he never heard of Dr. Kaali and he
          had no idea what she was talking about concerning blood
          electrification and then hung up on her. What does that tell
          about the power of the people behind the suppression of this
          discovery?) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Enter Dr Bob Beck</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A man named Walter Schnitder drew
          Dr Robert C. Beck'sattention to the above-mentioned item in
          Science News. Beck looked up the patent and decided to try and
          duplicate the therapy, but he wanted to do it non-invasively;
          that is by applying the electric current from outside the
          body. Now if you apply a direct current (DC) potential to the
          skin, you're going to get an electrolysis effect and that can
          cause problems, so Beck designed a circuit that varied the
          voltage with an alternating current (AC) at a very low
          frequency and avoided the electrolysis problem. The waveform
          that Beck chose is not the typical sine wave seen in AC
          household outlets, but rather is a bi-phasic square wave,
          meaning that the waveform voltage has a positive half and a
          negative half, allowing the current to reverse direction each
          half cycle. Square waves generate a large number of harmonics.
          Harmonics are frequency multiples of the original frequency.
          Odd harmonics are mutibles of the original frequency
          multiplied by 3, 5, 7 etc. and even harmonics are multibles of
          2. For example, the odd harmonics of a 4 Hertz (Hz) square
          wave would be 12 Hz , 20 Hz, 28 Hz,&nbsp; etc. right up into
          the radio frequency range. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Georges Lakhovsky, Nikola Tesla and
          many other scientists had discovered that everything in Nature
          has its own resonant frequency including every bacteria,
          virus, parasite, and fungus on the planet. Dr. Royal Rife was
          able to cure terminal, end stage cancers in the 1930's by
          applying the specific resonant frequencies of certain unique
          bacteria that are always assocaited wtih all types of cancers.
          The steady application of the bacteria's resonant frequency by
          plasma wave radiation caused the bacteria to internally
          shatter and eviscerate, thus destroying it (and all the other
          bacteria within the body that possessed the same resonant
          frequency) . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While Kaali and Lyman used DC
          current to deactivate the AIDS virus, Beck found that he could
          get he same results using the 3.92HZ square wave. Kaali and
          Lyman found that the amount of the current applied was the
          critcal factor and if they kept the current within a range of
          50-100 micro amperes- they were able to disable the HIV virus
          within a petri dish as mentioned above. Kaali then worked out
          a design of a small battery with two tiny electrodes that
          could be sewn directly into an artery in the arm or leg. By
          maintaining the current flow between the two electrodes within
          the 50-100 micro ampere range, the HIV particles were
          gradually disabled within the bloodstream and the AIDS victim
          would gradually recover his health. The procedure required
          surgery that costs about $5,000 (at that time). The implanted
          electrodes would cause scarring of the artery walls, so they
          had to be removed and implanted in a new section of an artery
          every month or so, costing another $5,000 each time the
          procedure was done. It took about 6 or 7 months to see a
          substantial improvement in the AIDS patient. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Beck studied Kaali's patent and
          tried applying the electrodes to the skin directly over those
          arteries that were close enough to the skin surface. The
          50-100 micro ampere current could be created within the artery
          by electromagnetic induction allowing the entire therapy to be
          applied externally, without the need for implanting electrodes
          into the arteries. The device he put together to accomplish
          this is today called a blood electrifier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Beck started by applying his blood
          electrifier to himself. He originally placed the electrodes
          over leg arteries near the ankles of either leg, then changed
          the location to two different spots on the arm, and finally
          found that it worked just as well if he placed the two
          electrodes near each other over the ulnar and radial arteries
          just behind the wrist. To find the correct location in order
          to center the electrodes exactly over the artieries, Bob
          recommends carefully feeling for the pulse of either artery
          and marking the path of the artery with a ball point pen. You
          can then memorize the correct location and align the
          electrodes over the artery path precisely and hold them in
          place with a stretchy wrist band that's held together with
          velcro. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Beck Breakfast Group</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Bob Beck has been giving talks for
          many, many years on a variety of topics from Tesla to
          psychotronics. I first heard him in 1994 on an after-midnight
          radio show out of Los Angeles called "Something's Happening"
          with Roy of Hollywood ( KPFK, 90.7 FM). Bob was getting ready
          to give a talk at the Pasadena Health Expo that upcoming
          weekend and proceeded to explain to Roy what he had discovered
          with blood electrification. I was amazed and blown away by
          what he told Roy. I had to learn more, so I made it my
          business to be at that convention and attend Bob's lecture...

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This invention relates to a novel
          combined filter and electrical field force method and system
          employing mechanical filtering in combination with the use of
          electric field forces to eliminate larger size particles
          entrained in fluids which are larger than 0.2 microns in size,
          and successively or simultaneously subject the fluid to
          electric field forces to attenuate virus, bacteria, parasites
          or fungus entrained in fluids such as blood or other body

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. patent applications Ser. No.
          07/615,800, filed Nov. 16, 1990, now issued U.S. Pat. No.
          5,139,684, entitled "Electrically Conductive Methods and
          Systems for Treatment of Blood and/or Other Body Fluids and/or
          Synthetic Fluids With Electric Forces"--Steven Kaali and Peter
          M. Schwolsky, Inventors, discloses novel electrically
          conductive methods and systems for transferring blood and/or
          other body fluids (such as amniotic fluids), and/or synthetic
          fluids such as tissue culture medium, from a donor to a
          transfusion recipient or storage receptacle, or vice versa, or
          for recirculating a single donor's blood or other body fluids
          through components of a treatment system external of the body
          or by implant devices for purging such contaminants. This
          treatment uses a novel low voltage, low current electrically
          operated vessel for direct electric treatment of blood and/or
          other body fluids, and/or synthetic fluids with electric field
          forces of appropriate field strength to attenuate contaminants
          such as bacteria, virus, fungus or parasites contained in the
          blood and/or other body fluid and/or synthetic fluids, and
          thereby render such contaminants and/or fluids ineffective to
          infect or affect normally healthy human cells. "Attenuate"
          means to reduce the infectivity of the blood, other body
          fluids, and/or synthetic fluids such as tissue culture medium
          being treated. The attenuation is believed to be achieved
          either by the direct and/or indirect physical effect of the
          electricity on the virus, bacteria, parasites and/or fungus,
          and/or the removal of such contaminants from the fluid being
          treated. The treatment, however, does not damage the fluid or
          render blood or other body fluid biologically unfit for use in
          humans or other mammals after the treatment. The treatment can
          be achieved with electric field forces during normally
          occurring transfer processing from a donor to a recipient or
          collection receptacle, or vice versa, or during recirculation
          of a single donor's blood or other body fluids, and/or
          synthetic fluids. A similar method and system using
          alternating current voltage and current is described in U.S.
          patent application Ser. No. 07/615,437 filed on Nov. 16, 1990
          concurrently with the above-described U.S. patent application
          Ser. No. 07/615,800 now issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,684. The
          disclosures of both these applications hereby are incorporated
          into the disclosure of this application in their entirety. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The above-described novel method
          and system originally disclosed in the above-noted pending
          U.S. patent applications did not, however, include within its
          disclosure appropriate and efficient means for screening out
          larger particles that might be entrained in the fluid being
          treated which are larger than 0.2 microns in size, prior to
          treatment. To overcome this deficiency, the present invention
          was devised. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is therefore a principle object
          of this invention to provide an improved method and system for
          treating blood and/or other body fluids (such as amniotic
          fluids) of mammals as well as synthetic fluids. The improved
          method and system comprises subjecting a fluid to be treated
          to mechanical filtering for elimination of any particles
          contained therein which exceed 0.2 microns in size and
          additionally subjecting the fluid being treated to electric
          field forces in the microwatt/milliwatt region induced by a
          relatively low voltage of a few volts and low current
          densities of from about 1 microampere per square millimeter to
          about a few milliamperes per square millimeter which does not
          exceed a value that could impair the biological quality and
          characteristics of blood or other fluids being treated. The
          mechanical filtering preferably takes place serially in stages
          whereby increasingly smaller size particles are serially
          filtered out by mechanical filter means. The treatment with
          electric field forces preferably is done concurrently with the
          mechanical filtering, but alternatively may be done

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BEST MODE OF PRACTICING THE
            INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>FIG. 1</b> is a partial
          schematic drawing of a novel filtration and electrical
          treatment method and system according to the invention. In
          FIG. 1 a plastic or other closed, electrically insulating,
          treatment vessel 11 is provided which has an elongated
          cylindrical shape with both ends closed as shown at 12 and 13.
          The ends 12 and 13 are provided with inlet and outlet openings
          through pipes 14 and 15, respectively. Secured within the
          hollow interior of cylindrical vessel 11 are a series of
          filter plate elements 16, 16A, 17 and 17A. The filter plate
          elements preferably are fabricated from an electrically
          conductive material such as platinum which is substantially
          chemically inert and does not chemically react with blood or
          other human body fluid or synthetic fluids such as tissue
          culture medium. Each of the filter plate elements 16 and 16A
          have a plurality of aperture openings formed therein, which
          may or may not be axially aligned with respect to each other,
          but are of a given size for screening out and blocking
          particles contained in fluids being filtered which are in
          excess of the given size. For example, filter plate elements
          16 and 16A may serve to filter out particles having a cross
          sectional dimension which is equal to or greater than 4
          microns in size. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Downstream in the liquid flow path
          through vessel 11, a second set of filter plate elements 17,
          17A are supported. The filter plate elements 17, 17A likewise
          are fabricated from a suitable electrically conductive
          material such as platinum and have sets of aperture openings
          formed therethrough which may or may not be axially aligned
          with respect to each other. The aperture openings in the
          filter plate elements 17 and 17A however are smaller and more
          numerous than the openings in filter plates elements 16 and
          16A. For example, the aperture openings in the filter plate
          elements 17, 17A may be sized to block or filter out particles
          having a size either equal to or in excess of 0.2 microns in
          size up to 4 microns in size. While only two different size
          sets of filter plate elements have been illustrated, it is
          believed obvious to those skilled in the art that additional,
          differently sized filter plate elements may be included within
          the vessel 11 depending upon the nature of the particles which
          one desires to filter out from fluid being treated with the
          system. The filter plate elements 16, 16A and 17, 17A are
          mounted within the interior of hollow, cylindrical vessel 11
          substantially at right angles to the flow path that extends
          longitudinally through vessel 11 from inlet end 12 to and
          through outlet end 13. The mounting of the filter plate
          elements is such that each filter element is electrically
          insulated from the other filter plate elements mounted within
          vessel 11. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, fluid to be filtered
          is supplied to the inlet end 12 of insulated vessel 11 via
          inlet conduit 14 and traverses past the filter element plates
          16, 16A, 17 and 17A then exits through the fluid outlet
          conduit 15. At the exit side all particles entrained in the
          fluid which are larger than 0.2 microns in size will have been
          filtered out. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Concurrently with the
          above-described filtering action, a low value electrical
          potential of the order from about 0.2 to about 12 volts is
          supplied to respective ones of the filter element plates 16,
          16A, 17 and 17A from a direct current power source 23 via
          selector switches 19, 20, 21 and 22. Switches 19, 20, 21 and
          22 serve to electrically connect respective ones of the filter
          plate elements to alternate polarity output electric
          potentials supplied from the direct current electric power
          supply 23. The electric potential supplied to respective ones
          of the filter plate elements 16, 16A and 17, 17A may vary in
          magnitude from about 0.2 to about 12 volts, for example, but
          are of opposite polarity relative to adjacent filter plate
          elements. For example, assume that a direct current electrical
          excitation voltage having positive (+) polarity and a value of
          4 volts is supplied to the filter plate element 16. Then a
          negative (-) 4 volts or any other of the above-noted values is
          supplied to the neighboring filter plate element 16A.
          Consequently, there will be a potential difference of 8 volts
          between the adjacent filter plate elements 16 and 16A through
          which the fluid being treated must pass. If desired, the
          potential difference existing between the next adjacent pairs
          of plates 17, 17A may be adjusted either to higher or to lower
          values in order to adjust the strength of the electric field
          between the stages of filtration to a desired value. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, the system functions
          in the same manner as was described more fully in the
          above-noted co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 07/615,800
          now issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,684, the disclosure of which
          has been incorporated into the disclosure of this application
          in its entirety. In effect, the electrical treatment
          attenuates any virus, bacteria, fungus and/or parasite so as
          to render them ineffective to infect normally healthy cells
          while maintaining the biological usefulness of blood, and/or
          other body fluids, and/or synthetic fluids being treated.
          During operation, the low voltage electric potentials applied
          to the respective filter plate elements should be of the order
          from about 0.2 to about 12 volts and should produce current
          flow through the fluid in current densities ranging from about
          1 microampere per square millimeter of filter plate element
          area exposed to fluid being treated to about 1 milliampere per
          square millimeter with direct current excitation to about 2
          milliamperes per square millimeter using alternating current
          excitation. Treatment time within this range of parameters may
          extend for a period of from about 1 minute to about 12 minutes
          during electrification. However, treatment time may be longer
          where, in certain cases, more complete attenuation of the
          contaminants in the fluid being treated is desired. Also, in
          certain circumstances where faster attenuation of contaminants
          is desired, the excitation voltage may exceed the 0.2 to about
          12 volt range indicated for most treatments. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">During operation of the method and
          system described with relation to the system described in the
          above-noted U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/615,800 now
          issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,684, it has been observed that
          under certain conditions bubbling of gas around one or more of
          the plate elements such as 16, 16A, 17 or 17A can occur. To
          avoid any adverse effects on the fluids being treated, it is
          possible to reduce or even eliminate the production of bubbles
          at the plate elements during operation by a number of
          techniques. One is to fill the treatment vessel 11 so
          completely that a gas phase cannot develop above the liquid in
          the vessel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Another technique that can be used
          to avoid bubbling at the plates is to provide a suitable vent
          pipe such as shown at 38 in the embodiment of the invention
          shown in FIG. 2 of the drawings. By introducing pressurized
          air or a suitable inert gas that does not chemically react
          with the fluids being treated, the liquid can be pressurized
          to the point that the liquid will not pass into the gas phase.
          Another alternative is to vent any gas produced by bubbling to
          the atmosphere via a vent tube such as 38 shown in FIG. 2.
          Other techniques for obviating the bubbling around the filter
          plate elements will be suggested to those skilled in the art.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">During operation of the filter
          elements 16, 16A, 17, 17A it is possible that one or more of
          the filter elements can become clogged either partially or
          otherwise. In this eventuality the system can be shut down and
          the clogged element replaced with a new clean filter element.
          Alternatively, it is possible to design the system so as to
          provide two parallel treatment paths together with suitable
          valve means to selectively supply fluid being treated to one
          treatment path or the other. With such an arrangement it would
          not be necessary to shut the system down during operation to
          remove and replace a clogged filter plate element. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 2 is a partial perspective
          view of a second embodiment of the invention which employs a
          generally rectangular, box-like treatment vessel 31 fabricated
          from plastic or other electrical insulating material closed by
          an insulating top 32 and an insulating bottom 33. A fluid
          inlet conduit 34 is provided in top 32 and an outlet conduit
          35 is provided in bottom 33. The near sides and top of vessel
          31 have been broken away to show the construction of the
          mechanical filter elements 36, 36A and 37, 37A all of which
          are fabricated from platinum or other relatively inert
          electrically conductive material which is compatible with
          human blood, and/or body fluids, and/or synthetic fluids,
          and/or tissue. As shown in FIG. 2, the upper set of filter
          plate elements 36 and 36A are relatively coarse compared to
          the lower set of filter plate elements 37 and 37A. Again, for
          example, the upper filter plate pair 36, 36A may be designed
          to prevent particles which are 4 microns or larger in cross
          section from passing through the elements while the lower set
          of elements 37, 37A may be designed to prevent the passage of
          particles 0.2 microns or larger from passing through. Again,
          as a matter of design, the passages through the sets of filter
          plates elements 36, 36A and 37, 37A may be axially aligned or
          relatively displaced from each other so as to form a more
          tortuous path for fluid flowing downwardly from the fluid
          inlet 34 to the discharge outlet 35. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An electric power supply 23 is
          provided which may be either direct current or alternating
          current so long that measures are taken to assure that the
          electric potential supplied to the respective filter plate
          elements 36, 36A and 37, 37A are out of phase relative to each
          other to assure that a potential difference exists between
          adjacent pairs of the filter elements as described with
          relation to FIG. 1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, the embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIG. 2 functions in substantially the same
          manner as that shown in FIG. 1 to provide for mechanical
          filtering out of particles entrained in fluid to be treated by
          the system which are greater than 0.2 microns in size.
          Concurrently, electrification of the filter plate elements in
          the manner described with relation to FIG. 1 causes
          attenuation of virus, bacteria, fungus, and/or parasites which
          might be entrained in the fluid being treated by the system
          thereby rendering them ineffective as described more fully in
          the above-referenced co-pending U.S. patent applications. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If necessary, anticoagulants may be
          used in the fluids being treated with either embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention provides a
          combined filtration-electrical treatment method and system
          which in operation serves to attenuate virus, bacteria, fungus
          and/or parasites found in blood, body fluids and/or synthetic
          fluids (such as tissue culture medium) used in the production
          and purification of biologicals. The system is designed such
          that no damage or impairment of the biological usefulness of
          the fluids being treated occurs as a result of the combined
          filtration and electrification treatments. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Having described two embodiments of
          a novel combined filtration and electrification treatment
          method and system according to the invention, other
          modifications and variations of the invention will be
          suggested to those skilled in the art in the light of the
          above teachings. It is therefor to be understood that changes
          may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention
          described which are within the full intended scope of the
          invention as defined by the appended claims. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A new alternating current process
          and system for treatment of blood and/or other body fluids
          and/or synthetic fluids from a donor to a recipient or storage
          receptacle or in a recycling system using novel electrically
          conductive treatment vessels for treating blood and/or other
          body fluids and/or synthetic fluids with electric field forces
          of appropriate electric field strength to provide electric
          current flow through the blood or other body fluids at a
          magnitude that is biologically compatible but is sufficient to
          render the bacteria, virus, parasites and/or fungus
          ineffective to infect or affect normally healthy cells while
          maintaining the biological usefulness of the blood or other
          fluids. For this purpose low voltage alternating current
          electric potentials are applied to the treatment vessel which
          are of the order of from about 0.2 to 12 volts and produce
          current flow densities in the blood or other fluids of from
          one microampere per square millimeter of electrode area
          exposed to the fluid being treated to about two milliamperes
          per square millimeter. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This invention relates to novel
          electrically conductive methods and systems employing
          electrically conductive vessels provided with electrically
          conductive surfaces for use in subjecting blood and/or other
          body fluids and/or synthetic fluids such as tissue culture
          medium to direct treatment by alternating current electric
          forces. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND PROBLEM</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is now well known in the medical
          profession and the general public that blood collected in a
          blood bank from a large number of donors may be contaminated
          by contaminants such as bacteria, virus, parasites and/or
          fungus obtained from even a single donor. While screening of
          donors has done much to alleviate this problem, the screening
          of donors can and does miss occasional donors whose blood is
          unfit for use. When this occurs and the unfit blood is mixed
          with otherwise usable blood, the entire batch must be
          discarded for transfusion purposes. Because of this problem,
          the present invention has been devised to attenuate any
          bacteria, virus (including the AIDS HIV virus) parasites
          and/or fungus contained in blood contributed by a donor to the
          point that any such contaminant is rendered ineffective for
          infecting a normally healthy human cell, but does not make the
          blood biologically unfit for use in humans. Similar problems
          exist with respect to treatment of other body fluids, such as
          amniotic fluids. The treatment method and system is also
          applicable to mammals other than humans. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to the above, there is
          a need for methods and systems for the treatment of blood and
          other body fluids both in in-situ processing wherein the
          treated blood and/or other body fluids are withdrawn from the
          body, treated and then returned to the body in a closed loop,
          recirculating treatment process that is located near but
          outside the patient's body, or the treatment can be effected
          through implanted treatment system components. </p>

          Other Body Fluids with Electric Forces"-Steven Kaali and Peter
          M. Schwolsky, inventors, filed concurrently and co-pending

        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention provides new
          electrically conductive methods and systems using alternating
          electric current excitation potentials for treating blood
          and/or other body fluids, such as amniotic fluids, and/or
          synthetic fluids such as tissue culture medium from a donor to
          a transfusion recipient or to a storage receptacle, or for
          recirculating a single donor's or patient's blood or other
          body fluids. The treatment can be accomplished in a treatment
          system external of the body or by implant devices for purging
          contaminants using a novel electrically conductive vessel for
          direct electric treatment of blood or other body fluids, such
          as amniotic fluids, with alternating current electric field
          forces of appropriate electric field strength to attenuate
          such contaminants to the extent that bacteria, virus, fungus,
          and/or parasites contained in the blood or other body fluids
          are rendered ineffective to infect and/or affect normally
          healthy human cells. The treatment, however, does not render
          the blood or other body fluids biologically unfit for use in
          humans or other mammals after the treatment. The new methods
          and systems according to the invention achieve these ends
          without requiring time consuming and expensive processing
          procedures and equipment in addition to those normally
          required in the handling of blood or other body fluids or
          synthetic fluids. The invention can be used to achieve the
          electric field force treatment during the normally occurring
          transfer processing from a donor to a recipient or to a
          collection receptacle, or recirculation of a single donor's or
          patient's blood or other body fluids, such as amniotic fluids.

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BEST MODE OF PRACTICING
            INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration
          of one form of a novel blood and other body fluid treatment
          system according to the invention. FIG. 1 shows an
          electrically conductive blood and/or other body fluid
          treatment vessel constructed according to the invention which
          is in the form of intravenous tubing 11 interconnected between
          a hypodermic needle 12 and a blood storage receptacle 14. The
          needle 12 is inserted in an artery or vein of the arm 13 of a
          blood donor and the tubing 11 leads from the arm 13 to the
          receptacle 14. Alternatively, the system could be set up to
          transfer blood from the storage receptacle 14 to the arm of a
          recipient or could be designed to recirculate the blood
          through electrified tubing 11 back to the donor. The
          electrically conductive tubing 11 may be of any desired length
          as indicated by the break at 15 so that it can be
          appropriately set up to lead from a comfortable position for
          the donor from whose arm 13 the blood is being taken to a
          proper storage location for the receptacle 14. The greater the
          length of the electrified portion of tubing 11, then the more
          extended is the exposure of the blood (or other body fluid) to
          the electric field force effects and low level, biologically
          compatible current flow through the body fluid being treated
          thereby assuring adequate electrification treatment of the
          fluid without impairing the biological usefulness of the blood
          or other body fluid being treated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of
          the electrically conductive tubing 11 taken through plane 2--2
          of FIG. 1. The tubing 11 may be from 1 to about 20 millimeters
          in inside diameter, although it may be larger or smaller in
          diameter depending upon the intended application. For example,
          if the blood transfer system is for the purpose shown in FIG.
          6, then the tubing may have a cross sectional dimension of
          about 5 millimeters. However, if the intended use is in an
          implanted blood treatment system, such as shown in FIG. 8,
          then the tubing diameter must be designed to result in a
          flow-through rate corresponding to the natural circulatory
          blood flow rate of the patient in which the system is
          implanted, and must be long enough to assure effective
          electrification treatment at the flow rate selected. The
          tubing 11 is formed from plastic, rubber, medical grade
          polymer, or other suitable material which is compatible with
          human fluids and/or tissue. A plurality of physically
          separated, electrically conductive surface segments form
          opposed, parallel electrodes shown at 16 and 16A on the inside
          of tubing 11 from electrically conductive materials such as
          platinum, platinum alloys, silver, silver or platinum covered
          alloys, or other similar conductive materials such as
          conductive polymers, or silver or platinum covered polymers
          which are compatible with human fluids and tissue. The spacing
          between opposed electrodes 16 and 16A is of the order of 1 to
          19 millimeters and perhaps may be more or less dependent upon
          the application and the conductivity of the body fluids being
          treated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 is a longitudinally
          extending sectional view along the axis of tubing 11 taken
          through staggered section lines 3--3 of FIG. 2. From FIG. 3 of
          the drawings it will be seen that the electrically conductive
          surface segments 16 and 16A all comprise longitudinally
          extending, zebra-like stripe or strip electrodes which extend
          longitudinally in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the
          tubing 11. In between each longitudinally extending conductive
          stripe electrode 16 or 16A is a longitudinally extending
          electric insulating area 17 which electrically isolates the
          alternate electrically conductive, zebra-like stripe
          electrodes 16 and 16A one from the other. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As best shown in FIG. 3, a first
          set of alternate electrically conductive surface stripes 16
          are electrically connected in common to a first annular
          terminal buss 18 which circumferentially surrounds the tubing
          11 and is embedded within the sidewalls of the tubing 11 at a
          suitable point along its length. The design is such that the
          first annular terminal buss 18 is electrically isolated from
          the remaining second set of alternate, electrically conductive
          surface stripe electrodes 16A and is electrically connected
          through a conductor terminal 19 to an alternating current
          source of electric excitation potential. AC source 20 may
          comprise the output from an AC to AC voltage converter for
          converting 110 volt AC potential to the desired 0.2 volts to
          12 volts for use in the invention. For those treatment systems
          which are to be implanted as described hereafter, the AC
          source may comprise a miniaturized DC to AC converter for
          converting the DC voltage from a miniaturized battery to low
          voltage (0.2 to 12 volts) AC. As best depicted in FIG. 2, all
          of the first set of positive electrically conductive stripes
          16 are physically and electrically connected in common to the
          first annular terminal buss 18 so that all of the conductive
          stripes 16 are maintained at a constant, alternating current
          electric excitation potential. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A second annular terminal buss 21,
          which circumferentially surrounds the tubing 11, is embedded
          within the tubing 11 at a point along its length displaced
          from the position of the first annular terminal buss 18 and is
          spaced inwardly towards the inside diameter of the tubing
          relative to the first annular buss 18. By this arrangement it
          is possible to electrically connect the remaining second set
          of alternate electrically conductive surface stripes 16A in
          common to the second annular terminal buss 21 in a manner such
          that the second annular terminal buss is electrically isolated
          from the first annular terminal buss 18 as well as the first
          set of alternate electrically conductive surface stripes 16.
          As shown in FIG. 3, the second annular terminal buss 21 is
          provided with an outside terminal conductor connection 22 for
          connecting the annular buss 21 and annular buss 18 across AC
          source 20 as shown in the system drawing of FIG. 1. The second
          set of alternate electrically conductive surface stripes 16A
          are all provided with internal connector studs which
          physically and electrically connect all of the 16A stripes in
          common to the second annular terminal buss 21 so that all of
          these conductive stripes will be maintained at a potential
          opposite to that from the potential applied to the first set
          of electrically conductive stripes 16 by annular buss 18. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As described earlier, the AC source
          of electric potential 20 may constitute an AC to AC converter
          for converting 110 volt AC to 0.2 to 12 volt AC or a DC to AC
          converter for converting 12 volt DC to 0.2 to 12 volt AC. The
          AC source 20 is connected to the conductor terminals 19 and 22
          through electric supply conductors 23 and 24 preferably by a
          double pole, double throw, on-off control switch 25. In
          preferred embodiments of the invention, voltage controlling
          variable resistors 26 and 27 also are included in the electric
          supply conductors 23 and 24 in order to control the value of
          the excitation voltage developed between the alternate sets of
          conductive surface stripes 16, 16A. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, the donor whose blood
          is to be taken, or the recipient who is to be given blood, or
          is to have his or her blood recycled, is made comfortable on a
          cot with his or her arm 13 extended and the interconnecting
          electrically conductive tubing 11 having the hypodermic needle
          12 for withdrawal, or supplying, or recycling of blood set up
          as shown in FIG. 1. When both the donor/recipient and the
          system is in readiness, the control switch 25 is closed so
          that an electric field is built up across the oppositely
          disposed electrically conductive zebra-like stripes 16, 16A,
          etc. Voltages of the order of from 0.2 to 12 volts are applied
          to the conductive surfaces 16, 16A For this purpose it is
          important to note that the hypodermic needle should be
          electrically isolated via conventional electrically insulating
          IV tubing from any of the zebra stripe electrodes 16, 16A so
          that the donor/recipient does not receive a shock. By this
          precaution, he or she will not even be aware of the existence
          of the electric field within the electrically conductive
          tubing 11. With the treatment system thus conditioned, the
          hypodermic needle is inserted into a vein in the
          donor's/recipient's arm and blood is withdrawn, given, or
          recycled through the tubing 11. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As the blood passes through the
          electric fields produced within the electric conductive tubing
          11 it will be subjected to and treated by biologically
          compatible electric current flow through the blood or other
          body fluid with a current density of from one microampere per
          square millimeter (1 .mu.A/mm.sup.2) of electrode cross
          sectional area exposed to the fluid to about two milliamperes
          per square millimeter (2 mA/mm.sup.2) dependent upon field
          strength of the electric field gradient existing between
          electrodes 16 and 16A, the space between the electrodes 16,
          16A and the conductivity (resistivity) of the body fluid being
          treated. Recent experiments have proven that exposure to
          electric fields induced by supply voltages in the range
          produces electric current flow through blood of the order of 1
          to 100 microamperes. Effectiveness is dependent upon length of
          time of treatment in conjunction with the magnitude of the
          biologically compatible current flow. For example, treatment
          of virus in media at 100 microamperes for 3 minutes has been
          observed to substantially attenuate (render ineffective) the
          AIDS virus. Similar treatment at other field strength values
          and lengths of time will have a similar attenuating effect on
          bacteria, virus, parasites and/or fungus which are present in
          blood or other body fluids being treated. By controlling the
          length of time and field strength values that blood is
          subjected to the electric field forces, undesirable
          contaminants such as virus, bacteria, fungus and/or parasites
          will be adequately attenuated to the point that they are
          rendered ineffective by the sustained action of the electric
          current flow as the blood travels from the hypodermic needle
          12 to the storage bag 14, or vice versa, or in a recycling
          mode. The length of travel of the blood through the sustained
          electric field induced current flow also can be adjusted so
          that the blood is subjected to the electric field force for
          time periods of the order of from one to six minutes at least.
          At the current values noted above this is believed adequate to
          attenuate (render ineffective) bacteria, virus (including the
          AIDS virus), parasites and/or fungus entrained in blood or
          other body fluids, but does not render the fluids unfit for
          human use or impair their biological usefulness. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The species of the invention shown
          in FIGS. 2 and 3 is advantageous since it is possible to
          fabricate the treatment tubing by preforming the conductive
          segments 16 and 16A on the tubing walls while it is in a flat
          planar condition, and then rolling the walls into tubular form
          using a suitable mandrel. The adjoining longitudinal edges of
          the planar member after rolling are thereafter heat sealed
          along a longitudinally extending seam located within one of
          the electrically insulating sections 17. Particular attention
          must be paid to the juncture of the ends of the annular
          terminal busses 18 and 21 during the rolling and heat sealing
          steps to assure that good electrical interconnection and
          continuity at these junctures of the annular terminal busses
          is provided in the completed treatment tubing. The conductive
          electrode segments 16, 16A may be electro-deposited,
          chemically formed, separately formed conductive polymer
          surfaces, or conductive foil or wires adhesively secured to
          the side walls of the tubing 11 in advance of the rolling and
          sealing using techniques well known in the printed circuit and
          integrated circuit manufacturing technologies. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic,
          fragmentary, elevational view of a modified blood treatment
          system using the novel electrically conductive treatment
          tubing in accordance with the invention. In the FIG. 6
          embodiment of the invention, a blood pump 28 of conventional,
          commercially available construction is inserted in the tubing
          11 at some point along its length. The blood pump 28 is
          electrically isolated from the zebra striped conductive
          surfaces 16, 16A by suitable insulators 29 formed on the blood
          input-output connections of pump 28. Provision for
          electrically bypassing the blood pump 28 (if need be) is made
          through the shunt conductors 30, 30A which maintain electrical
          continuity of the alternating current excitation potential
          applied to the conductive stripes 16, 16A on each side of pump
          28. For convenience, the alternating current excitation source
          20 and its connection to the electrically conductive tubing 11
          has not been shown in FIG. 6 but would have to be provided. A
          separate source of excitation current for running the blood
          pump 28 is provided from a conventional 110 volt alternating
          current source through the input terminals 31, 31A. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In systems employing a blood pump,
          it may be desirable in some applications to provide a blood
          flow regulating valve 37 inserted in the system at the output
          of blood pump 28 and within the by-pass loop 30, 30A for the
          conductive stripes 16, 16A. By thus controlling blood flow,
          the electrified transfer system safely can be employed in a
          closed loop recycling system for withdrawing blood from a
          patient, electrically treating the blood as described above
          and then returning the electrically treated blood to the
          patient. This procedure is referred to herein as recycling.
          The system of FIG. 6 also can be used in those situations
          where the blood flow of a donor's blood is not sufficient to
          assure supply of an adequate amount of blood to or from the
          collection receptacle 14 or other recipient. It may also be
          desirable to have a blood flow regulating valve such as 37 in
          non-pump systems. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIGS. 4 and 5 of the drawings show
          another embodiment of the invention wherein the electrically
          conductive treatment tubing 11 includes electrically
          conductive electrode segments 32 and 32A which are in the form
          of zebra stripes that extend radially around the inside
          diameter of tubing 11 in spaced-apart, alternating polarity,
          conductive annular bands 32 and 32A separated by insulating
          surface bands 11I which serve to electrically isolate the
          respective first set of conductive zebra stripes 32 from the
          second set of conductive zebra stripes 32A. The first set of
          alternate ones of the electrically conductive annular stripes
          32 are electrically connected in common to a first
          longitudinally extending terminal buss bar 33 that is embedded
          within tubing 11 in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the
          tubing and electrically isolated from the remaining second set
          of alternate electrically conductive annular stripes 32A. The
          first longitudinally extending terminal buss bar 33 is
          designed for connection to one output terminal of a source,
          such as 20, of alternating current electric excitation
          potential through a supply conductor connection 35 on the
          exterior surface of the tubing 11. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A second longitudinally extending
          terminal buss bar 34 is embedded within the body of tubing 11
          and is electrically connected to the remaining second set of
          alternate electrically conductive annular stripes 32A. The
          second longitudinally extending terminal buss bar 34 is
          electrically isolated from the first longitudinally extending
          terminal buss 33 and the first set of alternate electrically
          annular stripes 32. Terminal buss bar 33 is designed for
          connection to a second output terminal for the alternating
          current source of electric excitation potential. For this
          purpose an input supply conductor connection 36 is directly
          connected through the exterior surface of tubing 11 and to the
          second longitudinally treatment extending terminal buss bar
          34. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, the embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 is physically arranged in a
          blood treatment system in the manner illustrated in FIG. 1 of
          the drawings with the positive polarity and negative polarity
          zebra annular stripes being connected to the respective output
          terminals of AC source 20 via control switch 25. If required,
          a blood pump such as 28 and blood flow regulating valve 37
          shown in FIG. 6 can be included in the blood transfer system
          employing electrified tubing as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Similar to the system shown in FIG.
          1, a blood transfer system employing the embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 would be electrically excited
          in advance of injection of the hypodermic needle 12 into the
          arm of a blood donor so that all blood passing through the
          tubing 11 will be subjected to electric forces produced
          between the alternate polarity annularly formed conductive
          bands 32 and 32A. Experience with the invention will establish
          what length is required for the electrification field.
          However, for initial installations the length of the
          electrified field as related to the flow of blood through
          electrified tubing 11 should correspond to at least the 1-6
          minute treatment time mentioned earlier. This is achieved by
          using an extended array of the alternate annular zebra bands
          32 and 32A of adequate length to assure thorough subjection of
          blood to electric current flow produced between the
          alternating polarity zebra stripes 32 and 32A. The electric
          field force intensity applied to the blood by means of the
          electrified tubing is anticipated to be of the order of from
          0.2 to 12 volts similar to the embodiment of the invention
          shown in FIGS. 1-3. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In place of supplying continuous
          alternating current excitation to the conductive stripes 16,
          16A of FIGS. 2 and 3 or 32, 32A of FIGS. 4 and 5, it also is
          possible to excite these electrically conductive segments of
          tubing 11 with pulsed waveform direct current excitation
          potentials. For use in this manner, the pulse rate of the
          pulsed waveform excitation potentials must be sufficiently
          high to maintain continuous current flow through blood being
          treated. In addition, it may be desirable to couple a bank of
          storage capacitors in parallel across respective pairs of
          opposite polarity electrically conductive segments 16, 16A and
          32, 32A where operation in a pulsed DC mode is desired. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 7 of the drawings is a cross
          sectional view of another embodiment of the invention which is
          substantially different from those previously described. In
          FIG. 7, the material used for fabrication of the tubing 11 is
          one of the new space-age polymer materials which can be either
          highly electrically conductive, insulating, or semiconducting
          and may have values of conductivity ranging from essentially
          fully conductive to insulating. In the embodiment of the
          invention of FIG. 7, the conductive surface areas on the
          inside diameter of the tubing 11 are actually formed into
          segments, such as 11C, of the cross sectional area of the
          tubing 11 fabricated from the highly conductive polymer
          material. The intervening segments of the tubing 11I which
          separate the conductive segments 11C are integrally formed
          from the highly insulating polymer material. Suitable positive
          polarity and negative polarity potentials are applied to the
          exterior surface areas of alternate ones of the sets of
          conductive polymer segments 11C from a source of electric
          potential via the conductors 23 and 24 as illustrated
          schematically in FIG. 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It will be appreciated that the
          embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 7 is much simpler
          and hence less expensive to make in that it requires fewer
          processing steps than the embodiments of the invention shown
          in FIGS. 1-6. In other respects, the embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIG. 7 would be used in a blood transfer
          system similar to that shown in FIG. 1 or 6 with or without a
          blood pump 28 and blood flow regulating valve 37 to effect
          transfer of blood from a donor to a receptacle or recipient in
          the event of a transfusion or recycling. During the blood
          transfer process, again it would be necessary to provide
          alternating current excitation potentials across the
          spaced-apart, alternate sets of electrically conductive
          polymer segments 11C prior to passing blood through the tubing
          11. This will assure that all of the blood being transferred
          is subjected to the electric field forces produced between the
          alternate conductive surfaces 11C. As a variation of the FIG.
          7 embodiment, which visualizes that the segments 11C and 11I
          all extend longitudinally and parallel to the longitudinal
          axis of tubing 11, it would be possible, but more elaborate to
          design, to employ alternate radially surrounding annular
          conductive segments 11C and interlacing insulating segments
          11I similar to FIG. 5, but such fabrication would require
          somewhat more complex terminal buss bar electric supply
          connections 23 and 24 than those shown in FIG. 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 8 is a fragmentary,
          diagrammatic, elevational view showing a form of blood
          treatment system according to the invention wherein a small
          electrically conductive vessel 41 in the form of a short piece
          of electrified tubing and a combined miniaturized DC to AC
          converter and battery power source 42 are implanted in the arm
          of a human being. The electrified tubing 41 may be in the form
          of any of the prior disclosed electrified tubing structures
          described with relation to FIGS. 1-7, but which are fabricated
          in miniaturized form so that the tubing 41 and power package
          42 can be inserted in a section of or surrounding a vein 44 of
          the arm 13 of a patient whose blood is being treated. The
          implantation is such that the blood through the patient's vein
          44 naturally is pumped through the short piece of electrified
          tubing 41 while circulating blood to the hand of the patient
          to thereby form a closed loop, recirculating, implanted
          treatment system that comprises an integral part of the
          circulatory system of the patient being treated. Because the
          parameters of such an implanted system are necessarily small,
          a single passage through the implanted electrified tube 14 may
          accomplish relatively little attenuation of contaminants in
          the blood. Therefore, it is the repeated passage of small
          portions of the patient's blood continuously twenty-four hours
          a day and for as many days as are needed which will gradually
          attenuate the contaminants to the point where they are
          rendered ineffective as described earlier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 9 is a partial, fragmentary,
          sectional view of the upper arm portion 13 of a vein or artery
          of a patient in which a treatment system according to the
          invention has been implanted, and shows in greater detail the
          construction of a specialized, miniaturized, electrically
          conductive treatment vessel with associated miniaturized
          battery electric power source and DC to AC converter for use
          in an implanted treatment system as shown in FIG. 8. In FIG.
          9, the electrified vessel 41 is in the form of an outer
          housing 45 that is in the shape of a football which is
          implanted within the interior walls 44 of an artery or a vein.
          The outer housing 45 is comprised by a central,
          cylindrically-shaped portion 45M of solid conductor such as
          platinum which is biocompatible with human blood and tissue
          and has integrally formed, conically-shaped porous ends 45C
          which are attached to and form an electrically conductive
          screen grid (at the same potential) as the mid portion 45M.
          The conical end portions 45C both are perforated and may be in
          the nature of a screen or mesh wire and of the same material
          composition as the mid portion 45M. Disposed within the outer
          housing 45 is a inner housing 46 which is tear-drop shaped and
          secured within the central portion 45M of the outer housing by
          suitable insulating support spider legs 47. The inner housing
          46 likewise is formed from platinum or other suitable
          biocompatible conductive material and has supported within its
          interior a miniaturized AC source comprising a miniaturized
          battery and AC to DC converter 42 secured to the conductive
          walls of inner housing 46 by conductive support legs 48. The
          support legs 48 serve as terminal connectors from one terminal
          of AC power converter 42 to the inner housing 46 so that it is
          maintained at one polarity excitation potential. The remaining
          opposite polarity terminal of miniaturized AC source 42 is
          connected through an insulated conductor 49 to the central
          portion 45M of outer housing 45 whereby the entire outer
          housing including the meshed conical end portions 45C are
          maintained at an opposite polarity potential from the inner
          housing 46. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Prior to implantation in a patient,
          the electrified vessel shown in FIG. 9 is activated by
          connection to AC source 42 so that an electric field gradient
          is produced across the space between the inner and outer
          housings 45 and 46. Following implantation of the activated,
          electrified treatment vessel 41, its presence in a vein or
          artery will cause all blood flowing through the vein or artery
          to pass between the side walls of the inner and outer housings
          45 and 46 so as to be subjected to the electric field force
          gradient existing in these spaces. The presence of the
          electric field forces will induce a current flow through the
          blood passing between the interior and outer housings as
          explained above which will result in attenuating bacteria,
          virus, parasites and/or fungus which are present in the blood
          as contaminants. Here again, because of the relatively small
          portion of the total blood flowing in a patient that will be
          treated by the device within a given time period, it is the
          repeated, recycling process treatment of the blood over a
          prolonged period of time that will result in attenuation of
          the contaminants in the blood to the point where such
          contaminants are rendered ineffective as described earlier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In order to further assure adequate
          treatment of the blood of a patient receiving the implant
          device, it is recommended that the blood be treated in an
          external treatment processing facility such as described
          earlier in FIGS. 1 and 6 or to be described hereinafter with
          relation to FIGS. 18 and 19 in which the total capacity of the
          treatment system is greater whereby substantial attenuation
          effect can be achieved in a comparatively shorter time period
          yet to be determined, and then the in vitro implant treatment
          system such as shown in FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 can be used to
          maintain the attenuated condition and to prevent any
          subsequent build up of contaminants after the initial
          treatment, if determined to be desirable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 10 is a fragmentary,
          diagrammatic view of a partial vein or artery 44 showing in
          greater detail the cylindrical or tubular electrified
          treatment vessel 41 originally described with relation to FIG.
          8. This implant treatment vessel 41 is miniaturized so that it
          is in effect an open-ended cylinder in shape and has a
          diameter comparable to that of a large vein or artery and so
          that it can be grafted or implanted into the vein or artery as
          illustrated in FIG. 10. The tubular treatment vessel 41 may be
          designed pursuant to FIGS. 2 and 3 of the drawings, for
          example. For this application, the battery source of power and
          interconnected DC to AC converter 42 are annular in shape and
          are slipped over the tubular treatment vessel 41 in the manner
          shown. In FIG. 10 a longitudinal sectional view of the hollow
          annular-shaped treatment vessel 41 and AC power source 42 is
          illustrated. At the point where the battery driven AC power
          source 42 fits over the tubular treatment vessel 41, the
          respective terminals of the AC power source 42 are exposed to
          engage the corresponding positive and negative supply
          terminals 19 and 22 of the tube 41 so that the resulting
          structure has a minimum exterior profile to facilitate
          implantation. From a comparison of FIG. 10 to FIG. 9 of the
          drawings, it will be appreciated that the FIG. 9 treatment
          vessel introduces some flow restriction in the vein or artery
          in which it is implanted and for this reason the construction
          shown in FIG. 10 is preferred. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIGS. 11 and 11A of the drawings
          illustrate a construction for the electrified treatment vessel
          51 wherein the treatment vessel is in the form of square or
          rectangular cross sectionally-shaped open-ended tubing. The
          treatment tubing 51 provided with a square or rectangular
          shape so that provision of opposed, parallel conductive
          electrode surfaces 51U and 51L is greatly simplified as best
          seen in FIG. 11A of the drawings, which is a cross sectional
          view taken through plane 11A--11A of FIG. 11. By fabricating
          the upper and lower surfaces of the tubing 11 from
          electrically conductive material such as platinum, etc., and
          separating the upper and lower surfaces 51U and 51L by
          electrically insulating side walls 52R and 52L, provision of
          the electrically isolated, opposed, parallel electrode
          surfaces is simplified and the resulting treatment vessel
          introduces minimum restriction to flow of blood. By connecting
          the upper surface 51U to one terminal of the AC power source
          42 and connecting the lower surface 51L to the opposite
          terminal, AC electrification of the interior area of the
          tubing wherein the fluids to be treated flow is readily
          achieved with a greatly simplified electrode structure.
          Variations of this structural feature wherein the side
          insulating surfaces 52R and 52L are curved with their concave
          surfaces facing each other and the cross sectional area of the
          upper and lower conductive surfaces 51U and 51L tailored to
          provide a desired current density, tubular treatment vessels
          such as shown in FIGS. 11 and 11A could be readily provided
          for use in implantation devices such as that illustrated in
          FIG. 8. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 12 is a perspective view of a
          novel, electrified, closed, octagonally-shaped, flat, box-like
          treatment vessel 60 according to the invention which provides
          an enlarged cross-sectional area relative to the cross
          sectional diameter of the inlet and outlet tubing supplying
          the interior of the treatment vessel whereby increased
          through-put of a fluid being treated can be achieved in a
          given time period. The treatment vessel 60 shown in FIG. 12 is
          comprised essentially of upper and lower, octagonally-shaped,
          flat insulating plates 61 and 62, respectively, of an
          insulating material which is compatible with human blood
          and/or other body fluids. Disposed immediately below and above
          the upper and lower plates 61 and 62 are octagonally-shaped,
          conductive electrode members 63 and 64, respectively, which
          are separated and electrically isolated one from the other by
          a surrounding electric insulating gasket member 65. The entire
          structure is sandwiched together and held in assembled
          relation by threaded thru-pins 66 as best seen in FIG. 12A of
          the drawings. The insulating gasket 65 which may be of teflon
          defines an open space 67 between the two conductive electrode
          members 63 and 64 into which the blood or other body fluid to
          be treated is introduced via inlet and outlet conduits 68 and
          69. Alternating current electric potentials are applied across
          the respective conductive plates 63 and 64 to produce an
          electric field force across the intermediate space 67 through
          which the fluids being treated flow between electrode plates
          63 and 64. By thus structuring the treatment vessel, increased
          treatment surface area is provided to the blood or other body
          fluid flowing through the space 67 whereby in a given time
          period an increased quantity of fluids can be treated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 13 is a perspective view of
          another form of enlarged cross sectional area treatment vessel
          70 having an exterior shape similar to that of the treatment
          vessel shown in FIG. 12. The electrified treatment vessel
          shown in FIG. 13 differs from that in FIG. 12, however, in the
          construction of its electrically conductive electrodes which
          comprise a plurality of interleaved, conductive, flat,
          electrode plates 71 and 71A. The electrode plates 71 are
          secured in and project inwardly from a right hand (RH)
          conductive end plate 73R as shown in FIG. 13A. The alternate
          set of flat electrode plates 71A are secured to and project
          inwardly from a corresponding conductive end plate 73L on the
          left hand end of the treatment vessel 70. The conductive end
          plates 73R and 73L and coacting insulating side plates 72
          which insulate the conducting end plates from one another,
          form an octagonally-shaped box frame which is closed by upper
          and lower insulating top and bottom insulating plates 74 and
          75. The conductive end plates 73R and 73L have a central
          opening formed therein into which inlet and outlet tubes 76
          and 77 are secured as best seen in FIG. 13 for providing inlet
          and outlet flow through connection to the treatment vessel 70.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The alternate sets of flat
          electrode plates 71 and 71A extend parallel to one another and
          are provided with alternating current electric potentials
          supplied across the respective sets of interleaved electrode
          plates via the respective conductive end members 73R and 73L.
          If desired, the respective flat conductive electrode plates 71
          and 71A may be fabricated from a perforated material as shown
          in FIG. 13B of the drawings. Also, it may be desirable that
          some form of thermal insulation, or a thermally controlled
          chamber be provided around the exterior of the treatment
          vessel 70 as indicated by the thermal insulation 78 shown in
          FIG. 13A. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, electrified treatment
          vessel 70 shown in FIGS. 13, 13A and 13B functions in
          essentially the same manner as was described earlier with
          respect to FIGS. 1-7 to effect attenuation of contaminants
          such as bacteria, virus and fungus contained in blood and/or
          other body fluids being treated in the flow through treatment
          vessel of FIG. 13. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 14 is a longitudinal sectional
          view of still another form of enlarged cross sectional area,
          electrified treatment vessel 80. The treatment vessel 80 shown
          in FIG. 14 is in the form of an open-ended, elongated cylinder
          81 whose cylindrical walls are fabricated from an insulating
          material which is biocompatible with human blood and/or other
          body fluids and whose open ends are closed by circular-shaped
          conductive end pieces 82 and 83. Inlet and outlet tubular
          openings 84 and 85 are provided to the interior of cylindrical
          housing 81 through centrally formed apertures in the circular
          end plates 82 and 83. Within the interior of the cylindrical,
          insulating housing 81 at least two, separate, concentric,
          perforated, cylindrically-shaped electrode members 86 and 87
          are provided which extend longitudinally through the interior
          of the outer cylindrical housing 81. The first set of
          concentric, perforated, electrically conductive electrodes 86
          is embedded in and supported by the conductive end plate 82
          which serves as an electrical terminal for applying electric
          potentials to all of the concentric electrode member 86.
          Similarly, the concentric, perforated, conductive electrode
          member 87 is physically supported by and electrically
          connected to the conductive end plate 83 for the supply of
          alternating current potentials thereacross. Additionally, if
          desired, one or more additional perforated concentric
          electrode members similar to 86 may be spaced apart from the
          inner concentric electrode member 86 outwardly along the
          diameter of the circular end member 82 with additional
          perforated concentric electrode members 87 being sandwiched
          between the two electrode members 86 and spaced apart
          therefrom so as to provide an electric field force between all
          the spaced apart, separated electrically conductive electrode
          members 86 and 87. Additionally, if desired, a conductive
          surface 89 may be formed around the interior walls of the
          outer, insulating cylindrical housing member 81 and
          electrically connected to the conductive end plate 82 or 83.
          This will assure that the entire interior of the treatment 80
          vessel cross sectional area is crossed by the electric field
          force and all blood or other body fluid passing the
          cylindrical housing member 81 is subjected to biologically
          compatible low electric current flow as a consequence of the
          alternating current electric fields produced between the
          different concentric electrode members including the coated
          surface 89 within the interior insulating housing member 81. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation, the embodiment of the
          invention shown in FIG. 14 and 14A operates in substantially
          the same manner as described with relation to earlier
          embodiments of the invention to assure production of
          biologically compatible electric current flow through the
          blood or other body fluid being treated in the treatment
          vessel 80. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 15 is a longitudinal sectional
          view of still another embodiment of an enlarged
          cross-sectional area treatment vessel 90. The treatment vessel
          90 again comprises an outer, hollow, open-ended
          cylindrically-shaped, insulating body member 91 whose open
          ends are closed by electrically conductive, circular end
          plates 92 and 93, respectively. Inlet and outlet tubular
          openings 94 and 95 are provided through the central axial
          opening in the conductive end plates 92 and 93 for passage of
          blood and/or other body fluids being treated into the interior
          of the treatment vessel 90. The conductive end plates 92 and
          93 have respective sets of opposite polarity potential
          needle-like electrodes 96 and 97, respectively, projecting
          therefrom inwardly into the interior of the treatment vessel
          90. Alternating current electric potentials are applied to the
          respective conductive end plates 92 and 93 through respective
          AC supply terminals indicated at 98 and 99. If desired, and in
          order to assure complete saturation of the entire volumetric
          area within treatment vessel 90 with electric fields, a
          conductive coating similar to that shown at 89 in FIG. 14 can
          be provided to the inner surface of the hollow,
          cylindrically-shaped outer body member 91 of treatment vessel
          90. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 15A is a cross sectional view
          taken through plane A-A of FIG. 15 and shows how the array of
          needle-like electrodes appear within the interior of the
          treatment vessel 90. In operation, the treatment vessel 90
          will function in substantially the same manner as has been
          described previously with relation to earlier described
          embodiments of the invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 16 is a perspective view of
          still another form of enlarged cross sectional area treatment
          vessel 100 according to the invention and FIG. 16A is a
          partial cross sectional view taken through plane 16A--16A of
          FIG. 16. The treatment vessel 100 comprises a relatively large
          rectangular-shaped block 101 of electrical insulating material
          which is biocompatible with blood and/or other human body
          fluids. The insulating block 101 has a plurality of parallel,
          longitudinally extending, open-ended, tubular-shaped openings
          102 formed therein through the entire length of the block. The
          tubes 102 are provided with electrically isolated, opposed,
          parallel extending conductive plate electrodes 109 as best
          shown in FIG. 16A, which have alternating current electric
          potentials applied thereacross. One set of these electrodes,
          formed for example by the lower electrode 109 in each tube,
          extend out to and engage a conductive surface coating formed
          on one end of the insulating block, for example 101R, and the
          remaining upper electrodes 109 form a second set which extend
          out of the left hand end of the tubes and contact a conductive
          coating formed on the remaining end 101L of block 101.
          Alternating current electric potentials are connected across
          the respective conductive surfaces 101R and 101L so that a
          potential difference exists between the sets of electrodes 109
          within each longitudinally extending tube in block 101. The
          ends of the tubes 102 open into and are supplied from, or
          supply, respective header reservoirs 103 and 104 formed on the
          respective opposite ends of the block of insulating material
          101. Each of the reservoirs 103 and 104 has a centrally formed
          opening for receiving either an inlet tube 105 applied to
          header 103 or an outlet tube 106 secured to header 104 for
          supply of blood or other body fluids to be treated to and from
          the treatment vessel 100. If desired, a blood pump or other
          fluid pump can be inserted between the supply tube 105 and
          header 103, or between outlet tube 106 and the or outlet from
          the header reservoir 104, or both. Alternatively, both inlet
          and outlet pumps can be used. In operation, the electrified
          treatment vessel 100 shown in FIG. 16 functions in the same
          manner as those species of treatment vessels described
          previously. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For some treatment applications, it
          may be desirable to provide exhaust vents such as shown at 107
          and 108 in FIG. 16 to the inlet reservoir 103 and/or the
          outlet reservoir 104 with the vents that can be selectively
          operated by valves that can be automatically or manually
          controlled for venting off gases that might be trapped in the
          tops of reservoirs and which otherwise might interfere with
          the proper operation of the electrified treatment vessel. In a
          similar manner, suitable venting apparatus may be provided to
          other of the large cross sectional area electrified treatment
          vessels described previously. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 17 is a perspective view of
          still another enlarged cross-sectional area treatment vessel
          110 which is similar in all respects to the treatment vessel
          shown in FIG. 16 with the exception that the body or block of
          insulating material 101 through which the elongate tubular
          openings are made, is cylindrically shaped as illustrated in
          FIG. 17. In other respects, the embodiment of the invention
          shown in FIG. 17 would be identical to FIG. 16 in the
          fabrication and operation of its component parts including the
          reservoir headers 103 and 104 and would operate in a similar
          manner. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 18 is a diagrammatic, sketch
          of a human blood or other body fluid treatment system
          employing one of the larger cross-sectional dimension fluid
          treatment vessels 60, such as any one of those shown in FIGS.
          12-17 of the drawings. The particular fluid treatment system
          shown in FIG. 18 is for a continuous flow-through
          recirculating body fluid treatment wherein blood is withdrawn
          from the arm 13 of a patient and supplied through IV tubing
          111 to a commercially available blood pump 28 and thence to an
          electrified treatment vessel 60. The treatment vessel 60 may
          be like any of the treatment vessels described with relation
          to FIGS. 12-17 of the drawings wherein the blood or other body
          fluid being treated is exposed to a low voltage, low current
          electric current flow for attenuating to the point of
          rendering them ineffective, any contaminants entrained in the
          blood, such as bacteria, virus and fungus. The treated blood
          appearing at the output of the treatment vessel 60 then is
          recirculated back through IV tubing 112 to the arm 13 of the
          patient whose blood or other body fluid is being treated. If
          desired, IV tubing 111 and 112 could also be treatment tubing
          such as described in FIGS. 1-7 and 11. This could provide
          double treatment for the fluid if that were desirable. In the
          event that the entire treatment does not take place in an air
          conditioned, temperature controlled room, then it may be
          desirable to provide a temperature controlled enclosure
          indicated by dotted lines 78 around at least the pump 28,
          electrified treatment vessel 60 and the interconnecting IV
          tubing sections 111 and 112 in order to assure maintaining a
          substantially constant viscosity of the blood or body fluid
          being treated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Normally, the system of FIG. 18
          would be used in a continuous flow-through recirculating
          treatment system wherein blood from the patient's arm 13 is
          supplied through pump 28 to the treatment vessel 60 where it
          is treated and then discharged back through tubing section 112
          to the arm of the patient. The flow rate of the blood thus
          processed would be adjusted to correspond substantially to the
          natural flow rate of blood circulated through the patient's
          body to the extent possible. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to operation in the
          above manner, it would also be possible to operate the system
          of FIG. 18 in a stopped-flow, batch treatment manner wherein
          the blood pump is intermittently stopped to allow for more
          extended electrical treatment of the blood or other body fluid
          contained in the treatment vessel 60 during the period of time
          (referred to as the dwell time) that the blood pump is stopped
          thereby assuring fuller electrification treatment and the
          greater attenuation of the bacteria, virus, parasites and/or
          fungus entrained in the blood. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 19 is a diagrammatic sketch of
          a form of closed loop, flow-through recirculating treatment
          system according to the invention that is somewhat similar to
          the system shown in FIG. 18. FIG. 19 differs from FIG. 18 in
          that an inlet pump 28 and an outlet pump 28' are connected to,
          respectively, the intake to and outlet from the electrified
          treatment vessel 60. If desired, an inlet control valve 113
          and an outlet control valve 114 also can be interconnected
          between the inlet pump 28 and the intake to the treatment
          vessel 60 and between the output from the treatment vessel 60
          and the intake to the outlet blood pump 28'. These inlet and
          outlet control valves indicated at 113 and 114 preferably are
          automatically operated in a time sequence which allows the
          system of FIG. 19 to be operated as a two pump, start-stop
          flow through system. When operated in this manner, the first
          pump 28 is allowed to operate and discharge blood from the arm
          13 of the patient to be pumped into the treatment vessel 60
          and thereafter is closed off with both the inlet and outlet
          valves 113 and 114 in their closed condition. At this point
          electrification treatment of the blood or other body fluid
          takes place for a predetermined, scheduled time period to
          assure adequate attenuation to the point of rendering
          ineffective the contaminant bacteria, virus, parasites or
          fungus. Upon completion of the pre-scheduled treatment period,
          the outlet valve 114 is opened and outlet pump 28' actuated to
          return the treated blood to the arm of the patient 13.
          Operation in this semi-continuous, start-stop, batch fashion
          will assure that adequate electrified treatment of the blood
          has been accomplished while achieving this end in a somewhat
          continuous manner suitable for use in a closed loop, recycling
          blood treatment process. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>PRACTICAL USES OF INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While the disclosure herein
          presented has been directed to principally the electrical
          treatment of blood, it is believed obvious to those skilled in
          the art that the invention can be applied with corresponding
          effect to other body fluids which are electrically conductive
          for the treatment of contaminants such as bacteria, virus,
          parasites and/or fungus contained therein. Further, while
          voltages of the order of from about 0.2 volts to 12 volts AC
          have been indicated as preferable, it is possible that certain
          virus may be attenuated (or attenuated at a faster rate) if
          they are subjected to greater electric current magnitudes of
          the order of 500 microamperes for shorter time periods.
          Acceptable current magnitudes normally would require an
          excitation voltage of from 0.2 to 12 volts. However, in
          certain cases where faster or more complete attenuation of the
          contaminants in body fluids may be desired under certain
          circumstances and conditions, the excitation voltage supplied
          to the conductive tubing may in fact exceed the 0.2 to 12 volt
          range indicated for most treatments. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although it is uncertain what is
          specifically causing the attenuation of the contaminants
          (virus, bacteria, parasites and/or fungus), some possible
          explanations have been put forward. One is that the
          attenuation is caused simply by the direct affect of the
          electric current and voltage. Another entails the following.
          When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, a small current
          will flow through the electrically conductive medium. The
          applied voltage and ensuing current will induce changes in the
          complex biologically active fluid. Current can flow through
          the media if positive and/or negative charges are transported
          through said media. The transport might induce changes in the
          charge distribution of the biologically active molecules thus
          changing their biological activity. Furthermore, the voltage
          and current can induce the production or elimination of
          different ions, radicals, gases and/or PH levels which may
          affect, alone or in combination, the biologically active
          molecules and/or cells. The above products of the electrical
          processes may either be very short lived and stay in the close
          proximity of the electrodes or can diffuse or mix in the bulk
          of the media and react with the biologically active molecules
          or cells to result in their attenuation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Having described several
          embodiments of new and improved electrically conductive
          treatment methods and vessels for use in practicing the novel
          method for the treatment of blood and/or other body fluids
          with electric field forces and treatment systems employing the
          same, it is believed obvious that other modifications and
          variations of the invention will be suggested to those skilled
          in the art in the light of the above teachings. It is
          therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the
          particular embodiments of the invention described which are
          within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by
          the appended claims. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In this report, we present the
          results of double-blinded studies on the use of direct
          electric current to alter the infectivity o HIV-1 for
          susceptible cells in vitro. Two lymphoblastoid cell lines (H9
          and CEM-SS) were exposed to aliquots of the RT strain of HIV-1
          treated with direct current. Results of these studies show
          that virus treated with currents from 50 to 100 microamperes
          (A) has a significantly reduced infectivity for susceptible
          cells. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">These experimental currents were
          equal to 3.85 and 7.7./mm2 current densities respectively.
          The reduction of infectivity was dependent upon, the total
          electric charge (A x min) passing through the chamber to
          which the virus was exposed. Viral infectivity was determined
          by two independent measures: a syncytium-formation assay which
          can be used to quantify the production of infectious
          particles; and. a reverse transcriptase assay which is an
          index of viral protein production. Additional experiments
          demonstrated that the currents employed were biocompatible.
          Uninfected H9 cells were exposed to the same conditions used
          for the viral aliquots. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There was no significant change in
          the percentage of viable uninfected cells exposed to any of
          the currents tested. Therefore, because biocompatible direct
          electric current attenuates the infectivity of cell-free
          virus, this treatment may allow development of new strategies
          to prevent transmission of HIV-1 through either treating the
          general blood supply or developing alternative barrier
          contraceptive devices. Additionally, biocompatible electric.
          current may be applicable for the direct treatment of AIDS
          patients by utilizing either extracorporeal systems or self
          contained indwelling electrodes. Lastly, because the virus is
          being attenuated, electric current may also render treated
          HIV-1 suitable for vaccine development. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The number of individuals infected
          by the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (I-(HIV-1)
          continues to increase on a world-wide basis (1). A significant
          percentage, if not all, of these individuals will eventually
          develop the acquire d immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2)-
          While horizontal transmission in the homosexual. population
          may be contained or decreasing (3), heterosexual transmission
          and infection through contaminated blood supplies continues to
          increase (4). Additionally ver tical transmission from
          infected females to their fetuses is also on the rise with a
          resultant increase in the number of children with AIDS (5).
          New strategies, therefore, must be devised in order to limit
          more effectively the spread of this virus. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In this regard, three principal
          approaches are currently being investigated. In order to
          decrease susceptibility to the consequences of infection,
          vaccines are being sought which will induce the production of
          protective antibodies (6). As treatment modalities, the use of
          soluble antagonists to block the receptor for HIV-1 is being
          studied (7) as are pharmacologic agents such as nucleic acid
          analogs which can interfere with the transcription of viral
          genomic sequences (8). Each of these systems has------------
          and limitations and to date none has proven completely
          effective. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Because heat or light in
          combination with drugs and dyes can inactivate viruses
          including HIV-2 in vitro (9), others have suggested the use of
          these forms of energy to treat .. AIDS patients. The results
          of studies using heat have not been peer- reviewed and are
          therefore impossible to evaluate. The use of light with drugs
          ["photopheresis"] (10) appears to be efficacious although this
          treatment may be limited by drug toxicity and the potential
          long-term effects of ultraviolet radiation on blood c ell
          nucleic acids. Also, by its nature, this last system may not
          be suitable for the treatment of tissue-associated virus. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As result of our interest in the
          use of electric current to alter biological systems , we
          focused our investigations on the ability of direct electrical
          current at biocompatible levels to alter the infectivity of
          HTV-1 for susceptible CD4 positive cell s in vitro. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Electrical treatment of HIV 1:</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The RF strain of HIV-I (AIDS
          Reagent Program) was cryopreserved prior to treatment at
          -70C. Fur treatment, a sample of virus was thawed and
          maintained on ice at 4C . Ten microliters (l) of HIV-1 at a
          concentration of 105 infectious particles per ml were placed
          into a chamber which included a pair of platinum electrodes
          1mm apart permanently mounted into a well 1.56mm in length an
          d 8.32mm in depth equal to 12.9 l volume capacity. The
          chamber was connected to a power supply capable of creating
          constant direct current. The viral aliquots were exposed to
          direct currents ranging from 0 microamperes ( A) for up to 12
          minutes to 100A for up to 6 minutes. Intermediate currents of
          25, 50 and 75A were used to expose similar viral aliquots.
          Under these conditions, for example, 0, 50 and 100A represent
          0, 3.85 and 7 .7A/mm2 current densities respectively. The
          current was monitored throughout the experiment. A matrix of
          current and time employed is shown in Table 1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After the exposure of virus to
          electric current, the contents of the chamber were removed and
          placed into sterile microtubes. Five l of each sample were
          removed and diluted with 95l tissue culture medium
          supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for subsequent
          assays. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Syncytium-formation assays:</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This assay was performed as
          previously described by Nara et al (11). Briefly, 105 CEM-SS
          cells were dispensed into poly-L-lysine coated microliter
          wells. Thereafter, tenfold dilutions o f H9 cells incubated
          with the treated HIV-1 samples were co-cultured in triplicate
          for up to 4 days with the CEM-SS cells. Identical wells were
          prepared with control uninfected and infected cells. The wells
          were examined for syncytium formation at 2 and 3 days and
          quantified using an inverted microscope. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Reverse trascriptase assay:</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Uninfected H9 cells, were pelleted
          at 1,000 rpm for minutes at room temperature, the supernatant
          was decanted and the cells were resuspended in 100l treated
          viral sample. The cells were incubated for up to 6 hours with
          the viral samples. At the end of the incubation time, the
          viral/cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1,000 RPM for 5
          minutes and the supernatant decanted. The cell pellet was then
          resuspended in 5ml of RPMI, 10% FCS and placed into a T25
          tissue culture flask and maintained at 370C, 5% CO2 in a
          humidified chamber. At 2 day intervals (beginning at day 2},
          1ml of the cell suspensions was removed from each sample and
          centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes in order to pellet the
          cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 14,000
          RPM for I5 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in suspension
          buffer and assayed using standard methodology employing Mg+ +
          as the divalent cation poly (rA) oligo d(T) 12-18 as template
          primer, and tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) which comprise the
          reaction mixture. Known HIV positive and negative control
          samples were included in each assay for reference. Thirty l
          of the reacti on mixture were added to each 10 l viral sample
          and incubated at 37 0C for 60 min. Samples were then incubated
          with 1ml of cold quench solution on ice for 15 minutes and
          filtered through a Millipore manifold. Chimneys were rinsed
          first with wash solution and followed by cold 95% ethanol. The
          filters were dried by vacuum and counted in scintillation
          fluid. Reverse transcriptase activity is expressed as counts
          per minute (cpm) and is considered positive only if cpm are at
          least five times greater than the cpm obtained with HIV
          negative control samples. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Biocompatibility of electric
            currents/time:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To determine if the electric
          currents used were in a biocompatibility range of energy,
          uninfected H9 cells were exposed to distinct currents for
          different amounts of time. The H9 cells were washed two times
          in Hanks Balance Salt Solution (HBSS). Thereafter, the cells
          were resuspended in RPMI, 10% FCS at a concentration of 106
          cells per ml, Ten l of the cell samples were placed into the
          reaction c hamber. The cell samples were then exposed to 0, 50
          or 100A for 0, 3 or 6 minutes. At the end of each test, the
          cell sample was removed from the chamber and approximately
          10l of the sample was mixed with 90l of trypan blue. The
          number of viable cells w as determined by trypan blue
          exclusion using a hemocytometer and tight microscope. Results
          are expressed as percentage of viable cells from the total of
          all cells. At least 200 cells per field were counted. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Statistical analysis:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Results of the syncytium-formation
          and reverse transcriptase assays were tested for statistical
          significance by the Student's t test and analyses of variance.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>RESULTS</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Syncytium-formation assay:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Using this index of HIV-1
          infectivity, it was determined that exposing virus to direct
          electric current suppressed its capacity to induce the
          formation of syncytia. Figure 1 shows a representative e
          xperiment and Table 2 shows the Croup data for 3 separate
          experiments. As can be noted in Figure l, a statistically
          significant (p&lt;0.001) reduction in sycytium number was
          observed and this reduction was dependent upon the current
          applied to the viral i solate. At three different viral
          dilutions, there were analogous results in that a total charge
          of 200A x min (25A for 8 minutes) reduced the number of
          syncytia from 50 to 65% while a charge of 300A x min (50A
          for 6 minute s, 75A for 4 minutes or 100A for 3 minutes)
          resulted in 90% reduction. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Reverse transcriptase assays:</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The direct electric currents to
          which HIV-1 was exposed also reduced reverse transcriptase
          activity. Five separate experiments were conducted and a
          representative experiment is shown in Figure 2 and the ;coup
          data are included in Table 3. As can be seen in Figure 2,
          there was a significant decrease in the amount of reverse
          transcriptase activity after exposure of the virus to either
          50A for 3 or 6 minutes. An equivalent reduction in reverse
          transcriptase activity was also noted with exposure to, 100A
          for 3 minutes and almost ablation of reverse transcriptase
          activity was seen with exposure of the viral isolate to 100A
          for 6 minutes. The group data (Table 3} show that after
          exposure to 50A for 6 minutes, there was a 44% reduction in
          activity and treatment of virus with 100A for 6 minutes
          resulted in a 94% reduction. An analysis of variance indicates
          that t he decrease in reverse transcriptase activity was
          statistically significant (p &lt;0.0001). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Biocompatibility of the electric
            currents/time:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The results of a viability analysis
          using trypan blue exclusion criteria applied to uninfected
          cells exposed to the different currents and times used far
          these studies are shown in Table 4. The viability of H9 cells,
          after exposure to 100A fur either 3 or b minutes, did not
          show a significant decrease when compared to the 0 Current
          control. After maximum treatment at 100A for 6 minutes, cell
          viability was 93%. Interestingly, in other preliminary
          experiments in which HIV-infected H9 cells were used, the
          results show that at 100 A there may have been a significant
          decrease in the number of viable cells. That is, while an
          insta ntaneous pulse of 100 A did not affect the viability of
          infected cells, at 3 and 6 minutes of exposure to 100 A, a
          decrease in viability was noted. This decrease was time
          dependent in that exposure to 100 A far 3 min utes resulted
          in a viability of 83% while 100 A for 6 minutes resulted in a
          viability of 80%. Although these data are provocative, they
          only represent a preliminary experiment and require further
          investigation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With respect to the possibility
          that the electric current was transduced into heat, the
          calculated rise in temperature within the chamber was
          determined to be less than 1C. In order to verify this, a
          temperature microprobe was introduced into the cham ber
          containing tissue culture medium alone. Results of these
          studies are shown in Table S. Similar results were obtained
          when H9 cell-containing medium was placed in the reaction
          chamber. The data indicate that for the currents and times
          used for these ex periments, there was no alteration in the
          temperature of the chamber. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The results reported here
          demonstrate that HIV-1 treated with direct electric currents
          from 50 to 100A has a significantly reduced infectivity for
          susceptible cells in vitro. This reduction o f infectivity
          correlates with the total electric change passing through the
          chamber. Although extrapolation of these data predicts that
          ablation of HIV infectivity may be possible, and additional
          preliminary data support this prediction, the expectation t
          hat some virions may still escape the electrical effect cannot
          be discounted. Nevertheless, the .therapeutic potential of
          electric current may reside in its ability to lower the viral
          titer to subclinical significance or in its incorporation into
          a strate gy analogous to that of other therapies in which
          repeated cycles of treatment eventually achieve remission or
          cure. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The data presented in this report
          are based on both quantitative and quantal determinations of
          viral infectivity. Although the syncytium-formation assay can
          be used to quantify the number of infectious viral particles,
          this use with respect to HI V-1 may be abridged because of the
          ability of free fusigenic peptide (gp41) to induce syncytia by
          itself. Therefore, while syncytia were observed at some
          dilutions of electrically-treated virus, this may simply
          represent the presence of soluble gp41 in th e tissue culture
          medium. We believe that the correlation between total charge
          and reduction in syncytium number more adequately reflects the
          ability of direct electric current to reduce HIV-1
          infectivity. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This belief is also supported by
          the results of the reverse transcriptase assays. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although a decrease in HIV-1
          reverse transcriptase does not assure reduced infectiousness
          of this virus for Susceptible cells; we feel that, taken
          together with the syncytium-formation data, the results
          indicate that significant attenua tion of HIV-I infectivity is
          achieved by treatment with direct electric currents. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With respect to the
          biocompatibility of the electric currents and total charges
          reported here, two separate sets of evidence are applicable.
          The first has to do with the results showing that, by trypan
          blue exclusion, no significant cyt otoxicity was induced in by
          any total charge tested. The other evidence is obtained from
          reports which clearly indicates that the amount of electricity
          used for these experiments is significantly below presently
          used therapeutic electric currents which ar e in the
          milliampere range (12-16). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Rather than negative effects,
          exposure of cells to electric current may actually have
          positive consequences for resistance to infection in that
          important cellular electrochemical changes correlate with
          enhancement of specific enzymatic activities. In particular, a
          facilitation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and ATPase
          activity has been observed (12,15). Both of these enzymes are
          associated with the oxidative capacity of the cell.
          Specifically, it has been suggested that an elec trochemical
          reaction occurs between mitochondrial membrane-bound H+ ATPase
          and ADP leading to the formation of ATP. Therefore, exposure
          of cells to direct electric current may directly or indirectly
          increase energy resources within a cell and facil itate cell
          metabolism. This, in turn, may actualIy render a cell less
          susceptible to the effects of viral infection. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In summary, the data presented here
          indicate that biocompatible direct electric current
          significantly reduces the infectivity of HIV-1. Continuing
          investigations are exploring the mechanisms through which this
          effect is mediated. The in itial focus of these experiments is
          centered on the potential role which ionic and molecular
          species generated by electrolysis may have on the virus.
          However, the complete mechanism by which direct electric
          current attenuates HIV-1 infectivity is undoubte dly far re
          complex than simple electrolysis. Nonetheless. and independent
          of a complete understanding of all of the mechanisms involved
          in the attenuation of HIV-1 infectivity, the present
          observations may serve as an initiaI step for the development
          of new strategies to treat infection or prevent transmission
          of HIV-1 through either treat ing the general blood supply or
          developing alternative barrier contraceptive devices. It may
          also be feasible to treat AIDS patients with direct electric
          current using either extracorporeal systems or self contained
          indwelling electrodes. Lastly, because viral infectivity is
          being attenuated, electric current may render treated HIV-1
          suitable for vaccine development. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Overview:</b> A non-flow vessel
          or cell included a pair of platinum electrodes 1 mm apart
          inserted into a well 1.56 mm in length and 8.32 mm in depth.
          The non-flow vessel was connected to a direct current source
          capable of creating an electric field at a constant voltage
          and constant amperage. Into this well was laced a suspension
          of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) at a
          concentration of 1,000,000 infectious particles per ml. An
          aliquot of approximately 10 ul of the virus suspension was
          placed into the well. Thereafter, the viral suspension was
          exposed to direct currents ranging from 0 microamps (uA) for
          up to 12 minutes, to 100 microamps for up to 6 minutes.
          Intermediate currents of 25, 50 and 75 microamps were used to
          expose similar viral aliquots. After exposure of the viral
          suspension to electric currents, the contents of the non-flow
          vessel were removed and placed into sterile microtubes. 5 ul
          of each sample were removed and diluted with 95 ul tissue
          culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS.
          unborn calf blood) In Experiment 1, the resuspended and
          treated viral stocks were incubated with a human T
          lymphoblastoid cell line named CEM-SS. This cell line, upon
          exposure to HIV-1, forms syncytia (giant cells). It is well
          documented that the viral titer (amount) used is directly
          correlated with the number of syncytia formed. Therefore,
          evaluation of infectivity of HIV-1 can be used with this
          assay. In contrast, Experiment No. 2 used a differnet human T
          lymphoblastoid cell line named H9. This cell line, in contrast
          to CEM-SS cells, produces, upon exposure to HIV-1, many viral
          particles. The amount of virus produced is proportional to the
          amount of virus to which the <br>
          cells are exposed. Therefore, quantitation of viral particles,
          or more commonly associated viral protein (in this case
          reverse transcriptase), can be used as an index of viral
          infection. In both assays, the CEM syncytia forming assay and
          the H9 viral protein assay, similar type results were
          obtained. That is, with the CEM cells, although syncytium
          formation and quantitation is preferrable, one can quantitate
          the HIV-1 associated protein (reverse transcriptase) activity
          and conversely with the H9 cells, although reverse
          transcriptase quantitation is preferred, one can quantitate
          giant cell (syncytia) formation. Both of these assays are
          widely used as reproducible measures of viral infection and
          can be used to determine if alterations in viral infectivity
          as a product of this electrical treatment can be detected. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Experiment #1</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Approximately 100,000 CEM-SS cells
          per sample were incubated with a treated or untreated
          (control) viral aliquot for up to 4 days. The cells were
          placed into microtiter plate wells and monitored for formation
          of syncytia every 24 hours by microscopic observation. In a
          standardized fashion, as it has been reported in the
          literature and is currently being conducted in many
          laboratories, the number of syncytia at 3 and 4 days was
          determined. Table 2 summarizes the results from a
          representative experiment using this assay. As can be noted,
          the number of syncytia formed was inversely proportional to
          the amount of electric current. That is, additionally, with
          increased current (100 vs 50 uA) there was a reduction in the
          number of syncytia formed. These results and those of
          additional experiments using the CEM-SS cell line indicate a
          consistent finding that electrical treatment of the RF strain
          of HIV-1 attentuates the virus potential for inducing
          syncytium formation in this cell line. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Experiment #2</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A separate and independent assay to
          determine the ability of electric current to alter HIV-1
          infectivity using H9 cells was employed. The basic strategy
          was similar to that used for the CEM cells with the exception
          that the initial suspension of treated and controlled
          (non-treated) viral stock was incubated with 100,000 H9 cells
          for 2 hours at 37 degees Celsius. Thereafter, the cell virus
          suspensions were further diluted to 5 ml in standard tissue
          culture medium. The cell-viral suspensions were then incubated
          for up to 14 days at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% carbon
          dioxide. At 3 day intervals (beginning at day 2), aliquots of
          cell suspension were removed from each sample. The aliquots
          were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes in order to pellet
          the cells. After centrifugation, the supernatant and cell
          pellets were seperated. The supernatant was cyropreserved for
          subsequent reverse transcriptase assay and the cell pellets
          were resuspended in fixatives and maintained in a tissue bank
          for additional studies employing in situ hybridization and
          immunocytochemistry to detect qualitatively and
          semi-qualitatively viral infection by HIV-1. At the end of
          each experiment, the supernatant samples from each of the
          tests and time points were examined using standard reverse
          transcriptase assay. The results of the representative
          experiment are shown in Table 3. The results of this
          experiment indicate the ability of HIV-1 to infect H9 cells is
          attenuated by the magnitude of the electrical currents to
          which the virus is exposed. Additionally, at lower current
          magnitude, but with prolonged exposure time, attenuation of
          viral infectivity is achieved. That is, analogous to the
          results observed using syncytium formation and the CEM-SS cell
          line, either increased current or increased duration of
          exposure time was inversely proportional to the amount of
          reverse transcriptase produced by the cell line. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In conclusion, these experiments
          which have been repeated several times, and those using the
          CEM-SS cell line, indicate at a statistically significant
          level that direct electrical current at biocompatible
          amperages for discrete exposure time intervals can attenuate
          the ability of HIV-1 to infect normally healthy cells which
          are susceptible to the HIV-1 AIDS virus. </p>
