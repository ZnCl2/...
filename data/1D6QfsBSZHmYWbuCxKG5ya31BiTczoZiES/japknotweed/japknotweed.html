      ...Japanese Knotweed is listed by the World Conservation Union as
      one of the world’s worst invasive species. Perhaps it should be
      planted in countries where starvation is annual. Introduced into
      Great Britain by 1825 Japanese Knotweed has been on the decimation
      list for more than 30 years and has to be disposed at landfills
      licensed to handle the dreaded edible. In fact they spend some two
      billion pounds to combat it annually, which as of this writing is
      about three billion dollars a year. It increased the construction
      cost of the 2012 Olympic stadium by some 70 million pounds.
      Japanese Knotweed is also “invading” New Zealand, Australia, and
      Tasmania. It arrived in North America in the late 180os and is
      officially found in 39 of the 50 United States, probably more, and
      six provinces of Canada. It’s an invasive weed in Ohio, Vermont,
      West Virginia, New York, Alaska, Pennsylvania, Oregon and
      Washington. About the only place where they are not upset with the
      plant is where it’s native, southeast Asia. What do they know the
      rest of the world doesn’t? It is said that Japanese Knotweed out
      lives the gardener and the garden.<br>
      <br>
      Knotweed, in the Buckwheat family, is not liked in western nations
      because it grows around three feet a month, sends roots down some
      10 feet, grows through concrete, damaging roads, dams, buildings
      and just about anything made by man. It’s a pain in the asphalt.
      Forages take advantage of it eating — raw or cooked — young
      shoots, growing tips of larger plants and unfurled leaves on the
      stalk and branches. Many folks say it tastes like rhubarb but I
      think a lemony green is more accurate, crunchy and tender. For the
      health conscious it is a major source of resveratrol and Vitamin C
      … a noxious weed AND very healthy. Tsk…Tsk… The California
      Department of Food and Agriculture and the book Cornucopia II both
      say the rhizomes are edible. No references are given as to how to
      cook them nor have I tried. Usually the roots are used
      medicinally. Giant Knotweed, Polygonum sachalinense (Fallopia
      sachalinensis) is similarly consume except its fruit is eaten as
      well, or stored in oil..<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Green Deane’s “Itemized” Plant Profile:
          Japanese Knotweed</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      IDENTIFICATION: Polygonum cuspidatum: A semi-woody perennial, fast
      growing, hollow, bamboo-like stems forming dense, leafy thickets,
      woody with age. Young shoots are red. Leaves simple, toothless,
      hairless, alternating, broadly ovate with a pointed tip, 3 to 6
      inches long, 2 to 4½ inches wide, on a long leaf stem. Flowers
      branching in spike-like clusters, individual flowers are 1/8 inch
      across, white to greenish or pinkish, with 5 petals, 8 stamens.
      Male and female flowers separate (dioecious.) Female flowers can
      produce small 3-angled black-brown fruit. Seed production is
      uncommon.<br>
      <br>
      TIME OF YEAR: Purple shoots appear in spring, flowers late summer,
      early autumn.<br>
      <br>
      ENVIRONMENT: Riverbanks, roadsides, moist, disturbed areas.<br>
      <br>
      METHOD OF PREPARATION: Young shoots, growing tips, young leaves
      boiled or steamed and eaten like asparagus, or chilled and served
      with a dressing. Can be used in pies. soups, aspics, sauces, jams,
      chutneys even wines. The roots, actually rhizomes, are sometimes
      eaten. It is good fodder for grazing animals, including cattle,
      sheep, goats, horses and donkeys. Old stems have been used to make
      matches. It is high in oxalic acid so if you avoid spinach or
      rhubarb you should avoid knotweed….<br>

      <br>
      Japanese Knotweed; the most pernicious weed in the northern
      hemisphere has been rated as a biological catastrophe, for it`s
      monstrous tendency of overrunning the sensitive wetland areas of
      our nature reserves with monopolizing thickets due to which
      endangered native plant societies are often permanently displaced
      and their last occurrences extinguished.<br>
      <br>
      So Japanese Knotweed is the most invasive plant on the northern
      globe and often treated with massive amounts of highly toxic
      herbicides. My goal is to teach folks how to take a bite out of
      their knotweed invasion, because the costs for other means of
      controlling polygonum cuspidatum and the damage done to
      construction sites and real estate are horrendous, while this
      project would not only save taxpayers their due, but yield a
      fantastic new foodsource, supply employment to any willing sponsor
      and protect our native environment; by turning this botanic pest
      into an economical blessing.<br>
      <br>
      Not until 2002 did I realize that Japanese Knotweed was not just
      another edible wildplant, that I introduced to the attendance of
      my herbwalks. I would bring a jar of Knotweed jam and buttered
      breadslices along any excursion and whenever we passed a knotweed
      stand I would pass forward my knowledge of it`s fascinating
      culinary attributes as I was taught by Monsieur Dumaine and Euell
      Gibbons.<br>
      <br>
      In order to expand my monologue I started surfing the internet and
      learned that Fallopia japonica found mention mostly on gardening
      websites where it`s victims exchanged their experiences about the
      plants eradication or vice versa their failure to control it`s
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      Knotweed populations everywhere. A futuristic prediction would be
      that this plant may change the face of our landscape. Why let this
      precious regional produce go to waste ? <br>
      While counting hundreds of populations in the Wiesbaden Area I
      learned that several nearby wetlands were infested even worse and
      what damage common ignorance causes. Every m2 of Knotweed growth
      produces an average 12-15 Kg of biomass.<br>
      <br>
      Up to a hundred dry hollow stalks persist the elements for years
      to come, withdraw and conserve the soils nutriments.<br>
      <br>
      While I found numerous larger monopolizing patches where the
      native habitat has been completely displaced,<br>
      <br>
      I discovered several invasive species websites dedicated to
      Knotweed management all collectively ignorant to the fact that
      Knotweed is first and foremost a fantastic foodsource; which`s
      became an invasive weed due to a lack of natural enemies.<br>
      <br>
      Although it`s been predicted that knotweed`s in the process of a
      culinary boom as Wild Garlic has been going through in the last
      fifteen years and proven by the fact that ever more often the
      plant finds mention in cookbooks, the idea to connect it`s
      edibility against it`s invasive attributes, has not been really
      recognized yet. Mainly because specialists und consumers generally
      harvest the sprouts only over a span of ten days before it get`s
      to fibrous. Here, my semi-cultivation makes all the difference.<br>
      <br>
      In 2003 I had my booklet My Appetite; Your Herbicide completed,
      eager to offer advice and avoid further damage of our ecosystem by
      unnecessary, losses to native plant societies and waste of
      potential capital.<br>
      <br>
      But to volunteer with local control programs turned out to be the
      hardest part; of establishing my Bionic Knotweed Control.<br>
      <br>
      Specialists all over the world agree that a manual control is
      virtually impossible and that successful management usually
      requires herbicides.<br>
      <br>
      Due to it`s vigorous growth of, especially in watersheds, up to 30
      cm a day, harvest by wildfoodists has traditionally been limited
      to a span of probably 10 days; before the stalks become to
      fibrous. That`s why knotweed has never become a popular produce
      item of any culinary or agricultural importance. Here`s the
      significant difference between plain destructive mowing and
      disposal of the biomass, compared to semi-cultivating designated
      populations to reap an agricultural value and renature it`s native
      inhabitants.<br>
      <br>
      While the manual control is hard labour, the bionic treatment has
      an instant symptomatic impact on the plants aggressive tendency
      because once your action is a harvest and your supplied with it ́s
      beneficial profit; the entire measure gains a constructive and
      very motivation aspect which no other mean of control can match.<br>
      <br>
      In order to handle the advance of the knotweed invasion the most
      sustainable way, I suggest to semi-cultivate any population that
      suitable for human consumption in terms of the “Bio” standard.
      That way a good percentage of general knotweed control may be
      financially covered and communities would be able to save a lot of
      tax money presently squandered by temporary means.<br>
      <br>
      Each designated population is thoroughly cleaned, all stalks
      removed, burned and the ashes, after Phase 1, returned to the soil
      before the process of renaturing begins.<br>
      To attempt the control of a full grown population is useless
      because the organism has already began it`s secondary metabolism
      and all sprouts are too fibrous for Knotty Foods<br>
      <br>
      The tolerable leaf development during harvest (Phase 2). This can
      only be accomplished by daily operation throughout the entire 10
      weeks of the plants primary growth period.<br>
      After the harvest, the populations have to be weeded from all the
      tiny sprout bushels representing a secondary sort of growth that
      develop their leafs immediately upon surfacing. These sprouts are
      collected for the isolation of resveratrol and cosmetic
      application.<br>
      <br>
      The sprouts reach a length of 30-40 cm a day and the average yield
      is 70 g per day and m2..<br>
      <br>
      …In 2004 four populations were threatening to form a huge thicket
      to monopolize the meadow and displace the entire fauna and flora.<br>
      <br>
      In 2005 the Bionic Control began and throughout the season all
      leaf development was inhibited to weaken the plant, while 7 kg of
      knotweed- sprouts per m2 were the average harvest.<br>
      <br>
      In 2006 the combined effect of semi-cultivation and renaturing of
      the native plant- society has proven that this sustainable method
      is faster than all other current management approaches and yields
      a profit of 140 Euros per m2.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>The invention relates to a method for extracting resveratrol
      from a natural plant giant knotweed, particularly a method for
      extracting resveratrol from giant knotweed by enzymolysis. The
      method comprises the following steps: by using commercially
      available giant knotweed rhizome as the raw material, carrying out
      enzymolysis reaction, alcohol deep extraction and separation
      concentration, and drying to obtain the resveratrol crystal powder
      product. The method has the characteristics of sufficient
      enzymolysis, short time, low operating cost, high operation safety
      and the like, fully utilizes the raw materials and organic
      solvent, is beneficial to environmental protection since the waste
      liquid is mainly water, and can easily implement industrialized
      popularization and application. The resveratrol crystal powder
      product prepared by the method has high purity, and the maximum
      purity is 98.31%. The overall yield is high, and the maximum
      overall yield is 1.40%. The method can be widely used for
      producing the resveratrol crystal product. The product prepared by
      the method can be widely used in fine chemical engineering
      production of medical drugs for preventing cardiovascular
      diseases, protecting the liver and resisting cancers and skin-care

      Enzymatic extraction of Resveratrol from Polygonum method involves
      enzymatic extraction and microwave extraction technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Polygonum cuspidatum, also known as big-leaf tongue mains, spotted
      purple dragon root, its roots and stems contain anthraquinones and
      stilbene compounds effective active substances in its class
      component stilbene resveratrol (resveratrol) is an important
      phytoalexins, can enhance plant resistance to pathogens, and have
      antioxidant, free radical scavenging, anti-aging, anti-cancer,
      cardiovascular protection and plant estrogen and hepatoprotective
      effect, is a great value of natural substance.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, there are more than ten countries and regions in the
      development of the world's raw materials and preparations
      resveratrol, another new green anticancer drug Taxol has been
      hailed after being widespread concern. Major domestic extracted
      from Polygonum cuspidatum resveratrol, extracted with an organic
      solvent and more, and with a solvent such as chloroform as eluent,
      separated by a silica gel column, the time required is longer,
      larger toxic solvents such as chloroform, solvent residue problems
      difficult to solve, Polygonum cuspidatum only single component
      extraction and separation, and can not make full use of the
      resources of Polygonum cuspidatum, low economic value. Most of the
      active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines have been wrapped
      in the plant cell wall and extracted with an organic solvent used
      in general, difficult to destroy the cell wall, a lower extraction
      rate, foreign-1980s has been treated by the enzymatic extraction
      of natural products, researchers reported It showed that enzymatic
      action can make the cell wall loose, broken, reducing the mass
      transfer resistance, accelerate the release of the active
      ingredient, thereby increasing extraction rate, enhance the value
      of raw materials. The microwave heating method has a short time,
      uniform heating, producing good quality products, easy to automate
      control and so on. Microwave can be directly compared to the role
      of molecules, the thermal motion of molecules increased, while
      raising the temperature from this thermal effect can quickly
      destroy the cell walls, making Chinese medicinal herbs have active
      ingredients faster separations extracted. The present invention

      volume fraction of 80% ethanol as extracting solvent, dubbed
      liquid feed mixture 20:1 mass ratio, the optimum extraction
      conditions enzyme that is 50 ° C temperature, ph value of 5.0
      under the conditions of cellulase enzyme added 10mg 30min. Because
      microwave assisted extraction single-factor test showed that
      resveratrol has little effect on the yield of microwave power, so
      only consider the impact of microwave time. By the hydrolysis
      mixture over 510W power microwave heating, the extract reduced
      pressure suction filtration, dried and concentrated to low
      temperature, the sample was resveratrol.<br>
      <br>
      Precautions: It was found that by increasing the microwave power
      can increase the extraction yield, but little effect, likely to
      cause excessive power within the container vigorously boiling
      liquid, boiling medicine will produce large amounts of foam, rapid
      discharge extraction vessel, causing the active ingredient loss
      microwave should be used and intermittent, to control the
      temperature, to prevent violent boiling liquid.<br>
      <br>

      extraction of resveratrol on the one hand dramatically increase
      the extraction rate, on the other hand, and simple enzymatic
      extraction compared to shorten the extraction time, simply
      microwave extraction although time is fast but the extraction
      rate, the present method combines the full advantages of both
      methods, reduce production costs, more suitable for industrial
      production.<br>

      [Image]<br>
      <br>
      Polydatin and resveratrol have diverse biological activities such
      as anti-oxidation, inhibit tumor formation and development,
      Microcirculation and the role of shock therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Separation and purification method polydatin and resveratrol are
      set out in the literature include solvents (such as ethyl acetate,
      diethyl ether) extraction France, silica gel column chromatography
      (for example, Yang Yun, Feng Weisheng, the chemical composition of
      traditional Chinese medicine extraction and separation Manual,
      Chinese medicine Press, 1998: 205-207; Sun Wenji, natural medicine
      ingredient extraction and separation and preparation, Chinese
      Medical Science and Technology Press, second edition, 1999:
      315-317). In recent years, also appeared in a number of patents
      related to the preparation of documents and Polydatin its
      aglycone. For example, "resveratrol Preparation of alcohol
      polydatin "(Chinese Patent Application No. 01118461.2), the method
      is the column chromatography and high-speed Countercurrent
      chromatography together, namely a first step towards separation of
      resveratrol and resveratrol glucoside by silica gel column
      chromatography (Mobile phase chromatography halogenated
      hydrocarbons (e.g. chloroform, methylene chloride, carbon
      tetrachloride), fatty alcohols or ketones (e.g., methanol,
      ethanol, propanol, propoxy Ketone)), then the first step of this
      second separated product was isolated by countercurrent
      chromatography to give the target product. In another Patent
      "resveratrol and resveratrol glucoside Separation and Its
      Application" (Application No. 00121100.5), the method involves
      First mention was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate, and
      then using chloroform - methanol (or ethanol) or ethyl acetate -
      ethanol as elution chromatography Was subjected to silica gel
      column chromatography, and then with methanol - chloroform as a
      solvent was recrystallized to give crystals resveratrol glucoside,
      and through the secondary Chromatography (eluent: chloroform -
      ethyl acetate) and recrystallization (crystallization solvent:
      acetone - chloroform) to obtain resveratrol. <br>
      Obviously, The method also involves a large number of organic
      solvents, repeated use. Extraction of resveratrol and resveratrol
      glucoside from Polygonum cuspidatum reports Also found in Japanese
      Patent Publication 60-9455 (1985). The patented method is the use
      of ether as the extraction solvent to obtain the desired product,
      A process which is more complex, volatile and ether, flammable,
      toxic than ethyl acetate, methanol and other solvents stronger.<br>

      preparation of a small laboratory scale under the large-scale
      industrial production, It limited its application. First, from the
      separation process, the above-described methods are to varying
      degrees by silica gel column chromatography as an essential
      separation of the hand segment. Silica gel column there is a small
      amount of sample separation, the amount of filler big
      disadvantage, and silica filler is difficult to recycle, the
      production Limited scale, the higher cost of industrial
      production. The high-speed countercurrent chromatography
      applications, such as the Chinese Patent 01118461.2, Is obtained
      by silica gel column chromatography purity of more than 70% and
      90% of the product was chromatographed twice counterflow, over the
      entire process Part of a multi-step process involving a variety of
      equipment. In general, as compared with silica gel column
      chromatography, countercurrent chromatography sample amount is
      more Little harder to meet industrial production requirements.<br>

      In addition, the solvent used, the solvent system used in the
      above document are to varying degrees using a second class solvent
      such as halogenated hydrocarbons (Chloroform, etc.) or methanol,
      to ensure production safety conditions at the scale of production
      is relatively difficult and high cost solvent, The final product
      will inevitably involve harmful solvents residue problems.<br>

      <b>Example Results Discussion and Analysis of implementation</b><br>
      <br>
      Based on chromatographic separation method of choice First, the
      nature of the object Polydatin see: it is soluble in methanol,
      ethanol Alcohol, hot water, can be dissolved in ethyl acetate,
      sodium bicarbonate and aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, slightly
      soluble in water, insoluble in ether. Secondly, From the need to
      produce the feasibility and cost accounting to see: First, the
      production process should have the feasibility, routing the more
      pure and simple, No cross, the greater the feasibility of
      large-scale production; secondly with the operability and safety;
      taking into account the low consumption, low cost in principle.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is applied to the polyamide chromatography
      polydatin (and resveratrol) is isolated by the nature of the
      target Organic combination, give full play to the unique
      advantages in technology Polydatin scale preparation of.<br>
      <br>
      two. Basis and purpose of chromatographic separation techniques to
      determine embodiment employs clarification step of loading the
      appropriate samples Pretreatment, aims to reduce the interference
      of impurities, because herbs Polygonum cuspidatum extract,
      containing not only the active ingredient, but also contains a lot
      of Before invalid ingredients such as anthraquinone, tannins,
      polysaccharides and flavonoids and other ingredients, so the use
      of column chromatography, can be achieved by The column
      appropriate sample pretreatment to simplify the separation of
      work, but also reduce the pollution of the column, the column to
      improve utilization. Sample pre-treatment sample may also be
      realized by other technical methods, such as extraction liquid
      extraction methods.<br>
      <br>
      In the method of the present invention, the primary extract
      containing resveratrol polydatin and can be used on wet or dry
      samples. Chromatography eluant Preferably ethanol - water as the
      eluting solvent, three kinds of organic solvent is ethanol, low
      production cost, safe, and chromatographed eluting Using a
      gradient of concentration series of ethanol - water as solvent
      gradient system, 0-30% ethanol by water → 30 ~ 60% aqueous
      ethanol, Enrichment achieved is the active ingredient (Polydatin),
      the purpose of removing the interference of impurities, 30 to 60%
      ethanol water column after elution, can Higher concentrations of
      ethanol water continues to give eluted fractions containing
      resveratrol. The method of the present invention is realized in
      the same root Chromatography column, by changing the solvent
      leaving a gradient elution system of active ingredient isolated
      and enrichment purposes, chromatography and used Small elution
      solvent, a small amount of post-processing. Column in the elution
      component resveratrol has been completed, while preliminary column
      again Students, after washing with water and then make the
      appropriate change elution, the column can basically reach the
      standby state. The process is simple, economic security,
      Preparation of a large quantity of products.<br>
      <br>
      Third, the outstanding feature of this embodiment is reflected in:<br>
      <br>
      1. Solvent system: the method of the present invention may be
      implemented in the water - complete extract and resveratrol
      polydatin under ethanol system, divided From purified. Has been
      disclosed in resveratrol polydatin and separation techniques, all
      involving the use of a different degree, there are two types of
      Solvent such as diethyl ether, chloroform, methanol and ethyl
      acetate as the extraction solvent or solvent elution
      chromatography. Obviously, Experimental and production operations
      in the preparation process, the solvent system of the present
      invention, the method more secure, significantly reduces the
      solvent used in the production process Production staff as well as
      the potential impact on the environment.<br>
      <br>
      2. Industrialization, large-scale production: separation in the
      preparation of documents disclosed polydatin and resveratrol, the
      use of a silica gel column Chromatography, organic solvent
      extraction, countercurrent chromatography and other methods.
      Obviously, in these methods, their preparation and preparative
      scale amounts Enlarge necessarily limited by its own technical
      conditions. For example, when the silica gel column chromatography
      to achieve the industrial production, since (1) as Regeneration
      step chromatography on silica filler is too complex and generally
      difficult to regenerate, and packed conditions and conditions of a
      silica gel column chromatography Very strict requirements; (2) The
      silica gel column chromatography elution solvent is generally an
      organic solvent not containing water, such as chloroform, acetic
      acid Ethyl, not only the high cost of these solvents, and the use
      of more stringent process conditions; therefore, to achieve a
      silica gel column chromatography Industrial production there must
      be a substantial increase in production cost constraints and the
      technical difficulty. The use of a solvent such as ethyl ether
      extraction When taking, use and disposal of the solvent there are
      similar problems. As high-speed countercurrent chromatography,
      under the existing technical conditions, Its preparation batch
      volume generally only milligrams, industrial production is
      difficult to achieve under the technical conditions. In contrast,
      in the present Out method, since (1) may be water - to complete
      all of the production process of ethanol system; (2) a polyamide
      column can be regenerated Use, no need to replace the filler
      between the batch and re-packed; control (3) industrial production
      conditions easy to achieve, it Required equipment is simple, easy
      operation, safety, low production cost, easy to implement
      conversion process conditions under different production scale and
      Handover, so the applications, highlighting the advantages of the
      present invention is a method of the prior art methods can not be
      compared. <br>
