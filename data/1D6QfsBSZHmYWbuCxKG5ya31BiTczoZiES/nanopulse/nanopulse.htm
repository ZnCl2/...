      Non-ionizing radiation produced by nanosecond pulsed electric
      fields (nsPEFs) is an alternative to ionizing radiation for cancer
      treatment. NsPEFs are high power, low energy (non-thermal) pulses
      that, unlike plasma membrane electroporation, modulate
      intracellular structures and functions. To determine functions for
      p53 in nsPEF-induced apoptosis, HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53-/-
      colon carcinoma cells were exposed to multiple pulses of 60 kV/cm
      with either 60 ns or 300 ns durations and analyzed for apoptotic
      markers. Several apoptosis markers were observed including cell
      shrinkage and increased percentages of cells positive for
      cytochrome c, active caspases, fragmented DNA, and Bax, but not
      Bcl-2. Unlike nsPEF-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Beebe et
      al. 2003a) active caspases were observed before increases in
      cytochrome c, which occurred in the presence and absence of Bax.
      Cell shrinkage occurred only in cells with increased levels of Bax
      or cytochrome c. NsPEFs induced apoptosis equally in HCT116p53+/+
      and HCT116p53-/- cells. These results demonstrate that
      non-ionizing radiation produced by nsPEFs can act as a non-ligand
      agonist with therapeutic potential to induce apoptosis utilizing
      mitochondrial-independent mechanisms in HCT116 cells that lead to
      caspase activation and cell death in the presence or absence of
      p-53 and Bax.<br>

      <b>Abstract </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) is a novel non-thermal
      approach to induce cell apoptosis. NsPEFs has been proven
      effective in treating several murine tumors, but few studies focus
      on its efficacy in treating human tumors. To determine if nsPEFs
      is equally effective in treatment of human breast cancer, 30 human
      breast cancer tumors across 30Balb/c (nu/nu) mice were exposed to
      720 pulses of 100ns duration, at 4pulsespersecond and 30kV/cm. Two
      weeks after treatment, the growth of treated tumors was inhibited
      by 79%. Morphological changes of tumors were observed via a 3.0T
      clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system with a self-made
      surface coil. Pulsed tumors exhibited apoptosis evaluated by TUNEL
      staining, inhibition in Bcl-2 expression and decreased blood
      vessel density. Notably, CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression in treated tumors were
      strongly suppressed. To evaluate the might-be adverse effects of
      nsPEFs in healthy tissues, normal skin was treated exactly the
      same way as tumors, and pulsed skin showed no permanent damages.
      The results suggest nsPEFs is able to inhibit human breast cancer
      development and suppress tumor blood vessel growth, indicating
      nsPEFs may serve as a novel therapy for breast cancer in the
      future.<br>

      Exposing cells to nanosecond pulsed electric fields causes a rapid
      increase in intracellular calcium, enabling a pathway that
      activates protein kinase C for various physiological functions.<br>
      4 March 2013, SPIE Newsroom. DOI: 10.1117/2.1201302.004736<br>
      <br>
      In cellular electrochemistry, ions respond to stimuli by
      constantly shuffling across cellular membranes to perform their
      physiological roles. This flow of ions, the electromotive force,
      leaves cells vulnerable to exogenous electromagnetic fields that
      can stimulate and/or modulate cellular activity. An irreparable
      link exists between changes in ionic concentration and the
      electric gradient of the cell (or its potential energy).
      Consequently, we can manipulate the physiology of the cell by
      altering its permeability to various ions, thereby modulating its
      electrical gradient. Only a few millivolts in excess of the
      resting membrane potential can stimulate a dramatic change in ion
      distribution within the cellular microenvironment. In excitable
      neural-type cells, electrical-stimulation-induced changes in
      membrane potential lead to the generation or inactivation of
      action potentials (AP). These AP trigger activities, such as nerve
      impulses in neurons or contraction in muscle cells. Within neural
      networks, targeted alteration of AP can prompt physiological
      changes that selectively stimulate or inactivate specific signals
      along nerve fibers. On the whole-organism level, electromagnetic
      fields applied directly to neural tissue, or transversely through
      the skull, produce profound effects that range from altered
      sensory perception to deviations in motor movement. Given this
      wealth of observable electromagnetic effects on neurological
      tissues, it is no surprise that other forms of electrical stimuli
      may elicit novel responses in an exposed biological system.<br>
      <br>
      Our research team is currently exploring the cellular response to
      high-amplitude, short-duration electrical pulses termed nanosecond
      pulsed electric fields (nsPEF). Seminal studies showed that nsPEF
      exposure can elicit changes in membrane potential, plasma membrane
      phospholipid scrambling, mitochondrial depolarization, calcium
      uptake, platelet aggregation, and, at intense or repeated
      exposures, cause cell death.1–7 Notably, these observations show
      no substantial uptake of propidium iodide, a common indicator of
      pore formation in the plasma membrane when electric pulses are
      applied for longer periods (µs to ms).8 Thus, we assume that nsPEF
      exposure causes the formation of small, ion-permeable pores, or
      nanopores, in the plasma membrane.2, 9,10 Unlike the larger pores,
      nanopores retain ion selectivity when exposed to electrical
      pulses, acting more like a channel, and persist for many minutes
      after only a single pulse exposure.9, 11 Most notably, the
      formation of nanopores in the plasma membrane elicits an acute and
      prolonged increase in intracellular calcium, an ion critical to
      many neurological and cellular processes.<br>
      <br>
      We believe that nsPEF exposure is an ideal tool for the prolonged
      and non-invasive modulation of cell electrophysiology. Based on
      the hypothesis of nanopore formation, we investigated the dynamics
      of calcium entry into neuroblastoma cells. We used a highly
      sensitive electron multiplied CCD camera and precisely timed laser
      excitation to acquire high-resolution, spatiotemporal images of a
      single cell12 (see Figure 1). We visualized calcium entering from
      the sides nearest the electrodes in less than 1ms after
      perturbation by a single 600ns pulse, and filling the cell within
      100ms. With extracellular calcium excluded from the bathing
      buffer, the intensity of the signal was reduced and the signal
      emanated from within the cell, suggesting calcium release from
      intracellular stores. By pre-exposing cells to the inhibitor
      thapsigargin in an effort to deplete intracellular calcium, we saw
      no change in signal, validating the intracellular origin of the
      signal. This finding was the first to definitively show,
      spatially, that nsPEF caused both extracellular uptake and
      intracellular release of calcium.<br>
      <br>
      We hypothesize that the release of intracellular calcium is due,
      in part, to nsPEF-induced activation of intracellular pathways
      derived from the plasma membrane, namely the hydrolysis of
      phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) or PIP2.
      PIP2 is a well-characterized intracellular pathway that originates
      on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. It ultimately causes
      intracellular calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum via
      inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (see Figure 2), activating
      protein kinase C (PKC). To validate our hypothesis, we used a
      widely accepted optical probe of PIP2 hydrolysis and
      diacylglycerol (DAG) sensor GFP-C1-PKC? (green fluorescent protein
      labeled C1 domain of protein kinase C): see Figure 3.13,14 We
      validated that a single nsPEF exposure can cause hydrolysis of
      PIP2, ultimately leading to increased DAG on the plasma membrane,
      and activation of PKC.<br>
      <br>
      PKC triggers many physiological responses, including hormone
      secretion, AP propagation, and muscle contraction. Thus, by
      manipulating the electrochemistry of the cell with nsPEF, we can
      potentially elicit and control a number of biological responses.
      This single, exogenous, non-chemical stimulus can cause a
      prolonged activation of intracellular signaling cascades at a
      similar level to that of pharmaceutical treatment, but without the
      need for a specific cell surface receptor. The responses can last
      for minutes and can be delivered locally, precisely and without
      systemic drug administration. Electrical pulse delivery to cells
      offers scientists a new, instant, and simplified means of studying
      cellular physiology through direct, drug-free activation of
      cellular pathways. Non-invasive activation of PKC could be used to
      stimulate cognitive function or treat pain without pharmaceuticals
      or surgery. Future efforts will focus on validation of this effect
      in primary neuron cultures and evaluation of ion channels
      regulated by PIP2 hydrolysis.13<br>

      When new technologies are introduced into the scientific
      community, controversy is expected and both excitement and
      disappointment enrich the lives of those who initiate the new
      ideas. It becomes the mission of the “inventors” to embrace the
      burden of proof to establish their ideas and convince the skeptics
      and disbelievers who will undoubtedly temper their enthusiasm and
      test their patience. While open mindedness is generally a
      scientific motto, those who review patents, manuscripts, and
      grants do not always readily practice it, even when the evidence
      is convincingly presented; old ideas and concepts often die hard.
      So it has been and still is in many instances as engineers,
      physicists, biologists, and physicians pursue innovative ideas and
      novel technologies.<br>
      <br>
      So what is “Bioelectrics”? It is the application of ultrashort
      pulsed electric fields to biological cells, tissues, and organs.
      More specifically, it is the analysis of how these biological
      systems respond to high electric fields (10–100 s of kV/cm) when
      applied with nanosecond (1–300) durations. Compressing electrical
      energy by means of pulsed power techniques allows the generation
      of ultrashort (billionth of a second) electrical pulses [1].
      Because the pulses are so short the energy density is quite low
      and therefore nonthermal. However, the power is extremely high
      generating billions of watts. This can be compared to a coal power
      plant, which generates less than billion watts, but does it
      continuously. For example, for a 10 ns, 40 kV, 10 O pulse
      generator, the power provided by the pulse is 160 MW, however, the
      energy is only 1.6 J. Depositing this energy into one milliliter
      of water causes an increase in temperature by just one third of
      one degree Celsius. We have referred to these pulses as
      ultrashort, high-voltage pulsed electric fields or nanosecond
      pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs). These conditions are most
      certainly unique and do not exist in nature. Thus, this provides
      an opportunity to determine how cells respond to stimuli that they
      have not evolved to recognize. Undoubtedly, cells respond to
      nsPEFs in diverse and cell-type-specific ways. This suggests that
      nsPEFs represent a distinctive, non-ligand stimulus that can
      disclose basic cell-type-specific differences for responses to the
      external environment and can also be investigated for potential
      therapeutic and/or diagnostic applications. A patent has been
      issued and several provisional patents have been filed for devices
      and applications of nsPEFs to cells and tissues for a wide range
      of applications.<br>
      <br>
      The use of electric fields on biological systems is not new, but
      it has been a common misconception that nsPEFs are also not new. A
      method called electroporation has been used for decades to
      introduce drugs and/or DNA into cells for basic science or for
      therapeutic purposes. These electric fields charge the plasma
      membrane causing the temporary formation of “pores” or breaching
      of plasma membrane integrity that allows the entry of “foreign”
      molecules into the cell interior. However, compared to nsPEFs
      classical plasma membrane electroporation pulses are relatively
      long (microseconds to milliseconds) and with lower electric fields
      (= 1 kV/cm). Thus, nsPEFs can be orders of magnitude shorter in
      duration and higher in electric field. For example, during a 1ms
      electroporation pulse light travels 982,000 feet (186 miles).
      During a 10 ns pulse, light travels about 10 feet. Nevertheless,
      because nsPEF applications are an extension of classical plasma
      membrane electroporation, the effects of nsPEFs are often confused
      with effects of electroporation on the plasma membrane.<br>
      <br>
      Not so! Especially as the pulse duration is decreased below the
      charging time of the plasma membrane. The exclamation point serves
      a special note that cell response phenomena have now significantly
      changed as the rise-time and the pulse duration are below times
      required to fully charge the plasma membrane. As opposed to
      responses to classical plasma membrane electroporation, nsPEF
      affect intracellular structures (membranes) and functions (cell
      signaling), which may or may not involve measurable responses from
      the outer plasma membrane. This primarily depends on the pulse
      duration, pulse rise time, and electric field. nsPEFs enter new
      biological and cellular vistas with dimensions, dynamics, and
      kinetics focused more on intracellular mechanisms [2, 3].
      Nevertheless, nsPEFs have effects on the plasma membrane that are
      direct electric field, nonbiological effects, as well as secondary
      biological effects. While biological effects on the plasma
      membrane, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization
      associated with apoptosis are readily measured, they can be
      confused with PS externalization resulting from direct electric
      field effects. Direct electric field effects on plasma membrane
      integrity are often harder to determine because they occur at
      levels that are often below the level of detection by fluorophores
      and/or molecular probes are too large for small pores, referred to
      as nanopores, which are believed to be present with nsPEFs. Such
      nanopores and nanochannels for phosphatidylserine externalization
      are predicted based on modeling and simulation studies [4]. What
      effects nsPEFs might have on proteins and ion channels are not yet
      investigated. How diminishing effects on plasma membrane
      structures and functions interface with increasing effects on
      intracellular structures and functions as the pulse duration
      decreases remain the basis for continued research in bioelectrics.<br>
      <br>
      We have referred to the nsPEF-induced occurrence of greater
      effects on intracellular membranes and lesser effects on plasma
      membranes as intracellular electro-manipulation (IEM). We used the
      term “manipulation” instead of “electroporation” because it is yet
      to be determined whether nsPEF-induced effects on intracellular
      structures are similar to classical electroporation on the plasma
      membrane. Since nsPEFs applications are an extension of classical
      plasma membrane electroporation, it is reasonable and prudent to
      consider membrane charging as a mechanism for nsPEF effects. While
      the membranes may not be fully charged for a 10 ns pulse, they are
      charging during the pulse. However, as the pulse duration
      decreases to and below 1 ns, charging may not be a major factor.
      Here pure physics meets biology head on and new dimensions and
      other mechanisms may be encountered.<br>
      <br>
      This introduction to nsPEFs provides all of the superlatives and
      fervor that could be expected from physicists and biologists with
      a brand new toy. So what data support the unique effects of nsPEFs
      on biological systems? Most of the work has been done on cells in
      cultures, however an increasing number of studies are being
      conducted on tissues, including fibrosarcoma and melanoma tumors,
      and more recently on adipose tissue and skin as an organ (see [2,
      3] and references within). Cell culture models include HL-60,
      Jurkat, and HCT116, the later including clones that are wildtype
      and null for p53. However, a number of normal human leukocytes and
      a wide range of cancer cells have been tested. Cell responses have
      been measured for nsPEF effects on plasma membranes (integrity,
      potential, and phosphatidylserine externalization), endoplasmic
      reticulum (calcium mobilization), mitochondria (respiration,
      cytochrome c release), and nucleus (fluorescence changes, DNA
      damage, roles for p53, and gene expression). We have also measured
      responses of adipose tissue, skin, and tumors. Studies with tumor
      tissues have determined responses from slowed tumor growth to
      tumor regression. These cell and tissue responses are distinct
      from response to classical plasma membrane electroporation.<br>
      <br>
      A major question that remains to be fully investigated is the
      potential for nsPEF-induced cell-specific effects. There are two
      generalizations for cell-type-specific nsPEF-induced effects that
      have been defined. First, nsPEF-induced cell effects are not cell
      size-dependent as shown for classical plasma membrane
      electroporation where larger cells are more readily affected.
      While a well-controlled, extensive study has not been carried out
      for in vitro cell types, nsPEFs effects on the plasma membrane are
      more readily demonstrated in smaller cells compared to larger
      cells. Second, for a number of cell types tested, adherent cells
      have higher threshold for nsPEF-induced effects than cells that
      grow in suspension. Studies in progress are beginning to
      demonstrate selective effects in adipose tissue and skin.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that nsPEFs can affect cells as a double-edged sword;
      that is at relatively high electric fields nsPEFs recruit
      apoptosis mechanisms, but at lower electric fields they recruit
      nonapoptotic signaling mechanisms [2, 3] . It is now becoming
      clear that proteins that regulate apoptosis are also involved in
      regulating nonapoptotic processes. For example, we have shown that
      nsPEFs can modulate caspase activity and caspases have been shown
      to modulate apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell functions [2, 3]
      including proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, as well as
      programmed cell death. So at higher electric fields nsPEFs can
      induce apoptosis resulting in cell death and size reduction and/or
      ablation of tumors. This is observed as direct electric field
      effects or biological responses to electric fields in the absence
      of drugs. This is distinct from electrochemotherapy where
      classical plasma membrane electroporation allows the entry of
      chemotherapeutic drugs such as bleomysin, which is toxic to the
      tumor.<br>
      <br>
      At lower electric fields and shorter pulse durations, nsPEF
      recruit cell signaling mechanisms that induce calcium mobilization
      and modulate calcium-mediated functions [2, 3] such as platelet
      activation and aggregation, which is important for blood clotting.
      Activation of human platelets, Jurkat cells, and HL-60 cells mimic
      responses to hormones that act through G-protein-coupled, plasma
      membrane receptors that involve IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic
      reticulum. Furthermore, abrupt calcium mobilization has been shown
      to immobilize human neutrophils, presumably due to interruption of
      signals that direct specialized and specific mobilization in
      response to chemotactic signals. The mechanism(s) for these
      calcium mobilization responses remain to be determined.
      Nevertheless, since calcium is an ubiquitous second messenger
      signal, nsPEF-induced calcium modulation could have a wide range
      of applications.<br>
      <br>
      We hypothesized that if nsPEFs affected the nuclear membrane,
      plasmids and transfected genes may enter the nucleus more readily
      and gene transcription may be enhanced. We demonstrated that when
      a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid was
      transfected into cells with a classical plasma membrane
      electroporation pulse and then followed by a nonapoptotic nsPEF in
      a low-conductivity media, the level of expression and the number
      of cells expressing GFP were increased significantly [2, 3] . The
      mechanism(s) for this result is not yet clear, but nsPEF-induced
      effects on the nucleus and DNA have been reported. While some
      studies suggest that direct electric field effects damage DNA,
      other studies indicate effect at the nucleus, some of which are
      reversible and nonlethal. Other studies indicate that nsPEF affect
      expression of endogenous genes. It remains to be determined if
      effects on transcription are due to actions on the nuclear
      membrane, gene transcription mechanisms, or both.<br>
      <br>
      While these observations are exciting, only a few groups have
      carried out experiments with nsPEFs, but the numbers are growing.
      This is because generating pulses with such short durations, rapid
      rise times, and high electric fields is not a common skill.
      Funding from the Department of Defense through the Air Force
      Office of Scientific Research by a Multi-University Research
      Initiative has enhanced the growing number of studies using this
      new technology. These include investigators at Old Dominion
      University, Norfolk, where the technology originated and the MURI
      is administrated; Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk;
      Harvard/MIT, Cambridge; Washington University, St Louis;
      University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio; Wisconsin
      University, Madison; Purdue University, Calumet; and Northwestern
      University, Evanston. A group at University of Southern California
      with Martin Gundersen and Tom Vernier, also funded by AFOSR, has
      also been productive with this technology. Furthermore, two
      Centers of Excellence Programs have been funded in Japan to
      include investigations of nsPEF effects on biological cells. In
      addition, groups in England, France, and Germany have begun to
      establish programs related to bioelectrics research, seeking help
      from the Center of Bioelectrics in Norfolk. Furthermore, all of
      the funded groups are training students, some of whom will
      continue studies in bioelectrics. Moreover, an
      undergraduate/graduate course in Bioelectrics is now offered at
      Old Dominion University and a wider range of bioelectrics-related
      courses may be offered in the future. Thus, it is likely that as
      work continues in this field, it will expand to other groups with
      other methodologies and expertise, and enhance our understanding
      of mechanisms that cells use to respond to unique nsPEF stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      So!! Where do we go from here? Our initial strategies were to do
      preliminary studies to investigate a number of hypotheses based on
      understandings from classical plasma membrane electroporation.
      This approach revealed that a number of projects were worthy of
      pursuit based on peer-review publications and a wealth of
      unpublished data. However, a “rich kid in the candy store”
      strategy will not be successful. First, we are not rich. This
      technology requires a funding stream that is not easily acquired,
      especially with a new technology that must build a respected
      foundation in the peer-review processes. Thus, personnel and
      resources are limited. Second, acquisition of funding from
      national foundations such as the NIH, among others, requires focus
      in areas that are well defined, supported by unshakable
      preliminary data, and assured of success. Some funding may be
      available from venture capitol groups and startup companies, but
      the risk/benefit ratio must be favorable and this is not immediate
      with a new technology. Therefore, we have developed a strategy
      that is based on available funds, resources, and personnel to
      carry forth a series of studies that will provide for the future
      of bioelectrics. Bioelectrics research will remain stimulating
      because there is plenty of intracellular territory to explore.<br>

      <b> <big>Towards Solid Tumor Treatment by Nanosecond Pulsed
          Electric Fields (p. 289-306)</big></b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Local and drug-free solid tumor ablation by large nanosecond
      pulsed electric fields leads to supra-electroporation of all
      cellular membranes and has been observed to trigger nonthermal
      cell death by apoptosis. To establish pore-based effects as the
      underlying mechanism to inducing ­apoptosis, we use a
      multicellular system model (spatial scale 100 µm) that has
      irregularly shaped liver cells and a multiscale liver tissue model
      (spatial scale 200 mm). Pore histograms for the multicellular
      model demonstrate the presence of only nanometer-sized pores due
      to nanosecond electric field pulses. The number of pores in the
      plasma membrane is such that the average tissue conductance during
      nanosecond electric field pulses is even higher than for longer
      irreversible electroporation pulses. It is shown, however, that
      these nanometer-sized pores, although numerous, only significantly
      change the permeability of the cellular membranes to small ions,
      but not to larger molecules. Tumor ablation by nanosecond pulsed
      electric fields causes small to moderate temperature increases.
      Thus, the underlying mechanism(s) that trigger cell death by
      apoptosis must be non-thermal electrical interactions, presumably
      leading to different ionic and molecular transport than for much
      longer irreversible electroporation pulses.<br>
      <br>
      Tissue ablation techniques to treat all cells of unwanted tissue
      for surgical, cosmetic, or other reasons are potentially valuable
      as minimally invasive clinical tools (1). Tissue ablation may be
      achieved by the application of RF electric fields that lead to
      cell death by overheating the targeted tissue. Strong electric
      field pulses that cause electroporation (EP) of cellular
      membranes, a universal mechanism by which cellular membranes
      become permeable to drugs, molecules, and genetic material, may
      alternatively be used for tissue ablation. Drug-assisted methods
      such as electro-chemotherapy (ECT) (2) and electro-genetherapy (3)
      are examples of such EP-based tissue ablation methods. There is
      now evidence, however, that drugs actually may not be necessary,
      since the impact of certain strong electric field pulses that
      cause EP itself is sufficient to trigger cellular mechanisms that
      lead to cellular death.<br>
      <br>
      In a previous paper (4) we considered some fundamental mechanistic
      aspects that are relevant to solid tumor treatment by irreversible
      electroporation (IRE) (5-10). In short, IRE involves the
      application of pulses with a duration of typically hundreds of
      microseconds and an electric field strength on the order of a few
      kilovolts per centimeter (kV/cm). These IRE pulses are sufficient
      to cause what is known as conventional EP, for which pores in the
      plasma membrane (PM) of the cells are sufficiently large to
      facilitate molecular uptake and release. While those pulses reseal
      in most EP-based applications, IRE pulses are designed such that
      pores in the PM do not reseal - hence the PM is said to be
      irreversibly electroporated. Therefore, the barrier function of
      the PM is lost, leading to cellular death in a treated tissue
      region. Specifically, solid tumor treatment by IRE is observed to
      cause necrosis in the targeted cells (9).<br>
      <br>
      Using Blumleln circuit-based or MOSFET-based pulsed power
      technologies, solid tumor treatment by much shorter nanosecond
      pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with durations of ten to several
      hundred nanoseconds and field strengths of tens or even hundreds
      of kV/cm has been demonstrated (11-14). In particular, Nuccitelli
      et al., (12, 14) used electric field pulses with durations of
      about 300 ns and with electric field strengths of 20 kV/cm and 40
      kV/cm to demonstrate self-destruction of melanomas. Garon et al.,
      (13) used electric field pulses that were even one order of
      magnitude shorter, namely 20 ns or less and field strengths up to
      60 kV/cm. Their results showed decreased cell viability of a
      variety of human cancer cells in vitro, induction of tumor
      regression in vivo, and successful treatment of a human subject
      with a basal cell carcinoma for which they found a ?complete
      pathologic response?. Cell death does not appear to be due to
      immediate PM destruction, as expected for IRE pulses. Instead, it
      appears to be the result of delayed effects, which may be caused
      by the efflux of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (e.g.,
      endosplasmic reticulum) that eventually cause apoptosis (13).<br>
      <br>
      The concept of using nsPEF pulses as a therapeutic tool to treat
      solid tumors was first demonstrated by Beebe et al., (11) who
      reported the induction of apoptosis in solid tumors (mouse
      fibrosarcoma) ex vivo and the reduction of fibrosarcoma tumor size
      in vivo by nsPEF pulses up to 300 kV/cm and durations from 10 ns
      to 300 ns. Signs of apoptotic cell death comprise cell shrinkage,
      activation of caspases, persistent externalization of
      phosphatidylserine (PS) at the PM, and fragmentation of DNA (11).
      Apoptosis induction by nsPEF has also been observed for mammalian
      cancer cells in vitro (15).<br>
      <br>
      There have been several other interesting observations about the
      responses of cells and tissues to nsPEF pulses. First, EP markers
      such as propidium iodide (PI) and ethidium homodimer, whose uptake
      has been traditionally used to indicate the membrane integrity and
      permeability changes in the PM were reported to be taken up by
      cells only in very small amounts. However, we have noted that no
      measurement sensitivity was established and that uptake may be
      below the detection limit (16). Second, effects in the cell
      interior have been observed that have not generally been reported
      for conventional EP conditions. Calcium release from the
      endoplasmic reticulum, cytochrome-c release from mitochondria,
      phosphatidylserine translocation at the PM, and caspase activation
      are examples of such observed intracellular effects (11, 17-22),
      Those effects can be readily understood in terms of the supra-EP
      hypothesis (23-26) which leads to a different degree of EP as will
      be described in the present paper.<br>
      <br>
      The often stated motivation for the recent focus on nanosecond
      pulses is the low energy density that is delivered per pulse
      despite the much larger field than for IRE pulses. This argument
      appears misleading, however, since it is certainly not the
      dissipative energy that causes cell death, as is the case for RF
      tumor ablation, but a non-linear biophysical mechanism such as EP.
      It is arguably more important that nsPEF pulses lead to strong
      electric fields both inside and outside the cells and thereby
      significantly perturb organelle membranes in addition to the PM
      (17, 25).<br>
      <br>
      The consideration of both IRE and nsPEF pulses thus provides the
      tantalizing prospect of designing specific electric field pulse
      protocols and treatments that lead to different cell death
      mechanisms, for example necrosis with IRE pulses and apoptosis
      with nsPEF pulses. The ability to determine the cellular death
      mechanism by an appropriate choice of electric field parameters
      may seem like an unnecessary choice for a patient in urgent need
      of tumor treatment. Yet, the apoptotic cell death pathway may
      provide certain advantages. Specifically, if secondary necrosis
      can be avoided then it should be possible to bypass non-specific
      damage to nearby tissue due to e.g., inflammation and/or scarring.
      It might also be possible to avoid the tumor lysis syndrome
      resulting from massive tumor necrosis.<br>
      <br>
      As the cellular and tissue response to nsPEF pulses is so
      distinctively different from the response to IRE pulses, the
      object of the present paper is to seek an underlying mechanistic
      understanding of the tissue response to nsPEF pulses. This is
      achieved by using exactly the same tissue models as used
      previously for IRE pulses (4), for which we determine the local
      electric fields and currents in the treated tissue and then study
      the biophysical response in terms of pore densities and pore sizes
      that lead to cell permeability changes, as well as the resulting
      temperature change in the tissue model. Throughout, we attempt to
      make objective comparisons between responses to nsPEF pulses and
      the much longer and weaker IRE pulses.<br>
      <br>
      <b> Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The basic methods and tissue models are the same as used
      previously (4) only the electric field pulse waveforms are
      different. In this way we can straightforwardly compare the
      mechanistic response at the cellular and tissue level to IRE
      pulses that lead to necrotic cell death with nsPEF pulses that
      lead to apoptotic cell death. To facilitate understanding we have
      restated our methods here.<br>
      <br>
      As previously (4) we use the transport lattice (TL) method, which
      allows for a convenient description of electrical, chemical, and
      thermal behavior in a complex biological geometry that may contain
      tissue inhomogeneities and anisotropies. Basic features of the TL
      method have been presented elsewhere (23-25, 27-29). For the study
      of nanosecond pulses to treat solid tumors, we use two system
      models, a multicellular model of irregular cells and a tissue
      model, and consider their electrical and thermal responses to two
      representative nsPEF pulses. Each system model represents rabbit
      liver tissue but on a different spatial scale. Although
      experiments with nsPEF pulses on tumors have been performed for
      different cells and tissues, a liver tissue model is adopted here
      in order to compare the distinct features of tissue responses due
      to nsPEF pulses with those of IRE pulses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion and Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The treatment of solid tumors by nsPEF pulses leads to supra-EP at
      the PM, a universal mechanism by which only small nanometer-sized
      pores at large densities perforate cell membranes, and a strong
      interplay of conduction and displacement currents inside the cells
      and the interstitial space of the tissue. As a consequence, the
      cell interior is affected by intracellular electric fields that
      are almost as strong as the applied field strength. What is often
      neglected in the discussion of EP is the resulting exposure of the
      interior of the cell, i.e., both the intracellular electrolyte and
      the intracellular organelles, to an electric field. The
      inevitability of creating an intracellular field should address
      the magnitude of the intracellular field, which may vary from
      unimportant to tremendously important. It is therefore
      understandable that nsPEF pulses cause pronounced intracellular
      effects, which presumably are responsible for triggering a
      different cell death mechanism (apoptosis) than longer IRE pulses
      (necrosis). Supra-EP at the PM leads to a conductance change of
      the membrane that exceeds that of longer IRE pulses...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Treatment of cancer often involves uses of multiple therapeutic
      strategies with different mechanisms of action. In this study we
      investigated combinations of nanosecond pulsed electric fields
      (nsPEF) with low concentrations of gemcitabine on human oral
      cancer cells. Cells (Cal-27) were treated with pulse parameters
      (20 pulses, 100 ns in duration, intensities of 10, 30 and 60
      kV/cm) and then cultured in medium with 0.01 µg/ml gemcitabine.
      Proliferation, apoptosis/necrosis, invasion and morphology of
      those cells were examined using MTT, flow cytometry, clonogenics,
      transwell migration and TEM assay. Results show that combination
      treatments of gemcitabine and nsPEFs exhibited significant
      synergistic activities versus individual treatments for inhibiting
      oral cancer cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis and
      necrosis. However, there was no apparent synergism for cell
      invasion. By this we demonstrated synergistic inhibition of Cal-27
      cells in vitro by nsPEFs and gemcitabine. Synergistic behavior
      indicates that these two treatments have different sites of action
      and combination treatment allows reduced doses of gemcitabine and
      lower nsPEF conditions, which may provide better treatment for
      patients than either treatment alone while reducing systemic
      toxicities.<br>

      Deng, Kenneth Somers, and Karl H. Schoenbach. <br>
      <br>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The application of pulsed electric fields to cells is extended to
      include nonthermal pulses with shorter durations (10-300 ns),
      higher electric fields (=350 kV/cm), higher power (gigawatts), and
      distinct effects (nsPEF) compared to classical electroporation.
      Here we define effects and explore potential application for nsPEF
      in biology and medicine. As the pulse duration is decreased below
      the plasma membrane charging time constant, plasma membrane
      effects decrease and intracellular effects predominate. NsPEFs
      induced apoptosis and caspase activation that was
      calcium-dependent (Jurkat cells) and calcium-independent (HL-60
      and Jurkat cells). In mouse B10-2 fibrosarcoma tumors, nsPEFs
      induced caspase activation and DNA fragmentation ex vivo, and
      reduced tumor size in vivo. With conditions below thresholds for
      classical electroporation and apoptosis, nsPEF induced calcium
      release from intracellular stores and subsequent calcium influx
      through store-operated channels in the plasma membrane that
      mimicked purinergic receptor-mediated calcium mobilization. When
      nsPEF were applied after classical electroporation pulses, GFP
      reporter gene expression was enhanced above that observed for
      classical electroporation. These findings indicate that nsPEF
      extend classical electroporation to include events that primarily
      affect intracellular structures and functions. Potential
      applications for nsPEF include inducing apoptosis in cells and
      tumors, probing signal transduction mechanisms that determine cell
      fate, and enhancing gene expression.<br>

      bacterial counts was achieved at field strength of 107 V m-1 with
      a train of 500 successive pulses of 60 × 10-9 s. Incubation of
      germs after treatment with propidium iodide showed that membrane
      permeabilization was reversible. Possible protein changes of
      surviving bacteria were checked to assess potential phenotypical
      changes using two-dimensional electrophoresis. In our study, after
      40 generations, only UniProt #P39187 was up-regulated with P =
      0·05 compared with the control and corresponded to the
      uncharacterized protein YtfJ. Antibiograms were used to check
      whether or not the pattern of cultivable bacteria after nsPEF
      deliveries changed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The results tend to show that nsPEFs are able to inactivate
      bacteria and have probably no serious impact in E. coli protein
      patterns.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Significance and Impact of the Study</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The use of nsPEF is a safe promising new nonthermal method for
      bacterial inactivation in the food processing and environmental
      industry.<br>

      </b><b> </b>Methods for a new, drug-free therapy for treating
      solid skin tumors through the application of nanosecond pulsed

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] Electric fields have been employed in several different
      types of cancer therapy. Some of these involve radio frequency or
      microwave devices that heat the tumor to greater than 43 °C to
      kill the cells via hyperthermia (K.K.Tanabe, S.A.Curley, G.D.Dodd,
      A.E.Siperstein, S.N.Goldberg (2004) Cancer. 100:641-650;
      D.Haemmerich, P.F.Laeseke (2005) Int. J. Hyperthermia. 21 :
      755-760). Others use pulsed electric fields to permeabilize the
      tumor cells to allow the introduction of toxic drugs or DNA
      (M.L.Lucas, R.Heller (2003) DNA Cell Biol. 22:755-763; Y.Kubota,
      Y.Tomita, M.Tsukigi, H.Kurachi, T.Motoyama, L.M.Mir (2005)
      Melanoma Res. 15:133-134; A.Gothelf, L.M.Mir, J.Gehl (2003) Cancer
      Treat.Rev. 29:371-387). Previous studies have shown that
      fibrosarcoma tumors, treated in situ with nanosecond pulsed
      electric fields, exhibited a reduced growth rate compared to
      control tumors in the same animal (S.J.Beebe, P.Fox, LJ.Rec,
      K.Somers, R.H.Stark, K.H.Schoenbach (2002) IEEE Transactions on
      Plasma Science. 30:286-292). [0002] The main characteristics of
      nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) are their low energy
      that leads to very little heat production and their ability to
      penetrate into the cell to permeabilize intracellular organelles
      (K.H.Schoenbach, S. J.Beebe, E.S.Buescher (2001)
      Bioelectromagnetics. 22:440-448; E.S.Buescher, K.H.Schoenbach
      (2003) IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation.
      10:788-794) and release calcium (P.T. Vernier, Y.H.Sun, L.Marcu,

      from the endoplasmic reticulum (J.A. White et al. (2004)
      J.Biol.Chem). They provide a new approach for physically targeting
      intracellular organelles with many applications, including the
      initiation of apoptosis in cultured cells (S.J.Beebe, P.M.Fox,
      L.J.Rec, EX. Willis, K.H.Schoenbach (2003) FASEB J. 17:1493-1495;

      Meas. 25: 1077-1093) and tumors (S.J.Beebe et al. (2002) IEEE
      Transactions on Plasma Science) enhancement of gene transfection
      efficiency (S.J.Beebe et al. (2003) DNA Cell Biol; SJ.Beebe et al.
      (2004) Physiol Meas.) and reducing tumor growth (S.J.Beebe et al.
      (2002) IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science).<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The use of electric fields on biological cells to rupture
      the cell membrane can lead to cell death via necrosis, a
      nonphysiological type of cell destruction, while the use of nsPEFs
      on biological cells to permeabilize intracellular organelles can
      initiate cell death via apoptosis. When treating biological cells
      within tissue in situ, being able to initiate cell death via
      apoptosis would allow the destruction of specific undesired cells
      in situ without engendering the non-specific damage to surrounding
      or nearby tissue in the body due to inflammation and scarring that
      is normally observed with necrosis. Investigations of the effects
      of ultrashort, high intensity pulsed electric fields or nanosecond
      pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) on mammalian cells have
      demonstrated distinct differences on cell structure and function
      compared to classical plasma membrane electroporation. It was
      previously demonstrated that nsPEF invoked signal transduction
      mechanisms that initiate apoptosis cascades in several human cell
      lines including HL-60 cells (Beebe, S. J., et al. (2002) IEEE
      Trans. Plasma ScL 30, 286-292; Beebe, SJ., et al. (2003) FASEB J.
      17, 1493-1495).<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;[0004] The efficacy of this nsPEF treatment is believed to
      depend on two separate electric field parameters: pulse duration
      and amplitude. The effect of pulse duration can be understood by
      considering the process of membrane charging when the cell is
      placed in an electric field. Ions in the cell interior will
      respond to the electric field by moving in the field direction and
      charging the highly resistive membrane until they experience no
      further force. By definition this will only occur when their
      redistribution establishes an equal and opposite field so that the
      net electric field in the cell interior is zero. However this
      redistribution takes a certain amount of time that is
      characterized by the charging time constant of the plasma
      membrane, typically in the 0.1 to 1 microsecond range. If the
      nsPEF is shorter than this charging time, the interior charges
      will not have sufficient time to redistribute to counteract the
      imposed field and it will penetrate into the cell and charge every
      organelle membrane for a duration which is dependent on both the
      charging time constant of the cell's plasma membrane as well as
      that of the organelle membrane (K.H.Schoenbach, R.P.Joshi,
      J.F.Kolb, N.Chen, M.Stacey, P.F.BIackmore,E.S.Buescher, S.J.Beebe
      (2004) Proc. IEEE. 92:1122- 1137).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A second critical nsPEF parameter is the amplitude of the
      pulse. Both the force exerted on charges and the electroporation
      of lipid membranes depend on the strength of the electric field.
      When the electric field across a cellular membrane exceeds about 1
      volt (2 kV/cm for a cell 10 µm in diameter), water-filled pores
      form in the membrane's lipid bilayer and the size and lifetime of
      these pores are dependent on the strength and duration of the
      electric field pulse. For amplitudes exceeding 2 kV/cm and pulse
      durations in the millisecond range, large pores form resulting in
      electroporation of the membrane that has been used to introduce
      normally impermeant anticancer drugs into targeted tissues
      (M.L.Lucas et al (2003) DNA Cell Biol.; Y.Kubota et al (2005)
      Melanoma Res.; A.Gothelf et al (2003) Cancer Treat.Rev.;
      J.Teissie, M.Golzio, M.P.Rols (2005) Biochim.Biophys.Acta
      1724:270-280). For these long pulses, the pulse amplitude is
      limited to about 2 kV/cm to avoid thermal effects. Since heating
      is proportional to pulse duration and the square of the field
      strength, the much shorter pulses in the nanosecond range can have
      a higher field strength while delivering the same low level of
      thermal energy to the tissue. A 20-fold higher field strength of
      40 kV/cm can be employed to generate structural changes in the
      plasma membrane that result in a smaller electrical barrier as
      well as higher voltage gradients across cellular organelles for
      die duration of the pulse (Q.Hu, S.Viswanadham, R.PJoshi,
      K.H.Schoenbach, SJ.Beebe, P.F.Blackmore (2005) Phys.Rev.E
      Stat.Nonlin.Soß.Matter Phys.7?:031914-l-0319l4-9). A typical tumor
      cell nucleus measuring 10 µm in diameter will experience a voltage
      gradient of roughly 40 V across its diameter during each pulse.
      This electric field is large enough to cause electrodeformation
      (R.PJoshi, Q.Hu, K.H.Schoenbach, H.P.Hjalmarson (2002) Phys.Rev.E
      Stat.Nonlin.Soft.Matter Phys. 65:021913).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Previous studies provided direct evidence for cellular DNA
      as a direct or indirect target of nsPEF. Using a comet assay,
      Stacey, et al. (M.Stacey, J.Stickley, P.Fox, V.Statler,
      K.Schoenbach, SJ.Beebe, S.Buescher (2003) Mutat.Res. 542:65-75)
      found that ten 60 ns pulses of 60 kV/cm caused a rapid 2.6-fold
      increase in the mean image length of DNA electrophoresis tracks in
      Jurkat cell extracts and a 1.6-fold increase in the comet assay
      from HL60 cell extracts. In both cases this was a very significant
      change (p&lt;0.001). This elongation in DNA electrophoresis tracks
      is normally interpreted to indicate fragmentation of the DNA into
      smaller pieces that is associated with apoptotic cell death. An
      indication of changes in the DNA following nsPEF treatment comes
      from images of the nucleus labeled with acridine orange, a vital
      fluorescent dye that intercalates into DNA and RNA, Chen et al.
      (N.Chen, K.H.Schoenbach, J.F.Kolb, S.RJames, A.L.Garner, J.Yang,
      R.PJoshi, SJ.Beebe (2004) Biochem.Biophys.Res.Commun.
      317:421-427). A single 10 ns pulse of 26 kV/cm caused a dramatic
      decrease in fluorescence intensity in the nucleus evident as early
      as 5 min after the pulse. This change could be due to an outflow
      of DNA or to conformational changes in the DNA. [0007] The ability
      to selectively modify specific cells in ways that lead to
      apoptosis could provide a new method for the selective destruction
      of undesired tissue (e.g., cancer cells, fat cells or cartilage
      cells) while minimizing side effects on surrounding tissue. An
      electrical method of treatment that results, not only in tumor
      growth inhibition, but in complete tumor regression, without
      hyperthermia, drugs, or significant side effects, would be a great
      advancement in the field of cancer therapy and other in situ
      therapies. These and various other needs are addressed, at least
      in part, by one or more embodiments of the present invention.<br>

      Nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) parameters for destroying
      tumors with a single treatment are described. A nsPEF generator
      may be used with an electrode assembly to apply the pulses to one
      or more tumors where the parameters for the nsPEF are optimized
      for treating such tumors. The system may also be used to treat
      tumors on or within internal organs by using an expandable bipolar
      electrode assembly that can be imaged by ultrasound and can
      penetrate, e.g., the stomach, intestine or bowel wall, etc. and be
      positioned in or around the tumor on an internal organ while being
      guided by an operator who visualizes its position with ultrasound
      imaging. It utilizes an electrode assembly that extends down an
      internal cavity in the endoscope to allow the operator to spread
      the electrodes for pulse delivery of a nanosecond pulsed electric
      field (nsPEF) to the tumor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This application is directed to systems and methods for
      treating tumors on internal organs that have been identified using
      endoscopic ultrasound by precisely positioning a pulsed field
      delivery device on or in the tumor guided by ultrasound imaging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines endoscopy and
      ultrasound in order to obtain images and information about the
      digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs. Endoscopy
      refers to the procedure of inserting a long flexible tube via the
      mouth or the rectum to visualize the digestive tract, whereas
      ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of
      the organs and structures inside the body such as ovaries, uterus,
      liver, gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In EUS a small ultrasound transducer is installed on the
      tip of the endoscope. By inserting the endoscope through the
      esophagus into the stomach, the ultrasound transducer can be
      placed against the inner surface of the stomach or
      gastrointestinal tract so that sound waves can be beamed through
      the stomach wall to obtain high quality ultrasound images of the
      organs on the other side of the stomach wall such as the kidney,
      pancreas and liver. Because of the proximity of the EUS transducer
      to the organ(s) of interest, the images obtained are frequently
      more accurate and more detailed than the ones obtained by
      traditional ultrasound where the transducer in placed on the skin.
      Tumors on internal organs have ultrasound reflection properties
      that are different from the organ so that they can be easily
      detected with EUS. An example of EUS is shown and described in
      U.S. Pat. 7,318,806, which is incorporated herein by reference in
      its entirety. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] Some of these ultrasound imaging endoscopes have been
      designed with an open channel down the center into which a fine
      needle aspirator or other instruments can be inserted to allow the
      sampling of tumor tissue by poking through the stomach wall and
      into the tumor tissue for aspiration. The aspirated tissue sample
      can then be stained and observed by a pathologist to obtain an
      immediate diagnosis of malignancy.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) have been found
      to trigger both necrosis and apoptosis in skin tumors. Treatment
      with nsPEF independently initiates the process of apoptosis within
      the tumor cells themselves causing the tumor to slowly self-
      destruct without requiring toxic drugs or permanent
      p[epsilon]rmeabi[iota]ization. In addition to initiating apoptosis
      in the tumor cells, nanosecond pulsed electric fields halt blood
      flow in the capillaries feeding it which in turn reduces blood
      flow to the tumor and activation of apoptosis pathways causing the
      tumor to slowly shrink and disappear within an average of 47 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An example of nsPEF is shown and described in U.S. Pat.
      6,326,177, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;[0008] Various devices utilizing ElTS are known yet they are
      generally insufficient to treat tumors accessible via endoscopic
      access utilizing nsPEF. Accordingly, there exists a need for
      methods and devices which are efficacious and safe in facilitating
      the treatment of tumors in patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] In delivering nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) to
      a region of tissue. such as a tumor, it is possible to precisely
      control the number of pulses delivered as well as the frequency of
      those pulses to deliver electrotherapy via an electrode assembly
      designed to draw tissue into a recessed cavity in order to
      immobilize the tissue and position the electrodes firmly against
      or within the tissue. The recessed cavity may be varied in its
      size to match a size of any particular rumor to be treated such
      that the treated tumor may be received within the cavity in close
      proximity or in direct contact against the electrodes. <br>
      <br>
      [0010] The electrode assembly may be configured into a variety of
      configurations for delivering electrotherapy and may also utilize
      suction to fix in place the tissue being treated. For example, six
      (6) spaced apart planar electrodes may be positioned
      circumferentially about the recessed cavity. In other variations,
      the electrode assembly may comprise a support member having a pair
      of "U"-shaped planar electrodes disposed on the periphery of the
      recessed cavity. Other variations may include a pair of spaced
      apart parallel plate electrodes while other variations may include
      a plurality of needle electrodes which are mounted at the base of
      a back plate to control the penetration depth of the tissue as it
      it&gt; sucked into the recessed cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The back plate of each recessed cavity may have multiple
      apertures, such as on the order of 100 [mu]m in diameter. An air
      pump, e.g., an oscillating diaphragm air pump or other suction
      source, is then coupled to the support member on the side of the
      base w all support opposite the recessed cavity and is used to
      generate a mild suction that pulls the tissue to be treated into
      the cup-like volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In use, the support member may Miction or draw in tissue to
      be treated from various regions of the body into the recessed
      cavity into contact or proximity to the electrodes. Drawing in the
      tissue may further facilitate tissue treatment by clearly defining
      the treatment area to be treated for the operator. When nsPEF is
      applied to a tissue region such as a tumor, if a [iota]arge
      resistance between the electrode and the tumor restricts current
      flow (such as the presence of the stratum corneitm in skin), the
      field may not pass into the tumor effectively. Thus it may be
      desirable to apply, in one example, a minimum current of 20 A
      (although lower currents may be applied if so desired) that may
      pass through the tumor during nsPEF application to have a desired
      effect of triggering tumor apoptosis. In order to prevent damage
      to tissues surrounding the tumor, the nsPEF therapy may be applied
      at a pulse frequency that will not heat the tissue above, e.g.. 40
      &lt;0&gt;C (the minimum temperature for hyperthermia effects).
      Therapy \\ ith nsPEF treatment is thus able to initiate apoptosis
      within the tumor cells without raising the temperature more than a
      few degrees so as to prevent harm to surrounding tissues from heat
      transfer. In one example, if 100 ns pulses were applied, the
      frequency of the applied pulses is desirably 7 pulses per second
      (Hz) or lower to prevent damage to surrounding tissues.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] With the electrode assemblies described herein, treatment
      of tissue regions such as skin tumors may be effected by applying
      nsPEF while specifying various parameters. For instance, one or
      all of the following parameters may be adjusted to provide optimal
      treatment of tissue to effect tumor apoptosis: ( 1) pulse
      amplitude (kV'cm); (2) pulse duration (ns); (3) pulse application
      frequency (Hz); and/or (4) pulse number applied. <br>
      <br>
      [0014] Because the value of these parameters may vary widely over
      a number of ranges, it has been determined that particular ranges
      may be applied for effecting optimal tissue treatment which may
      effect tumor apoptosis in as few as a single treatment. In varying
      pulse amplitude, an applied amplitude as low as, e.g., 20
      kV/&lt;'&gt;cm, may be sufficient for initiating an apoptotic
      response in the treated tissue. The pulse amplitude may, of
      course, be increased from 20 kV/cm, e.g., up to 40 kV/'cm or
      greater. However, an applied amplitude of at least, e.g., 30 kV/cm
      or greater, may be applied for optimal response in the treated
      tissue, In varying pulse duration, durations in the range of.
      e.g., 50-900 ns, may be highly effective although shorter
      durations may be applied if the number of pulses is increased
      exponentially. In varying pulse application frequency, frequencies
      up to 7 Hz may be applied with 100 ns pulses without heating
      surrounding tissues to hyperthermic levels. Because tissue heating
      may be dependent on pulse width multiplied by the frequency of
      application, shorter pulses may be applied at proportionately
      higher frequencies with similar heat generation. In varying the
      number of pulses applied, the pulse number determines the total
      energy applied to the tissue region. Generally, applying a minimum
      pulse number of 600 pulses may result in complete remission of
      tumors. In one example, nsPEF therapy having a pulse duration of
      100 ns may be applied over a range of, e.g., 1000-2000 pulses, to
      effectively treat the tissue region. <br>
      <br>
      [0015] Given the range of parameters, a relationship between these
      parameters has been correlated to determine a minimum number of
      electrical pulses which may effectively treat a tissue region,
      e.g., a tumor, with a single treatment of nsPEF therapy to cause
      complete apoptosis in the tumor tissue. Generally, the number of
      electrical pulses increases exponentially as the pulse duration is
      shortened. The correlation for a given pulse duration or width and
      number of pulses, N, to effectuate complete tumor remission after
      a single treatment may be described in the following equation:<br>
      N = 28.714 e -0026f<br>
      where, N = minimum number of pulses to cause tumor apoptosis with
      a single treatment t = pulse duration (in nanoseconds)<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This non-linear dependence of pulse number on pulse width
      suggests that the effectiveness of the nsPEF therapy described
      herein is not simply due to energy delivery to the tumor as that
      is linearly proportional to N times t given a constant voltage and
      current.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one particular variation, an elongate instrument which
      may be delivered via or through an endoscopic device may utilize
      any one or more of the nsPEF parameters described herein for tumor
      treatment. The endoscopic device, particularly an EUS device. may
      be used to image or locate a tissue region to be treated.
      Ultrasound imaging may be particularly useful in locating one or
      more tumors for treatment although conventional endoscopic imaging
      may also be utilized. With the targeted tissue region located
      within the body, the nsPEF instrument may be positioned or
      advanced within one or more working channels in the endoscope
      until a tapered piercing end of the nsPEF instrument is projected
      from a distal end of the endoscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The nsPEF instrument may also have an expandable or re
      configurable bipolar electrode assembly that may extend or
      reposition itself into a deployed profile. With the electrode
      assembly deployed, the piercing tip may be penetrated into or
      through the tissue to be treated (such as the tumor) while under
      the guidance of ultrasound imaging from the endoscope for
      desirably positioning the instrument. The outer reference
      electrodes may be actuated by the operator to reconfigure the
      electrodes for pulse delivery and/or to retract them for insertion
      and/ or withdrawal from the patient. Moreover, the electrodes may
      be coupled via an electrical cable having at least two conductors
      which may also extend through the endoscope or electrode assembly
      to conduct the pulsed electric fields to the distal end effector.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The electrode assembly may be advanced into the tissue to
      be treated until the deployed outer electrodes are positioned on
      or against a surface of the tumor or tissue region. The deployed
      outer electrodes may be spread or reconfigured into a variety of
      shapes, e.g.. hemi -circular plate configuration. Moreover, to
      facilitate contact between the electrode assembly and the tissue
      surface of the targeted tumor, suction may be applied through,
      e.g., a working channel either through the endoscope, electrode
      assembly, or both for drawing the tumor into apposition against
      the electrode assembly. Other mechanisms such as tissue graspers
      may also be used. <br>
      <br>
      [0020] In other variations, the electrode assembly may be
      configured to project distally from the shaft of the nsPEF
      instrument to surround the tissue to be treated, such as a tumor.
      Various numbers of conductive needles may be utilized such that
      the tumor to be treated is surrounded by the needle array and the
      electric field created between the needles may be uniformly
      applied to the tumor. These instruments may utilize any of the
      nsPEF parameters as described herein to effectively treat the
      tissue with, e.g., a single treatment of nsPEF therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Follow ing nanosecond pulse application, the treatment
      instrument may be withdrawn from the tumor and the outer
      electrodes may be reconfigured back to their original low profile
      configuration for retraction back into the endoscope... <br>

      Methods for forming activated platelet gels using nsPEF's and
      applying the activated gels to wounds, such as heart tissue after
      myocardial infarction. The platelets are activated by applying at
      least one nsPEF with a duration between about 10 picoseconds to 1
      microsecond and electrical field strengths between about 10 kV/cm
      and 350 kV/cm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Electric fields can be used to manipulate cell function in
      a variety of ways. One specific cell mechanism that can be
      affected by electric fields is calcium mobilization within a cell.
      Calcium signaling, an important cell function, is responsible for
      a variety of cellular responses and actions. The release of
      internally stored calcium can stimulate responses to agonists,
      activate growth and respiration, cause the secretion of
      neurotransmitters, activate transcription mechanisms, cause the
      release of a variety of hormones, produce muscle contractions, and
      initiate release of key factors in the apoptosis pathway
      (Berridge, M. J., Bootman, M. D., Lipp, P. (1998) Nature. 395,
      645-648). This calcium mobilization also triggers the influx of
      calcium from the external medium into the cell as a means of
      further propagating calcium signals and also replenishing depleted
      pools of calcium. Electric fields can be used to manipulate the
      movement of ions, such as calcium, in order to study calcium
      signaling.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One application of this calcium increase is to activate
      platelets and cause them to aggregate in vitro and in vivo.
      Platelet activation/aggregation is important for preventing blood
      loss during traumatic injury or surgery by forming a hemostatic
      plug at the site of injury. At present, treatment with thrombin,
      known to increase intracellular calcium in human platelets, is
      used to control slow bleeding at sites of injury. Thrombin
      treatment includes the topical application of bovine or
      recombinant thrombin, or the use of platelet gels in which
      autologous platelets are treated with bovine thrombin and added to
      the surgical site (Brissett and Hom (2003) Curr. Opin.
      Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surgery 11, 245-250; Man et al., (2001)
      Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 107, 229-237; Saltz (2001) Plast. Reconstr.
      Surg. 107, 238-239; Bhanot and Alex (2002) Facial Plast. Surg. 18,
      27-33). However, the use of animal products could cause allergic
      reactions or cause possible contamination of platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) with infectious agents. The use of recombinant thrombin or a
      peptide that mimics thrombin action could be used as an
      alternative to animal-derived thrombin; however, this type of
      treatment is expensive and could also give rise to allergic
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Since calcium signaling plays such an important role in so
      many cellular functions, there remains a need to further examine
      this signaling mechanism and explore ways to manipulate calcium
      signaling pathways for therapeutic purposes. For example, there is
      a need to develop methods of activating calcium-mediated cell
      functions, including aggregation of human platelets, for
      therapeutic purposes, such as wound healing. These and various
      other needs are addressed, at least in part, by one or more
      embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] One or more aspects of the invention provide a method for
      inducing calcium mobilization in a cell. The method comprises
      applying at least one electrical pulse to one or more cells,
      whereby calcium is mobilized in the cells. According to at least
      one embodiment, the electrical pulse comprises at least one
      nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF). The at least one nsPEF
      has a pulse duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more
      than about 1 microsecond and an electric field strength of at
      least about 10 kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. In one or
      more embodiments of the invention, calcium influx into the cells
      occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one or more aspects of the invention, the cells are
      human platelets, whereby activation and aggregation of the
      platelets is induced.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The invention also provides a method for increasing
      intracellular calcium in cells comprising applying at least one
      nsPEF to the cells, whereby intracellular calcium in the cells is
      increased. The at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of at least
      about 100 picoseconds and no more than about 1 microsecond and an
      electric field strength of at least about 10 kV/cm and no more
      than about 350 kV/cm. In one or more embodiments, the cells are
      human platelets, whereby activation and aggregation of the
      platelets is induced.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Also provided in the invention is a method for activating
      and aggregating human platelets comprising applying at least one
      nsPEF to the platelets, whereby the platelets are activated and
      induced to form aggregates. The at least one nsPEF has a pulse
      duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more than about
      1 microsecond and an electric field strength of at least about 10
      kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. In one aspect, the at
      least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of about 10 nanoseconds and
      an electric field strength of about 125 kV/cm. In another aspect,
      the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of about 60
      nanoseconds and an electric field strength of about 30 kV/cm. In
      another embodiment, the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of
      300 nanoseconds and an electric field strength of 30 kV/cm. The
      platelets may be suspended in a medium or included in a tissue or
      in a natural or synthetic tissue repair matrix, such as but not
      limited to bioresorbable collagen scaffold or matrix, or
      incorporated into bandage or wound closure devices. In other
      embodiments, activated platelets are applied or incorporated into
      bandages or sutures that may be applied to a wound.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The invention also provides a method of treating an injury,
      trauma, or the loss of blood in a subject, comprising applying at
      least one nsPEF to autologous platelets, whereby the platelets are
      activated and induced to form aggregates. The activated and
      aggregated platelets are then applied to the site of injury,
      trauma, or blood loss. The at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration
      of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more than about 1
      microsecond and an electric field strength of at least about 10
      kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. The blood loss in a
      subject may be related to a bleeding disorder resulting from
      inactive platelets or low platelet counts. The blood loss may also
      be related to a platelet disorder such as congenital
      afibrinogenemia, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, gray platelet
      syndrome, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] As a further embodiment for the preparation of activated
      platelet aggregations, at least another aspect of the invention
      provides a method for preparing platelet gels comprising human
      platelets comprising applying at least one nsPEF to the platelets,
      whereby the platelets are activated. The at least one nsPEF has a
      pulse duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more than
      about 1 microsecond and an electric field strength of at least
      about 10 kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. In one aspect,
      the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of about 10
      nanoseconds and an electric field strength of about 125 kV/cm. In
      another aspect, the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of
      about 60 nanoseconds and an electric field strength of about 30
      kV/cm. In another embodiment, the at least one nsPEF has a pulse
      duration of 300 nanoseconds and an electric field strength of 30
      kV/cm. The platelets may be suspended in a medium or included in a
      tissue or in a natural or synthetic tissue repair matrix, such as
      but not limited to bioresorbable collagen scaffold or matrix, or
      incorporated into a bandage or wound closure devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] At least another aspect of the invention provides a method
      for treating an injury, trauma, or the loss of blood in a subject,
      comprising applying platelets at or near the site of injury,
      trauma, or blood loss, whereby the platelets are activated and
      induced to form gels through application of at least one nsPEF.
      The at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of at least about 100
      picoseconds and no more than about 1 microsecond and an electric
      field strength of at least about 10 kV/cm and no more than about
      350 kV/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] At least another aspect of the invention provides a method
      for treating and/or preventing infection at the site of an injury,
      trauma, or the loss of blood in a subject, comprising applying
      platelets at the site of injury, trauma, or blood loss, whereby
      the platelets are activated and induced to form gels through
      application of at least one nsPEF. The at least one nsPEF has a
      pulse duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more than
      about 1 microsecond and an electric field strength of at least
      about 10 kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. In another
      embodiment, the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of 300
      nanoseconds and an electric field strength of 30 kV/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] At least another aspect of the invention provides a method
      for altering the acute changes in systolic and diastolic pressures
      in the left ventricle of the heart after an ischemic event, such
      as ischemia-reperfusion, whereby the platelets are activated and
      induced to form gels through application of at least one nsPEF and
      injected into the myocardial tissue. The at least one nsPEF has a
      pulse duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more than

      <br>
      [0014] At least another aspect of the invention envisions the
      application of activated platelets to the surface of the heart,
      whereby the platelets are activated and induced to form gels
      through application of at least one nsPEF. The at least one nsPEF
      has a pulse duration of at least about 100 picoseconds and no more

      least about 10 kV/cm and no more than about 350 kV/cm. In another
      embodiment, the at least one nsPEF has a pulse duration of 300
      nanoseconds and an electric field strength of 30 kV/cm.<br>
