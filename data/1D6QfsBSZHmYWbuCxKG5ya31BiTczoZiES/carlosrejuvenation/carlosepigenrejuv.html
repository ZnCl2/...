      The black mouse on the screen sprawls on its belly, back hunched,
      blinking but otherwise motionless. Its organs are failing. It
      appears to be days away from death. It has progeria, a disease of
      accelerated aging, caused by a genetic mutation. It is only three
      months old.<br>
      <br>
      I am in the laboratory of Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte, a Spaniard
      who works at the Gene Expression Laboratory at San Diego’s Salk
      Institute for Biological Studies, and who next shows me something
      hard to believe. It’s the same mouse, lively and active, after
      being treated with an age-reversal mixture. “It completely
      rejuvenates,” Izpisúa Belmonte tells me with a mischievous grin.
      “If you look inside, obviously, all the organs, all the cells are
      younger.”<br>
      <br>
      Izpisúa Belmonte, a shrewd and soft-spoken scientist, has access
      to an inconceivable power. These mice, it seems, have sipped from
      a fountain of youth. Izpisúa Belmonte can rejuvenate aging, dying
      animals. He can rewind time. But just as quickly as he blows my
      mind, he puts a damper on the excitement. So potent was the
      rejuvenating treatment used on the mice that they either died
      after three or four days from cell malfunction or developed tumors
      that killed them later. An overdose of youth, you could call it.<br>
      <br>
      The powerful tool that the researchers applied to the mouse is
      called “reprogramming.” It’s a way to reset the body’s so-called
      epigenetic marks: chemical switches in a cell that determine which
      of its genes are turned on and which are off. Er3ase these marks
      and a cell can forget if it was ever a skin or a bone cell, and
      revert to a much more primitive, embryonic state. The technique is
      frequently used by laboratories to manufacture stem cells. But
      Izpisúa Belmonte is in a vanguard of scientists who want to apply
      reprogramming to whole animals and, if they can control it
      precisely, to human bodies.<br>
      <br>
      Izpisúa Belmonte believes epigenetic reprogramming may prove to be
      an “elixir of life” that will extend human life span
      significantly. Life expectancy has increased more than twofold in
      the developed world over the past two centuries. Thanks to
      childhood vaccines, seat belts, and so on, more people than ever
      reach natural old age. But there is a limit to how long anyone
      lives, which Izpisúa Belmonte says is because our bodies wear down
      through inevitable decay and deterioration. “Aging,” he writes,
      “is nothing other than molecular aberrations that occur at the
      cellular level.” It is, he says, a war with entropy that no
      individual has ever won.<br>
      <br>
      “I think the kid that will be living to 130 is already with us. He
      has already been born. I’m convinced.”<br>
      <br>
      But each generation brings new possibilities, as the epigenome
      gets reset during reproduction when a new embryo is formed.
      Cloning takes advantage of reprogramming, too: a calf cloned from
      an adult bull contains the same DNA as the parent, just refreshed.
      In both cases, the offspring is born without the accumulated
      “aberrations” that Izpisúa Belmonte refers to.<br>
      <br>
      What Izpisúa Belmonte is proposing is to go one step better still,
      and reverse aging-related aberrations without having to create a
      new individual. Among these are changes to our epigenetic
      marks—chemical groups called histones and methylation marks, which
      wrap around a cell’s DNA and function as on/off switches for
      genes. The accumulation of these changes causes the cells to
      function less efficiently as we get older, and some scientists,
      Izpisúa Belmonte included, think they could be part of why we age
      in the first place. If so, then reversing these epigenetic changes
      through reprogramming may enable us to turn back aging itself.<br>
      <br>
      Izpisúa Belmonte cautions that epigenetic tweaks won’t “make you
      live forever,” but they might delay your expiration date. As he
      sees it, there is no reason to think we cannot extend human life
      span by another 30 to 50 years, at least. “I think the kid that
      will be living to 130 is already with us,” Izpisúa Belmonte says.
      “He has already been born. I’m convinced.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Youth factors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The treatment Izpisúa Belmonte gave his mice is based on a
      Nobel-winning discovery by the Japanese stem-cell scientist Shinya
      Yamanaka. Starting in 2006, Yamanaka demonstrated how adding just
      four proteins to human adult cells could reprogram them so that
      they look and act like those in a newly formed embryo. These
      proteins, called the Yamanaka factors, function by wiping clean
      the epigenetic marks in a cell, giving it a fresh start.<br>
      <br>
      “He went backwards in time,” Izpisúa Belmonte says. All the
      methylation marks, those epigenetic switches, “are erased,” he
      adds. “Then you’re starting life again.” Even skin cells from
      centenarians, scientists have found, can be rewound to a
      primitive, youthful state. The artificially reprogrammed cells are
      called induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPSCs. Like the stem
      cells in embryos, they can then turn into any kind of body
      cell—skin, bone, muscle, and so on—if given the right chemical
      signals.<br>
      <br>
      To many scientists, Yamanaka’s discovery was promising mainly as a
      way to manufacture replacement tissue for use in new types of
      transplant treatments. In Japan, researchers began an effort to
      reprogram cells from a Japanese woman in her 80s with a blinding
      disease, macular degeneration. They were able to take a sample of
      her cells, return them to an embryonic state with Yamanaka’s
      factors, and then direct them to become retinal cells. In 2014,
      the woman became the first person to receive a transplant of such
      lab-made tissue. It didn’t make her vision sharper, but she did
      report it as being “brighter,” and it stopped deteriorating.<br>
      <br>
      Before then, though, researchers at the Spanish National Cancer
      Research Centre had already taken the technology in a new
      direction when they studied mice whose genomes harbored extra
      copies of the Yamanaka factors. Turning these on, they
      demonstrated that cell reprogramming could actually occur inside
      an adult animal body, not only in a laboratory dish.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment suggested an entirely new form of medicine. You
      could potentially rejuvenate a person’s entire body. But it also
      underscored the dangers. Clear away too many of the methylation
      marks and other footprints of the epigenome and “your cells
      basically lose their identity,” says Pradeep Reddy, a staff
      researcher at Salk who worked on these experiments with Izpisúa
      Belmonte. “You are erasing their memory.” These cellular blank
      slates can grow into a mature, functioning cell, or into one that
      never develops the ability to perform its designated task. It can
      also become a cancer cell.<br>
      <br>
      That’s why the mice I saw in Izpisúa Belmonte’s lab were prone to
      sprouting tumors. It proved that cellular reprogramming had indeed
      occurred inside their bodies, but the results were usually fatal.<br>
      <br>
      Izpisúa Belmonte believed there might be a way to give mice a less
      lethal dose of reprogramming. He was inspired by salamanders,
      which can regrow an arm or tail. Researchers have yet to determine
      exactly how amphibians do this, but one theory is that it happens
      through a process of epigenetic resetting similar to what the
      Yamanaka factors achieve, though more limited in scope. With
      salamanders, their cells “just go back a little bit” in time,
      Izpisúa Belmonte says.<br>
      <br>
      Could the same thing be done to an entire animal? Could it be
      rejuvenated just enough?<br>
      <br>
      In 2016, the team devised a way to partially rewind the cells in
      mice with progeria. They genetically modified the mice to produce
      the Yamanaka factors in their bodies, just as the Spanish
      researchers had done; but this time, the mice would produce those
      factors only when given an antibiotic, doxycycline.<br>
      <br>
      In Izpisúa Belmonte’s lab, some mice were allowed to drink water
      containing doxycycline continuously. In another experiment, others
      got it just for two days out of every seven. “When you give them …
      doxycycline, expression of the genes starts,” explains Reddy. “The
      moment you remove it, the expression of the genes stops. You can
      easily turn it on or off.”<br>
      <br>
      The mice that drank the most, like the one Izpisúa Belmonte showed
      me, quickly died. But the mice that drank a limited dose did not
      develop tumors. Instead, they became more physically robust, their
      kidneys and spleens worked better, and their hearts pumped harder.<br>
      <br>
      In all, the treated mice also lived 30% longer than their
      littermates. “That was the benefit,” Izpisúa Belmonte says. “We
      don’t kill the mouse. We don’t generate tumors, but we have our
      rejuvenation.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fountain of youth</b><br>
      <br>
      When Izpisúa Belmonte published his report in the journal Cell,
      describing the rejuvenated mice, it seemed to some as if Ponce de
      Leon had finally spotted the fountain of youth. “I think Izpisúa
      Belmonte’s paper woke a lot of people up,” says Michael West, CEO
      of AgeX, which is pursing similar aging reversal technology. “All
      of a sudden all of the leaders in aging research are like, ‘Oh, my
      gosh, this could work in the human body.’”<br>
      <br>
      To West, the technology offers the prospect that humans, like
      salamanders, could regenerate tissues or damaged organs. “Humans
      have that ability too, when we are first forming,” he says. “So if
      we can reawaken those pathways ... wow!”<br>
      <br>
      To others, however, the evidence for rejuvenation is plainly in
      its infancy. Jan Vijg, chair of the genetics department at the
      Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, says aging
      consists of “hundreds of different processes” to which simple
      solutions are unlikely. Theoretically, he believes, science can
      “create processes that are so powerful they could override all of
      the other ones.” But he adds, “We don’t know that right now.”<br>
      <br>
      An even broader doubt is whether the epigenetic changes that
      Izpisúa Belmonte is reversing in his lab are really the cause of
      aging or just a sign of it—the equivalent of wrinkles in aging
      skin. If so, Izpisúa Belmonte’s treatment might be like smoothing
      out wrinkles, a purely cosmetic effect. “We have no way of
      knowing, and there is really no evidence, that says the DNA
      methylation [is] causing these cells to age,” says John Greally,
      another professor at Einstein. The notion that “if I change those
      DNA methylations, I will be influencing aging,” he says, “has red
      flags all over it.”<br>
      <br>
      One other fundamental question hangs over Izpisúa Belmonte’s
      findings: while he succeeded in rejuvenating mice with progeria,
      he hasn’t done it in normal aged animals. Progeria is an illness
      due to a single DNA mutation. Natural aging is much more complex,
      says Vittorio Sebastiano, an assistant professor at the Stanford
      Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Would
      the rejuvenation technique work in naturally aged animals and in
      human cells? He says Izpisúa Belmonte’s research so far leaves
      that crucial question unanswered.<br>
      <br>
      Izpisúa Belmonte’s team is working to answer it. Experiments to
      rejuvenate normal mice are under way. But because normal mice live
      as long as two and a half years, whereas those with progeria live
      three months, the evidence is taking longer to gather. “And if we
      have to modify any experimental condition,” Reddy says, “then the
      whole cycle will have to be repeated.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Editing age</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Wholesale rejuvenation, then, is still far off, if it will ever
      come at all. But more limited versions of it, targeted to certain
      diseases of aging, might be available within a few years.<br>
      <br>
      If the Yamanaka factors are like a scattergun that wipes out all
      the epigenetic marks associated with aging, the techniques now
      being developed at Salk and in other labs are more like sniper
      rifles. The goal is to allow researchers to switch off a specific
      gene that causes a disease, or switch on another gene that can
      alleviate it.<br>
      <br>
      Hsin-Kai Liao and Fumiyuki Hatanaka spent four years in Izpisúa
      Belmonte’s lab adapting CRISPR-Cas9, the famed DNA “editing”
      system, to instead act as a volume control knob. Whereas the
      original CRISPR lets researchers eliminate an unwanted gene, the
      adapted tool allows them to leave the genetic code untouched but
      determine whether a gene is turned on or off.<br>
      <br>
      The lab has tested this tool on mice with muscular dystrophy,
      which lack a gene that’s crucial in maintaining muscle. Using the
      epigenome editor, the researchers cranked up the output of another
      gene that can play a substitute role. The mice they treated did
      better on grip tests, and their muscles “had become much larger,”
      Liao remembers.<br>
      <br>
      Another result of this kind came from beyond the Salk campus, at
      the University of California, Irvine. Researcher Marcelo Wood
      claims that activating a single gene in old mice improves their
      memory in a test involving moving objects. “We restored long-term
      memory function in those animals,” says Wood, who published the
      results in Nature Communications. After a single epigenetic block
      is removed, says Wood, “the genes for memory—they all fire. Now
      that animal perfectly encodes that information straight into
      long-term memory.”<br>
      <br>
      “I think turning back the clock is an appropriate way to explain
      it.”<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, researchers at Duke University have developed an
      epigenetic editing technique (not yet tested on animals) to turn
      down the volume on a gene implicated in Parkinson’s disease.
      Another Duke team brought down the levels of cholesterol in mice
      by turning off a gene that regulates it. Izpisúa Belmonte’s lab
      itself, as well as experimenting with muscular dystrophy, has
      worked on rolling back the symptoms of diabetes, kidney disease,
      and the loss of bone cartilage, all using similar methods.<br>
      <br>
      The first human tests of these techniques are likely to happen in
      the next few years. Two companies pursuing the technology are AgeX
      and Turn Biotechnologies, a startup cofounded by Sebastiano from
      Stanford. AgeX, says West, its CEO, is looking to target heart
      tissues, while Turn, according to Sebastiano, will begin by
      seeking regulatory clearance to test treatments for osteoarthritis
      and aging-related muscle loss.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile GenuCure, a biotech company founded by Ilir Dubova, a
      former researcher at Salk, is raising funds to pursue an idea for
      rejuvenating cartilage. The company has a “cocktail,” Dubova says,
      that will be injected into the knee capsule of people with
      osteoarthritis, perhaps once or twice a year. Such a treatment
      could take the place of expensive knee replacement surgeries.<br>
      <br>
      “After injection, these … genes that were silenced due to aging
      would be turned on, thanks to our witchcraft, and start the
      rejuvenation process of the tissue,” Dubova says. “I think turning
      back the clock is an appropriate way to explain it.”<br>

      <br>
      LA JOLLA—Graying hair, crow’s feet, an injury that’s taking longer
      to heal than when we were 20—faced with the unmistakable signs of
      aging, most of us have had a least one fantasy of turning back
      time. Now, scientists at the Salk Institute have found that
      intermittent expression of genes normally associated with an
      embryonic state can reverse the hallmarks of old age.<br>
      <br>
      This approach, which not only prompted human skin cells in a dish
      to look and behave young again, also resulted in the rejuvenation
      of mice with a premature aging disease, countering signs of aging
      and increasing the animals’ lifespan by 30 percent. The
      early-stage work provides insight both into the cellular drivers
      of aging and possible therapeutic approaches for improving human
      health and longevity.<br>
      <br>
      “Our study shows that aging may not have to proceed in one single
      direction,” says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in
      Salk’s Gene Expression Laboratory and senior author of the paper
      appearing in the December 15, 2016, issue of Cell. “It has
      plasticity and, with careful modulation, aging might be reversed.”<br>
      <br>
      As people in modern societies live longer, their risk of
      developing age-related diseases goes up. In fact, data shows that
      the biggest risk factor for heart disease, cancer and
      neurodegenerative disorders is simply age. One clue to halting or
      reversing aging lies in the study of cellular reprogramming, a
      process in which the expression of four genes known as the
      Yamanaka factors allows scientists to convert any cell into
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Like embryonic stem calls,
      iPSCs are capable of dividing indefinitely and becoming any cell
      type present in our body.<br>
      <br>
      “What we and other stem-cell labs have observed is that when you
      induce cellular reprogramming, cells look younger,” says Alejandro
      Ocampo, a research associate and first author of the paper. “The
      next question was whether we could induce this rejuvenation
      process in a live animal.”<br>
      <br>
      While cellular rejuvenation certainly sounds desirable, a process
      that works for laboratory cells is not necessarily a good idea for
      an entire organism. For one thing, although rapid cell division is
      critical in growing embryos, in adults such growth is one of the
      hallmarks of cancer. For another, having large numbers of cells
      revert back to embryonic status in an adult could result in organ
      failure, ultimately leading to death. For these reasons, the Salk
      team wondered whether they could avoid cancer and improve aging
      characteristics by inducing the Yamanaka factors for a short
      period of time.<br>
      <br>
      To find out, the team turned to a rare genetic disease called
      progeria. Both mice and humans with progeria show many signs of
      aging including DNA damage, organ dysfunction and dramatically
      shortened lifespan. Moreover, the chemical marks on DNA
      responsible for the regulation of genes and protection of our
      genome, known as epigenetic marks, are prematurely dysregulated in
      progeria mice and humans. Importantly, epigenetic marks are
      modified during cellular reprogramming.<br>
      <br>
      Using skin cells from mice with progeria, the team induced the
      Yamanaka factors for a short duration. When they examined the
      cells using standard laboratory methods, the cells showed reversal
      of multiple aging hallmarks without losing their skin-cell
      identity.<br>
      <br>
      “In other studies scientists have completely reprogrammed cells
      all the way back to a stem-cell-like state,” says co-first author
      Pradeep Reddy, also a Salk research associate. “But we show, for
      the first time, that by expressing these factors for a short
      duration you can maintain the cell’s identity while reversing
      age-associated hallmarks.”<br>
      <br>
      Encouraged by this result, the team used the same short
      reprogramming method during cyclic periods in live mice with
      progeria. The results were striking: Compared to untreated mice,
      the reprogrammed mice looked younger; their cardiovascular and
      other organ function improved and—most surprising of all—they
      lived 30 percent longer, yet did not develop cancer. On a cellular
      level, the animals showed the recovery of molecular aging
      hallmarks that are affected not only in progeria, but also in
      normal aging.<br>
      <br>
      “This work shows that epigenetic changes are at least partially
      driving aging,” says co-first author Paloma Martinez-Redondo,
      another Salk research associate. “It gives us exciting insights
      into which pathways could be targeted to delay cellular aging.”<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, the Salk scientists turned their efforts to normal, aged
      mice. In these animals, the cyclic induction of the Yamanaka
      factors led to improvement in the regeneration capacity of
      pancreas and muscle. In this case, injured pancreas and muscle
      healed faster in aged mice that were reprogrammed, indicating a
      clear improvement in the quality of life by cellular
      reprogramming.<br>
      <br>
      “Obviously, mice are not humans and we know it will be much more
      complex to rejuvenate a person,” says Izpisua Belmonte. “But this
      study shows that aging is a very dynamic and plastic process, and
      therefore will be more amenable to therapeutic interventions than
      what we previously thought.”<br>
      <br>
      The Salk researchers believe that induction of epigenetic changes
      via chemicals or small molecules may be the most promising
      approach to achieve rejuvenation in humans. However, they caution
      that, due to the complexity of aging, these therapies may take up
      to 10 years to reach clinical trials.<br>

          hallmarks by partial reprogramming</b><br>
        <b>Alejandro Ocampo, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Highlights</b><br>
      Partial reprogramming erases cellular markers of aging in mouse
      and human cells<br>
      Induction of OSKM in progeria mice ameliorates signs of aging and
      extends lifespan<br>
      In vivo reprogramming improves regeneration in 12-month-old
      wild-type mice<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      Aging is the major risk factor for many human diseases. In vitro
      studies have demonstrated that cellular reprogramming to
      pluripotency reverses cellular age, but alteration of the aging
      process through reprogramming has not been directly demonstrated
      in vivo. Here, we report that partial reprogramming by short-term
      cyclic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM)
      ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and
      prolongs lifespan in a mouse model of premature aging. Similarly,
      expression of OSKM in vivo improves recovery from metabolic
      disease and muscle injury in older wild-type mice. The
      amelioration of age-associated phenotypes by epigenetic remodeling
      during cellular reprogramming highlights the role of epigenetic
      dysregulation as a driver of mammalian aging. Establishing in vivo
      platforms to modulate age-associated epigenetic marks may provide
      further insights into the biology of aging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><br>
      For humans living in modern societies, aging is the largest risk
      factor for most diseases (Partridge, 2014). However, despite
      decades of effort, the complexity of cellular and organismal aging
      has limited our understanding of this critical biological process.
      Epigenetic alterations (e.g., DNA methylation, post-translational
      modifications of histones, and chromatin remodeling) have recently
      emerged as one of the most conserved hallmarks of aging (Benayoun
      et al., 2015, Sen et al., 2016). Interestingly, cellular
      reprogramming to pluripotency occurs through a stepwise global
      epigenetic remodeling (Benayoun et al., 2015, Liu et al., 2013b,
      Polo et al., 2012). The rejuvenation of aging hallmarks has been
      extensively described during cellular reprogramming to
      pluripotency in vitro (Lapasset et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2011,
      Mahmoudi and Brunet, 2012, Rando and Chang, 2012), but the
      dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. In addition,
      until now, the amelioration of age-associated phenotypes by
      cellular reprogramming has not yet been demonstrated at the
      organismal level.<br>
      <br>
      Our results demonstrate that partial reprogramming by short-term
      expression of the Yamanaka factors has the capacity to rejuvenate
      cellular phenotypes of aging in mouse and human cells. Although
      previous studies have indicated that expression of the Yamanaka
      factors in vivo can lead to cancer development or teratoma
      formation (Abad et al., 2013, Ohnishi et al., 2014), here, we
      demonstrate that tumor formation can be avoided by short-term
      induction of OSKM. Cyclic induction of OSKM in vivo ameliorated
      hallmarks of aging and extended the lifespan of a mouse model of
      premature aging. Additionally, short-term induction of OSKM
      improved the regenerative capacity of pancreas and muscle
      following injury in physiologically aged mice. Together, these
      results show that partial in vivo reprogramming might be used to
      modulate aging hallmarks and significantly benefit organismal
      health.<br>

        <b>Mo Li &amp; Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In advanced age, the stem cells responsible for muscle
      regeneration switch from reversible quiescence to irreversible
      senescence. Targeting a driver of senescence revives muscle stem
      cells and restores regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      One of the telltale signs of advanced ageing is loss of
      skeletal-muscle mass and strength, a phenomenon known as
      sarcopenia. Muscle strength is inversely correlated with mortality
      in old populations1,2, and the decline in strength is attributable
      to the decreased regenerative capacity of muscle stem cells,
      called satellite cells, with age. Whether this decline is caused
      by cell-intrinsic and/or environmental alterations has remained
      unclear. On page 316 of this issue, Sousa-Victor et al.3 shed
      light on this debate by uncovering intrinsic aspects of
      age-related satellite-cell dysfunction that account for the loss
      of muscle maintenance (homeostasis) and regeneration. This study
      also provides a potential strategy for satellite-cell rejuvenation
      that could benefit geriatric individuals and those with progeria,
      a disorder in which cells age prematurely...<br>
      <br>
      Finally, this study presents yet another addition to the list of
      potential strategies to improve the regenerative capacity of aged
      tissue11,14,15. It may be worth considering whether the benefits
      of transiently reducing tumour-suppressor levels in stem cells
      outweigh the associated risks, in the context of preventing an
      age-related decline in regenerative potential. Whether these
      strategies can be safely implemented in the clinic to maximize
      human health span deserves thorough investigation in the near
      future.<br>

          rejuvenation</b><br>
        <b>Prim B. Singh, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Age reprogramming represents a novel method for generating
      patient-specific tissues for transplantation. It bypasses the
      de-differentiation/redifferentiation cycle that is characteristic
      of the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) and nuclear
      transfer-embryonic stem (NT-ES) cell technologies that drive
      current interest in regenerative medicine. Despite the obvious
      potential of iPS and NT-ES cell-based therapies, there are several
      problems that must be overcome before these therapies are safe and
      routine. As an alternative, age reprogramming aims to rejuvenate
      the specialized functions of an old cell without
      de-differentiation; age reprogramming does not require
      developmental reprogramming through an embryonic stage, unlike the
      iPS and NT-ES cell-based therapies. Tests of age reprogramming
      have largely focused on one aspect, the epigenome. Epigenetic
      rejuvenation has been achieved in vitro in the absence of
      de-differentiation using iPS cell reprogramming factors. Studies
      on the dynamics of epigenetic age (eAge) reprogramming have
      demonstrated that the separation of eAge from developmental
      reprogramming can be explained largely by their different
      kinetics. Age reprogramming has also been achieved in vivo and
      shown to increase lifespan in a premature ageing mouse model. We
      conclude that age and developmental reprogramming can be
      disentangled and regulated independently in vitro and in vivo.<br>

        <b>Method of making induced pluripotent stem cells </b><br>

      <br>
      A method of producing an induced pluripotent stem cell includes
      introducing into a somatic cell one or more non-viral expression
      vectors. The vectors include one or more of an Oct family gene, a
      Klf family gene, a Sox family gene, a Myc family gene, a Lin
      family gene, and Nanog gene. The somatic cell is then cultured in
      a medium that supports pluripotent stem cells. At least a portion
      of the one or more introduced non-viral expression vectors is not
      substantially integrated in the chromosome...<br>
      <br>
      Technical Problem<br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of
      producing an iPS cell by reprogramming a somatic cell without
      using a viral vector such as a retrovirus.<br>
      <br>
      Solution to Problem<br>
      The present inventors extensively investigated to solve the
      problems described above, and found that an iPS cell can be
      produced by introducing genes that encode reprogramming factors
      into a somatic cell by means of a non-viral expression vector such
      as a plasmid vector, and that a safe iPS cell can be obtained from
      a somatic cell by the method. The present invention has been
      developed on the basis of these findings.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of producing
      an induced pluripotent stem cell, comprising the step of
      introducing at least one kind of non-viral expression vector
      incorporating at least one gene that encodes a reprogramming
      factor into a somatic cell...<br>
