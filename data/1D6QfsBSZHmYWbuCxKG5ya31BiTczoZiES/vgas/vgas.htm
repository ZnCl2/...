        <p><b><font size="+1">A Vapour Fuel System is Now in the Works</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>By</b> </p>
        <p><b>Brad Dennis</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>There are those of us who still tout the vapor principle as
        being far superior to what Detroit is presently producing. It
        finally looks as though a computerized vapor fuel system will
        enter the market which proves the Pogue vapor carburetor theory
        is a valid one. </p>
      <p>Two firms came very close to breaking into the market place (or
        should I say, against the bureaucrats) with their systems:
        Advanced Fuel Systems, Seattle, WA which is based on Tom Ogle’s
        patent and the Flex vaporizing System in Nevada. To this day,
        however, there is not one vaporizing system available. </p>
      <p>This time the story might change. A small firm in Ohio has
        progressed further in achieving the goal of a practical vapor
        fuel system and it appears to be the moist cost effective
        systems yet developed. </p>
      <p>The company is VGAS and stands for Vaporizing Gasoline
        Aspiration Systems. </p>
      <p>VGAS has spent the last five years perfecting a vapor fuel
        system that offers a 100 percent gain in fuel mileage and a
        drastic drop in emissions. The corporation has spent better than
        $1.5 million on this project and are expected to mass produce
        and market these vapor systems worldwide. Presently there are
        some 330 US dealer-installers who promote and field test the
        VGAS system (Figure 1). </p>
      <p>The system weighs 31 pounds. It is expected to retail for
        between $400 and $500. Installation takes two to three hours… </p>
      <p>While the system makes conventional liquid carburetors obsolete
        and unnecessary, vehicles can convert back to their old
        carburetor with a switch on the dashboard. </p>
      <p>It has been tested at temperatures between 95 to 18 F. </p>
      <p>He firm has developed the concept, to the point of having
        computer-programmed mass produced systems applicable to just
        about any internal combustion engine made in Detroit. And the
        systems are in the price range most people can afford (Figure
        2). </p>
      <p>Now for you who follow the information in this column on
        vaporizers, and have done some research on your own, it is
        common knowledge there is a tremendous number of vapor
        carburetor or system patents worldwide. None of these 18,000 or
        more patents have found its way on to the marketplace. The
        problem of control, gasoline chemical fragment separation, had
        always been the reason why these systems didn’t work. But with a
        microprocessor, the task of controlling the multi-fraction
        separation of the fuel in the vaporizing process can easily be
        overcome. The advantage of this system is its adaptability to
        auto engines, marine, and stationary for irrigation or
        electrical generation. </p>
      <p>So let’s take a deeper look at what VGAS is all about and what
        it plans to do with their high mileage vapor system… </p>
      <p>The VGAS device in its most ideal form would replace the
        carburetor altogether and occupy no more space than that on the
        engine… </p>
      <p>The VGAS president continues his claim of two years ago, that
        his device will potentially double the mileage of any
        gas-powered vehicle, subsequently cutting fuel costs in half.
        “The device works at its optimum on traditional ‘gas-hogs” like
        Lincolns, Cadillacs, other large cars, pickup trucks and 4-wheel
        drive vehicles…” </p>
      <p>The VGAS system operates by converting liquid gasoline to a
        vaporous mixture of gasoline and air, which is fed to the engine
        as needed through a system of temperature controls and vacuum
        passageways --- via a microprocessor which constantly monitors
        engine demand… </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a new and novel fuel system and more
        particularly to a fuel system especially designed for use with
        internal combustion engines or the like, and which fuel system
        is operable therewith to provide fuel fumes to the engine from a
        source of liquid ignitable vaporizable fuel, such as gasoline,
        and of sufficient quantity, whereby to significantly increase
        the efficiency of the engine, to thus substantially increase the
        per gallon mileage rate for the engine when used in an
        automotive vehicle or the like, and using the liquid fuel as an
        original fuel source. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is recognized in the art that the efficiency of the typical
        internal combustion engine in present use in automotive vehicles
        and the like is approximately twenty-five percent or less when
        using liquid fuel such as gasoline or other like ignitable
        fuels, such as for instance pentane, hexane, heptane, octane,
        nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tetra decane, hexadecane,
        octadecane, and crude oil. </p>
      <p>Typical prior art fuel systems are exemplified in U.S. Pat. No.
        3,749,376. </p>
      <p>In the use of any such liquid fuel with an associated internal
        combustion engine it is well recognized that a substantial
        percentage of said fuel is not utilized by the engine for power
        generation, but instead is expelled from the engine and/or
        burned or consumed in the exhaust system thereof. </p>
      <p>In applicant Kenneth A. Jackson's pending U.S. patent
        application, Ser. No. 129,345, filed Mar. 11, 1980 and entitled
        "Vaporous Gasoline Aspiration System," there is disclosed a
        novel fuel system which will materially increase the efficiency
        of an internal combustion engine, and the prior art identified
        therein is incorporated herein, without specifically listing the
        same. The present invention is an improvement of a system of the
        general type disclosed in Ser. No. 129,345. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Briefly, the invention provides a fuel system for use with an
        internal combustion engine or the like wherein fuel fumes are
        generated from a liquid source of ignitable fuel such as
        gasoline, or similar liquid vaporizable fuel, and presented in a
        fumed state to the engine for consumption and power conversion
        therein, and wherein the system is provided with improved means
        for fuming the liquid fuel. </p>
      <p>Novel arrangements of fume tanks are disclosed for use in the
        fuel system. </p>
      <p>Substantially all of the fumed fuel presented to the engine is
        consumed therein for power conversion, thus resulting in
        substantially increasing the efficiency of the engine and hence
        substantially increasing the mileage rate per gallon of liquid
        fuel. </p>
      <p>In actual testing of one embodiment of system incorporating the
        present invention with an internal combustion engine in an
        automobile, the mileage rate obtained per gallon with liquid
        leaded gasoline as the source of ignitable fuel, has been of the
        order of at least 400 percent greater than that which has been
        heretofore obtainable using liquid gasoline which is directly
        burnable in the engine. </p>
      <p>For example, testing of the present system has been undertaken
        with a 1975 Cadallic wherein the mileage rate per U.S. gallon of
        fuel obtained has been in the magnitude of 45-48 miles per
        gallon with liquid leaded gasoline as the fuel source. </p>
      <p>It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to
        provide a fuel system especially designed for use with an
        internal combustion engine utilizing liquid ignitable fuel as
        the fuel source, and wherein the fuel system is operable to
        generate fuel fumes from said liquid fuel and to provide a
        sufficient quantity of the same to the engine, so as to
        substantially increase the operating efficiency of the engine. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a fuel system
        especially designed for use with an internal combustion engine
        of an automotive vehicle adapted to utilize liquid ignitable
        fuel and which system is operable to generate fuel fumes in an
        improved manner from the liquid fuel, and to provide fumes of
        sufficient quantity to the engine, whereby to significantly
        increase the efficiency of the engine, to thus substantially
        increase the automotive vehicle per gallon mileage rate of the
        liquid fuel. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        fuel system as hereinabove referred to which is operable at
        atmospheric pressure and which utilizes the vacuum or suction
        generated by the engine, to provide the fuel fumes to the
        engine. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is the provision of a
        fuel system a hereinabove referred to and which is substantially
        easily adapted for use with an internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a fuel system of
        the type hereinabove referred to and which utilizes the vacuum
        of the internal combustion engine to supply fumed fuel to the
        engine, and wherein the system includes a novel auxiliary or
        fume tank in conjunction with the main fuel tank, for improving
        the fuming of the liquid fuel. </p>
      <p>A still further object of the invention is to provide a fuel
        system in accordance with the above, which includes improved
        means for fuming the liquid fuel. </p>
      <p>A still further object of the invention is to provide a fuel
        system in accordance with the foregoing wherein arcuate
        diffusing vanes are provided in conjunction with baffle
        structure, for aiding in removal of liquid droplets of fuel from
        the fuel-air mixture adapted to be supplied to the engine. </p>
      <p>A further object is to provide novel arrangements of fume tanks
        for assembly with the conventional main liquid fuel tank of an
        automotive vehicle, for materially increasing the operating
        efficiency of the engine of the vehicle. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent
        upon reference to the following description taken in conjunction
        with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate preferred
        embodiments thereof. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>

        fuel from the fumed air-fuel mixture prior to its passing from
        the fume tank. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>While the fuel systems illustrated are particularly adapted for
        use with an internal combustion engine in an automotive vehicle
        type of environment, it is also contemplated that said system
        may be adaptable to an internal combustion engine in varied
        environments such as tractors, stationary power units,
        off-the-road equipment, and the like. </p>
      <p>As herein illustrated, a typical automobile vehicle V is shown
        in FIG. 1 equipped with an internal combustion engine 10
        designed to burn liquid ignitable fuel supplied by a more or
        less conventional fuel tank (e.g. tank 12 having liquid fuel
        inlet 12a and conventional vented cap 12b) for providing liquid
        fuel such as gasoline or any other liquid vaporizable ignitable
        fuel, to the carburetor 13 of said engine. </p>
      <p>As aforementioned, with the fuel such as gasoline being
        supplied to the engine 10 in its liquid state, the engine only
        uses about 25-30 percent of said fuel for power conversion
        whereby the major part of said fuel is wasted and emitted in
        various well known pollutant forms from said engine. </p>
      <p>As aforementioned, the fuel system of the present invention
        overcomes this deficiency by providing ignitable fuel in its
        "fumed state" such that substantially all of the delivered fuel
        to said engine is utilized for power conversion. </p>
      <p>To accomplish this, a fuel fume tank or auxiliary tank
        identified at 16 which is generally cylindrical in its present
        configuration, coacts in the upright position with the
        conventional fuel tank 12 located below the trunk space 18 (FIG.
        2) of the vehicle, and with its (member 16) lower end projecting
        into the interior of tank 12, so as to be disposed in submerged
        relation with the anticipated level 19 of liquid fuel in main
        tank 12. Tank 16 in the embodiment illustrated comprises top
        wall 20, side wall portion 20a and bottom wall 20b, with such
        bottom wall, in the embodiment illustrated having a plurality of
        openings 22 therein. thus communicating the interior of tank 16
        with the interior of main tank 12, and thus establishing the
        liquid fuel level in tank 16 at substantially the same level as
        that of the liquid fuel in main tank 12. Tank 16 is received in
        the complementary opening 23 formed in the top wall of main tank
        12 in sealed relation, either by adequate gasketing means or by
        permanent welds securing tank 16 to tank 12. </p>
      <p>In its present configuration, tank 16 is about 16" in its
        external diameter, to define a fume chamber 16a therein. </p>
      <p>One end of a collector member or tube 24 is secured as at 24a
        by any suitable means, such as, for instance, welds, to the top
        wall 20 (in the embodiment illustrated) of the auxiliary or
        fuming tank 16, with such member 24 projecting interiorly of the
        fuming tank 16, and being open at its bottommost end, for
        passage of fumed fuel-air mixture thereinto from the fuming
        tank. </p>
      <p>Member 24, in the embodiment illustrated, is of arcuate
        configuration in side elevation, as can be best seen in FIG. 2,
        and at its distal end comprises a pair of branch conduit
        sections 26, 26a, which have coupling means 27 coacting
        therewith such as, for instance, threaded coupling means, for
        coupling member 24 to a respective line 28, 28a. </p>
      <p>Line 28 is directed to the carburetor 13 passing through a
        tight fitting opening in the conventional air cleaner housing 30
        mounted on the carburetor, and with line 28 terminating just
        above the conventional butterfly valve 32 located in the
        carburetor throat, thereby providing for passage of fumed
        fuel-air mixture from the collector member 24 to the carburetor.
        Line 28a passes from the collector 24 to coupling 34, mounted to
        the conventional air cleaner housing 30, thereby providing a
        further passage for the transmission of additional fumed
        fuel-air from the collector 24 to the carburetor. </p>
      <p>Collector tube 24 in the specific embodiment illustrated, is
        preferably approximately three inches in internal diameter,
        while supply line 28 has an internal diameter of preferably
        approximately 11/2", and line 28a has a corresponding diameter
        of approximately 3/4". Such lines 28, 28a are capable of
        providing sufficient fumes to carburetor 13 for powering the
        engine. </p>
      <p>Extending from exteriorly of collector member 24 and passing
        through the wall thereof in sealed relationship, is an air inlet
        conduit 36, which extends downwardly through the downwardly
        extending collector pipe 24 below open end thereof, with pipe 36
        having a diffuser member 38 secured thereto just above the level
        19 of liquid fuel in auxiliary or fuming tank 16. </p>
      <p>Diffuser member 38, in the embodiment illustrated, comprises an
        upper plate 40 and a lower plate 42 (FIG. 5) with the distal end
        of air inlet pipe 36 being disposed in vertically spaced
        relation above the lower plate 42 so that as air (and also fuel
        as will be hereinafter described) passes downwardly through the
        pipe 36, it impinges against the upper surface of lower plate
        42. Extending generally radially outwardly from the vertical
        axis of plate 42 commencing generally adjacent the periphery of
        lower plate 42, are a plurality of arcuate vanes 44 so that the
        air and fuel passing into diffusing member 38 is twirled or
        given a vortex effect as it streams outwardly through the
        diffusing member 38 and across the confronting surface of the
        liquid fuel in auxiliary tank 16, thus fuming the fuel and
        creating a relatively rich mixture of fuel and air, which is
        then drawn upwardly by the engine vacuum, as will be hereinafter
        discussed. </p>
      <p>As the fumed fuel-air mixture is drawn upwardly in chamber 16a
        of fume tank 16, it passes through a baffle arrangement 48,
        which may be supported on aforementioned inlet pipe 36, such
        baffle comprising a cup-like member 48a which opens upwardly so
        that the fumed fuel-air vapor has to pass upwardly over the open
        top of the cup-shaped baffle and then downwardly to pass into
        the lower open mouth of collector member 24, and aiding in
        removal of any liquid droplets of fuel from the fumed fuel-air
        mixture. </p>
      <p>Air inlet pipe 36 preferably has an interior diameter of
        approximately one inch. Branching off from air inlet pipe 36 and
        in communication therewith is a liquid fuel pipe or conduit 50
        of conventional internal diameter size coming from the output
        port of the conventional fuel pump 52 (FIG. 4) of the
        conventional internal combustion engine 10. The input port of
        the fuel pump 52 is connected by means of conventional conduit
        line 54 (FIGS. 1 and 4) to the conventional outlet port 56 on
        the main fuel tank 12. Fuel lines 50 and 54 preferably have an
        internal diameter in the embodiment illustrated of approximately
        3/8". </p>
      <p>A shower head or liquid diffusing screen 57 of conventional
        known type may be provided either at the connection of fuel line
        50 to air inlet line 36, or in the alternative at the distal end
        of air inlet line 36, so that the liquid fuel as it is mixed
        with the air being inserted into the diffuser member 38 via line
        36, is broken into a fine mist, thus facilitating the fuming of
        the liquid fuel and enriching the fuel-air mixture with fumes of
        the liquid fuel as compared with liquid fuel droplets. The
        impacting of the lower plate 42 in diffuser 38, by the fuel-air
        mixture emanating from the distal end of inlet line 36 likewise
        aids in the removal of liquid droplets from the fuel-air
        mixture. </p>
      <p>A conventional, normally closed, air check valve 58 (FIGS. 2
        and 4) coacts with the air inlet line 36 and is intended to be
        actuated to its open condition in response to the pressure in
        the fuming tank 16 reaching a negative pressure (vacuum) of
        approximately minus one pound of mercury as read on a
        conventional automotive vacuum gage, thus connecting the
        interior of the fuming tank 16 through the air inlet pipe 36 to
        atmosphere. In actual practice this magnitude of negative
        pressure (vacuum) is substantially immediately realized upon the
        engine 10 being initially actuated or "turned over" as is
        referred to in the art. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, the circular wall of the air filter
        housing member 30 is provided with two air entry ports 60 and 62
        respectively. The conventional air intake chute 64 on the air
        cleaner is blocked, as at 65, so that air cannot be drawn
        thereinto as is conventionally done with an internal combustion
        engine. Port 60 is connected to a normally closed conventional
        air check valve 66, while port 62 is coupled to a normally
        closed conventional air check valve 68. Valve 66 is adapted to
        open in response to pressure in the throat of the carburetor
        reaching a negative pressure (vacuum) of approximately one and
        one-half pounds of mercury, thus coupling the closed air cleaner
        housing to the exterior air shortly after the engine is "turned
        over" or actuated, thus "leaning out" the fuel-air mixture of
        fumed fuel being supplied via lines 28, 28a to the carburetor.
        Air check valve 68 is adapted to open when the pressure in the
        carburetor throat reaches a negative pressure (vacuum) of
        approximately a minus five pounds of mercury, thus furnishing
        further outside or atmospheric air to the carburetor. In actual
        practice this magnitude of negative vacuum of a minus five
        pounds is reached when the engine is at approximately its idle
        operating condition. </p>
      <p>In operation the fume fuel system of the FIGS. 1 through 5
        system is preferably as follows: </p>
      <p>Assuming that the engine 10 is off, or at rest condition, a
        certain quantity of fuel fumes is being generated in the fuming
        tank 16 due strictly to the fact that there is liquid fuel
        therein. In this rest condition) the air check valves 58, 66 and
        68 are in closed condition, and the butterfly valve 32 in the
        carburetor throat is likewise in generally closed position. </p>
      <p>When the engine is turned over either manually, or by the
        typical battery-powered starter used in conventional present-day
        automotive systems, the initial cranking of the engine will
        generate a vacuum in the fuming tank 16 and in the air inlet
        pipe 36 as well as in the engine manifold, and in carburetor 13,
        when the butterfly valve 32 is opened through the conventional
        foot control accelerator or throttle (not shown), or by any
        other means, thus causing the vacuum to go to about minus one
        pound of mercury in the carburetor as well as in the lines 28,
        28a and in the aforementioned fuming tank 16 and air inlet 36,
        and thus resulting in the air check valve 58 to outside air,
        permitting air from atmosphere to flow into inlet pipe 36. At
        the same time, the cranking of the engine causes the fuel pump
        52 to pump liquid fuel via fuel line 50 into air inlet pipe 36
        through the misting connection 57, thereof, thereby supplying a
        combined fuel-air mixture to the diffuser member 38, whereupon
        the fuel mixture whirls in cyclonic fashion outwardly from the
        center of the lower baffle, or abutment plate 42, to pass across
        the surface of the liquid fuel in auxiliary tank 16 upwardly
        past the baffle arrangement 48, and into the open bottom end of
        the collector tube 24. </p>
      <p>The cyclonic, or whirling effect of the diffuser 38 aids in
        elimination of liquid droplets from the fuel-air mixture
        abutting against the abutment plate 42, thereby maintaining the
        fuel-air mixture being supplied to the engine in vaporous
        condition, as well as enhancing the vaporization of the liquid
        fuel. Such fuel-air mixture, passing upwardly through the baffle
        48, likewise aids in removal of any liquid droplets in the
        fuel-air mixture to further aid in increasing the efficiency of
        the engine. </p>
      <p>From collector chamber 24, the fuel may pass through the fuel
        supply lines 28, 28a to the carburetor, whereupon the fuel in
        the piston firing chambers of the engine 10 is ignited, to cause
        the engine to fire. As the comparatively rich fuel-air vaporous
        mixture is passed into the carburetor, due to the vacuum caused
        by cranking the engine, the atmospheric air inlet check valve 66
        opens to mix further at approximately a minus one and one-half
        pounds of mercury, to "lean" out the fuel as it passes through
        the throat of the carburetor to the piston chambers. </p>
      <p>Upon firing of the engine, the atmospheric air check valve 68
        opens at approximately a minus five pounds vacuum of mercury, to
        further lean out the comparatively rich vapor being furnished to
        the carburetor via lines 28, 28a, and the engine is then
        available to power the vehicle V. Safety screening, such as for
        instance miner's screen, are preferably provided as at 69 in
        collection chamber 24 and in supply lines 28, 28a at their
        connections to the air filter housing 30, to extinguish any
        flame in the event of back firing of the engine. </p>
      <p>It will be seen that the system of FIGS. 1 through 5 is a
        closed system, with outside atmospheric air being admitted to
        the system only upon opening of the air check valve 58 which
        occurs upon cranking of the engine. As the negative pressure or
        vacuum increases toward a minus five pounds of mercury, the
        quantity of fumed fuel-air mixture that is drawn from the fuming
        tank 16 into the collector tube or member 24 and then through
        lines 28, 28a to the carburetor, increases proportionately, thus
        providing an adequate source of the vaporous fuel-air mixture to
        the engine. When the engine is shut off by turning off the key
        thereto, the air check valves 58, 66 and 68 close, and the
        butterfly valve 32 is returned to its closed position, thus
        causing the pressure in the carburetor to return to
        approximately zero magnitude, thus stopping any ingress of
        atmospheric air into the system. It will be understood that in
        the present system wherein only a fumed fuel and air mixture is
        provided to the engine for combustion, substantially all of the
        fuel-air mixture is burned for power conversion, thus resulting
        in substantially increasing the efficiency of the engine, and
        for automotive type vehicles, such system is operable to
        substantially increase the vehicle mileage rate per gallon of
        liquid fuel that is utilized in the fuel tank. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 5 through 7, there is shown another
        embodiment of fuming tank arrangement. In this embodiment, the
        fuming tank is more readily connectable to an existing main fuel
        tank without substantial alteration of the latter and an
        overflow arrangement is provided for causing fuel inserted into
        the air inlet line to be returned to the main tank when it gets
        to a predetermined level in the auxiliary fuming tank. In this
        arrangement, like reference numbers have been utilized when
        referring to the component parts thereof, except that the prefix
        prime (') has been added thereto. </p>
      <p>In this arrangement, the auxiliary fuming tank 16' includes a
        non-perforated bottom wall 20b', but which has a pipe or conduit
        member 72 extending through such bottom wall 20b' in sealed
        relation therewith, and which extends downwardly to communicate
        at its lower end with the interior of the main fuel tank 12' of
        the vehicle. Coacting with upright pipe 72 is an overflow pipe
        section 74 which branches off from pipe 72 and extends a
        predetermined distance above the bottom surface of the auxiliary
        tank 16' and in this embodiment opens onto the upper surface of
        bottom baffle plate 42 of diffuser member 38'. Thus it will be
        seen that in the event that the fuel level in auxiliary tank 16'
        gets up to the entry mouth pipe 74, the fuel flows down through
        branch pipe 74, through pipe 72 to the interior of main fuel
        tank 12'. </p>
      <p>The air inlet pipe 36' in this embodiment extends from
        exteriorly of the collector pipe or member 24' through the wall
        thereof in sealed relationship and extends downwardly to
        terminate at the upper plate member 40' of diffuser member 38'.
        In other respects, the diffuser member 38' is generally similar
        to that aforediscussed in connection with diffuser member 38 of
        the firstdescribed embodiment. The air inlet pipe 36' has a
        conventional air check valve 58' coacting therewith in a similar
        manner as the corresponding air check valve in the
        first-described embodiment. In this embodiment, the fuel line
        50' from the fuel pump 52 preferably has a manually actuatable
        shut-off valve 76 therein, and with such fuel line extending
        into the air inlet pipe 36' just above the diffuser member 38',
        a liquid misting screen or head 57' is preferably utilized at
        the entry end of line 50' into air inlet line 36' and in a
        generally similar manner as in the first described embodiment. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, the collector member 24' coacts with a
        single transmission line 28', in the embodiment as illustrated.
        Line 28' is preferably approximately two inches in internal
        diameter and connected to collector 24' in sealed relationship
        and as at 80. Line 28' is then coupled to the carburetor
        preferably in a generally similar manner as the coupling of line
        28 in the first-described embodiment. This single transmission
        line 28' takes the place of the two substantially smaller lines
        28, 28a in the first described embodiment. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of fuming tank 16', the interior of the side
        walls thereof may be covered with a liquid absorbent material,
        such as at 77, impervious to the action of the fuel, for aiding
        in removal of liquid droplets from the fumed air-fuel mixture
        being dispersed from the diffuser member 38' to the interior of
        the fuming tank 16' prior to its passage through the baffle
        member 48' and entry thereof into the collection member 24'. A
        suitable material for such droplet absorbing member has been
        found to be non-woven fabric in the form of carpeting of
        polyester, or nylon, or the like. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown a further embodiment
        of auxiliary or fume tank which is somewhat similar to the fume
        tank embodiments illustrated in the previous embodiments of FIG.
        2 and FIG. 6 respectively, but which includes thereon on the
        interior of the tank a greater amount of the liquid absorbent
        material 77" shown in FIG. 6 embodiment. Moreover, in this
        embodiment, the diffuser member 38" is somewhat different from
        the diffuser members of the first-described embodiments, and a
        different arrangement is provided for passing of the overflow of
        liquid fuel in the fume tank back to the main fuel tank. Like
        numbers have been utilized to designate generally similar parts
        except that the prefix " has been added thereto. </p>
      <p>As can be seen from FIG. 10, the bottom plate 42" of the
        diffuser assembly 38" is the larger of the plates, with the top
        plate 40" providing the bottom of the cup baffle 48". The vanes
        44" commence adjacent to the axial center of the plates 40", 42"
        and are arcuate in a generally similar manner as in the
        first-described embodiments, for causing a whirling of the inlet
        fuel and air mixture as it strikes the bottom plate when it
        emerges from the distal end of the inlet pipe 36". </p>
      <p>Bottom plate 42" extends almost completely across the dimension
        of the fuming tank 16" and terminates just short of the side
        walls thereof and as at 80. The top plate 40" of the diffuser
        38" preferably terminates just short of (approximately 1/2 inch)
        of the fabric covered side walls of tank 16". </p>
      <p>The aforementioned fabric material 77" covers not only the
        interior surfaces of the side walls of the fuming tank, but also
        the interior surfaces of the top wall as well as the side and
        interior bottom surfaces of the baffle member 48" and also the
        exterior of the collector member 24" where it extends into the
        fuming tank 16". Accordingly, the fuel-air mixture passing
        through the diffuser up over the baffle member 48" and then
        downwardly into the cup-like baffle to enter the lower open end
        of the collector 24" is passed by or exposed to a substantial
        amount of the fabric 77", thus removing substantially all of any
        liquid droplets in the fuel-air mixture to maintain maximum
        efficiency for powering the engine. It will be seen that the
        lower end of the fabric material on the side walls of the fuming
        tank extend downwardly as at 82, below the lower plate 42" of
        the diffuser 38" and into the pool of liquid fuel which
        ordinarily is found therein. Liquid fuel by the "wicking" action
        of the fabric is drawn upwardly into the fabric covering the
        side walls and the top wall, wetting the latter with liquid
        fuel, and thus aids in fuming the fuel-air mixture. A funnel
        member 83 is provided through plate 42" in general alignment
        with inlet pipe 36" so that some fuel-air mixture from pipe 36"
        passes through lower plate 42". </p>
      <p>A sight tube 84 may be provided on the exterior of the fuming
        tank for indicating the level of liquid fuel therein. </p>
      <p>A housing member 86 is provided over the drain port 88, which
        is connected as by means of a drain line 90 to the main fuel
        tank (not shown), and if the level of liquid in chamber 89 gets
        above the level illustrated, it will overflow housing 86 and
        then flow down through openings 92 in enclosure 86 and out the
        drain 88 to the main fuel tank. Expansion chamber 93 may be
        provided in line 90. </p>
      <p>The upper end of the collector member 24" is reduced from the
        approximately three inch diameter of the vertical portion
        thereof down to approximately one and seven-eighths inch
        diameter where it is connected to the feed line 28", which is
        directed to the carburetor. As can be seen, an expansion chamber
        93' may be provided in line 28", and also a drain 94 may be
        provided in line 28" and connected by line 96 back to line 90 to
        the main fuel tank, for further removal of any liquid fuel that
        may still exist in the fuel-air mixture being fed to the
        carburetor by the vacuum pressure. </p>
      <p>Line 28" is preferably approximately one and one-half inches in
        internal diameter. Operation of this embodiment of fuming tank
        is generally similar as that described for the previous
        embodiments, except that due to the coating material, or fabric
        77", the fuel-air mixture is further enriched with vapor emitted
        from coating 77", and thus is maintained in an even greater
        magnitude of vaporous condition. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 9 there is shown a modified arrangement
        of closed carburetor head for replacement of the first described
        conventional air cleaner housing on the carburetor. In this
        embodiment the closed head member 84 is mounted in generally
        sealed relationship on the conventional throat 85 of the
        carburetor 13. The air ports 60', 62' are provided in the head
        member 84, above the entry of the fuel-air mixture transmission
        lines 28', 28a' to the carburetor throat, so that the
        atmospheric air being admitted from the atmosphere to the
        carburetor throat via the air check valves (not shown)
        associated with the respective part is admitted above the
        discharge end of the fuel-air mixture transmission lines 28',
        28a' to the head. Thus the atmospheric air being applied to the
        carburetor to lean out the mixture of fuel-air being furnished
        to the carburetor by lines 28', 28a' is entered into the
        carburetor head above the enriched fuel-air mixture being
        supplied from the fuming tank. Such a closed carburetor head
        arrangement will provide slightly greater vacuum to the
        carburetor upon turning the engine over than say, for instance,
        the vacuum when utilizing the air cleaner housing member 30 of
        the FIGS. 3 and 4 embodiment. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing discussion and accompanying drawings, it
        will be seen that the invention provides a novel fuel system for
        use with an internal combustion engine for generating a fumed
        fuel-air mixture and for supplying such mixture to associated
        fuel delivery means of the engine, for ignition therein and
        which system includes means for causing improved diffusion of
        the air and fuel, to improve the vaporization process and thus
        increase the efficiency of the fuel utilized in the engine. The
        invention also provides a novel fuel system embodying efficient
        fuming tank mechanism, which is operable to cause an increase of
        vaporization of the liquid fuel provided, together with means
        for more completely removing liquid droplets from the fumed
        fuel, to thus further increase the efficiency of the engine. </p>
