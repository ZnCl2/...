      May 5, 2001<br>
      <br>
      I now place in everyone's hand the complete answer to tooth
      cavities. Following this procedure there will not be one more
      cavity, one more gingivitis case, or one more fluorosed, brittle,
      cracked tooth in the world. Bad teeth in Ireland, Canada, the USA,
      Britain, Australia and New Zealand will now be curbed. The 55-year
      fight with fluoride promoters (dentists) in these countries is
      over since research now establishes for certain that fluoride
      makes the teeth WORSE and not better (refs 1,2,3). My book, Good
      Teeth, Birth to Death lays out in no uncertain terms all the
      detail to achieve my claims.<br>
      <br>
      I have talked to thousands of people about their teeth, many of
      whom have perfect teeth. In all those cases of perfect teeth, the
      practice of rinsing while eating has been the reason, and not
      fluoride. I am convinced that perfect teeth have little or nothing
      to do with genetics. The best way to have perfect teeth besides
      staying away from greedy or incompetent dentists is to pursue the
      following behavior:<br>
      <br>
      Rinse acids off the teeth during eating (ref 4).<br>
      Brush the teeth with bar soap (ref 5).<br>
      Take calcium pills with vitamin D daily (ref 6).<br>
      Take monosodium phosphate daily (ref 7).<br>
      Take freshly made sodium ascorbate daily for gum connections to
      the teeth (ref 8).<br>
      Dispense with the worry that bacteria harm teeth: THEY CANNOT (ref
      9).<br>
      Dispense with the worry that sugar destroys teeth. I find sugar
      has little or nothing to do with cavities (ref 10).<br>
      Avoid all fluoride products. They destroy teeth, unravel enzymes
      and cause 113 ailments (ref 11).<br>
      <br>
      My 117-page book, Good Teeth, Birth to Death (Call 1-623-412-3955
      for a copy delivered to you after which you will return $15)
      covers the perfect teeth subject thoroughly including the fluoride
      controversy. It is a product of thousands of hours of research.
      The index alone is 41 pages.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 1) J Pub Health Dentistry, Nov 1993. This article states we
      have a tooth decay epidemic in the US since 42% of people over 65
      years of age have no natural teeth, 44-year-olds have an average
      of 30 decays, 17-year-olds have an average of 11 decays, the
      blacks and the poor are twice as bad as this and the American
      Indians have four times the tooth trouble. American Indians have
      free dental care, and have had since almost the beginning of
      fluoridation. If fluoride helped prevent cavities at a rate of 80%
      per 15 years as the proponents of fluoride claimed in the
      beginning of the early studies of the forties, US residents would
      now have less than 2 cavities per person (my calculation).<br>
      <br>
      (ref 2) In MediZine, V6 #2, April of 2000, the American Dental
      Association again states that a dental epidemic exists and 42% of
      those over 65 years of age and 25% of those over 44 years of age
      have no natural teeth. They admit their ignorance as to why.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 3) 4 curves representing a total of 480,000 students and
      covering over 30 years of study indicate that the increasing
      concentration of fluoride in drinking water from 0 to 1 ppm
      increases the cavities 7, 43, 22 and 10% in Japan, Tucson, India
      and the US (see GTBD, pp 44,45,46 and 49). In other words,
      fluoridation about doubles cavitation from the normal (my
      calculation). Numerous studies verify the fact that fluoridation
      of water increases cavities.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 4) Tooth enamel (essentially calcium phosphate) reacts with
      all acids to form cavities (see any chemistry text dealing with
      solubilities). The proton of the acid pulls the phosphate right
      out of the enamel, and fast. By drinking a sip of water along with
      the acid during eating, the acid reacts chemically with water
      immediately to form hydronium ion and thus the enamel is saved.
      One can use milk or coffee for the same purpose, since they are
      both non-acidic. Dr. Albert Schatz, Nobelist who discovered
      streptomycin, found several decades ago that sharks' teeth with
      their excessive fluoride would dissolve just as readily in citric
      acid as ordinary non-fluoridated teeth, laying to rest the
      hypothesis that fluoride would stop cavities. The dental people
      (American Dental Association) pushed aside this discovery and Dr.
      Schatz' discoveries regarding excessive baby mortalities caused by
      fluoridation in Chili, South America as insignificant. They
      returned his mail 3x unopened and would not deal with him.<br>
      <br>
      Some harmful acids (with pH &lt;4) which are tart to the taste and
      attack the enamel include lemons, grapefruit, oranges, pineapple,
      kiwi fruit, tomatoes, vinegar, cider, vitamin C (especially
      chewable) and stomach acid. The lower the pH, the more rapidly the
      acids attack. Body acid (extremely weak) is insignificant in this
      process. Non-acid foods such as beans, bread and potatoes have no
      action on teeth. Worry about such foods is over. The only worry
      about non-acid foods is if they will crack the teeth due to their
      hardness. Chewing ice, unpopped corn kernels, extremely hard nuts,
      bones or other hard objects is not smart, since teeth do have a
      breaking strength.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 5) Reenamelization of the teeth occurs when they are clean.
      All toothpastes make a barrier of glycerine on the teeth which
      would require 20 rinses to get it off. A good solution for clean
      teeth, which I have used for 5 years, is bar soap. Wet the brush,
      swipe the bar two or three times with it, then brush the teeth
      thoroughly and the gums gently. Rinse with water three or four
      times. All oils are washed off the teeth and the gums are
      disinfected. The bacteria are killed by the soap. The teeth are
      then ready for reenamelization with calcium and phosphate in the
      diet. The enzyme adenosine diphosphatase delivers phosphate to the
      enamel surface. Do not use liquid soaps. Their different
      composition is harmful to the protoplasm.<br>
      <br>
      Reenamelization is necessary on a daily basis because the enamel
      leaches slightly with water as well as the bones over decades
      leading to holey bones and holey teeth even in the absence of acid
      attack. Without reenamelization, we could never have good teeth.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 6) Calcium (1.2 g if it is the only source) with vitamin D
      can be obtained from Walgreens at a very reasonable price of about
      5 cents per pill. Other required vitamin and mineral requirements
      of the body can be found on page 56 of GTBD. Vitamin D helps to
      deliver calcium to its needed site. All acid-soluble calcium
      compounds such as calcium carbonate or calcium citrate are
      suitable with D. It goes without saying that calcium is necessary
      in building calcium phosphate teeth.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 7) Monosodium phosphate is the best supplement for phosphate
      since it is very pure and highly soluble in water. Simply take
      about 1/5 teaspoon (1 gram), dissolve it in 1 inch of water in
      less than a minute, then fill up the glass and drink it daily.
      This takes care of all the bones, teeth, DNA, RNA and at least 30
      phosphate-containing enzymes which are listed on page 53 of my
      GTBD book. Our bodies run on enzymes and we are hard put to lose
      any of them. Even the brain requires them. Phosphate also
      regulates body pH. (ed. note: We have located an excellent source
      of food grade Monosodium Phosphate which is V. L. Clark Chemical
      Company, 888-852-2436, www.vlclark.com or sales@vlclark.com)<br>
      <br>
      (ref 8) Vitamin C powder at Trader Joes is $9.99/lb. Put 1 level
      tsp (4 g) in a glass, add 1/2 tsp Arm and Hammer baking soda, add
      1 inch of water, let fizz, dilute to 8 oz and drink. The compound
      made here is fresh sodium ascorbate. This is about 1000 x as
      soluble as C, and is more reactive towards antibody and connective
      tissue construction and viral destruction. Thus the gums knit back
      to the teeth, avoiding any kind of oral surgery for "receding
      gums." Receding gums are nothing but gum pockets caused by
      toothpaste and especially fluoride, which severs all proteins
      because of its highly negative character. Fluoride is the smallest
      negative ion on earth, and consequently is the most intensely
      negative particle on earth. As such, fluoride breaks the positive
      hydrogen bonds, which hold the coils together, in proteins and
      enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 9) We know that bacteria have nothing to do with loss of
      enamel. Witness the billions of animal and human remains in the
      earth which have lost all the flesh and are reduced to tooth
      enamel and bones. It is quite evident that the teeth have been
      through bacterial contact but are unaffected. The same with human
      teeth. They cannot be affected by bacteria, because there is no
      carbon or hydrogen in enamel, which bacteria subsist on. Study of
      streptococcic mutans as a source of so-called "decay" is a waste
      of government funding donated to dental organizations.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 10) Sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose) were found in my
      laboratory studies to be unable to dissolve calcium phosphate to
      any extent, even in hot water solution. The reason for this is
      that the chelation process of the sugar towards teeth is slow
      because of the large size of the molecule and perhaps for the
      particular shape of the chelate formed. Sugars are not the cause
      of tooth cavities to any great extent, but still it will do no
      harm to rinse them off the teeth after consuming candy, especially
      the sticky variety. The adhering barrier will prevent
      reenamelization.<br>
      <br>
      (ref 11) Fluoride at very low levels destroys at least 66 out of
      83 enzymes (p. 53, GTBD) by uncoupling the hydrogen bond linkage
      between the enzyme coils. Fluoride causes 113 known ailments (p.
      54, GTBD). Ten of these were established through double blind
      studies, which although noteworthy, may be of no more significance
      than the individual diagnoses.<br>
      <br>
      Fluoride in the gels used (inappropriately) to harden the enamel
      is extremely toxic at a concentration of 13,000 ppm (1.3%). Keith
      Kantor of McMinneville Oregon was killed in the dentist's chair 3
      years ago by swallowing half a teaspoon of the gel. His brother
      nearly died from the same treatment, but was saved by having
      calcium gluconate administered to him.<br>
      <br>
      Three kidney dialysis patients at the University of Chicago
      Medical School were killed 3 years ago when nurses used unpurified
      Chicago tap water for dialysis. Chicago water has 2 ppm fluoride
      in it during the winter. Fluoridated water is lethal to dialysis
      patients. Fluoride is also very harmful to the kidneys of ordinary
      people.<br>
      <br>
      One can look up the lethal dose of a large number of chemicals all
      the way from botulinum and snake poison toxins to sugar, a
      non-toxin, on pages 57and 58 of my book GTBD. It is interesting
      that the lethal dosage of fluoride compound for a 50 kg man is 2.5
      mg (fluoroacetic acid), and 400 mg for arsenic oxide. Numerous
      people, animals and fish on earth, especially in the U.S., have
      been killed by fluoride, but very few, if any, by arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      Toothpaste companies now are required to put warning signs on
      tubes so children will not consume enough of the 1000 ppm (.1%)
      material to make them sick or cause death. This requirement arises
      out of lawsuits in which children were poisoned by
      fluoride-containing toothpaste.<br>
      <br>
      The best available data indicates about 120,000 cancer patients
      are killed annually because of fluoride in their drinking water.
      These include patients with every type of cancer. The dramatic
      increase of cancer cases in the US in recent times can probably be
      laid directly on the shoulders of the dentists due to their
      tireless energies in converting city councils to put fluoride in
      the water for "the children's teeth." They are able to do this
      because of large government grants. It is irrational to believe
      just "anything" in the environment causes cancer. The unique
      character of fluoride ion in destroying enzymes deserves
      attention.<br>

      <br>
      April 2002 Dear Government Executive and Employee: We can all stop
      spending billions for American dental work and research. Let me
      tell you why: I have learned the real causes of dental cavities
      and gum infection. People, including you, will now be able to take
      care of their own dentistry with insignificant cost, and end with
      perfect teeth. Cavities and gum infections are ended! A great
      amount of REPUTABLE DENTAL RESEARCH proves the following:<br>
      <br>
      Tooth cavities will be ended simply by rinsing acids off the
      teeth. ACIDS ALONE EAT THE ENAMEL. THERE WOULD BE NO CAVITIES IN
      THE WORLD if all people rinsed acids from their teeth promptly.
      Just sip water, milk or other liquid while eating. Water reacts
      with acids.<br>
      <br>
      Foods and drinks, other than those containing acids, have no
      action on tooth enamel. SUGARS HAVE NO ACTION ON THE ENAMEL.<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria cannot damage the enamel (calcium hydroxy phosphate).
      There is no such thing as decay of the enamel since bacteria
      require carbon and hydrogen to live. Billions of human and animal
      remains show teeth and bones are resistant to earth-bound
      organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Teeth reenamalize when clean. TO MAKE TEETH CLEAN ONE BRUSHES WITH
      ANY BAR SOAP. Soap washes off in just 2 rinses. What about
      toothpastes? Glycerine in all tooth pastes is so sticky that it
      takes 27 washes to get it off. Teeth brushed with any toothpaste
      are coated with a film and CANNOT PROPERLY REENAMELIZE.<br>
      <br>
      Taking calcium and phosphate in the diet results in
      reenamelization of the teeth, but only when they are clean. Bar
      soap does a perfect job in cleaning the surface. The enamel
      thickens and becomes less sensitive. Adenosine diphosphatase
      furnishes phosphate to teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Gums are disinfected by brushing with any bar soap. Not only
      bacteria and viruses are destroyed promptly by small amounts of
      soap in water, but also white flies and aphids. Gardeners: Spray 1
      tsp of dishwashing soap in 1 gallon of water to kill white flies
      and aphids.<br>
      <br>
      Plaque, a poorly formed crystal stuck to the bottom of the enamel,
      is prevented and eventually removed by brushing with bar soap.
      Dental procedures to get the badly formed crystals off dig holes
      through the enamel. These cavities catch food and cause gum
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      Prevention of plaque retards gum pockets. GUM POCKETS are formed
      as the plaque pushes the gums away from the teeth. GUM POCKETS,
      from 1 to 8 mm deep, ARE ALSO FORMED BY FLUORIDE, WHICH SEVERS THE
      PROTEIN MOLECULES ADHERING THE GUMS TO THE TEETH. SOAP PREVENTS
      GINGIVITIS caused by bacteria which is lodged in the gum pockets.<br>
      <br>
      VITAMIN C AND PHOSPHATE help knit the gums back to the teeth.
      Pressing against the gums with fingers forces adhesive materials
      from the gums onto the teeth, which helps the process. Abscesses
      can be offset by holding Cepacol (14% alcohol) in the mouth 5
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      "Receding gum" surgery will end when the GUM POCKETS cease. The
      very mention of the procedure, which involves transferring flesh
      from the roof of the mouth to the excised area of the gums, is a
      heinous and useless procedure which ought to pass into oblivion.<br>
      <br>
      REMOVAL OF FLUORIDE FROM DRINKING WATER, PASTES OR GELS SAVES THE
      ENZYME ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATASE so it can deliver phosphate to
      calcium at the tooth surface, RESULTING IN A BEAUTIFUL,
      SEMI-FLEXIBLE ENAMEL.<br>
      <br>
      As stated above, THE GUMS CAN BE RECONNECTED TO THE TEETH BY
      TAKING VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID) (1 tsp) with Arm and Hammer
      baking soda (1/2 tsp) in 1 inch of water, letting it fizz and then
      diluting to 1/2 to 1 cup with water, then drinking. The resulting
      SODIUM ASCORBATE is non-acid, very pure and a thousand times more
      soluble than vitamin C. SODIUM ASCORBATE IS MORE REACTIVE THAN
      ASCORBIC ACID (C) in building connective tissue and antibody
      structures and more effective in killing some viruses and
      bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Receding gums and plaque are ended when soap is used for brushing
      and VITAMIN C IS TAKEN DAILY AS DESCRIBED IN #12.<br>
      <br>
      30% of American youths ages 8-10 have no cavities. 100% of Ugandan
      youths ages 6-10 have no cavities. What does this tell us?<br>
      <br>
      THE REASON UGANDAN YOUTHS HAVE 3 TIMES BETTER TEETH THAN AMERICAN
      YOUTHS IS BECAUSE they do not consume as many acid foods. have no
      fluoride in their drinking water, have regular meals rather than
      sipping acid drinks all day, have more calcium and phosphate in
      their diet, and have fewer dentists to "WORK ON" their teeth.<br>
      <br>
      DENTAL LITERATURE says 42% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 HAVE NO NATURAL
      TEETH while 25% OF THOSE OVER 43 HAVE NONE.<br>
      <br>
      Dental literature says AMERICANS AGE 43 AVERAGE 32 CAVITIES, those
      AGE 17 HAVE 13 CAVITIES, blacks and poverty stricken (without
      calcium and phosphate) have twice this and the native Americans
      have four times this amount. The NATIVE AMERICAN PLIGHT CAN BE
      BLAMED ON THEIR POOR NUTRITION, EXCESSIVE FLUORIDATION AND FREE
      BUT IMPROPER DENTAL CARE.<br>
      <br>
      IF FLUORIDATION WERE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING CAVITIES, NATIVE
      AMERICANS WOULD HAVE THE LEAST CAVITIES OF ANY GROUP. THEY HAVE
      HAD FORCED FLUORIDATION FOR APPROXIMATELY 62 YEARS.<br>
      <br>
      Spokesmen for national groups are beginning to notice AN ALARMING
      RISE IN CAVITIES AMONG CHILDREN AND TEENS. Same dentists recommend
      DENTAL SEALANTS, especially for older teens not previously
      considered candidates for the treatment. But if sealants are now
      ordered, AREN'T DENTISTS ADMITTING NO CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF
      FLUORIDE TO PREVENT CAVITIES?<br>
      <br>
      FLUORIDE in water at I part per million INCREASED TOOTH CAVITIES
      in four large reliable studies 7.22.45 and 10% (average 21 %). The
      reason far these increases has to do with the fact that adenosine
      diphosphatase is destroyed by fluoride and CALCIUM FLUORIDE which
      slips into the enamel, IS ALIEN TO THE TOOTH COMPOSITE AND MAKES
      THE ENAMEL WEAK, BRITTLE AND DISCOLORED.<br>
      <br>
      THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN TEETH WILL INCREASE TO BE VERY NEARLY
      PERFECT if the regimen of WATER RINSING, SOAP BRUSHING AND TAKING
      CALCIUM, PHOSPHATE AND VITAMIN C IN THE DIET is implemented.<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, we now know the current 'teeth perfecting protocol"
      of dentistry with fluoridation is flawed. IF THE EARLY ESTIMATES
      OF 80% TOOTH IMPROVEMENT IN CHILDRENS' TEETH BY AGE 13 WERE TRUE,
      EACH AMERICAN WOULD NOW HAVE LESS THAN ONE CAVITY. That is far
      from true. The teeth in America are in a sorry state, AND AT THE
      PRESENT TIME ARE GETTING WORSE.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous top scientists over the past 60 years have discarded the
      theory that fluoride helps teeth, or is a nutrient helpful to man<br>
      <br>
      TO AVOID FLUORIDE IS TO PREVENT MORE THAN 114 AILMENTS listed with
      references in a book Good Teeth Birth to Death by Gerard F. Judd,
      Ph.D.. These 114 MEDICAL SIDE EFFECTS extend all the way from
      cancer down to headaches CAUSED BY 1 PPM FLUORIDE IN THE WATER.
      Thirteen of these side effects are proved by a double blind study
      on 60 patients by 12 physicians, 1 pharmacist and 1 attorney.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism for destruction of enzymes by fluoride has been
      proven by x-ray studies. Hydrogen bonds are broken by fluoride.<br>
      <br>
      Fluoride is the smallest negative particle on the face of the
      earth. Since the FLUORIDE PARTICLES ARE SO SMALL and so intensely
      negative, THEY CONNECT WITH THE HYDROGEN BONDS HOLDING THE ENZYME
      COILS IN PLACE and ruin every enzyme molecule at very low
      concentration, around 1-3 ppm. These enzymes are often 3,000 or
      more times the small size of the fluoride. The effect is ruinous.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid fluoride is to prevent the destruction of 83 enzymes
      listed with references in Good Teeth, Birth to Death, by Gerard F.
      Judd, Ph.D.. FLUORIDE IS A SEVERE BIOLOGICAL POISON. Being
      intensely negative, it unlatches positive hydrogen bonds in
      enzymes AND proteins.<br>
      <br>
      It is fortunate we have learned fluoride is a nerve poison.
      FLUORIDE CAUSES CAVITIES. There is not the slightest doubt.<br>
      <br>
      Methylmercury formed from amalgams in the body is deadly. It
      causes brain disease. Fillings made of quartzite and epoxy are a
      safe substitute.<br>
      <br>
      Fluoride harms the economy by MAKING PEOPLE PURCHASE OTHER THAN
      CITY WATER to avoid it. It also harms the economy by making people
      dependent an undependable professions that know nothing about it.
      Ignorance about fluoride and what it does is worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      Keep the teeth moist. Teeth that are dry "craze" (crack). If you
      chew ice, teeth may crumble. Teeth do have a breaking strength.<br>
      <br>
      LOOK IN YOUR MOUTH. Tell the dentist(s) what you want done and get
      several bids for examination and work. Save your fortunes.<br>
      <br>
      We now know we can cancel the green light given by Harry Truman
      with the help of Congress TO SUBSIDIZE DENTISTRY. BILLIONS OF
      DOLLARS BEING WASTED in this regard (Public Law 755, June 24,1948)
      CAN NOW BE RETURNED TO THE TAXPAYERS.<br>
      <br>
      I hope you will put this information in the hands of your Congress
      persons so they and we may alert the newspapers, radio and TV
      stations, magazines, and all other news media as well as their
      friends, families, and associates about this giant leap in dental
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      I ask for your feedback on this letter and I would also like you
      to ask for feedback from the ones you contact. THIS IS VERY
      IMPORTANT!<br>
      <br>
      Respectfully yours,<br>
