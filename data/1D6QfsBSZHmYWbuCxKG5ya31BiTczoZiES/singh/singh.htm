      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive my Indica," says Somender Singh,
        giving me the keys. The engine is noiseless and the power
        exhilarating. The wheel-spinning indicates that the car is tuned
        to race performance. It can go into top gear at speeds as low as
        20 kilometres from where it moves to top speed in no time, even
        with the air conditioner on. There is no chugging or knocking.
        The fuel consumed is minimum, considering that the car can move
        in top gear through congested roads. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singh's Indica (and his Victor motorbike)
        seems to have all the characteristics one dreamed of in a single
        machine thanks to his 'design to improve turbulence in
        combustion chambers'. "The Indica you drove was this technology
        in motion," says Singh, who has a US patent (No. 6237579) for
        the design. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technology is the result of decades of
        self-funded research in his garage (Garuda R&amp;D) at home in
        Mysore, Karnataka. A self-made engineer who was a racing legend
        in the 70s and 80s, Singh has to his credit more than 1,500
        flying hours in his three home-built ultralight aircraft powered
        by motorcycle engines. He has spent the better part of his life
        understanding engine designs and modifying them for extreme
        applications. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dreaming up an idea is one thing," says
        Singh. "Transforming that into reality is challenging. Patenting
        the idea in the US with no past experience is like scaling an
        unknown peak barefoot hoping it will be named after you."
        Helping him get the patent in 2001 were friends and racing
        associates Joe P. Joseph and Stephan G. Matzuk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singh and friends have approached market
        leaders such as Ford Global Technologies and Briggs &amp;
        Stratton of the US, and Rotax Bombardier of Austria with the
        design. "Most companies have long-drawn procedures, which
        require you to sign a disclosure document, confidential waiver
        along with an unsolicited project proposal empowering them to
        test out the design without your involvement," he says. "People
        are reluctant to take new ideas that come from outside the
        industry and the scientific community." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is frustrating, especially when he has
        transformed around 70 vehicles including the Ford Escort, Ikon,
        Opel Astra, Cielo, Matiz, Fiat Uno and Palio, the full range of
        Marutis and the older generation of automatic gear transmission
        cars besides every possible Indian bike one can think of. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the manufacturers turned him down
        saying that 'our products are perfected and certified, hence any
        changes will require approval from our principals'. Some even
        said that he would lose his warranty because he had tampered
        with the engine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singh says that manufacturers are secretive
        about their upcoming products, "little realising that confined
        nuts like me will find more ways than one to better the
        performance as there is plenty of scope for improvement in
        products that are produced on a mass scale". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's refinements in engine, he argues,
        are restricted to electronic gadgetry, sensors and systems that
        support the main computer governing the engine management
        systems. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The internals of the cylinder have not
        changed much since the early overhead valve designs except for
        additional valves, ports and twin igniters to improve
        performance," says Singh, whose design involves changes in the
        combustion chamber of the IC engines. All the air and fuel
        charge is compressed into and ignited in this chamber. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of this 'bang' inside the
        cylinder reflects on the engine's efficiency to burn fuel. Lab
        experiments show that Singh's design improves the thermal
        efficiencies of the engines. It also produces noticeable
        increase in torque and power along with low emissions of unburnt
        hydrocarbon, carbon-monoxide, carbondioxide and nitric oxides.
        "Most people in the industry and the scientific community doubt
        my claims," says Singh. "I will prove them wrong." </p>

      <p>The internal combustion engine—or is it the 'infernal'
        combustion engine, to you?— isn't going to go away in a hurry.
        Hate it all you want, live without it if you can, but millions
        of them are burning petro fuels right now and warming up the
        globe. And they are breeding faster than ever before. So, our
        best chances are with taming them into better behaviour.
        Somender Singh, a home-spun, hands-on tinkerer in Mysore,
        Karnataka may have bred just such an animal. </p>
      <p>When reporting technology breakthroughs, it's best to first
        answer, "what was the problem?" The problem here,is accelerated
        depletion of fossil fuels, emission of pollutants and climate
        change due to global warming, all majorly contributed by I C
        engines. Singh's invention may not stop any of these, but it
        will buy our planet more time in which to come up with the magic
        bullet. </p>
      <p>We owe this story to reader John Norris who scooped this good
        news from 'Popular Science' magazine, which has featured Singh's
        work. It's rare for an Indian innovation or product to appear in
        this 100+ year old publication. It is the equivalent of 'Nature'
        magazine for technology and innovation. It is very selective
        about its content. For example, over the decades it has devoted
        no more than 1000 words per achievement of Burt Rutan, the
        serial aeronautical innovator, the very man who recently built
        and propelled SpaceShipOne into outer space. Bimbettes can
        appear sooner on Time magazine covers than inventors in Popular
        Science's inner pages. </p>
      <p>In its August 21 edition, it has run a 5000 word essay on
        Singh. We had better take notice. And empathise with him. The
        poor man has endured enough of the humiliation of Indian
        pioneers—of being recognised abroad and being ignored at home.
        But let's savour his achievement first. </p>
      <p>Charles Graeber, author of the Popular Science article on
        Singh, says the I C engine has scarcely changed in its essence
        of a "boom that turns a crank", since Christiaan Huygens in
        1673, exploded gunpowder in a chamber to push a piston down. In
        the over 300 years since, all we have managed is to extract 28%
        out of gasoline's 'boom' in our engines. The rest is wasted and
        pushed into the atmosphere as heat and pollutants. </p>
      <p>Somender Singh, grew up fascinated by bikes and speed. He was
        forever trying to make his machines go that bit faster. He is a
        tech-school drop out but a good mechanic. Singh intuited that if
        one wanted to improve efficiency of engines, one has to extract
        more from the fuel that goes in. Singh's solution is "a concave
        bit of steel, with rough grooves scored through the four axes
        like the points of a compass. It looks a bit like a homemade
        ashtray." </p>
      <p>Incorporating this design into the cylinder head of his test
        engine, Singh witnessed some amazing improvements: the engine
        consumed between 10 and 20% less fuel, the exhaust was
        distinctly cooler and yet, the spark plug — when pulled out —
        was blue-hot. Clearly, the cauldron inside was busier, but
        little energy escaped it as exhaust. The Singh Chamber was
        improving combustion. </p>
      <p>Greater revelations awaited when a Singh engine powered a car.
        He was "able to keep his car in fourth gear at 500 rpm without
        sputtering or pinging", and "It was zippier. And in third gear I
        could slow down to 20 kph with no engine knock, and just speed
        up smoothly, like you would in first gear". It was as though you
        didn't need a gear-box at all. Singh calls it the "Direct Drive
        Engine". </p>
      <p>Singh was awarded US Patent No 6237579 in May 2001. A greater
        tribute — if imitation be deemed as such —f ollowed: General
        Electric came up, in two months flat, with a 'me-too' device.
        After that euphoria however, Singh has been climbing steeper
        mountains — of neglect and impediments that India places on her
        sons. </p>
      <p>He wrote to every conceivable person of substance. Nobody
        showed any interest. He has spent money and humiliating time
        trying to persuade people. Take this as an example of the laws
        we have: it turns out that no government funded lab will test an
        engine unless the engine builder approves. It's like saying we
        may not assay Coca Cola, unless Atlanta allows. </p>
      <p>Singh spent weeks in a bug-ridden hotel in Pune trying to get
        his engine tested at Automotive Research Association of India
        [ARAI]. Test showed that a Singh modified engine consumed
        between 10 and 42% less fuel and ran 16 degC cooler. Yet no one
        has come up to champion him. He is close to bitterness, though
        recently Tata Motors has evinced some early interest. </p>
      <p>Graeber quotes a US expert:"what Singh needs to prove his
        concept is a standard, scientific A:B test, on a standard
        engine, preferably something mainstream and dyno testing with a
        five-gas analyzer. Then he needs to take one of his modified
        cylinder heads, swap it out on the same engine, and dyno test
        that. A to B. Even if the emissions don't go down a whisker, if
        there's an increase in fuel economy, my god, that's a win... the
        world's your oyster." </p>
      <p>Why is it so hard for an Indian to get that test done here? The
        longish Popular Science article is worth a read,for it
        highlights areas that Indians must agitate against. </p>
      <p>Here's a do-able road-map. For a start, GoodNewsIndia appeals
        to a reader out there, willing to track down Somender Singh in
        Mysore [Speedwell Tune Up Centre and Garuda R&amp;D is all the
        lead we have] and send his address, phone and email to be added
        here. Once it's here, you can write and express your
        appreciation. Next, you can button-hole your favourite
        politician, industrialist or bureaucrat, post in message boards
        and newsgroups. Maybe some doors will open for this man. </p>
      <p>India has many tinkerers in the great Yankee tradition Many are
        unlettered and unaware of the roads they must take to realise
        their potential. Singh would be a role-model if he succeeds. He
        must therefore, get his hearing. </p>

            the simple key to boosting the efficiency of the gasoline
            engine. Now a barefoot tinkerer in India believes he has
            unlocked the door. Is he for real?</i> </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Charles Graeber</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>India is booming. The expanding population has overwhelmed the
        Bangalore-Mysore road the way a river floods its banks, and the
        flow of two-way traffic is choked with a living history of human
        transportation. There are belching herds of diesel trucks,
        diesel buses and iron-framed diesel tractors. There are
        wooden-wheeled carts pulled by brightly painted Brahma bulls,
        and two-stroke-motor rickshaws fueled by kerosene or cooking oil
        or whatever else is flammable and cheap. There are mopeds and
        bipeds and bicycles and motorcycles, and every conceivable type
        of petrol-powered, internally combusting automobile, from
        doddering Ambassador cabs to gleaming 16-valve Mercedes
        miracles. But there’s only one car like the one Somender Singh
        and I are riding in right now. </p>
      <p>That’s because Singh invented it. Or rather, reinvented a piece
        of it: a small detail on the engine that he calls “direct
        drive.” He claims that his invention makes an engine cleaner,
        quieter and colder than its internal-combustion cousins around
        the world — while using up to 20 percent less gas. </p>
      <p>“Some people say to me, ’Singh, why are you wasting your time
        on such a thing?’” he yells, his singsong Indian English barely
        piping above the tooting traffic. “But I tell you sir—I tell the
        world: I have conquered the internal combustion engine!” </p>
      <p>To hear Singh tell it, his story has all the makings of a
        Bollywood movie, a classic heartwarmer about a small-fry Indian
        grease monkey who challenges the big boys armed only with a
        dream and a dirty wrench. And there’s no doubt that he has come
        up with something new, at least in the eyes of the U.S. Patent
        Office. But has a potbellied philosopher- mechanic from Mysore
        really discovered the efficiency El Dorado sought by every auto
        manufacturer, R&amp;D center and thermal engineer from Detroit
        to Darmstadt? </p>
      <p>Well, maybe. So far, all Singh’s invention has earned him is a
        few polite rejection letters from presidents, professors and
        auto manufacturers — while costing him tens of thousands of
        borrowed rupees and an untold number of sleepless nights. His
        eyes are glazed with the heat of an idea he can neither sell nor
        surrender. Mostly, he seems to have discovered the hard way that
        in 2004, it takes more than a patent and personal conviction to
        reinvent the automobile. </p>
      <p>Even though Mysore is only a few hours south of the Indian IT
        epicenter of Bangalore, most of its 700,000 inhabitants lead
        traditional lives seemingly untouched by technology. The poor
        still work the fields and factories as they have for centuries,
        weaving silk or hand-rolling sandalwood incense; the last raja
        still lives in a whitewashed fairy-tale palace framed in stained
        glass and 97,000 lightbulbs. And every fall rich and poor alike
        make their pilgrimage up Chamundi Hill to pray to the mountain
        goddess who has watched over their tile-roofed city since time
        began. This is a place of yoga and vegetarian food, of barefoot
        men swathed in traditional white longhis and women draped
        elegantly in colorful saris. </p>
      <p>In such a place, Somender Singh has long been an eccentric — a
        blue-jeans rock-’n’-roller, a leather-jacketed motorcycle race
        champion and homegrown Evel Knievel, an autodidactic birdman who
        soars above the palaces and red clay roofs in Mysore’s first and
        only motorized hang glider. Like most Indians, he is a reverent
        man; he prays to the mountain goddess for strength and wears a
        green ring from his guru to cool his fiery heart. But unlike
        most Indians, he also worships at the altar of the speed demon.
      </p>
      <p>Singh has craved it for as long as he can remember: real
        bad-ass, teeth-gritting speed. And when, at age 10, a cricket
        ball to the eye destroyed his chances of following his father
        into the air force, Singh was destined to find that speed on the
        ground. So in 1968, following the time-honored tradition, he
        dropped engineering college for the old-school curriculum of
        trial and error and the dog-eared hot-rod canon of J.E.G.
        Harwood’s Speed and How to Obtain It and Gordon Jennings’s
        Two-Stroke Tuner’s Handbook. He bought a motorcycle and then
        dedicated his health to racing it. When the sponsors wouldn’t
        touch him, he started his own team and called it Speedwell — and
        it did, winning more than 120 trophies for him as a racer in
        national and international events, and some 400 more for the
        machines he tuned. </p>
      <p>Winning made Singh a local celebrity, to the point that when
        the first movie musicals were being made in the local Kannada
        language, the producers tapped him for typecast guest
        appearances—first as a pompadoured rocker strumming an electric
        guitar to Elvis’s “Hound Dog,” then as a daredevil motorcycle
        stuntman jumping stairs and cars. When a 1986 cycling accident
        left him with a broken shoulder and collarbone, Singh traded his
        helmet for a wrench and hung out his shingle as a mechanic. Now
        if you own a performance vehicle and are passing within a day’s
        drive of Mysore, Singh’s garage is a pilgrimage site of its own.
      </p>
      <p>To get there, simply follow the Mysore road to a small sign
        announcing the headquarters of Speedwell Tune Up Centre and
        Garuda R&amp;D. Beyond the sign you’ll find a little metal gate
        and a 50-foot yard containing a few cars, more motorcycles and
        the familiar open darkness of a working mechanic’s garage.
        Singh’s workshop doubles as the family home he shares with his
        wife and 10-year-old daughter. Out front, sleeping dogs and
        rusting car chassis lie in the shade of a rain tree. His
        assistants — four kids, their hair in modified d.a.’s, wearing
        rolled dungarees—peer into the mystery revealed beneath an open
        hood. </p>
      <p>Singh’s office is in the back, separated from the greasy piles
        of engines and parts by a beige shower curtain. On the walls,
        competing for space between the pictures of Christian saints and
        Hindu gods and the standard mechanic’s warnings against urgent
        jobs and requested credit, are yellowed clippings celebrating
        Singh’s earlier life of speed. “Singh Takes the Day,” one reads,
        and “5,000cc Man Machine.” The grainy photocopies show a man who
        seems a lifetime younger, his eyes black and staring, his rugged
        mug framed with thick black hair. Below the photos, and a
        menacing poster of two jets about to collide in midair, is a
        sign bearing Singh’s motto: We specialize in work which few
        understand. “And this has been my problem sir,” Singh says with
        a shrug. He settles in behind a metal desk heaped with paper and
        parts. “It has been my problem ever since I started this whole
        business of whatever I started doing in my life.” </p>
      <p>It’s On this desk, somewhere Under the tools and parts and the
        notebooks crammed with letters and diagrams, that you’ll find a
        concave bit of steel, with rough grooves scored through the four
        axes like the points of a compass. It looks a bit like a
        homemade ashtray. In fact, it is Singh’s problem — his
        invention. Even as a prototype, it’s high-concept but
        exceptionally low-tech, the sort of thing you might be able to
        make in your own garage with a steady hand and a Dremel tool.
        Which is, essentially, what Singh did. </p>
      <p>“I am no great genius man, no man with letters after his name
        or fancy institutions, and what I have invented is really very
        simple,” he admits, as he pushes aside the clutter to reveal a
        child’s chalkboard. “But to understand even so simple a concept,
        you first must have a basic understanding of the forces at work
        within the combustion cylinder, the concept of turbulence and
        combustion which define the engine.” </p>
      <p>Singh takes the chalk and draws a rectangle with a domed top: a
        combustion chamber and the cylinder head, the ashtray-like piece
        of metal he has modified. Then he draws a diagonal line across
        the edge of that dome, then another, representing the grooves he
        has carved — his invention. The grooves are supposed to better
        mix the air and fuel inside the chamber. Singh is convinced that
        it makes combustion more efficient. </p>
      <p>If a child’s chalkboard seems an overly basic tool for
        explaining a new engineering concept, remember that the internal
        combustion engine is itself hardly rocket science. Its
        fundamental conceit—a boom in a closed chamber, a zoom
        translated through piston, rod and crank — has remained pretty
        much unchanged since 1673, when the Dutch physicist Christiaan
        Huygens designed a brilliant, nonfunctional, closed-cylinder,
        piston-driven engine that ran on gunpowder. The functional,
        liquid-fueled version of that invention — the internal
        combustion engine (ICE) — has been with us for about 200 years,
        over which time it has transformed itself from Swiss engineer
        Francois Isaac de Rivaz’s wonky four-wheeled hydrogen
        thingamabob (1807) to the fairly familiar gas-fuel innovations
        of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler (late 1880s) and then wrapped
        under the familiar body shapes of Henry Ford (early 1900s). </p>
      <p>Since then, gas has risen in octane, and the carburetor has
        been invented and largely discontinued. Engine emphasis has
        shifted from deep power to muscle to fuel economy and back,
        engineers have realized that compression is a key to maximizing
        thermal efficiency, and inventing the automobile has grown from
        an amateur’s obsession to a multinational juggernaut. But all of
        that is really just window dressing. The basic concept—the boom
        that turns a crank—has not really changed at all. And one of the
        physical fundamentals of that basic concept is turbulence. </p>
      <p>Turbulence is the chaotic movement of fuel and air through the
        ICE’s combustion chamber—the swirl and tumble that makes
        hydrocarbons and oxygen combine fast and furiously in an
        efficient engine. Compressed fuel stagnates and separates and
        burns inefficiently, if at all — imagine trying to burn a phone
        book without fanning the pages. Turbulence mixes it up, fans
        those pages. It’s what allows modern high-compression engines to
        go boom. </p>
      <p>A hundred years ago, turbulence was to automotive engineers
        what chaos is to the Old Testament: a raw randomness ungoverned
        by words or math, an unordered whirlwind of particles as
        inexpressible to engineers as angels dancing on the head of a
        pin were uncountable to Sir Thomas More. Then came a Cambridge
        don named Harry Ricardo. </p>
      <p>Like Singh, Sir Harry was a bit of an eccentric and was
        obsessed with motorcycles—though back in 1906, Ricardo was
        forced to create his own bike, by equipping his velocipede with
        a steam-powered engine fueled by coal fed from his own bulging
        pockets. As a proto?grease monkey, Ricardo intuitively
        recognized that air and fuel burn best when mixed. He then
        became the first to test the notion in the lab, measuring burn
        rates against the speed of a fan. The faster the fan, the better
        the burn; Ricardo had found the key to the boom. </p>
      <p>Modern automotive engineers want turbulence, and they can
        describe it, just as modern mathematicians can describe chaos.
        What you want are swirling eddies of air and fuel mix, each
        variegated into smaller sub-eddies, and so on, down to
        individual molecules. Imagine it as a cascading Mandelbrot set
        of air and fuel inside the chamber. Then there’s a spark, and
        the whole thing goes off like a daisy chain of fire, a giant
        fractal fuse. </p>
      <p>Engineers have devised all manner of technologies to create
        this particular form of chaos in their combustion chambers, from
        ornately angulated fuel injectors and domed cylinder heads to
        swirl-and-tumble-inducing atomizers. But 100 years ago, Ricardo
        found a far easier way to make the air-fuel mix in an ICE more
        turbulent. He built a combustion chamber that was domed in the
        middle and tapered on the edges, like a derby hat, so that the
        edges of the rising piston would come very close to the angled
        edges of the cylinder head. The piston goes up, and the fuel
        along the edges squirts into the center, to mix and swirl near
        the spark plug. Imagine pinching the edges of a jelly doughnut.
        He called this concept “quench.” Today we call it “squish.” </p>
      <p>Squish! A laughably simple idea with a laughable name, but now
        almost every one of the billions of internal combustion engines
        operating around the planet employ some version of it—including
        virtually every engine Singh ever straddled in his 30 years in
        motorsports. </p>
      <p>Singh knew that to get his precious speed he had to fire the
        heart of the engine, the center of its mystery: the combustion
        chamber. It was here that fuel was turned to bang — and here
        that the efficiency of that bang had stalled out at around 28
        percent. The vast majority of the fuel was dissipated as engine
        heat or exhaust. </p>
      <p>In the history of automobiles, manufacturers had experimented
        with all sorts of shapes and valve arrangements to improve
        efficiency, but nobody had ever dramatically altered the surface
        of the chamber itself—perhaps, Singh reasoned, because engineers
        couldn’t see inside its metal walls and eyeball its forces. The
        combustion chamber was a mystery shrouded in plate steel. The
        very soul of the engine appeared ripe for improvement. </p>
      <p>“From the beginning of time, whatever I did was geared toward
        taking an engine, polishing the rough edges out of it, and
        getting some more performance from it,” Singh remembers. “And I
        certainly knew that it was not God who was manufacturing these
        engines in a factory. It was just human beings, men set on a
        time frame, assembling parts. So there is, then, great room to
        improve.” </p>
      <p>Singh needed his engines to work as efficiently as possible—he
        wanted the fuel to burn cleanly and under the maximum
        compression. But like most tuners, he had run up against
        compression’s upper limit, above which pockets of unburned fuel
        explode spontaneously, or “knock,” under the pressure. He knew
        that the flame front from the spark plugs wasn’t reaching all
        the fuel at the edges of the cylinders. </p>
      <p>One way to fight knock is with high-octane gasoline, which
        racers in countries like India have no access to. If Singh
        wanted more compression, he’d have to decipher the problem his
        way. So he started imagining: “My whole thing was, how on earth
        could one do something to mix it better?” </p>
      <p>The simplest answer was Ricardo’s squish, which Singh, like
        many tuners before him, maximized into a sort of supersquish by
        making the rising piston head come as close as possible to the
        squish band. But the knock just got worse; either the chaos of
        the supersquish turbulence was too much, or the exploding
        hydrocarbons he was hearing were trapped inside the squish band,
        isolated from the spreading flame at the point farthest from the
        spark plug. The compression was stagnating his air-fuel mix. He
        needed to stir it up, to make that eddied, fractal fuse between
        the edge of the squish band and the center of the spark. </p>
      <p>And so, armed with this intuition and a toolbox, Singh
        scratched his own small mark on Ricardo’s 100-year-old concept —
        through the squish band from the cylinder edge to the spark
        plug. Then he scratched another, and another. The first channels
        were shallow, and they quickly filled with hydrocarbons.
        Tentatively, he made them deeper. “We were very scared,” Singh
        confesses, and as he says it he sets down his nub of chalk in
        favor of a Gold Flake cigarette. “Maybe we were actually putting
        an induced crack into the head.” </p>
      <p>But the engine didn’t crack. It changed. The compression went
        up, but the engine noise went down. And it seemed to be using
        less fuel: Measuring with a drip syringe and a stopwatch, Singh
        determined that it was between 10 and 20 percent less. “Most
        definitely and immediately, sir, something was very different,”
        he says. “My combustion was so stable that I could bring the
        idling down to such a point that you could actually count the
        blades on the fan as it turned.” </p>
      <p>He felt the exhaust with his bare hand and noticed that it was
        running cooler. Yet when he removed the spark plug, he
        discovered that it had become blue, apparently from intense
        combustion-chamber heat. And when he ran his finger along the
        inside of the exhaust pipe, he noticed something else, or a lack
        of it: unburned hydrocarbons. His engine seemed to be running
        cleaner. In automotive terms, his squish-band channels seemed to
        have maximized combustion by propagating the laminar flame front
        from the spark plug to the edges of the cylinder at its top
        dead-center position, converting more fuel to expanding gases
        and piston work while avoiding the spontaneous combustion of
        unburned hydrocarbon emissions. In layman’s terms, they boomed
        better. </p>
      <p>So much better, in fact, that he was able to keep his car in
        fourth gear at 500 rpms without sputtering or pinging, even
        while navigating the local congestion of bullock carts,
        rickshaws, bikes and cars. His engine ran so slow that it nearly
        didn’t need the gearing of a transmission — thus, “direct
        drive.” </p>
      <p>He modified a motorcycle, then a two-stroke, then a
        four-stroke, then a car, then 50 cars. Finally he borrowed money
        from his mother-in-law and bought a spanking-new Tata Indica in
        which to showcase his design. He decorated it with “direct
        drive” in stick-on letters on the steering wheel and a bull’s
        head above the grill. Then he tested his idea on a few
        customers, including N. Bhanutej, a writer for a national weekly
        news magazine who owns a pokey 1.2-liter Fiat Palio. </p>
      <p>“Essentially, the whole car changed,” Bhanutej recounts. “It
        was zippier. And in third gear I could slow down to 20 kph with
        no engine knock, then press the petrol and just speed up
        smoothly, like you would in first gear.” He also found that his
        modified engine was strangely quiet. “At the stops, I sometimes
        needed to peek at the dashboard to make sure it was still
        running. It seemed like a different car.” The mechanic at
        Bhanutej ’s Fiat dealership thought so too. “He told me it was
        impossible for this type of car to perform this well,” Bhanutej
        says. “He kept asking about fuel additives.” </p>
      <p>Singh seemed to be onto something. Although he couldn’t prove
        scientifically that it worked, he felt sure that it did.
        Certainly, it was novel — Singh applied for a patent in January
        1999, and the U.S. Patent Office issued him No. 6237579 in May
        2001. Two months after his application hit the patent office Web
        site, engineers from General Electric applied for a nearly
        identical patent for an aftermarket design, which they claimed,
        as Singh had, would result in increased turbulence, and thus
        better fuel efficiency, with fewer emissions. </p>
      <p>“It’s very interesting, I think, that General Electric
        developed this idea after my patent became public,” Singh says
        with a smile. “But their design is very stupid. An add-on will
        never survive the intense forces of the combustion chamber. If I
        had come up with this idea, I would have been too embarrassed to
        tell anybody about it, let alone apply for the patent.” </p>
      <p>This roadside mechanic in Mysore had seemingly beaten a
        billion-dollar R&amp;D department. But what had he actually
        invented? Did it really work? Singh had his patent and his
        prototype. Now all that remained was to introduce his invention
        to the world. </p>
      <p>Ford Global Technologies generates most ideas internally,
        employing 1,200 innovators — an alphabet soup of Bachelors and
        Masters and Ph.D.s from more than 60 countries, who file around
        500 patents a year from gleaming Death Star?size facilities such
        as the Scientific Research Laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, and
        the Forschungszentrum in Aachen, Germany. Outsiders like Singh
        are encouraged to submit through the Web site, and every year,
        5,000 ideas pour in from inventors, academics, mechanics,
        customers and even children. </p>
      <p>But of course, submitting with the masses was not Singh’s
        style. After all, he had conquered the internal combustion
        engine; he didn’t want to just click through a legal waiver and
        throw his life’s work, his lottery ticket, into a virtual
        wishing well, with no promise of return. Instead he wrote
        directly to the company president, and he did it by mail, with
        stamps and a typed letter and his standard spark plug
        photograph. He wanted to be recognized, singled out, and ushered
        through the front door. When he found himself repeatedly
        referred to the public portal, Singh simply took his business
        elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Mostly, Singh spent his hope and energy writing to scientists.
        Surely, he thought, engineers would understand the significance
        of his idea! Or at least offer insight to what was happening
        inside his scratched cylinders. Singh writes the way he thinks,
        and his letters were excitable, florid documents in which his
        theories on combustion, turbulence and the environment were
        drawn in multiple colors and emphasized with triple interrobangs
        and exclamation marks. </p>
      <p>The scientists’ replies were more compact. He claimed to have
        conquered the internal combustion engine? Using poor fuel on
        engines of antiquated design, evaluated without scientific
        instruments and in third-world conditions? Had he tested the
        design for 500,000 miles, they wondered, as a proper R&amp;D lab
        would? He hadn’t — none of his modified engines had done more
        than 65,000 road miles. Had he tested it on non-Indian vehicles
        or with the kinds of fuel used in the developed world? (He
        hadn’t.) Had he put it on a proper dynamometer, tested
        horsepower and torque? (No, but there’s a reason....) Could he
        send them an official printout from a five-gas analyzer
        indicating the oxides of nitrogen and carbon and the unburned
        hydrocarbons and total fuel economy? In a word, no. </p>
      <p>It was possible that Singh’s invention was useful for the
        inefficient engines and poor-grade gasoline that crowd the
        Bangalore-Mysore road — but of course, any modern modification
        would improve on those ICE dinosaurs. So how, the scientists
        asked, did he know that his modification really did anything?
        Singh explained about the quiet and the low rpms, the blue spark
        plugs and clean tailpipes. “What more proof do we need?” he’d
        ask. “What more does the world need?” </p>
      <p>As the scientists had made clear, what the world needed was
        proof of concept, in the form of hard, numerical data. But in
        Singh’s India, getting numbers is not as easy as you might
        imagine. First there’s the price: The most basic dyno test costs
        25,000 rupees, or about $550, plus the cost of the engines,
        parts, assistants and fuel. That’s real money to amateurs
        anywhere; in India, where the average person earns around $250 a
        year, it’s real close to impossible. </p>
      <p>Even if you can manage the money, testing in India is a
        difficult proposition. Singh repeatedly beseeched Mico-Bosch, a
        Bangalore subsidiary of the German dyno-testing giant, to let
        him pay for an afternoon’s test, and was just as repeatedly
        blown off. As he quickly learned, there are only three
        government-authorized dyno-testing facilities in all of India,
        each used almost exclusively for manufacturers. An amateur
        inventor here — even one with 25,000 rupees in his pocket—can’t
        just walk in off the street and test any old engine he likes, at
        least not without the written permission of the engine’s
        manufacturer. </p>
      <p>“I imagined that these great men would say, 'OK, let us get
        down to the bloody bottom line! Let us see about what on earth
        can be happening!’” Singh says. “Or perhaps, at the very least,
        be willing to take my money.” </p>
      <p>The rule requiring manufacturer consent is apparently an effort
        to prevent individuals from disputing the official data on
        horsepower and emissions, as published by importers,
        manufacturers and the Indian government. “They don’t want any
        Ralph Naders popping up here,” Singh explains weakly. </p>
      <p>In November 2002 Singh actually received one such permission
        from a manufacturer to test his modification on its engines. The
        manufacturer was Briggs and Stratton, and the engines were two
        149cc side valves. Singh borrowed $3,000 and drove the 500 miles
        to the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) test
        facilities in Pune, but day after day, his test was delayed. He
        waited in a cheap hotel for two weeks, pacing, smoking, burning
        money. “It was a very frustrating experience,” Singh says,
        wringing the tension from his graying temples with permanently
        grease-stained fingers. “Sometimes it was like a bloody test of
        will.” </p>
      <p>Finally he was allowed to bring his engines and hook them to a
        Benz EC-70 dynamometer with a five-gas analyzer and a Benz
        gravimetric fuel-measuring device. A week later, he got his
        results. According to ARAI, at between 2,000 and 2,800 rpm,
        Singh’s modified engine used between 10 and 42 percent less fuel
        than its unmodified twin, with no appreciable losses in torque
        or power. And, as he suspected, it ran cooler too—as much as
        16°C cooler. </p>
      <p>This, it would seem, represented success on a massive scale.
        With record-high gas prices at the pump and intimations of
        global warming encroaching on the front page, the world’s auto
        manufacturers are investigating every option to simultaneously
        comply with federally mandated fuel-economy standards yet
        continue to feed the market for ever larger vehicles. This
        spring GM and Ford announced a joint investment of $1 billion to
        develop their own version of a six-gear automatic transmission
        already popular in Europe, to achieve perhaps a 4 percent
        increase in fuel economy. Singh’s invention, in contrast,
        offered five times that fuel savings. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Singh, Briggs and Stratton wasn’t interested
        in fuel economy — it wanted better emissions. And according to
        the test, Singh’s modification made emissions slightly worse.
        Things looked dire: Singh had lost his only sponsor and blown
        his money on a test that was essentially useless. </p>
      <p>“The problem is, it’s a side valve,” explains Steve Weiner, a
        35-year Porsche race-tuning veteran and the owner of Rennsport
        Systems in Portland, Oregon. “Nobody’s been using those things
        in our world since the 1950s. Not even on lawn mowers. They’re
        hugely inefficient and dirty.” </p>
      <p>According to Weiner, what Singh needs to prove his concept is a
        standard, scientific A:B test, on a standard engine, “preferably
        something mainstream — a high-efficiency shitbox even — and dyno
        testing with a five-gas analyzer. Then he needs to take one of
        his modified cylinder heads, swap it out on the same engine, and
        dyno test that. A to B. Even if the emissions don’t go down a
        whisker, if there’s an increase in fuel economy—my god, that’s a
        win. If you can even find that, the world’s your oyster. Whether
        it’s valid in the U.S. or not.” </p>
      <p>In short, what Singh needs to prove his ideas to the world is a
        test he can neither afford nor gain access to. It’s a simple
        fact, simple enough to diagram on a child’s chalkboard, and it’s
        driven him to the point of mania. He screws the green ring round
        and round his finger, then grabs himself by the face. “This
        bloody country,” Singh spits. “We have millions of dollars and
        millions of people for puja [a Hindu festival], but when one
        bloody inventor wants to get a simple engine tested . . .” </p>
      <p>Singh lets his sentence trail off into the stagnant heat of the
        empty garage. He sits, face in his hands, his elbows resting on
        patents and rejection letters. Five years ago, Singh was a local
        celebrity with a young family and the world by the tail. Now he
        just looks exhausted. He has written to everyone he can think
        of, he has prayed to every god who might take an interest in his
        cause. What he needs at the moment is a miracle. </p>
      <p>In the movie version of Somender Singh’s life, the phone rings.
        It’s a major auto manufacturer. They’ve gotten one of his
        letters, reviewed the patent, and they’re ready to deal. Singh’s
        idea gets tested in a world-class lab filled with computers and
        blinking lights; men in white coats look at their clipboards in
        disbelief, and Singh is handed a laurel of genius and a
        Publisher’s Clearing House Sweepstakes? size check for his
        squish-band scratch. As the credits roll, Singh loads his wife
        and daughter, Beverly Hillbillies?style, into his tiny
        direct-drive prototype and motors — efficiently, quietly, coolly
        — to a grand mansion with a gold-plated garage. The world is
        just and good. It’s hankie time. Lights up. </p>
      <p>In real life, Singh and I just sit there in the stifling heat
        of his little office. Flies turn lazy circles beneath the
        lifeless fans. The dog crosses the driveway to find a new cool
        spot on the garage floor. The next day it’s the same. And the
        next, and the next. </p>
      <p>And then one day, the phone rings. It’s Tata Motors. The
        $3.5-billion Indian auto manufacturer, which supplies
        automobiles to Rover UK, has received one of his letters. The
        Tata engineers have seen his patent and examined the photograph
        of his spark plugs. And they’re interested. If he’s willing to
        sign a five-year nondisclosure agreement, they’ll test his
        design further in their lab in Pune — on a proper dynamometer,
        with permission and everything. </p>
      <p>There are no promises of checks or mansions. But for the first
        time in his life, Singh’s dreams might be sponsored. His
        squish-band scratch might be good or not, it might improve gas
        mileage or not, it might save the planet or increase emissions
        and crack the cylinder heads. But at least now he’ll know for
        sure. Everyone will. Singh is getting his chance. </p>
      <p>Another man might start dancing on that pile of rejection
        letters, or roar off into the sunset on a modified squish-band
        motorcycle. But Singh has been riding the ups and downs of this
        plot for years, and he’s too careful or too superstitious to
        jinx himself with conspicuous joy. So he just places the phone
        carefully back in its cradle and sits there, staring ahead. He
        reaches for a cigarette. </p>
      <p>“You have to understand, I have been working at this for such a
        very long time,” he says finally. “Honestly, I am no longer
        certain whether it is possible for me to be happy.” He stands,
        and walks past the piles of parts and papers, to his
        hand-me-down computer. “But I tell you this,” he says. “At least
        now we can perhaps tell those 'No, no’ buggers out there that
        Mr. Singh is not completely off his rocker!” </p>
      <p>Then he sits down. </p>

      <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to improvements in combustion by
        enhancing the turbulence and multipoint ignition in two- and
        four-cycle internal combustion (I.C.) engines. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In normally aspirated two and four cycle I.C. engines the basic
        combustion process is as follows. The air-fuel mixture is drawn
        into the engine through the carburetor due to the low pressure
        created by the ascending or descending piston depending on two
        and four cycle. The controlled air-fuel mixture is then
        compressed by the rising piston in the cylinder to a desirable
        compression ratio determined by the fuel. The compressed gases
        are ignited through a spark plug located in the cylinder head
        before top dead center (TDC) resulting in a sharp increase in
        temperature and pressure inside the combustion chamber. The
        expanding gases push the piston down which in turn gets the
        crank rolling and storing the energy in a flywheel to do useful
        work. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, the flame velocity and degree of combustion have a
        direct bearing on the a) power output, b) efficiency of engine,
        c) fuel consumption, d) emission, e) operating temperature, f)
        sound and vibration levels and g) reliability. The flame
        velocity and degree of combustion are directly related to the
        state of turbulence in the charge prior to ignition. </p>
      <p>In existing combustion chambers designs in I.C. engines, the
        combustion chamber is the enclosed space within the cylinder,
        the cylinder-head and above the piston where burning of charge
        occurs. The combustion chambers play a vital role in engine
        characteristics. Since the inception of the I.C. engine, a lot
        of research and development has been carried out to perfect the
        combustion chamber to achieve maximum engine efficiency and
        reliability. The trend in combustion chamber design has been to
        direct the expanding forces caused due to combustion towards the
        piston crown and to avoid the dissipation of these forces in the
        direction that do not produce power. </p>
      <p>Two stroke combustion chambers, due to their relatively simple
        layouts, have evolved and revolved around hemispherical layouts
        with a center or offset spark plug location since their
        inception. Four stroke combustion chambers of the early types
        featured side valves layouts with their large volume low
        compression cylinder heads prone to detonation and low power
        outputs. </p>
      <p>The most notable research on combustion chambers in the early
        days was done by Sir Harry Recardo, who enlightened the world
        about the causes of Detonation and Pinging. Recardo discovered
        Pinging and Detonation arose through uncontrolled instantaneous
        combustion occurring in pockets of fuel in the extreme ends of
        the combustion chamber due to the extreme heat and pressure
        build up. Ricardo's solution was to concentrate the greater part
        of the clearance volume over the side valves layout and reducing
        greatly the clearance between the larger part of the combustion
        chamber which extended over the piston crown. In the Ricardo
        layout, the space between the piston and the cylinder head was
        so small and the surface so cool in relation to the combustion
        temperatures that the gases trapped in this "Quenched" area did
        not detonate in the combustion cycle under load. This was an
        improvement over other combustion chambers. Later over-head
        valve (O.H.V) layouts gained popularity due to several
        advantages and attained higher power outputs and sustained
        reliability. The shape and sizes of four stroke combustion
        chambers with their overhead valves layouts went through many
        design changes over the years. </p>
      <p>The four stroke combustion chamber layouts evolved through the
        plain cylindrical form with the required clearance volume, the
        bath tub type, the wedged shape type, and the hemispherical
        cross flow type. The hemispherical combustion chamber or
        hemi-head provides room to accommodate larger valves increasing
        volumetric efficiency and permits centrally located spark plug
        which contribute to more efficient combustion, better heat
        dissipation and higher thermal efficiency. </p>
      <p>The concept of a portion of the combustion chamber at close
        proximities to the piston crown at TDC came to be known as
        "squish" area or "squish" band earlier referred to as quenched
        area. In principle, the trapped charge between the piston crown
        and the squish area nearing TDC starts to be injected towards
        the main scoop of the combustion chamber causing turbulence
        prior to ignition greatly reducing detonation and pinging.
        Higher compression ratios are possible with squish bands
        resulting in improved engine efficiencies. Turbulence in the
        charge is also caused by inlet ports, their shapes, angles and
        surface finish. They greatly help to keep the air-fuel mixture
        bonded and in a homogeneous state at the point of entry only.
        Multipoint fuel injection basically achieves very fine break ups
        of fuel particles prior to entry on the intake stroke and
        achieves better combustion due to the ideal state of the charge.
      </p>
      <p>Two stroke engines have lesser volumetric efficiency due to the
        obstruction in the ports and short time/area available in the
        intake and transfer phase. Due to the size, shape and angles of
        the ports the charge is in a higher state of turbulence entering
        the cylinder than four strokes and requires far lesser ignition
        advance to operate efficiency irrespective to combustion chamber
        design. Four strokes require higher degree of ignition advance
        and assisted by vacuum advance to operate efficiently due to the
        lower state of turbulence and a denser charge before combustion.
        The turbulence inside the cylinder and head mainly helps to
        maintain the air-fuel mixture in a gaseous state and prevent
        condensation of fuel droplets preventing erratic and incomplete
        combustion. In recent times the most accepted practice to create
        turbulence is to provide squish bands in the combustion chamber.
      </p>
      <p>The squish area are normally placed in the outer circumference
        of the combustion chamber and are machined smooth. The squish
        area could be a band or a tapered area or two bands on opposite
        sides. The squish area are either flat or angled depending on
        the profile of the piston crown. They are machined smooth to a
        high degree of finish and set up in design with a close
        tolerance between combustion chamber and piston at TDC
        preventing contact. </p>
      <p>In principle, the piston on the upward stroke causes the
        compression to progressively increase. Nearing TDC, the gases
        around the squish band and the piston crown are pushed towards
        the center scoop causing Turbulence which in turn improve flame
        propagation as ignition has occurred before TDC and greatly
        reduces Pinging and Detonation. Thus, present day two stroke
        combustion chambers are hemispherical or the "top hat" type with
        a circular or partial squish band and are machined smooth with
        no sharp edges. The spark plugs are located centrally or offset
        depending on the requirement. They are made of alloys of
        aluminum of high conductivity and, in certain cases, are water
        cooled. </p>
      <p>Present day four stroke combustion chambers house the inlet and
        exhaust valves. Multiple valve layouts are standard feature in
        high performance design. Partial or circular squish bands are
        provided and are finished smooth to a high degree with no sharp
        edges. The spark plug is location depends on design and
        availability of space. In the case of aircraft engines, twin
        plugs are mandatory. Cylinder heads are largely made of alloys
        of aluminum having steel inserts for valve seats and water
        cooled in most cases. Basic designs typically are bath tub,
        wedged or double wedged with a flat roof or hemispherical cross
        flow type with inclined valve layouts. </p>
      <p>Over the last 60 years standard practice is to have a squish
        area of 20% to 40% or more of the combustion chamber area either
        concentric or offset to the cylinder axis at close proximities
        of the piston crown, causing turbulence in two stroke engines.
        Depending on the number of valves and layouts, four stroke
        combustion chambers are machined to provide the squish area
        resulting in a puff of mixture pushed towards the spark plug
        causing turbulence resulting in better combustion. </p>
      <p>In either case the surface of the combustion chamber, squish
        bands and the piston crown are normally machined smooth with a
        high degree of finish with the right tolerance to prevent
        contact at TDC on existing two and four cycle engines in
        production. </p>
      <p>Compared to diesel engines (with their higher efficiencies),
        the present day combustion chamber layouts in two and four cycle
        petrol (gasoline) engines include the following design defects
        and limitations. First, diesel engines operate at higher
        efficiencies due to the turbulence caused by direct diesel
        injection into the combustion chamber before TDC. Second, the
        diesel also burns more completely due to the turbulence created
        by the high pressure spray resulting in lesser emissions and
        unburnt fuel. Third, the diesel has higher resistance to flash
        point due to its composition and hence can withstand much higher
        compression ratios than petrol or kerosene. Fourth, the petrol
        and kerosene engines have a threshold on compression ratios due
        to its properties and lower flash points compared to diesel.
        Fifth, the petrol and kerosene need to be atomized with air to
        form a homogenous mixture before it is drawn into the cylinder,
        as compared to the diesel which is injected prior to ignition
        directly into the combustion chambers. Sixth, as compression is
        applied the air-fuel mixture tends to get unstable and starts to
        separate and condense causing erratic and incomplete combustion.
        Seventh, the only possible method to keep the mixture in a
        homogeneous state is to induce turbulence prior to ignition.
        Eighth, the only method known to cause turbulence are squish
        bands or squish areas located in the combustion chambers which
        help retain the air-fuel mixture. Ninth, squish bands have their
        disadvantages too. They prevent total combustion as fuel trapped
        between the squish band are less volatile due to the lower
        temperatures caused by masking. Tenth, squish bands and
        compression ratios have their limitations on creating
        turbulence, often resulting in heat build up due to uneven
        thickness of metal in the squish band resulting in detonation
        and pinging under load. Eleventh, very often at lower operating
        speeds incomplete combustion occurs causing excessive emissions
        and poorer torque compared to diesel engines. Twelfth, leaner
        air-fuel mixture result in slower flame velocities resulting in
        excessive heat build up causing emissions of oxides of nitrogen.
        Thirteenth, in two cycle engines the combustion temperature
        builds up very rapidly due to the short intervals of combustion
        occurring each revolution. Hence compression ratios are critical
        and cannot be increased to four stroke parameters. Fourteenth,
        the charge comprising of petrol/air drawn in the induction
        stroke is invariably preheated due to engine temperatures and
        further heated by compression bringing it to a critical state
        before ignition. Fifteenth, carbon deposits in the combustion
        chamber absorb heat and cannot dissipate the heat into the
        combustion chamber and eventually contribute to preignition and
        detonation and auto ignition once the engine is switched off.
        Sixteenth, under load, lean burn, high compression engines
        require very careful monitoring of air-fuel ratios and ignition
        timing to avoid pinging and detonation resulting in excessive
        emissions. Seventeenth, there are limits to which a petrol I.C.
        engine could stand up to. Exceeding these limits the existing
        combustion chamber design cannot cope with the following
        parameters: a) temperature build up during combustion cycle
        resulting in detonation and pinging under load; b) squish bands
        greatly reduce detonation and pinging, but cause unburnt fuel
        and excessive emissions; c) carbon build up in combustion
        chambers and piston crown build up compression ratios and
        largely contribute to auto ignition and erratic and noisy
        running resulting in excessive emissions; d) richer mixture
        bring down combustion chamber temperature but result in
        excessive carbon monoxide and Carbon emissions; e) leaner
        settings result in low flame velocities and higher combustion
        temperatures due to time lag, causing emissions of oxides of
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a fuel-air turbulence prior and
        during combustion, which causes a multipoint ignition in the
        combustion chamber of I.C. engines, with the following distinct
        advantages. First, more power output is derived from the same
        given charge operating on the same compression ratio. Secondly,
        lesser emission due to far more complete combustion is provided.
        Third, far lesser carbon deposits in the combustion chamber,
        piston crown and exhaust system occur due to controlled complete
        combustion. Fourth, exhaust gas temperatures and combustion
        chamber temperatures are lower due to quicker and even
        multipoint flame propagation. Fifth, there is no pinging or
        detonation or auto ignition due to reduced temperature in the
        combustion chamber and no residue of unburnt fuel. Sixth, there
        is better fuel economy due to improved and complete combustion.
        Seventh, the use of higher compression ratios for the same fuel
        without adverse effects is allowed. Eighth, lower octane fuel
        may be used without any adverse effect on performance loss on
        existing compression ratios. Ninth, noise levels and combustion
        vibrations are reduced due to even and complete combustion.
        Tenth, the reduced operating temperatures due to the short flame
        travel and complete combustion greatly reduce oxides of nitrogen
        and carbon and extend engine oil life and prevent contamination.
        Eleventh, lesser ignition advance is required due to the high
        degree of turbulence resulting in quick and efficient combustion
        delivering a) improved torque and power outputs, b) lesser
        emissions and carbon deposits, c) improved specific fuel
        consumption, and d) lower operating temperatures and noise
        levels enhancing engine life. Thus, according to the present
        invention, the above advantages are achieved without side
        effects. </p>
      <p>This particular invention includes a specific design change to
        the "squish" band or "squish" area located in the combustion
        chamber or piston crown of I.C. engines. This specific design
        change further enhances turbulence in the charge prior and
        during the combustion cycle by varied flame velocities in the
        form of multipoint ignition. The rapid multipoint flame front
        engulfs the air-fuel charge resulting in controlled complete
        burning of the charge in the shortest possible time with no
        residue of unburned fuel. This unique form of controlled
        complete quick combustion greatly enhances power characteristics
        and greatly reduces emissions of nitrous oxides and carbon
        monoxide. </p>

        trapped between the piston crown and the squish band towards the
        center scoop of the combustion chamber on the upward stroke. </p>
      <p>The effects of the grooves, channels and passages cause the
        air-fuel charge to be in a greater state of turbulence prior to
        ignition in the combustion chamber. When the spark plug 7
        located normally in the center of the combustion chamber ignites
        the air-fuel charge, which presently is in a high state of
        turbulence the flame front engulfs the dense volatile charge
        present in the combustion chamber through these grooves or
        channels or passages and causes flame turbulence in the ends of
        the combustion chamber by the time the main flame front has
        reached the piston crown. This form of multipoint combustion
        causes total quick controlled combustion leaving no room for
        unburnt fuel or temperature increase to cause pinging or
        Detonation in the extreme ends of the combustion chamber. This
        unique form of multipoint flame front combustion exerts the
        maximum force of the expanding gases towards the piston crown
        delivering optimum torque through the entire range. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 4, the grooves 1 or channels 2 or passages 3
        act two ways. They induce turbulence in the air-fuel charge by
        forcing the charge through these grooves or channels or passages
        towards the spark plug 7 preventing fuel separation and
        condensation taking place due to the compression applied and
        prevent stagnation of the charge prior to combustion as the
        reciprocating piston 6 comes to a momentary halt at TDC as shown
        in FIG. 2. When the turbulent dense volatile charge is ignited
        before TDC the flame front travels through these grooves 1 or
        channels 2 or passages 3 to the extreme corners of the
        combustion chamber causing a high degree of flame turbulence
        while the main flame front engulfs the main change leaving no
        form of unburnt fuel residue resulting in total controlled quick
        efficient clean burn combustion in two and four cycle engines.
        This unique design concept is applicable to all forms of two and
        four cycle combustion chamber designs in I.C. engines
        irrespective to the fuel in use. On diesel engines, the same
        principles are applicable on the piston crown which performs
        like a combustion chamber due to the small clearance volumes
        required to attain the ultra high compression ratios and diesel
        fuel being sprayed by the injectors located in the cylinder
        head. In principle, the design functions on varied flame
        velocities which actually cause the turbulence in the air-fuel
        mixture during combustion resulting in a quick and efficient
        combustion cycle compared to existing designs. </p>
      <p>Thus, according to the method of according to the present
        invention, improved turbulence is provided in the air-fuel
        charge before ignition and greatly improving flame propagation
        after ignition in the combustion chambers of two and four cycle
        I.C. engines during the combustion cycle resulting in improved
        engine efficiency over existing designs. Moreover, no previous
        or existing combustion chamber has any resemblance or design
        incorporating grooves or channels or passages either formed or
        machined or drilled into the combustion chamber or squish band
        or squish area or wedged area or flat surfaces to induce
        turbulence in the air fuel charge prior to combustion on the
        upward stroke of the piston. No previous or existing combustion
        chamber has any design to induce turbulence other than squish
        bands. Furthermore, after ignition occurs the flame front
        engulfs the charge by simultaneously burning through the grooves
        or channels or passages reaching the far ends of the combustion
        chamber in the shortest possible time causing flame and gas
        turbulence while the main flame front burns through the bulk of
        the charge in the center scoop of the combustion chamber. No
        present day combustion chamber operates on these principles of
        multipoint combustion. </p>
      <p>The multipoint ignition according to the present invention
        brings about flame turbulence which in turn intermingles and
        result in a combined total complete efficient combustion with no
        residue of unburnt fuel. Such turbulence and other advantages
        are provided by the unique physical layouts of the grooves or
        passages in combustion chamber according to the present
        invention, especially drawings FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3 and FIG.
        4. </p>
      <p>The grooves 1, or channels 2, or passages 3 are either arranged
        in a pattern that radiate out of the cylinder axis like spokes
        in a hub of a wheel or in a pattern that radiate out of an
        offset angle to the center or straight from the nearest point to
        the spark plug extending to the ends of the combustion chamber
        through the squish band or squish area or flat areas 4. These
        grooves or channels or passages are either straight or angled or
        curved and have a depth or diameter proportional to the
        circumference of the combustion chamber in relation to the
        cylinder bore diameter and squish band or squish area. These
        grooves or channels or passages start from the extreme ends of
        the combustion chamber and taper out to a point closest to the
        plug. No past or present design of combustion chambers wither
        two stroke or four stroke have any features or resemblance or
        concept to inducing turbulence before and after ignition cause
        multipoint combustion. According to the present invention, these
        grooves or channels or passages impart a squirting and swirling
        motion in the air fuel charge to create vortices that induce a
        higher degree of turbulence in the charge prior to ignition than
        any previous or existing combustion chambers in practice.
        Moreover, these grooves or channels or passages, due to their
        location, cause multipoint ignition once ignited partly due to
        the shorter distances the flame front needs to travel and reach
        the extreme ends of the combustion chamber while the main bulk
        of the ignited charge located in the center scoop is thrusting
        forward towards the piston crown. In these critical milliseconds
        of the combustion cycle in existing engines the piston is
        progressively loosing speed to come to a momentary dead halt at
        TDC causing stagnation of charge before it starts to speed up in
        the downward stroke. No previous or present day combustion
        chambers have any method to induce multiple combustion and inter
        mingling of charge occurring at this critical location of the
        piston at TDC, resulting in controlled efficient combustion
        utilizing the entire air fuel charge to its maximum efficiency
        in the shortest possible time. Thus, according to the present
        invention, these grooves or channels or passages cause rapid
        progressive complete combustion in the shortest possible time
        resulting in lower build up of temperatures in the combustion
        chamber, piston crown, cylinder walls and spark plug. Lower
        temperatures cause lesser distortion of metal parts resulting in
        lesser "blowby" of burned gases past piston rings and valve
        seats and better retention of compression ratios through the
        entire range. </p>
      <p>The lower combustion chambers temperature greatly reduce
        emissions of nitrous oxide, oil contamination and oil
        discoloring. Existing combustion chamber greatly fall short in
        controlling excessive temperature build ups resulting in
        pinging, detonation and auto-ignition. </p>
      <p>Also, the varied flame velocities occurring after ignition due
        to the formation of grooves, channels or passages result in
        shorter flame front travel through the walls of the combustion
        chamber to the extreme ends in comparison to the main bulk of
        ignited flame front which needs to follow the profile or
        contours of the combustion chamber to reach the extreme ends.
        This form of multipoint combustion results in clean burn
        efficient combustion with maximum utilization of the trapped air
        fuel charge delivering improved economy, enhanced torque and far
        lower emissions of carbon monoxides and carbon through the
        entire range as compared to previous or existing combustion
        chamber design. This form of induced turbulence in combustion
        chambers greatly helps to retain air fuel mixture in an optimum
        state for combustion. Once ignited the varied flame velocities
        cause multipoint controlled clean burn combustion greatly
        reducing combustion vibrations resulting in super smooth engine
        operation through the entire range. No previous or existing
        combustion-chamber design is capable of achieving total
        controlled combustion with a single source of ignition achieving
        all the above listed inventive features. </p>
      <p>Therefore, this unique concept of forming grooves or channels
        or passages in the squish area or flat areas of the combustion
        chamber induces turbulence and optimum multipoint flame
        propagation after ignition is applicable to all two and four
        cycle petrol or kerosene or liquid petroleum gas engines of any
        cylinder capacity achieving all the claims listed above with no
        adverse effects. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the same principles apply to piston crowns of
        Diesel engines resulting in lower emissions, smooth engine
        operation and improved engine efficiency through the entire
        operating range. Thus, this unique functions on varied flame
        velocities which actually cause the turbulence in the air-fuel
        mixture during combustion results in a quick and efficient
        combustion cycle compared to existing designs. </p>
