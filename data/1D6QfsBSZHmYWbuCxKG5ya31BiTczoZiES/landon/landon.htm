      <br>
      By heritage, accomplishment and spirit, Bill Landon Jr. is a
      quintessential Connecticut Yankee.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanically adept from a young age, Landon, 72, has immersed
      himself in making things work. At age 8, he took electrical motors
      from old record players to customize his train set. Starting at
      age 10, he revived a decrepit Model A Ford and buggied through the
      woods and fields around his home.<br>
      <br>
      Landon has worked as an electrical engineer for various companies,
      including contributions to what is now Hamilton Sundstrand's
      spacesuit program. He is an inventor, a fixer of antique machines,
      a vintner, a carpenter and designer at his historic home on the
      edge of Lebanon's long green.<br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Now Landon is waiting for a decision from the U.S. Patent and
      Trademark Office on his latest and most ambitious project — a
      magnet-powered motor. Such "fuel-less" motors could be used to run
      anything, negating the need for fuel of any kind, Landon said. The
      implications of his claim are huge, he acknowledged, and people
      will be skeptical. One of his own relatives asked how it was
      possible that no one had thought of such a motor before, Landon
      said. Displayed on a table in his home, the magnet motor doesn't
      look revolutionary or even complicated. The size of a medium
      pizza, the main parts are a stationary base, or stator, and a
      rotor. Magnets are arranged in circles along the edges of both
      pieces. Milled to precise shapes and placed in exact positions,
      Landon said, the magnets will pull and push one another to create
      constant rotation. "The energy produced by moving in a straight
      line between two points and that produced by moving between the
      same two points on a curved line is different, and that difference
      is used to propel the motor," he said. That's the translation for
      laymen -- the patent application, available online at
      patft.uspto.gov, is much more detailed and complex. Landon flicks
      the rotor and it spins for several minutes. The model is not
      perfect, he said, because the parts must be precisely machined and
      fitted and he lacks the necessary equipment. Landon said he hopes
      that an entrepreneur somewhere in the U.S. will fund a working
      model. In the the end, patent examiners will decide whether
      Landon's invention is novel and useful. He expects a decision in
      about seven months.<br>
      <br>
      "This is," he said, "either madness or genius." [ &amp;c... ]<br>

        <b>Abstract</b> -- A magnetic motor that comprises two
        assemblies, a rotor assembly (built up arrangement of rotor
        discs populated with permanent magnets) spaced in circular
        fashion on or about the disc and a stator assembly (built up
        arrangement of stator discs or planes populated with groups of
        permanent magnets spaced apart in circular fashion) so that the
        magnets on the rotor disc can move between the stator magnet
        groups in the same plane during rotation of the rotor assembly.
        The rotor (rotor discs) are connected to a common shaft (drive
        shaft) mounted on bearings to the mainframe to allow relative
        motion (rotation between the rotor and the stator).</div>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention is directed generally to magnetic
      motors and more particularly to a motor using only permanent
      magnets as the power source to produce relative motion (rotation).
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Prior magnetic motors typically provide motion (rotation
      etc.) using magnetic north or south pole faces, edges or relative
      elevations of faces or edges or combinations thereof and extensive
      shielding to produce motion. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] This invention eclipses previous attempts by direct use of
      atomic forces separating the north and south poles of a magnet
      (magnets) by producing a virtual bipolar magnet (magnets) stator
      arrangement that allows movement of a rotor magnet (magnets) past
      and along and in the plane separating the poles while passing
      through the virtual center of symmetry (COS) of the virtual magnet
      <br>
      (magnets) group arrangement.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      [0005] The inventor has reasoned by observations of the universe
      and reason itself a method of producing continual motion with no
      apparent power source by inventing an equivalent magnetic circular
      rotating force field that is completely overlapping between
      magnets and never ending because the magnets are placed in
      circular arrangements so that any rotor magnet placed in the
      circular force field at point (a) can be moved to any next point
      (b) in the circular path by the combined overlapping and aiding
      attraction and repulsion forces acting on that magnet (magnets) to
      produce motion in the same direction. <br>
      <br>
      [0006] The resulting power source is an equivalent single force
      field composed of overlapping ball-like shaped magnetic field
      structures where each ball shaped structure has no physical magnet
      (magnets) at the center of its structure to prevent passage of one
      magnet attracted and repelled by another to the center of the ball
      structure and then repelled and attracted to the next ball
      structure after passage through the center of the ball on a never
      ending point (a) to point (b) ball structure movement basis. <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      [0007] In a first aspect of the present invention, a motor
      includes two assemblies--a rotor assembly and a stator assembly. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] The rotor assembly includes a shaft (drive shaft) capable
      of bearing supports so that the shaft can rotate freely to which
      is mounted many discs which are phased to one another and spaced
      to fit into the stator assembly so that the discs can all rotate
      together on a common drive shaft within the stator assembly. <br>
      <br>
      [0009] The stator assembly includes a main frame which is
      preferably round but other shapes (square, rectangular etc. will
      also do). <br>
      <br>
      [0010] The stator assembly also includes bearings that will
      support a rotor shaft running through the stator center. <br>
      <br>
      [0011] Rotor discs forming the rotor assembly are staggered within
      the stator assembly to form facing rotor disc, stator disc, rotor
      disc, stator disc, etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0012] The rotor assembly further includes magnets equally spaced
      around the disc's rim and at other circumferences within. <br>
      <br>
      [0013] The stator further includes magnets equally spaced around
      the stator disc's rim and at other circumferences within so that
      rotor disc magnets can pass by stator disc magnets in the same
      plane. <br>
      <br>
      [0014] The stator disc magnets are arranged in macroatomic
      patterns to simulate the microatomic patterns of the barrier plane
      separating the north pole from the south pole in a magnet. <br>
      <br>
      [0015] A space in the above patterns is purposely allowed so that
      a rotor magnet (magnets) can pass through this pattern in dead
      alignment with the barrier separating plane and complete the
      parallelogram structure of neutrons in the microatomic structure
      as simulated by the macroatomic stator magnetic pattern. <br>
      <br>
      [0016] In a second aspect of the present invention both the rotor
      disc patterns and the stator disc patterns may be interchanged and
      this will allow more disc inertia for more resulting momentum and
      motor physical size reduction. <br>
      <br>
      [0017] Also the arrangement of rotor/stator magnets in other
      configurations is acceptable as long as rotor/stator magnet
      patterns remain and the plane of operation is the neutron barrier
      plane separating the north pole from the south pole. <br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the third aspect of the present invention, the motor
      operates both clockwise or counterclockwise depending on polarity
      patterns for both the rotor disc and stator disc. <br>
      <br>
      [0019] Advantages of the magnetic motor embodying the present
      invention over prior magnetic motors are as follows: <br>
      <br>
      [0020] 1. Very powerful, can operate in the so-called cold fusion
      mode <br>
      <br>
      [0021] 2. Small size (no shielding) <br>
      <br>
      [0022] 3. Cost (no expense for shield or machining); can be built
      up of carbon composites, plastics etc., and cast and not machined
      <br>
      <br>
      [0023] 4. Only one moving part <br>
      <br>
      [0024] 5. No heat produced <br>
      <br>
      [0025] 6. Very long operating life <br>
      <br>
      [0026] 7. No fuel or electric current needed to power the motor,
      and <br>
      <br>
      [0027] 8. Easily installed--can be a throw away for replacement. <br>
      <br>
      [0028] In conclusion, I have thought of the outer world and its
      relation to the universe and its arrangements and motions (stars,
      moons, planets, etc. rotating endlessly) and the thought of the
      inner world, the arrangement of atoms and its subatomic particles
      (neutrons, etc.) motions and realized the possibility that the
      magnet and its associated force fields is possibly the "Rosetta
      Stone" connecting these worlds. <br>
      <br>
      [0029] With this in mind I have created a pseudo magnet (magnets)
      that has an endless magnetic force field with no magnet (magnets)
      located at its virtual atomic center of symmetry so that another
      magnet (magnets) can pass through this center without collision
      with another magnet (magnets) as real magnets do when attracted to
      their mutual centers of symmetry. <br>
      <br>
      [0030] This pass through magnet (magnets) is used as the prime
      movement object in the present invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0031] The invention of a magnetic motor run by magnetic
      interactions is based on the reasoning as follows: <br>
      <br>
      [0032] 1. Atomic force fields within the atom self propel the
      atom's component parts (neutrons, protons, electrons, etc.) in
      orbital (circular, rotational) motion about the atom's atomic
      center of symmetry with seemingly endless unlimited power forever
      unless acted upon by nuclear fission or fusion which destroys the
      atom's structural arrangement and the motion of the atom's
      components. <br>
      <br>
      [0033] 2. Most atoms in this universe are arranged in patterns
      that set the group of atoms in atomic arrangements to form matter
      that exhibits little or no external radiating force fields and
      whatever force field that is generated is unipolar. <br>
      <br>
      [0034] 3. Some atoms in this universe are arranged in patterns
      that set the group of atoms in atomic arrangements to form matter
      that exhibits large radiating force fields that are bipolar
      (namely magnets). <br>
      <br>
      [0035] 4. Magnets exhibit large attracting and repelling fields to
      certain metals and other magnets. <br>
      <br>
      [0036] 5. The magnetic fields of magnets must overlap for any
      interaction between the magnets. <br>
      <br>
      [0037] 6. The direction of the overlap sets the direction of
      magnet attraction or repulsion fields that move the magnets toward
      (attraction) or away (repulsion) from one another. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] 7. The force field of a magnet is shaped like a sphere with
      the magnet located at the center of this sphere. <br>
      <br>
      [0039] 8. The magnet has two planes both passing through the
      center of symmetry of the magnet and at right angles to one
      another that can radiate attraction or repulsion force fields. <br>
      These planes are: <br>
      <br>
      [0040] a. The plane perpendicular to the pole faces and passing
      through the pole faces and aligned with the magnet's center of
      symmetry which I name the face plane. <br>
      <br>
      [0041] b. The plane perpendicular to the face plane and passing
      through the magnets center of symmetry separating the north pole
      from the south pole or vice versa. (I call this the neutron plane
      N). The force vectors produced on this plane are infinitely small
      at the exact center of the barrier (I named neutron barrier plane
      N) passing through the atomic N center of symmetry. <br>
      <br>
      [0042] Note--The face plane magnetic configurations used to power
      prior art magnetic motors is not used to produce motion in this
      invention because of inherent rotation instability and great
      difficulty to suppress (have to use shielding) forces that
      inherently act to oppose wanted direction of motion. <br>
      <br>
      [0043] 9. This motor uses the near field (close in, near touching)
      magnets (and many of them) and the problems associated with the
      face plane concept are eliminated by using the N plane concept of
      this invention. Note--The problems associated with air gaps for
      prior magnetic motor art pole face configurations are eliminated
      using the N plane concept of this invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0044] 10. Big or small objects are relative (a magnet compared to
      an atomic neutron or a magnet compared to the Sun). <br>
      <br>
      [0045] 11. Once an object (in this case, one or more rotor
      magnets) is set in motion in a force field, the object will tend
      to stay in motion in that force field unless acted upon by other
      force fields. <br>
      <br>
      [0046] 12. Once that object is set in motion that motion is
      forever (infinite) if the force field is forever. <br>
      <br>
      [0047] 13. The motion of the neutron is forever within the atom. <br>
      <br>
      [0048] 14. Magnets are materials composed of very dense
      configurations of neutron matter. <br>
      <br>
      [0049] 15. Neutrons are free to move about within the atom and
      move about to other atoms. <br>
      <br>
      [0050] 16. There are enough neutrons in certain matter to produce
      a magnet. <br>
      <br>
      [0051] 17. This type matter allows neutrons to move about and form
      a neutron barrier including closely packed neutron ball type
      spheres that is impenetrable by any force field. <br>
      <br>
      [0052] 18. This neutron barrier allows movement of neutrons into
      or out of the barrier in fourth dimension orthogonal figure eight
      motions to satisfy not only the barrier but the magnetic domains
      established by the barrier. <br>
      <br>
      [0053] 19. The neutron barrier contains a fourth dimensional hole
      or well shaped like a sector of two convex circles facing one
      another in the third dimension and viewed as such in the third
      dimension by viewing the spacing between the balls forming the
      neutron barrier that looks like a vase or tunnel. <br>
      <br>
      [0054] 20. It is this hole and the barrier structure moving in the
      fourth dimension to seal this hole and the forces involved to
      duplicate this movement using magnets as pseudo neutrons that is
      reasoned. <br>
      <br>
      [0055] 21. The parallelogram structure, the atomic Y cradle, the
      figure eight movement (F8), the eclipse, the shadow, the atomic
      hole or well (AH, AW), the atomic dwell (AD), the center of
      symmetry (COS) are concepts used in this invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0056] 22. Atomic attraction or repulsion is always along the COS
      direction between any two magnets. <br>
      <br>
      [0057] 23. The motor neutron barrier goes into its natural
      frequency atomic resonance wobbling the curve convolutes of the 4D
      field producing nearly unbounded atomic forces that are closely
      coupled to the motor's rotor assembly to generate nearly unbounded
      rotation and power. <br>
      <br>
      [0058] 24. I have discovered by reason and or invention that
      motion produced in this universe by two or more interacting
      (overlapping) force fields upon a third object possessing its own
      force field and interacting with the other two or more force
      fields by passing through with relative motion between them is
      along the direction of the diagonal of the parallelogram
      structural arrangement formed by the force fields when two or more
      force fields are overlapping to effect motion. <br>
      <br>
      [0059] 25. I have discovered by reason and or invention that this
      motion is symmetrical about a center of spherical symmetry
      regardless of the motion's direction. <br>
      <br>
      [0060] 26. I have discovered by reason and or invention that this
      direction is defined by three points in spherical space regardless
      of time and space and that the third point that defines this time
      and space relationship is at center of symmetry (COS) for that
      time and space and that this (COS) is at the center of the
      resulting time/space curvatures. <br>
      <br>
      [0061] 27. I have discovered by reason and or invention that time
      is a spherical entity as is space and both exhibit force fields
      not easily imagined. <br>
      <br>
      [0062] 28. The straight line motion of time and space and all
      other entities besides is also curved in the fourth dimension and
      all other dimensions that follow. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] 29. I have discovered by reason and or invention a means of
      making a hole in three dimensional space (3D space) that is used
      to produce a pseudo magnet with equivalent north and south pole
      magnetic effects about its center of symmetry (COS) with no magnet
      at its center. <br>
      <br>
      [0064] 30. The pseudo magnet (pseudo magnets) produced are guided
      by the 3D planes (XY, YZ) at right angles to one another in
      orthogonal space passing through the pseudo magnets (COS). <br>
      <br>
      [0065] 31. This invention uses the parallelogram structure
      arrangement pattern of the X, Y neutron plane and one disc is
      coupled to another disc's neutron plane by means of the hole in
      the atomic barrier structure that allows equivalent neutron
      movement along the parallel YZ plane or the next disc to
      intercouple the discs atomically to produce vast atomic power to
      drive the disc into motion (rotation). <br>
      <br>
      [0066] 32. I have discovered by reason and or invention that the
      time/space curvature of this motion produced is along the diagonal
      of the 3D parallelogram as defined by this invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0067] The results of 1 through 32 is a magnetic motor run by
      magnetic interactions that can be used as a power source whose use
      is limited only by one's imagination. <br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </span><br>
      <br>
      [0076] With reference to FIG. 1, a magnetic motor (motor)
      embodying the present invention is generally designated by the
      reference number 1. The motor includes an abcd rotor assembly 10
      rotatably coupled to an ABCD stator assembly. <br>
      <br>
      [0077] The rotor assembly 10 further includes disc (discs) 12 each
      including disc shaped magnet (magnets) 13. The rotor assembly 10
      further includes a drive shaft 14 and bearings 15 to support the
      drive shaft. <br>
      <br>
      [0078] Stator assembly 11 is mounted to a mainframe 16. <br>
      <br>
      [0079] The stator assembly discs or planes 17 are populated with
      stator magnet group 18. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] (Note--The neutron plane (N) defines the plane separating
      the north pole from the south pole or vice versa of any magnet and
      is the operating plane of all of the magnets used in the magnetic
      motor 1. This plane is magnetically neutral--i.e., does not
      attract or repel other magnets and forms an atomic track for other
      magnets passing by one another). <br>
      <br>
      [0081] FIG. 2 shows the overview alignment and position patterns
      of any rotor magnet 13 passing any stator magnet 18. <br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 3 shows a parallelogram structure 30 of FIG. 5 for a
      non-overlapping stator magnet group 18. Oscillations 30 define the
      FIG. 8 (F8) movement for non-overlapping mode. <br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 4 shows parallelogram structure 60, 61 and 62 of FIG.
      6 for any overlapping stator magnet groups 18. Oscillations 40
      define the F8 movement for overlapping mode. <br>
      <br>
      [0084] FIG. 5 shows parallelogram 50, the Y 51, the ab or ba path
      of motion along diagonal 52 of the parallelogram 50 and the region
      of atomic dwell (AD) 53. <br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIG. 6 shows parallelogram 61 overlapped by parallelogram
      60 and parallelogram 62. Inner parallelogram 63 and parallelogram
      64 show the regions of overlap for push (repel) pull (attract)
      action on the rotor magnet 13 traveling from point (a) to point
      (b) or vice versa. <br>
      <br>
      [0086] If, for example, the rotor magnet 13 is traveling through
      the overlap region 63 from point (b) to point (a), the push of
      parallelogram 61 occurs simultaneously with the pull of
      parallelogram 60 to produce movement of the rotor magnet 13. <br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 7 illustrates the movement in FIG. 6 example as shown
      by the fourth-dimensional force 70 as viewed in the second
      dimension. <br>
      <br>
      [0088] FIG. 8 illustrates the stator magnet group 18 push and pull
      or vice versa on a plurality of rotor magnets 13 within the range
      of the parallelograms 60, 61 and 62. <br>
      <br>
      [0089] Entrance magnet 80 and exit magnet 82 or vice versa are
      eclipsed by ecliptic magnet 81 to the range of the atomic dwell
      (AD) 53 to eliminate any counter motion forces as any rotor magnet
      13 moves through any stator magnet group pair 22. <br>
      <br>
      [0090] (Note--Any ecliptic magnet 81 acts just like the eclipse of
      the sun or moon to light and block magnetic action in just the
      same way). <br>
      <br>
      [0091] Any parallelogram 60, 61 contains lines of magnetic force
      (forces) 83 filling that parallelogram's volume. These magnetic
      forces 83 propel any rotor magnet 13 through group 22. The
      passageway of any rotor magnet 13 through any group 22 is a tunnel
      or atomic hole 23 that allows movement through group 22. <br>
      <br>
      [0092] As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the
      pertinent art, numerous modifications and substitutions can be
      made to the above-described embodiments of the present invention
      without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly,
      the preceding portion of this specification is to be taken in an
      illustrative, as opposed to a limiting sense.<br>
