              Industry</font></b><b><br>

      <p>If you could spend $208 on a small device that fitted to your
        car engine, saving you up to 40 percent on your gas consumption,
        the earth from pollution, and which also gave your car more
        power, you'd think it was too good to be true, right? Well this
        is exactly the promise of a new invention,&nbsp; the Z5, devised
        by an Israeli teenager Zion Badash when he was only 16. </p>
      <p>After two years in the works, Badash started selling his device
        a few months ago, with road tests to prove it. Car manufacturers
        around the world are lining up for stakes in this wunderkind's
        new device. </p>
      <p>Badash came up with the idea while he was walking down a smoggy
        street in Tel Aviv one day, and noticed all the pollution
        belching out of the cars. "That bothered me," he tells
        ISRAEL21c. He hadn't even started studying for his driving
        license at that time, and had no idea about the cost of fuel. It
        was the environmental cost of pollution that put his gears in
        motion. </p>
      <p><b>Less fuel, more power, slashes emissions</b> </p>
      <p>"Especially being a young kid, I had no idea what was the cost
        of gas or the fuel consumption for regular cars," says Badash,
        now 18. "I realized if [the solution] comes before the
        combustion itself, the effect will not only be on emissions --
        it will also affect emissions, save fuel and make the more car
        powerful," the young brainiac continues. </p>
      <p>Of course, more energy savings is "a big and important effect,"
        he says, but it "wasn't my main concern." </p>
      <p>Though Badash learned physics at high school and is already
        doing math at university courses, the knowledge he needed to
        come up with the special metal alloys in his device didn't come
        from either of these places. "I realized that there has to be
        something with all the technologies around us that isn't done,
        that could be," he says. </p>
      <p>The device he developed changes -- for a fraction of a second
        -- the way air behaves when going into the combustion chamber.
        This change allows the engine to use air more efficiently,
        saving fuel and giving more thrust at the same time. </p>
      <p>After developing the prototype of the Z5, Badash went on to
        found a three-man company. It's a family business run by
        Badash's brother-in-law Eli Mor, with headquarters in Tel Aviv
        and a manufacturing and distribution outlet in Turkey. The Z5 is
        now available through mail order via the company website, and
        already thousands of units have been sold so far. </p>
      <p><b>Car manufacturers look to Badash</b> </p>
      <p>All of the world's large car manufacturers have been in contact
        with Mor, he tells ISRAEL21c. They are looking for ways it can
        be fitted directly into their vehicles. "Ford, Mazda, all the
        large companies have been in contact with us, and we are in
        talks with them," says Mor, who sees the environment as the main
        priority for the business: "This is the top of the work. We
        don't look at fluctuating gas prices." </p>
      <p>What the alloy is made from is a secret, of course, and Badash
        admits he isn't quite sure how it works, but road tests on
        emissions show that it certainly does work. It can be fitted to
        new cars, or old ones, diesel, hybrid, buses -- basically any
        combustion engine, even power plants - says Badash, who is about
        to be recruited to the army. </p>
      <p>"Using it in an open combustion chamber brings a maximum
        effect. You can see fuel consumption [go down] very clearly," he
        says. "It can be used everywhere. I am not exaggerating," says
        the teen convincingly, pointing to the company's website and
        recent emissions monitoring done by the authorities in Israel. </p>
      <p>Fitted onto the air filter that goes to the combustion
        chambers, the Z5 is as easy to use as changing a tire. And for
        $208, this teen may be onto something that could revolutionize
        the auto industry. His brother-in-law seems to think so. He
        thinks Badash should win a Nobel Prize for the Z5. </p>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Eheud Z. Waldoks</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Zion Badash, 18, from Savyon, has invented a device to reduce
        emissions from internal combustion engines in most vehicles by
        as much as 40 percent and significantly cut gasoline
        consumption. </p>
      <p>The compact contraption called Z5 has no moving parts and can
        be easily self-installed in cars. </p>
      <p>After two years of research and development, it went on the
        market three months ago - and by all accounts is selling like
        hot cakes. </p>
      <p>"Some of the people who come to us want to reduce their
        emissions and others want to save money on gas," Badash told The
        Jerusalem Post on Friday. </p>
      <p>While it is being marketed for automobiles, the Z5 will
        theoretically work with any type of engine, from huge electric
        turbines to home generators. </p>
      <p>The initiative has been a private one, with no government
        funding contributing in any way, according to Z5 marketing
        director Eli Mor. Zion's father is securing the patent. </p>
      <p>"We've started marketing the Z5 in Israel, Turkey, Great
        Britain, the US and on the Internet," Mor told the Post. "It
        goes for $208. We are also in negotiations with automobile
        manufacturers." </p>
      <p>According to an IBA English News report on the Z5, a
        government-approved mechanic independently confirmed that the
        device reduced emissions in all sorts of vehicles, from trucks
        to cars. </p>
      <p>The story of the Z5 began two years ago, when Badash was 16. </p>
      <p>"I was walking down the street in Tel Aviv, noticing how hard
        it was to breathe and watching the exhaust come out of cars, and
        it really personally bothered me," he said. </p>
      <p>"I came back home and thought to myself, 'Even after all of the
        technological advances, it still seems like an old movie with
        black smoke belching out behind the cars.' </p>
      <p>"At that time, I didn't have a lot of knowledge about engines.
        I knew that there must be some problem with the engine's
        combustion [to have all that black smoke coming out] and I knew
        that an engine is about the combination of two elements: gas and
        air. I started looking into the gasoline side, but there had
        been lots of efforts to improve the gas - all sorts of additives
        - and none had really worked. </p>
      <p>"So I started to think about the air side. I realized that if I
        wanted to change anything, I had to treat the air before it
        reached the combustion chamber." </p>
      <p>From that initial brainstorm, after much trial and error, the
        Z5 emerged. In layman's terms, the device, built from a special
        alloy, improves the air flow into the engine in such a way that
        the combustion is much more efficient. By being more efficient,
        the car both uses less fuel and produces fewer emissions. </p>
      <p>How does a teenager with a dream and lots of will power
        actually create a product? Trial and error, according to Badash.
      </p>
      <p>"We had an old large generator in our house that used to put
        out lots of black smoke. I started trying to put different
        metals into the air filter. Then I would measure the amount of
        gas used and try and gauge whether less black smoke was coming
        out." </p>
      <p>"It took a long time, with a lot of trial and error, until one
        day I realized that I was actually making a difference in the
        amount of smoke coming out," he recalled. "Well, I was very
        excited when I realized that I had discovered something which
        worked. It's not every day that a 16-year-old invents something.
      </p>
      <p>"I went to my father and we took it to the next level. We spent
        two years perfecting it, finding the right metals. Now we've
        started to market it." </p>
      <p>The next step for this budding inventor and entrepreneur is one
        familiar to most 18-year-olds here: Badash will soon be drafted
        into the IDF. </p>
      <p>Asked whether he had any other ideas up his sleeve, Badash
        replied with a laugh, "We'll start with this right now and see
        where it goes." </p>

        <p><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;When this higher quality air mixture reaches the
        combustion chambers it: </p>
      <p>- Causes more efficient engine combustion (burning more of the
        fuel) </p>
      <p>- Provides more engine power </p>
      <p>- Results in a quieter engine running at optimal engine
        temperature </p>
      <p>- Gives you more miles per gallon (kilometers per liter) </p>
      <p>- And emits less pollution, like harmful carbon gases </p>
      <p>And as a totally inert solution with no moving parts, Z5 needs
        no maintenance or repairs for as long as you drive. </p>
