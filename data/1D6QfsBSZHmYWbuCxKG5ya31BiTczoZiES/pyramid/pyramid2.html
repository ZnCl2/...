      Some of the six triangular faces (A-H) defined on the blank (1)
      are folded over each other during the folding process to form a
      regular tetrahedron. Alternate cross-folds (11) and diagonal folds
      (12) define equilateral right-angle triangles with the short sides
      equal to the width (4) of the rectangle. The width of the
      rectangle is one quarter of the length (2).<br>

      The present invention relates to a pyramid-shaped subtle energy
      generating device emitting scalar waves, which is characterized by
      winding a coil around quartz in a clockwise direction and putting
      the quartz into a pyramid-shaped body. The device of the present
      invention is configured to generate scalar waves using a scalar
      wave generating coil wound in the opposite direction with the same
      number of windings and right-handed torsion waves using a
      right-handed torsion coil wound clockwise starting at the center
      from free electrons present in a living space. The pyramid-shaped
      body for accumulating the free electrons is made by piling up a
      mixture of 50% minerals such as steel shavings, quartz shavings,
      brass shavings, copper shaving, etc. and 50% polyester resin into
      a pyramid shape to effectively accumulate the free electrons, and
      the accumulated free electrons pass through the coils wound the
      quartz to generate scalar waves and right-handed torsion waves. A
      drawn line is connected to the top of the pyramid-shaped body to
      effectively deliver the generated scalar and right-handed torsion
      waves to a human body. Therefore, the pyramid-shaped subtle energy
      generating device generates the scalar waves not using a man-made
      power source and provides energy beneficial to the human body.<br>

      PURPOSE:To provide an apparatus for generating strong pyramid
      energy regardless of azimuth, obtained by arranging a wire member
      and a composite body of the wire members along a secondary curved
      surface. CONSTITUTION:A large number of single wire members 3 and
      composite bodies 4 of the wire members are connected to a ring
      shaped upper support member 1 and a ring shaped lower support
      member 2 and the single wire members 3 and the composite bodies 4
      are arranged along a conical surface. Furthermore, a metal or
      bamboo material is appropriately used as each single wire member.
      In addition, when the pole of a magnet 5 is contacted with the
      lower support member 2, the radiation direction of pyramid energy
      can be bundled to a lower direction. This generation apparatus
      always generates a large amount of strong pyramid energy even if
      directed to any direction and excellent in dehydration effect or
      corrosion preventing effect.<br>

      The subject of the invention is on the one hand an instrument for
      the use of pyramid energy, which consists of a carrier of any
      substance and square based pyramidal bodies arranged on the
      carrier, characterized by the spiral arrangement of the pyramidal
      bodies on the carrier, the multiple spiral formations arranged
      into a spiral system originating from multiple points close to
      each other on the carrier, and by the defined manner in which the
      size of the pyramidal bodies decreases within a spiral formation.
      The spiral formations of the instrument according to the invention
      follow the Fibonacci Principle. The subject of the invention is
      also a procedure using the device above for the use of pyramid
      energy, characterized by placing the pyramid energy-enhancing
      instrument above or below the substance to be treated - ideally
      water or substance containing water - in a way that the top
      vertices of the pyramidal bodies arranged on the carrier point
      towards the substance to be treated, and carrying on with the
      treatment for the desired time. The substance containing water may
      ideally be the human body, tea, fruits, fruit juices, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The instrument and procedure for use of pyramid-energie The
      subject of the invention is an instrument and procedure for the
      use of pyramid energy.<br>
      <br>
      The energy concentrating effect of pyramids has long been known.<br>
      <br>
      Such is, for example, <b>Czechoslovakian patent Na 91304</b>
      which describes that a razor blade is repeatedly resharpened in a
      pyramid shaped housing and is reusable hundreds of times.<br>
      <br>
      According to the currently accepted supposition the common
      resultant of cosmic space, terrestrial space, electric, magnetic,
      corpuscular, and other, thus far unknown particles and energies
      could be responsible for phenomena taking place in pyramid shaped
      spaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>German patent Na 3525521</b> gives directions as to the
      formation and placement of the pyramid. The pyramid is fashioned
      of a material with a high dielectric constant to the reduced size
      of the Cheops pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>German patent Na 19717053</b> describes an energy pyramid for
      therapeutic purposes. A number of pyramids according to the patent
      are placed on different points of the body to achieve the desired
      remedial effect. The pyramids may be 3-5 sided, with edge lengths
      between 1-10 cm, and may be made of aluminum or its alloys.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Japanese patent Na 9313624</b> proposes the use of reduced size
      Cheops pyramids with a plane inclination angle of 68-25 degrees
      for destroying infecting bacteria, viri and fungi, and curing
      joint and muscle pains.<br>
      <br>
      According to the view currently held by researchers energy travel
      downwards in the pyramid in a spiral from the top vertex.
      According to suppositions this spiral movement lends special
      properties to pyramidal shapes. Spiral movements found in nature
      are characterized by the Fibonacci spiral model. (For example the
      expansion of an explosion, a spiraling galaxy also works according
      to the Fibonacci Principle.)<br>
      The aim during the elaboration of our invention was to allow for a
      much more widespread and general use of pyramid energy than
      before.<br>
      <br>
      We have recognized that a great number of pyramidal shapes
      arranged according to the Fibonacci Principle allow for the use of
      the inner energy of pyramids with greater efficacy. In a formation
      thus constructed energies flowing upward also exercise their
      effects according to the Fibonacci spiral formation, their effect
      is multiplied (not simply added up).<br>
      <br>
      Our further research has shown that if the pyramidal shapes we
      arranged in a spiral are not of equal size, rather they differ in
      size in an orderly manner along each spiral arm, the energy
      concentration that can be achieved is larger than before by up to
      two magnitudes.<br>
      <br>
      The subject of the invention is on the one hand an instrument
      according to the above for the use of pyramid energy, which
      consists of a carrier of any substance and square based<br>
      <br>
      pyramidal bodies arranged on the carrier, characterized by the
      spiral arrangement of the pyramidal bodies on the carrier, the
      multiple spiral formations arranged into a spiral system
      originating from multiple points close to each other on the
      carrier, and by the defined manner in which the size of the
      pyramidal bodies decreases within a spiral formation.<br>
      <br>
      The spiral formations of the instrument according to the invention
      follow the Fibonacci Principle; the number of spirals on a carrier
      is between 3-21.<br>
      <br>
      The instrument according to the invention may be made of any
      formable or afterhardening material, ideally rubber, plastic,
      metal, paper, concrete, gypsum or epoxy. Metal may ideally be
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      The instrument may naturally be made with spirals formed clockwise
      or counter-clockwise, which correspond to carrying positive or
      negative energy/Ying and Yang/.<br>
      <br>
      A ring shaped body made of metal and/or magnetic rods with high
      field intensity and/or stones (e. g. crystals) may be positioned
      inside the pyramidal bodies constituting the spiral arms.<br>
      <br>
      Experience suggests that this also increases the energy level of
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      The pyramidal bodies may be fixed to the carrier by gluing or
      using detachable jointing, or they may be formed together with the
      carrier by vacuum-forming plastic or machining metal.<br>
      <br>
      The subject of the invention is also a procedure using the device
      above for the use of pyramid energy, characterized by placing the
      pyramid energy-enhancing instrument above or below the substance
      to be treated-ideally water or substance containing water-in a way
      that the top vertices of the pyramidal bodies arranged on the
      carrier point towards the substance to be treated, and carrying on
      with the treatment for the desired time.<br>
      <br>
      While carrying out the procedure according to the invention it may
      be expedient to rotate the instrument around its center of
      symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      The substance containing water may ideally be the human body, tea,
      fruits, fruit juices, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Substance containing water thus treated may be used for treating
      human and animal sicknesses. The instrument and procedure
      according to the invention is also suited to set the satisfactory
      energy level of the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The instrument according to the invention may be formulated so
      that it is set on a shoe sole shaped carrier.<br>
      <br>
      The color of the instrument according to the invention may
      diverse/ideally according to the seven chakra colors/.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of the instrument according to the invention is
      presented in Figures 1-9 as an example.<br>

      In a device for the treatment of living beings and plants with
      pyramidal energy, the energy is picked up on energy pick-up lines
      (12, 13), which are arranged electrically separate along the four
      edges of the pyramid (6). Since the emission of energy is
      particularly strong along the pyramid edges, a particularly large
      amount of energy can be picked up by energy pick-up lines (12, 13)
      of this type. Such energy pick-up lines (12, 13) are considerably
      cheaper to produce.<br>

      The device has a pyramid used with a quadratic base surface of a
      side length and a vertical height (hy) in a center. The pyramid is
      produced from cuboidal stones, where a cuboidal-shaped hollow
      space is designed with volume (V1) in the pyramid. A well-shaped
      hollow body is designed with outer volume and inner volume in the
      pyramid. The hollow body is adjusted on the volume, such that the
      electrical energy that is provided in the hollow body is converted
      into gravitational energy.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a device with a pyramid according to the
      preamble of claim 1.<br>
      A variety of such pyramids there are on earth.<br>

      known V1 and other factors.<br>
      The invention is now expected that applies to energy transfer
      between two bodies with the volume V3 and V4: [omega] 3 &lt;2&gt;
      V3 = [omega] 4 &lt;2&gt; V4<br>
      Harmonious relationships exist when V3 and V4 and [omega] 3

      The internal volume V3 of the hollow body is half as large as the
      external volume V2.<br>
      It is important for the function of the device that the volumes in
      the construction of the pyramid are adhered to as closely as
      possible.<br>
      The pyramid must have so much mass that change the volumes at
      different daytime and nighttime temperatures do not markedly.<br>
      Seasonal changes in volume are kept within limits when the pyramid
      is built near the equator.<br>

      The energy focusing pyramid model is made of plastic, three-ply
      board, fiber board, granite and other insulating material and is
      shaped as rectangular pyramid or triangular pyramid with each side
      plane is one isosceles triangle of apex angle of 52 deg and base
      angle of 64 deg. It may be set inside bed room, office and class
      room to result in body building, disease preventing and treating
      effect, and entering to one large model will result in even high
      effect. Food or beverage may be set inside the model for
      preserving even long period. The reason is that the model can well
      absorb cosmic wave energy.<br>
