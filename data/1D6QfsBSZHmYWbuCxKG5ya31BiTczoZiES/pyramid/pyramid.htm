      various industries, agriculture or domestic situations, in
      particular, the protection of premises (shops, warehouses, eating
      establishments) from rodents (rats, mice) and insects (ants,
      termites, cockroaches, flies) by means of detracting and/or
      destroying them.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Task of the invention is the expansion of functions of the device
      for generated concentration of pyramid energy by effective energy
      influence on different objects and including the application for
      effective protection of premises and their contents against
      destruction by rodents and insects.<br>
      <br>
      00 To fulfill this task, the essential attribute of the offered
      device is the usage of r, rigidly connected pieces of electric
      wire for creation of the symmetric pyramidal form of the device,
      arrangement of the Reich's energy accumulator executed in the form
      of sphere inside the pyramidal form on the central vertical axis
      and arrangement of sphere of amplification and optimization of
      energy radiation on top of the pyramidal form connected with
      Reich's energy accumulator by electric conductor.<br>
      <br>
      Variants (embodiments) of the pyramidal form the device can be
      executed:<br>
      <br>
      c,1 In the form of a correct tetrahedral pyramid enclosed inside
      of an additional correct tetrahedral pyramid with the common plane
      of the bases and with the common top of both pyramids, and the
      attitude of the areas of the bases of external and internal
      pyramids make 2:1, and the center of sphere of Reich's accumulator
      is located on 1/3 height of pyramids from their bases;<br>
      <br>
      The figure of the pyramidal form is formed by a ring of wire,
      forming the base, three pieces of wire have two parts, the first
      part represents the spatial spirals located on a surface of part
      of ellipsoid with a direction of coils counter-clockwise, and the
      second part represents flat spirals inside of the ring base,
      converging in its center, and points of interface of spatial and
      flat parts are located on the base ring on angular distance 120
      degrees from each other, and angles of twisting of flat parts of
      spirals and the angles of twisting of projections of spatial parts
      on a plane of the base are equal to each other and made from 0.5
      up to 1.5 angular turnovers around vertical axis, the center of
      the sphere of Reich's accumulator is located on half of the height
      from the top to a plane of the base.<br>
      <br>
      By such embodiments of the device inventors made purposeful
      influences on objects: improving energy fields of people and
      foodstuff while dispersing small rodents and insects.<br>
      <br>
      For realization of the method of protection against rodents and
      insects, the devices are kept on the protected premises whenever
      possible and at a convenient distance without interruption to the
      user. The necessary quantity of the devices depends on the size of
      the protected area with an approximate ratio of overall dimension
      of the base of the device of 10 cm for 3.5 m length of floor of an
      area.<br>

      </b><br>
      00 Main principle of application of the offered devices is the
      definition of influence of a level of energy initially existing in
      object and demanded effect of a so-called resource level necessary
      for achievement. Further means of the t devices of the necessary
      size and quantity, the demanded resource level of energy is
      created for the decision of tasks in view.<br>
      <br>
      ri Effective generation of pyramid energy is impossible without
      its effective concentration in the device. Reich's accumulator is
      used for amplification Seffect of concentrated energy, and the
      sphere on top of the pyramidal form of N the device is used for
      optimizing the energy radiation. It is known, that Reich's
      accumulator acts in a role of the receiver-condenser of energy
      from the outside that through the sphere on top of the pyramidal
      form device forms the concentrated field around the device. Reich
      made metal and wood boxes cosmic orgone energy accumulators (in
      more common case accumulators with metal and dielectric layers).
      So in our case, Reich's accumulator represents multilayered
      structure of dielectric and metal layers, with an external
      dielectric layer (for example, a dielectric polymeric film) and an
      internal core from metal (a steel ball). Reliability of wide
      energy opportunities of Reich's accumulator proves to be true
      documentary, and its action continuum. The sphere of amplification
      and optimization of radiation of energy represents a ball from the
      metal foil, which has been wound up around the top. The effect of
      optimization of radiation of energy is represented in more
      harmonious tranquility radiated energy above and along the surface
      of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The first embodiment of the device has the traditional form of
      correct pyramids with an inclusion of a smaller pyramid inside the
      larger one also for amplification effect of concentration and
      generation of pyramid energy. The second embodiment of the device
      with the smoothed pyramidal form of ellipsoid realizes the spiral
      principle considering close interrelation of Space and Time in
      existential thermographicaly objectificated, thus in additional
      influence on a person there is a strengthened component of
      adjustment (objective parameters of state), time rhythms of the
      person, in particular, his sleep as essential part of a daily
      regime.<br>
      <br>
      Practice has shown that small rodents and insects do not remain in
      the invaded areas due to correcting surrounding space energy
      concentrated and generated by the offered devices, as the size and
      capacity of their own energy fields of rodents (rats, mice) and
      insects are much less than sizes of area and capacity of the
      energy generated by the offered device. For example, rats have
      field size of cm (mice and insects as essences of the smaller
      size, than rats, have the sizes of their fields naturally also
      much less) in comparison with approximately 25 m of the size of
      area of concentration of energy by the device with length of sides
      of the bases 70 cm.<br>
      <br>
      O The method has many obvious advantages, especially important in
      the food 0processing industry: ecologically pure and safe, without
      application of harmful pesticides and radiations harmful to
      people; rodents and insects fail to build immunity to the
      influence of the devices; the task of installation of the offered
      systems in remote places do not require any technological process
      or electrical 00 installation.<br>
      Proofs of efficiency of application of the offered prototype
      devices and the method are given in the following examples, which
      proved to be of positive benefit to the user:<br>
      a) After visiting a veterinary clinic with a "sick" gang gang, the
      diagnosis revealed an incurable virus found quite common amongst
      these birds.<br>
      <br>
      Had no appetite, loss of feathers, beak breakage and very poor
      Scondition. After introducing the pyramid devices for two or three
      months, the bird's improvement was very noticeable by his
      condition, his "hungry" appetite, growth of feathers and mended
      beak.<br>
      <br>
      b) A young couple in the midst of a marital break up mended their
      relationship with the introduction of the spiral device. It
      provided a much more relaxing atmosphere in the home, taking away
      the tension between them. They also noticed the disappearance of
      ants after several days that had been present earlier. All the

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a space energy implosion
      unit which implodes a little energy that is full in the universe
      to be directly and indirectly used, and an energy amplification
      generator using the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] Newton's Mechanics in which the nature of materials is
      defined as particles dominate classical scientific circles.
      However, as quantum mechanics and relativity theory are
      established before and after 1900, the nature of materials can be
      understood as particles and waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] For example, it can be understood that an untouchable
      energy is changed into a touchable material by using equation
      (E=mc2). Also, as it is understood that, according to the
      Heisenberg uncertainty principle which is a basis for quantum
      mechanics, a particle position x and a momentum p cannot be
      determined simultaneously and are limited by mutual uncertainty
      ([Delta]x[Delta]p&gt;=h 2[pi] (where, h is a Planck's constant),
      new thinking that particles as materials and waves as
      non-materials cannot be separated from one another has emerged.
      Thus, it is accepted to be obvious that the universe is comprised
      of materials and non-materials and materials can be changed into
      energies which are non-materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] On the other hand, in early 1990, G. I. Shipov doctor
      (selected as one of 500 leaders who made the most affect on the
      20thcentury, by American Biographic Institute, 1998) which is
      Russian scientist has found that an energy reacts with a
      particular geometrical shape. Such an energy field is referred to
      a third force which is not gravity or an electromagnetic force,
      i.e., a torsion field or a space energy. The torsion field (space
      energy) is mutual influence or a wide-meaning resonance effect
      that is originated from all materials, rotation of electricity or
      magnetism, and rotation of biomolecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Such a space energy is very little and is full in the
      universe. It is very little and is not measured using a
      conventional apparatus for measuring an electromagnetic field.
      However, the existence of the space energy is verified by a trace
      (an interference effect) that leaves in materials or an
      electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The space energy is also applied to medicine. A new
      academic field such as quantum medicine which is a new medical
      treatment method has emerged. In advanced countries such as USA or
      France, enormous research expenses for studying an effect of a
      space energy on a living body have been supported.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In this way, study and development for using a space energy
      (a torsion field) generated in the universe filled with
      mutually-changed materials and energies by a particular
      geometrical shape in reality has proceeded in several countries.<br>
      <br>

      implosion unit according to an embodiment of the present
      invention, and FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a cubic structure
      having another shape of the space energy implosion unit of FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Referring to FIG. 1, the space energy implosion unit
      according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a
      planar structure 1 having a regular pentagonal shape, a cubic
      structure 2 which is installed to be separated from an upper
      portion of the planar structure 1 and has a regular pentagonal
      pyramid shape, and a separation structure 3 which separates the
      planar structure 1 and the cubic structure 2 from each other and
      has a smaller area than areas of the planar structure 1 and the
      cubic structure 2. In this case, the separation structure 3 has a
      regular pentagonal shape. Here, the planar structure 1 is
      implemented as one or more pieces, and as the number of planar
      structures increases, the quantity of implosion of a space energy
      increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The cubic structure 2, the separation structure 3, and the
      planar structure 1 are stacked so that the arrangement angle of
      their respective sides is identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Here, a cubic structure 2' may also be applied in another
      shape. In other words, the cubic structure 2' may be implemented
      by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a regular pentagonal
      pyramid shape having a smaller area than the area of a regular
      pentagonal planar plate 2a' on the planar plate 2a' as illustrated
      in FIG. 2.<br>

      having another shape of the space energy implosion unit of FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Referring to FIG. 3, the space energy implosion unit
      according to another embodiment of the present invention is
      similar to the space energy implosion unit shown in FIG. 1. The
      only difference therebetween is that, in FIG. 3, the space energy

      the planar structure 1 is cut to one side from the center and a
      cubic cut groove 2a in which the cubic structure 2 is cut to one
      side from the center. In this case, the separation structure 3 has
      a regular pentagonal shape but has a cut groove 3a in which the
      separation structure 3 is cut to one side from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The cubic structure 2, the separation structure 3, and the
      planar structure 1 are stacked so that the arrangement angle of
      their respective sides is identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Here, a cubic structure 2' may also be applied in another
      shape. In other words, the cubic structure 2' may be implemented
      by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a regular pentagonal
      pyramid shape having a smaller area than the area of a regular
      pentagonal planar plate 2a' on the planar plate 2a' as illustrated
      in FIG. 4. In this case, a cubic cut groove 2c in which the cubic
      structure 2 is cut to one side of the planar plate 2a from the
      center is formed in the cubic structure 2'.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view of a space energy
      implosion unit according to another embodiment of the present
      invention, and FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a cubic structure
      having another shape of the space energy implosion unit of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Referring to FIG. 5, the space energy implosion unit
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a planar structure 6 having a regular heptangular shape, a cubic
      structure 7 which is installed to be separated from an upper
      portion of the planar structure 6 and has a regular heptangular
      pyramid shape, and a separation structure 8 which separates the
      planar structure 6 and the cubic structure 7 from each other and
      has a smaller area than areas of the planar structure 6 and the
      cubic structure 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In this case, the separation structure 8 has a regular
      heptangular shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Here, the planar structure 6 is implemented as one or more
      pieces, and as the number of planar structures increases, the
      quantity of implosion of a space energy increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The cubic structure 7, the separation structure 8, and the
      planar structure 6 are stacked so that the arrangement angle of
      their respective sides is identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Here, a cubic structure 7' also be applied in another
      shape. In other words, the cubic structure 7' may be implemented
      by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a regular heptangular
      pyramid shape having a smaller area than the area of a regular
      heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate 7a' as
      illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>

      implosion unit according to another embodiment of the present
      invention, and FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a cubic structure
      having another shape of the space energy implosion unit of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Referring to FIG. 7, the space energy implosion unit
      according to another embodiment of the present invention is
      similar to the space energy implosion unit shown in FIG. 5. The
      only difference therebetween is that, in FIG. 7, the space energy
      implosion unit further includes a planar cut groove 6a in which
      the planar structure 6 is cut to two continuous sides from the
      center and a cubic cut groove 7a in which the cubic structure 7 is
      cut to two continuous sides from the center. In this case, the
      separation structure 8 has a regular pentagonal shape but has a
      cut groove 8a in which the separation structure 8 is cut to two
      continuous sides from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The cubic structure 7, the separation structure 8, and the
      planar structure 6 are stacked so that the arrangement angle of
      their respective sides is identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Here, a cubic structure 7' may also be applied in another
      shape. In other words, the cubic structure 7' may be implemented
      by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a regular heptangular
      pyramid shape having a smaller area than the area of a regular
      heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate 7a' as
      illustrated in FIG. 8. In this case, a cubic cut groove 7c' in
      which the cubic structure 7' is cut to two continuous sides of the
      planar plate 7a' from the center is formed in the cubic structure
      7'.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In the space energy implosion unit shown in FIGS. 1, 3, 5,
      and 7, the planar structure 1 implodes a space energy that is full
      in the universe due to its geometrical structure, and the cubic
      structure 2 concentrates the space energy imploded from the planar
      structure 1 due to its geometrical structure in a forward
      direction. When the cubic structure 2 is implemented in the shapes
      shown in FIGS. 2, 4, 6, and 8, the space energy that is full in
      the universe is imploded and simultaneously is concentrated in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] An energy amplification generator using the space energy
      implosion unit according to exemplary embodiments of the present
      invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] FIG. 9 is an energy amplification generator according to an
      embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 10 is a perspective view
      of a first geometrical structure of the energy amplification
      generator of FIG. 9, FIG. 11 is a perspective view of a second
      geometrical structure of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 9, FIG. 12 is a perspective view of another shape of the
      second geometrical structure of FIG. 10, and FIG. 13 illustrates a
      stack structure of a second geometrical structure, a first
      geometrical structure, a plate structure, and a separation
      structure of the energy amplification generator of FIG. 9. Here,
      like reference numerals in FIGS. 1 through 4 denote like elements
      having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Referring to FIG. 9, the energy amplification generator
      according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a
      first geometrical structure 10 in which vertices of each of five
      pieces of planar structures 1 having a regular pentagonal shape
      contact one another, a second geometrical structure 20 which is
      separated from an upper portion of the first geometrical structure
      10 and in which vertices of each of five cubic structures 2 having
      a regular pentagonal pyramid shape contact one another, and a
      plurality of separation structures 3 which separate the first
      geometrical structure 10 and the second geometrical structure 20
      from each other, are installed between the planar structure 1 and
      the cubic structure 2 and have a smaller area than areas of the
      planar structure 1 and the cubic structure 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The first geometrical structure 10 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 10 implodes a space energy that is
      full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The second geometrical structure 20 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 10 in a forward
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Areas of the first geometrical structure 10 and the second
      geometrical structure 20 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 10 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 10 and 20 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 20' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 12, in the second geometrical structure 20' a cubic structure
      2 is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a
      regular pentagonal pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular pentagonal planar plate 2a' on the planar plate
      2a' Five cubic structures 2' are disposed on a plane so that
      vertices of each of five cubic structures 2' contact one another,
      thereby implementing the second geometrical structure 20' of the
      present application. The second geometrical structure 20' having
      the cubic structure 2' implodes the space energy and
      simultaneously concentrates the space energy in a forward
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A plate structure 40 supports the first geometrical
      structure 10 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 10. A plate hole 43 corresponding to a case
      hole 53 that will be described later is formed in the center of
      the plate structure 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The separation structures 3 may be installed among several
      first geometrical structures 10 so that the first geometrical
      structures 10 are separated from one another, or may be installed
      between the first geometrical structure 10 and the second
      geometrical structure 20 so that they are separated from each
      other, or may be installed between the first geometrical structure
      10 and the plate structure 40 so that they are separated from each
      other. The separation structures 3 have a regular pentagonal shape
      and may be implemented to a predetermined thickness by stacking
      several plates or as a one product having a predetermined
      thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The separation structures 3 allow the frequency of a
      radiated space energy to vary. In other words, the frequency of
      the space energy varies according to the thickness of the
      separation structures 3. The thickness of the separation
      structures 3 may be between 3 mm and 20 mm, and 7 mm thick
      separation structures 3 are used in the present embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] A case 50 has a cover 51 in which a radiation sphere 52
      through which a space energy is radiated in a forward direction is
      formed. The case hole 53 corresponding to the plate hole 43 is
      formed in the case 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The first geometrical structure 10, the separation
      structures 3, and the second geometrical structure 20 that will be
      stacked on the plate structure 40 are built in the case 50. In
      other words, the plate structure 40 on which the first and second
      geometrical structures 10 and 20 and the separation structures 3
      are stacked, is fixed in the case 50 in such a way that a bolt
      portion 63a of a fixing member 63 perforates the plate hole 43 and
      the case hole 53 and then is engaged with a nut 64 in the rear of
      the case 50, as illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>

      embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] FIG. 14 is an energy amplification generator according to
      another embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 15 is a
      perspective view of a first geometrical structure of the energy

      generator of FIG. 14, FIG. 17 is a perspective view of another

      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 9. Here, like reference numerals in FIG. 9 denote like
      elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Referring to FIG. 14, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes

      five pieces of planar structures 1 having a regular pentagonal
      shape contact one another, a second geometrical structure 120
      which is separated from an upper portion of the first geometrical
      structure 110 and in which vertices of each of five cubic
      structures 2 having a regular pentagonal pyramid shape contact one
      another, and a plurality of separation structures 3 which separate
      the first geometrical structure 110 and the second geometrical
      structure 120 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 1 and the cubic structure 2 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 1 and the cubic structure 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The first geometrical structure 110 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 110 implodes a space energy that
      is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The second geometrical structure 120 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 110 in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Areas of the first geometrical structure 110 and the second
      geometrical structure 120 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 110 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 110 and 120 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In this case, in the first geometrical structure 110, the
      planar structure 1 further includes a planar cut groove 1a in
      which the planar structure 1 is cut to one side between two
      contacting vertices from the center, and the cubic structure 2
      further includes a cubic cut groove 2a in which the cubic
      structure 2 is cut to one side between two contacting vertices
      from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In addition, the separation structures 3 have a regular
      pentagonal shape but also have a cut groove 3a in which each of
      the separation structures 3 is cut to one side from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The cubic structure 2, the separation structures 3, and the
      planar structure 1 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 120' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 17, a cubic structure 2' of the second geometrical structure
      120' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a
      regular pentagonal pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular pentagonal planar plate 2a on the planar plate
      2a'. At this time, a cubic cut groove 2c' in which the cubic
      structure 2' is cut to one side between two contacting vertices of
      the planar plate 2a' from the center is formed in the cubic
      structure 2'. Five cubic structures 2' are disposed on a plane so
      that vertices of each of five cubic structures 2' contact one
      another, thereby implementing the second geometrical structure
      120' of the present application.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] A plate structure 140 supports the first geometrical
      structure 110 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 110. A plate hole 143 corresponding to a
      case hole 53 is formed in the center of the plate structure 140.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The case 50, the cover 51, the radiation sphere 52, the
      case hole 53, the fixing member 63, the bolt portion 63a, and the
      nut 64 are the same as in the energy amplification generator shown
      in FIG. 9 and thus, a detailed description thereof will be
      omitted.<br>

      like elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Referring to FIG. 19, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 210 in which vertices of each of
      seven pieces of planar structures 1 having a regular pentagonal
      shape contact one another, a second geometrical structure 220
      which is separated from an upper portion of the first geometrical
      structure 210 and in which vertices of each of seven cubic
      structures 2 having a regular pentagonal pyramid shape contact one
      another, and a plurality of separation structures 3 which separate
      the first geometrical structure 210 and the second geometrical
      structure 220 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 1 and the cubic structure 2 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 1 and the cubic structure 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The first geometrical structure 210 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 210 implodes a space energy that
      is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be

      <br>
      [0116] The second geometrical structure 220 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 210 in a

      <br>
      [0117] Areas of the first geometrical structure 210 and the second
      geometrical structure 220 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 210 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 210 and 220 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The cubic structure 2, the separation structures 3, and the
      planar structure 1 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 220' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 22, a cubic structure 2' of the second geometrical structure
      220' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a
      regular pentagonal pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular pentagonal planar plate 2a' on the planar plate
      2a'. Seven cubic structures 2' are disposed on a plane so that

      illustrates the structure in which a second geometrical structure,
      a first geometrical structure, a plate structure and separation
      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 25. Here, like reference numerals in FIGS. 9, 14, and 19
      denote like elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Referring to FIG. 24, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 310 in which vertices of each of
      seven pieces of planar structures 1 having a regular pentagonal
      shape contact one another, a second geometrical structure 320
      which is separated from an upper portion of the first geometrical
      structure 310 and in which vertices of each of seven cubic
      structures 2 having a regular pentagonal pyramid shape contact one
      another, and a plurality of separation structures 3 which separate
      the first geometrical structure 310 and the second geometrical
      structure 320 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 1 and the cubic structure 2 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 1 and the cubic structure 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The first geometrical structure 310 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 310 implodes a space energy that
      is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The second geometrical structure 320 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 310 in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Areas of the first geometrical structure 310 and the second
      geometrical structure 320 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 310 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 310 and 320 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In this case, in the first geometrical structure 310, the
      planar structure 1 further includes a planar cut groove 1a in
      which the planar structure 1 is cut to one side between two
      contacting vertices from the center, and the cubic structure 2
      further includes a cubic cut groove 2a in which the cubic
      structure 2 is cut to one side between two contacting vertices
      from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In addition, the separation structures 3 have a regular
      pentagonal shape but also have a cut groove 3a in which each of
      the separation structures 3 is cut to one side from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The cubic structure 2, the separation structures 3, and the
      planar structure 1 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 320' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 27, a cubic structure 2' of the second geometrical structure
      320' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 2b' having a
      regular pentagonal pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular pentagonal planar plate 2a' on the planar plate
      2a'. At this time, a cubic cut groove 2c' in which the cubic
      structure 2' is cut to one side between two contacting vertices of
      the planar plate 2a' from the center is formed in the cubic
      structure 2'. Seven cubic structures 2' are disposed on a plane so
      that vertices of each of seven cubic structures 2' contact one
      another, thereby implementing the second geometrical structure
      320' of the present application.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] A plate structure 340 supports the first geometrical
      structure 310 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 310. A plate hole 343 corresponding to a
      case hole 53 is formed in the center of the plate structure 340.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] The case 50, the cover 51, the radiation sphere 52, the
      case hole 53, the fixing member 63, the bolt portion 63a, and the
      nut 64 are the same as in the energy amplification generator shown
      in FIGS. 9, 14, and 19, and thus, a detailed description thereof
      will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] An energy amplification generator according to another
      embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] FIG. 29 is an energy amplification generator according to
      another embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 30 is a
      perspective view of a first geometrical structure of the energy
      amplification generator of FIG. 29, FIG. 31 is a perspective view
      of a second geometrical structure of the energy amplification
      generator of FIG. 29, FIG. 32 is a perspective view of another
      shape of the second geometrical structure of FIG. 31, and FIG. 33
      illustrates the structure in which a second geometrical structure,
      a first geometrical structure, a plate structure and separation
      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 29. Here, like reference numerals in FIGS. 5 through 8 denote
      like elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Referring to FIG. 29, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 60 in which both-end vertices at two
      continuous sides of each of five pieces of planar structures 6
      having a regular heptangular shape contact one another, a second
      geometrical structure 70 which is separated from an upper portion
      of the first geometrical structure 60 and in which both-end
      vertices at two continuous sides of each of five cubic structures
      7 having a regular heptangular pyramid shape contact one another,
      and a plurality of separation structures 8 which separate the
      first geometrical structure 60 and the second geometrical
      structure 70 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 6 and the cubic structure 7 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 6 and the cubic structure 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The first geometrical structure 60 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 60 implodes a space energy that is
      full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The second geometrical structure 70 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 60 in a forward
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Areas of the first geometrical structure 60 and the second
      geometrical structure 70 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 60 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 60 and 70 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 70' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 32, a cubic structure 7' of the second geometrical structure
      70' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a
      regular heptangular pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate
      7a'. Five cubic structures 7' are disposed on a plane so that
      both-end vertices at two continuous sides of each of five cubic
      structures 7' contact one another, thereby implementing the second
      geometrical structure 70' of the present application. The second
      geometrical structure 70' having the cubic structure 7' implodes a
      space energy and simultaneously, concentrates the space energy in
      a forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] A plate structure 90 supports the first geometrical
      structure 60 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 60. A plate hole 93 corresponding to a case
      hole 53 that will be described later is formed in the center of
      the plate structure 90.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The separation structures 8 may be installed among several
      first geometrical structures 60 so that the first geometrical
      structures 60 are separated from one another, or may be installed
      between the first geometrical structure 60 and the second
      geometrical structure 70 so that they are separated from each
      other, or may be installed between the first geometrical structure
      60 and the plate structure 90 so that they are separated from each
      other. The separation structures 8 have a regular heptangular
      shape and may be implemented to a predetermined thickness by
      stacking several plates or as a one product having a predetermined
      thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The separation structures 8 allow the frequency of a
      radiated space energy to vary. In other words, the frequency of
      the space energy varies according to the thickness of the
      separation structures 8. The thickness of the separation
      structures 8 may be between 3 mm and 20 mm, and 7 mm thick
      separation structures 3 are used in the present embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] A case 50 has a cover 51 in which a radiation sphere 52
      through which a space energy is radiated in a forward direction is
      formed. The case hole 53 corresponding to the plate hole 93 is
      formed in the case 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The first geometrical structure 60, the separation
      structures 8, and the second geometrical structure 70 that will be
      stacked on the plate structure 90 are built in the case 50. In
      other words, the plate structure 90 on which the first and second
      geometrical structures 60 and 70 and the separation structures 8
      are stacked, is fixed in the case 50 in such a way that a bolt
      portion 63a of a fixing member 63 perforates the plate hole 93 and
      the case hole 53 and then is engaged with a nut 64 in the rear of
      the case 50, as illustrated in FIG. 29.<br>
      <br>

      embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] FIG. 34 is an energy amplification generator according to
      another embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 35 is a
      perspective view of a first geometrical structure of the energy
      amplification generator of FIG. 34, FIG. 36 is a perspective view
      of a second geometrical structure of the energy amplification
      generator of FIG. 34, FIG. 37 is a perspective view of another
      shape of the second geometrical structure of FIG. 36, and FIG. 38
      illustrates the structure in which a second geometrical structure,
      a first geometrical structure, a plate structure and separation
      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 34. Here, like reference numerals in FIG. 29 denote like
      elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Referring to FIG. 34, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 160 in which both-end vertices at
      two continuous sides of each of five pieces of planar structures 6
      having a regular heptangular shape contact one another, a second
      geometrical structure 170 which is separated from an upper portion
      of the first geometrical structure 160 and in which both-end
      vertices at two continuous sides of each of five cubic structures
      7 having a regular heptangular pyramid shape contact one another,
      and a plurality of separation structures 8 which separate the
      first geometrical structure 160 and the second geometrical
      structure 170 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 6 and the cubic structure 7 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 6 and the cubic structure 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] The first geometrical structure 160 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 160 implodes a space energy that
      is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The second geometrical structure 170 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 160 in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] Areas of the first geometrical structure 160 and the second
      geometrical structure 170 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 160 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 160 and 170 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] In this case, in the first geometrical structure 160, the
      planar structure 6 further includes a planar cut groove 6a in
      which the planar structure 6 is cut to two continuous sides
      between two contacting vertices from the center, and the cubic
      structure 7 further includes a cubic cut groove 7a in which the
      cubic structure 7 is cut to two continuous sides between two
      contacting vertices from the center. In addition, the separation
      structures 8 have a regular heptangular shape but also have a cut
      groove 8a in which each of the separation structures 8 is cut to
      two continuous sides from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The cubic structure 7, the separation structures 8, and the
      planar structure 6 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 170' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 37, a cubic structure 7' of the second geometrical structure
      170' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a
      regular heptangular pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate
      7a'. At this time, a cubic cut groove 7c' in which the cubic
      structure 7' is cut to two continuous sides between two contacting
      vertices of the planar plate 7a' from the center is formed in the
      cubic structure 7'. Five cubic structures 7' are disposed on a
      plane so that both-end vertices at two continuous sides of each of
      five cubic structures 7' contact one another, thereby implementing
      the second geometrical structure 170' of the present application.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] A plate structure 190 supports the first geometrical
      structure 160 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 160. A plate hole 193 corresponding to a
      case hole 53 that will be described later is formed in the center
      of the plate structure 190.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] A case 50, a cover 51, a radiation sphere 52, a case hole
      53, a fixing member 63, a bolt portion 63a, and a nut 64 are the
      same as in the energy amplification generator shown in FIG. 29 and
      thus, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>

      embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] FIG. 39 is an energy amplification generator according to
      another embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 40 is a
      perspective view of a first geometrical structure of the energy
      amplification generator of FIG. 39, FIG. 41 is a perspective view
      of a second geometrical structure of the energy amplification
      generator of FIG. 39, FIG. 42 is a perspective view of another
      shape of the second geometrical structure of FIG. 41, and FIG. 43
      illustrates the structure in which a second geometrical structure,
      a first geometrical structure, a plate structure and separation
      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 39. Here, like reference numerals in FIGS. 29 and 34 denote
      like elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] Referring to FIG. 39, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 260 in which both-end vertices at
      two continuous sides of each of seven pieces of planar structures
      6 having a regular heptangular shape contact one another, a second
      geometrical structure 270 which is separated from an upper portion
      of the first geometrical structure 260 and in which both-end
      vertices at two continuous sides of each of seven cubic structures
      7 having a regular heptangular pyramid shape contact one another,
      and a plurality of separation structures 8 which separate the
      first geometrical structure 260 and the second geometrical
      structure 270 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 6 and the cubic structure 7 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 6 and the cubic structure 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] The first geometrical structure 260 is one or two or more.
      The first geometrical structure 260 implodes a space energy that
      is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to be
      indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] The second geometrical structure 270 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 260 in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Areas of the first geometrical structure 260 and the second
      geometrical structure 270 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 260 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 260 and 270 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] The cubic structure 7, the separation structures 8, and the
      planar structure 6 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 270' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 42, a cubic structure 7' of the second geometrical structure
      270' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a
      regular heptangular pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate
      7a'. Seven cubic structures 7' are disposed on a plane so that
      both-end vertices at two continuous sides of each of seven cubic
      structures 7' contact one another, thereby implementing the second
      geometrical structure 270' of the present application.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] A plate structure 290 supports the first geometrical
      structure 260 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 260. A plate hole 293 corresponding to a
      case hole 53 that will be described later is formed in the center
      of the plate structure 290.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] A case 50, a cover 51, a radiation sphere 52, a case hole
      53, a fixing member 63, a bolt portion 63a, and a nut 64 are the
      same as in the energy amplification generator shown in FIGS. 29
      and 34 and thus, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] An energy amplification generator according to another
      embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] FIG. 44 is an energy amplification generator according to
      another embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 45 is a
      perspective view of a first geometrical structure of the energy
      amplification generator of FIG. 44, FIG. 46 is a perspective view
      of a second geometrical structure of the energy amplification
      generator of FIG. 44, FIG. 47 is a perspective view of another
      shape of the second geometrical structure of FIG. 46, and FIG. 48
      illustrates the structure in which a second geometrical structure,
      a first geometrical structure, a plate structure and separation
      structures are stacked, of the energy amplification generator of
      FIG. 44. Here, like reference numerals in FIGS. 29, 34, and 39
      denote like elements having the same function.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] Referring to FIG. 44, the energy amplification generator
      according to another embodiment of the present invention includes
      a first geometrical structure 360 in which both-end vertices at
      two continuous sides of each of seven pieces of planar structures
      6 having a regular heptangular shape contact one another, a second
      geometrical structure 370 which is separated from an upper portion
      of the first geometrical structure 360 and in which both-end
      vertices at two continuous sides of each of seven cubic structures
      7 having a regular heptangular pyramid shape contact one another,
      and a plurality of separation structures 8 which separate the
      first geometrical structure 360 and the second geometrical
      structure 370 from each other, are installed between the planar
      structure 6 and the cubic structure 7 and have a smaller area than
      areas of the planar structure 6 and the cubic structure 7. Here,
      the first geometrical structure 360 is one or two or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] The first geometrical structure 360 implodes a space energy
      that is full in the universe due to its geometrical structure to
      be indirectly and directly used.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] The second geometrical structure 370 concentrates the space
      energy imploded by the first geometrical structure 360 in a
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] Areas of the first geometrical structure 360 and the second
      geometrical structure 370 allow the quantity of the imploded space
      energy to be increased. In other words, in order to obtain a
      larger quantity of space energy, the number of stacked first
      geometrical structures 360 increases or the areas of the first and
      second geometrical structures 360 and 370 increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] In this case, in the first geometrical structure 310, the
      planar structure 6 further includes a planar cut groove 6a in
      which the planar structure 6 is cut to two continuous sides
      between two contacting vertices from the center, and the cubic
      structure 7 further includes a cubic cut groove 7a in which the
      cubic structure 7 is cut to two continuous sides between two
      contacting vertices from the center. In addition, the separation
      structures 8 have a regular heptangular shape but also have a cut
      groove 8a in which each of the separation structures 8 is cut to
      two continuous sides from the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] The cubic structure 7, the separation structures 8, and the
      planar structure 6 are stacked that the arrangement angle of their
      respective sides are identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] On the other hand, a second geometrical structure 370' may
      be modified in another shape. In other words, as illustrated in
      FIG. 47, a cubic structure 7' of the second geometrical structure
      370' is implemented by forming a subcubic structure 7b' having a
      regular heptangular pyramid shape having a smaller area than the
      area of a regular heptangular planar plate 7a' on the planar plate
      7a'. At this time, a cubic cut groove 7c' in which the cubic
      structure 7' is cut to two continuous sides between two contacting
      vertices of the planar plate 7a' from the center is formed in the
      cubic structure 7'. Seven cubic structures 7' are disposed on a
      plane so that both-end vertices at two continuous sides of each of
      seven cubic structures 7' contact one another, thereby
      implementing the second geometrical structure 370' of the present
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] A plate structure 390 supports the first geometrical
      structure 360 and has the same shape as that of the first
      geometrical structure 360. A plate hole 393 corresponding to a
      case hole 53 that will be described later is formed in the center
      of the plate structure 390.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] A case 50, a cover 51, a radiation sphere 52, a case hole
      53, a fixing member 63, a bolt portion 63a, and a nut 64 are the
      same as in the energy amplification generator shown in FIGS. 29,
      34, and 39 and thus, a detailed description thereof will be
      omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] The space energy implosion unit shown in FIGS. 9, 14, 19,
      24, 29, 34, 39, and 44, a space energy which is a kind of a
      torsion field, i.e., a small space energy that is full in the
      universe, is imploded and is converted into a usable energy to be
      directly or indirectly used due to the above-described geometrical
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] An implosion mechanism of a space energy has not clearly
      been investigated scientifically yet. However, the present
      applicant has found a structure in which a space energy can be
      most effectively radiated, through many repetitive experiments.
      Such a space energy does not have the intensity that can be
      directly perceived by human's five senses but its existence can be
      verified through several experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] In other words, when a case where a space energy is
      radiated on a particular object and a case where a space energy is
      not radiated on a particular object are compared, if any
      difference therebetween occurs, it can be inductively known that a
      space energy exists. Hereinafter, various experimental examples
      for verifying the existence of a space energy will be described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0181] (1) Cancer Cell Growth Experiment</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0182] FIG. 55 is a graph showing tumor volumes of white rats that
      have drunk a general drinking water and white rats that have drunk
      a space energy processing water.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The present experiment has been carried out by professor
      Hyunwon Kim of Wonju medical college of the Yonsei University,
      April 2004 and his researchers.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] In order to carry out the present experiment, after two
      chambers where experiment white rats C56BL/6 live were prepared, a
      water supply tube in which a processing water processed by
      radiating a space energy on a general drinking water was put was
      installed in one of the chambers, and a water supply tube in which
      a general drinking water was put was installed in the other one (a
      control group) so that the space energy processing water or the
      general drinking water can be freely taken by subjects from the
      water supply tubes that are put in each chamber. The same number
      of experiment white rats C56BL 6 as experiment white rats C56BL/6
      to whose subcutaneous tissues malignant skin cancer cells B16
      Melanoma are injected were put in each chamber and tumor volumes
      were observed according to days for 20 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] In the graph of FIG. 55, a portion marked by control
      indicates tumor volumes of white rats that have drunk a general
      drinking water according to days, and a portion marked by life
      energy indicates tumor volumes of white rats that have drunk a
      space energy processing water according to days.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] As a result of measuring tumor volumes for 20 days, as
      shown in the graph of FIG. 55, in case of white rats that have
      drunk a space energy processing water that is imploded by an
      energy amplification generator, tumor volumes are very smaller
      than those of the control group.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] As known from the graph of FIG. 55, in case of white rats
      (life energy) that have drunk a space energy processing water,
      tumor volumes are very smaller than those of white rats (control)
      that have drunk a general drinking water. Thus, the space energy
      processing water makes an anticancer action on a living body of a
      white rat. That is, the existence of the space energy can be
      verified from the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] (2) Clinical Tests Relating to Whether a Processing Water
      that is Processed by a Space Energy Affects Infant Atopic Patients
      or not.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] FIG. 49 shows a graph of Table 1 and illustrates the number
      of subjects before taking a space energy processing water. Also,
      FIG. 50 shows a graph of Table 2 and illustrates the number of
      subjects that show Erythema symptoms after taking a space energy
      processing water, FIG. 51 shows a graph of Table 2 and illustrates
      the number of subjects that show Edema Papulation symptoms after
      taking a space energy processing water, FIG. 52 shows a graph of
      Table 2 and illustrates the number of Oozing subjects after taking
      a space energy processing water, FIG. 53 shows a graph of Table 2
      and illustrates the number of Excoriation subjects symptoms after
      taking a space energy processing water, and FIG. 54 shows a graph
      of Table 2 and illustrates the number of Lichenification subjects
      after taking a space energy processing water.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] The clinical tests have been carried out at Chungnoi
      oriental hospital (principal Jaekyu Ryu) located in the third
      floor, Winplus commercial building, 507, Daechi-dong, Kangnam-gu,
      Seoul, Republic of Korea, in early 2005. The clinical tests are
      experiments for verifying whether, when infant atopic patients
      took a space processing water, the space processing water affects
      the infant atopic patients clinically or not.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] In the clinical tests, D-company spring water (hereinafter,
      referred to as a space energy processing water) in which the space
      energy that is radiated from the energy amplification generator
      according to the present invention is investigated for 10 days,
      was taken by 40 infant atopic patients (male 15, female 25) of 0-4
      years old who visited at the Chungnoi oriental hospital for atopic
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] In the clinical tests, five hypotheses that, when infant
      atopic patients took the space energy processing water, there may
      be a difference between before and after taking the space energy
      processing water were formed, and an atopic index ((SCORAD:
      SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) index)) before and after taking the
      space energy processing water was measured, thereby verifying a
      clinical effect of a space energy processing water.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] Here, the atopic index (SCORAD index) has clinical
      significance only when the whole body skin status, partial skin
      photos and itching are simultaneously checked and a resultant
      value thereof is obtained. However, there was a difficulty for
      checking the whole body skin status and itching because subjects
      were infants. Thus, Erythema, Edema Papulation, Oozing,
      Excoriation, and Lichenification which are main atopic symptoms
      were scored and classified.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] The symptoms of atopic patients before taking a space
      energy processing water are shown in Table 1 and FIG. 50.<br>

      after taking it and treatment. In other words, as illustrated in

      taking the space energy processing water, the status of a number
      of patients who belong to 'severe' and 'moderate' of Table 2 is
      moved to the status of mild or '0(no symptom)', that is, symptoms

      [0215] In Excoriation symptoms of infant atopic patients, there
      was no significant difference between before taking 200-300 cc of
      the space energy processing water three times a day for 10 days
      and after taking it and treatment. In other words, as illustrated
      in FIG. 53, in Excoriation symptoms of patients after treatment by
      taking the space energy processing water, the Excoriation symptoms
      of most subjects were not severe, and thus, it was a difficulty
      for finding significance in comparison with the results before and
      after taking the space energy processing water. However, it was
      verified by naked eyes that the skin status after taking the space
      energy processing water is more smooth than before taking the
      space energy processing water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0216] (e) Result of Hypothesis 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0217] In Lichenification symptoms of infant atopic patients,
      there was no significant difference between before taking 200-300
      cc of the space energy processing water three times a day for 10
      days and after taking it and treatment. Since Lichenification
      symptoms occur in adult chronic serious-case patients having a
      long disease-contraction period, as illustrated in FIG. 54, many
      Lichenification symptoms have not been found in infants having a
      short disease-contraction period of less than 4 years old.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] As verified in the above results, symptoms such as Erythema
      (hypothesis 1), Edema Papulation (hypothesis 2), Oozing
      (hypothesis 3), and Excoriation (hypothesis 4) have been improved.
      Although, in case of Lichenification (hypothesis 5) symptoms,
      there was no significant difference, the existence of a space
      energy can be verified according to the results of hypotheses 1,
      2, 3, and 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] The space energy radiated from the energy amplification
      generator according to the present invention allows a living body
      energy to be activated, as verified in the above-described cancer
      cell growth experiments or clinical tests. However, the space
      energy shows various effects in the following fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] If the space energy radiated from the energy amplification
      generator is radiated on a plant, the growth of the plant is
      brought on, and chemical reactions such as decay etc. are
      suppressed. Thus, it can be understood from the results that one
      action of the space energy according to the present invention is a
      non-ionization action for suppressing ionic polarization. Such a
      phenomenon occurs even in a human body and is as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0221] In addition, when the space energy is radiated on milk at
      about 20[deg.] C. for about three weeks, milk is not decayed but
      can be eaten and is changed into yogurt in which lactobacillus
      that has also been used in a health food is contained.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] In addition, when the space energy is radiated on a
      strawberry for two months, the strawberry is not decayed or
      acidified, is dried and dehydrated and is changed into a glutinous
      shape like raisins. This does not harm the human body when man
      takes the strawberry. This represents a processing method by which
      foods can be kept for a long time, comparing when strawberries are
      kept in a general environment, for more than three days, they
      begin to be deformed and be decayed after several days have
      elapsed.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] In addition, when the space energy is radiated on a
      cold-storage apple for about two or more years, due to moisture
      evaporation, part of the epidermis is crumpled and its interior
      fleshiness is not greatly different from the fleshiness of an
      original apple. In this way, when the present invention is applied
      to living body objects around man, their living body energy can be
      preserved and reinforced.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] While the present invention has been particularly shown and
      described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will
      be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in
      form and details may be made therein without departing from the

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      I invented the absolutely new, yet unknown for the mankind super
      technology of collecting energy and generating electricity and
      absolutely new NUCLEA POWER REACTOR (NPR). My NUCLEAR POWER
      REACTOR works without any fuel! ! ! My NPR produces absolutely
      CHEAP ENERGY! ! ! Because my NPR does not need any fuel it takes
      only operating costs and outlay for its building. My NPR produces
      absolutely ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY, SAFE, STABLE ENERGY WITHOUT
      LIMITS!!! The power of my NPR depends on its size and supply of
      water. The larger size of the reactor the more power the reactor
      produces, the more water Power station requires. As my NPR needs
      good supply of water it should be built near large enough source
      of water. Ideally it could be very big river or big enough
      freshwater lake. Before we start building NPR we need to chose .a
      natural earthquake-resistant platform (some plateau or outcrop of
      bedrock). The earthquake resistance of the platform is the most
      important factor. The natural weight of my NPR is very high (from
      aboutlO million tons and higher) so as a platform we should take
      some very solid monolith plateau. Another reason for this is that
      part of this base under the Pyramid is the very important part of
      the reactor. For water supply we need to create a special harbour
      from the river as close as possible to the Power station.<br>
      <br>
      MY NUCLEAR POWER REACTOR AND MY TECHNOLOGY OF COLLECTING ENERGY
      AND PRODUCING ELECTRICITY IS UNIQUE. The reactor and technology
      that our civilization has not known yet. Without a doubt this is
      the best reactor and technology that have ever been created. My
      NPR is using the ideal way of collecting energy. Technology that
      mankind will use for producing electricity from now on and
      forever. Technology that will end up any other main ways of
      generating electricity, that will save our planet from pollution
      and poisoning and even will save our civilization in the case of
      some global catastrophe that already has happened on our planet in
      the past ( global total flood), because my NPR and my technology
      works non-stop, forever without any fuel even deep under water
      surface, on the ocean's floor where people could hide and live
      during total flood or ice age. My technology will allow people to
      get energy even on other planets if this planets have enough
      water.<br>
      The reactor of my Power station is a PYRAMID(it can be a CONE as
      well, but PYRAMID is much better) that should be made from blocks
      of solid enough material( natural stones, cement...) It could be
      better to use granite and limestones. All body of the Pyramid
      should be made from huge blocks of limestones. Some parts of the
      interior design that should resist very high pressure and high
      temperature should be made from huge blocks of high quality
      granite. The type of the Pyramid is a four sided Pyramid( It could
      be three, five, six and much more sided Pyramid even as I have
      said before a Cone). Four sided Pyramid is much better. The
      approximate optimum size of the Pyramid see figure 1. The position
      of the Pyramid on Earth see figure 2 ( the view from above for the
      reactors situated in the northern hemisphere ). The angles of the
      Pyramid see figure 1. Inside the Pyramid and on its surface it is
      very important to minimize the thickness of the joints between
      stones. Ideally it should be monolith structure. All blocks of
      stones should be brought as close as just 0,001 inches, or ideally
      in very tight contact with cement between stones. The precision in
      the consistency of the lengths of the Pyramid's four sides at the
      base as well as its four sides from the capstone to the base, all
      angles, positioning the Pyramid to the real north, the real
      horizontal position of its base are the most important things! The
      power of my NPR depends on this precision and accuracy. The
      precision should be as good as today's technology can afford it.
      There should be large enough limestones weighting at about 3 - 5
      tons and more to create firm enough structure. All this Pyramid
      should be made from such stones because we expect very high
      pressure of steam in special inner chambers of the Pyramid hence
      the structure should successfully resist high pressure and high
      temperature at the same time! The surface of the Pyramid should be
      perfect as a mirror. It should be made from ideally polished
      limestones that should be cat and fitted together with a cement
      with ideal precision, with joints almost invisible to the naked
      eye. All four sides of the Pyramid should look like a single,
      flawless, pyramid- shaped slab. As I have said before there should
      be perfect monolith structure inside the Pyramid as well. If we
      successfully fulfil all this conditions the Pyramid will start
      working. The Pyramid starts a nuclear chain reaction and starts to
      accumulate energy in its inner space and under the Pyramid. In
      this case to collect energy from the core of the Pyramid and from
      special chambers under the Pyramid we need water.<br>

      <br>
      To achieve very precise horizontal position of the Pyramid's base
      we shall have to level the surrounding plateau by fitting it with
      a limestone pavement, carved to match the profile of the
      underlying bedrock. This pavement should be built from fine
      quality limestones and should be extended some 40 feet beyond the
      Pyramid's boundary on each of its four sides all around the
      Pyramid. Of course in this case we shall have to extend the
      precision of the Pyramid on the pavement as well. The mean
      thickness of the joints between limestones should be not more then
      &lt;-&gt; 0,001 inches or ideally it should be very tight contact
      with cement.<br>
      <br>
      Before we start building the Pyramid's casing the whole Power
      station, the whole its infrastructure should be absolutely ready
      to work. Because having started building the Pyramid's casing we
      START THE REACTOR OF THE POWER STATION. It means that building of
      the Pyramid's casing is THE LAST STEP. During the process of
      building the Pyramid's casing we will start collecting first
      kilowatts of electricity!<br>
      <br>
      And now it is high time to have a look inside and under the
      Pyramid. As I have said before we expect very high pressure of
      steam in its inner chambers and in special chambers under the
      Pyramid and we expect very high temperature as well. To resist
      both we need to create special structure of chambers and tunnels
      inside the Pyramid from huge blocks of high quality granite. All
      granite stones should be brought together in very tight contact
      with a cement. We need to carve special structure of chambers and
      tunnels in the base under the Pyramid. The positioning of the
      Pyramid's inner chambers and special chambers in the base under
      the Pyramid see figure 7. The view from above see figure 12. The
      process of collecting energy is quite simple: The Pyramid itself
      starts a nuclear chain reaction and starts to accumulate energy in
      its inner space and in the base under the Pyramid. The nuclear
      chain reaction induce the gain of temperature in the Pyramid's
      inner space and in the base under the Pyramid. Some parts of the
      Pyramid and the base will get very high temperature. In this case
      we need water as a moderator and as a coolant at the same time.
      Water takes heat from the core of the Pyramid and special chambers
      and runnel under the Pyramid and converts into steam. Eventually
      we will use steam to drive a steam turbines as normal in any power
      station.<br>
      <br>
      And now about very important thing: Before we start planning the
      Pyramid's inner chambers and special chambers in the base under
      the Pyramid and building our first real huge Pyramid we need very
      carefully check the map of allocation of temperature of different
      parts of the Pyramid and how this map is changing during the day
      and during the year. It is very difficult to know about this
      without having made an experiment on a smaller model first. So we
      need to build the very precise smaller copy of our huge Pyramid
      first. We need to install a lot of very sensitive temperature
      sensors all over this smaller model and, that is very important,
      under the Pyramid's base as well to check temperature of different
      parts of this smaller model and under it. We shall have to wait
      for a one year so that we could check how temperature of different
      parts of our smaller model and under it is changing during the
      whole day and during the whole year. The approximate map of
      allocation of temperature inside the Pyramid and under the Pyramid
      is on figures 3 and 5. The view from above see figures 4 and 6.
      During the day the active zone of energy concentration is changing
      from position (2) on figure 5 (view from above of this position
      see figure 4.) to position that is shown on figure 3 (view from
      above of this position see figure 6.) and then to position (1) on
      figure 5 (view from above - position 1 on figure 4.). This process
      takes 12 hours. In the active zones of energy concentration we
      expect very high temperature. To be certain about safety we need
      to install radiation sensors all around outside our smaller model
      too. Of course without making experiments no one knows how the
      size enlargement of the Pyramid could affect the power. I suppose
      it is quit possible that enlargement twice as much of the size of
      the Pyramid could bring three or even four times more power! Who
      knows it could be even more. I think that the Pyramid as huge as
      volcano Vesuvius which is CONE could supply enough energy for the
      whole world!!! The problem is: we could not be able to supply
      enough water for so huge reactor. All about pyramids, cones and
      volcanoes as well we could know only making experiments and
      calculations on a smaller models. I have no doubts all experiments
      will pay for themselves more then enough.<br>
      <br>
      It would be very advisable to built smaller copy of the Pyramid on
      the rotating platform so that we could know how power and
      allocation of temperature all over the Pyramid is changing if we
      wind the Pyramid around its axis.<br>
      <br>
      Having know the allocation map of temperature inside the Pyramid
      and even deep under the Pyramid (which is very important as well),
      how this temperature is changing during the day and during the
      year we could eventually plan the disposition of the Pyramid's
      inner chambers and their design. We could plan the power of the
      reactor, the temperature and the pressure inside, how much water
      do we need and so on. In fact we could then compare the power of
      my reactor with powers of already existent other types of reactors
      and eventually plan the rest infrastructure of the power station
      which will be the same as in any other types of power stations
      (see figure 11.). The steam from exit (C) of the Pyramid is passed
      directly to the steam turbine (1) where it is joined by the steam
      from exit (A) of the Pyramid. After expanding outwards through the
      turbine, the steam has had all of its useful energy removed. It is
      then condensed by passing over pipes carrying cold water (3): this
      water in turn loses its heat in cooling towers. Condensed water is
      pumped into a cold water tank (2) and then into entrance (B) and
      entrance (A) of the Pyramid. The blades of the steam turbine (1)
      turn at 3600 rpm, spinning a shaft connected to a generator (4)
      producing 22 kV of three-phase electricity.<br>
      <br>
      As I have said before the allocation map of temperature all over
      the Pyramid and under the Pyramid is not constant. It is changing
      during the day and during the year. It depends on positioning of
      the Pyramid on Earth - on the latitude on which the Pyramid lie.
      It means that during the day different chambers of the Pyramid and
      the base under the Pyramid work actively at different times.
      Although all chambers of the Pyramid and the base are generating
      enough power as a steam for the whole day, non-stop because of the
      Pyramid's capability to accumulate and keep enough energy as a
      heat for a long period of time. Now we have a look at figure 7.
      This is just approximate plan of the reactor's inner chambers that
      I have made without experiments on a smaller model. The
      disposition of the reactor's inner chambers depends on the
      Pyramid's positioning on Earth (latitude). The plan that we can
      see on figure 7 is for the reactors which should be situated in
      the northern hemisphere. The structure inside the Pyramid consist
      of two separately working parts. The first part consist of chamber
      (1), antechamber (11) and tunnel (4). The second part consist of
      chamber (2), tunnel (5), tunnel (7), chamber (6), chamber (3),
      antechamber (10), tunnels (8) and (9). During the day some of this
      two parts starts working actively first. Water is coming into
      chamber (1) through the entrance (A), tunnel (4) and antechamber
      (ll).Because of very high temperature all around chamber (1),
      antechamber (11) and tunnel (4), water starts boiling right in
      tunnel (4) converting into steam. The process of steam generation
      continues in chamber (1). Because of the very high temperature all
      around this chamber the temperature and pressure of steam in
      chamber (1) is growing. When the pressure of steam is high enough
      steam pushes water level down, comes out of the chamber and hit
      into granite blocks in antechamber (11). This granite blocks is
      especially meant to withstand the steam's blow from the chamber
      (1). Steam is coming out under big pressure through tunnel (4) and
      entrance (A) to a steam turbine. The approximate size of tunnel's
      (4) section is 3 feet 11 inches high by 3 feet 5 inches wide. The
      active process of growing temperature all around this part
      continues for about four hours, but the process of steam
      generation continues all day round non-stop. The second part of
      the Pyramid's inner structure works independent of the first part.
      Water is coming into this part through the entrance (B) and tunnel
      (8). Then from chamber (3) water is coming through antechamber
      (10) into chamber (6) and further into tunnel (7), through tunnel
      (5) into chamber (2). Water level in both (2) and (3) chambers see
      figure 7. The very high temperature all around this part of inner
      structure starts the process of steam generation in all chambers
      and tunnels. In chamber (2) steam under big pressure pushes down
      water level and comes out into tunnel (5). Big bubbles of steam on
      the way into chamber (6) hit into five granite blocks ( see figure
      10.) This granite blocks is especially meant to withstand the
      steam's blow from chamber (2). This granite blocks slice and
      disperse big steam bubbles into smaller fractions. And at the same
      time this granite blocks do not allow steam bobbles come into
      tunnel (7) because of their special overlap position. The bubbles
      of steam from tunnels (5) and (7) come into chamber (6). Here, in
      chamber (6) we can see special structure of granite blocks fixed
      on special ramp (see figure 10.). This granite blocks is
      especially meant to direct steam bubbles upwards on their way to
      chamber (3) and antechamber(l[theta]) so that steam bubbles do not
      get into antechamber (10) straight but come to the water surface
      in chamber (6). The space in chamber (6) over water surface
      accumulates steam. The pressure and temperature of steam in
      chamber (6) over water surface is growing. When the pressure is
      high enough steam pushes water level down, comes into antechamber
      (10) and hit into granite blocks (see figure 9.). This granite
      blocks is especially meant to withstand the steam's blow from
      chamber (6). Then steam comes into chamber (3). We expect very
      high temperature all around chamber (3). It raise the steam's
      temperature and pressure even higher. That is why all this chamber
      should be made of high quality granite blocks. Steam under big
      pressure and temperature pushes water level down and comes out of
      chamber (3) through tunnel (9) and exit (C) to a steam turbine.
      The active process of accumulating energy all around this part
      continues non-stop for about 12 hours, but the process of steam
      generation continues non-stop all day round. I should say that for
      at least 12 hours every day the Pyramid works very actively. This
      amount of time is far then enough for the Pyramid to accumulate
      enough energy for another 12 hours when the Pyramid is not
      accumulating energy in its inner space and under the Pyramid.
      Stones of the Pyramid keep enough heat for the next 12 hours till
      the Pyramid starts working very actively accumulating energy again
      in its inner space to keep on generating steam non- stop for the
      whole day, the whole year, the whole eternity! ! ! Yes . MY
      REACTOR WORKS NON-STOP, FOREVER, WITHOUT ANY FUEL ! ! !<br>
      <br>
      Everything inside the Pyramid should be made very firm and
      reliable. Because any mistake could cost a lot of money. To change
      or repair something inside the reactor we shall have to stop the
      reactor. To stop the reactor means that we shall have to remove
      the upper layer of stones which is the Pyramid's casing. This is
      the very expensive task. Hence everything inside the Pyramid
      should be ready to work firmly and reliably for hundreds of years
      or even thousands of years nonstop. The system inside the Pyramid
      should be simple, without replaceable details.<br>
      <br>
      Another problem is the configuration profile of the steam tunnel
      (9) . The steam under very high pressure and high temperature is
      coming out of the Pyramid with the very high speed. It means that
      resonance could make this tunnel very noisy. We need to choose the
      right profile for this tunnel to keep its prime resonant
      frequencies in the infra sound range. The approximate example of
      the steam tunnel's profile see figure 8.<br>
