      <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayer MaterialScience
        Polyurethane Raw Materials Used in Formulations for Lighter,
        More Compact Blades with Enhanced Durability and Weatherability</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Boulder City, Nev., March 3, 2009 - Wind Sail Receptor, Inc. is
      developing a rotor blade design that could change how wind
      turbines harness power.<br>
      <br>
      “We have the major breakthrough,” said Richard Steinke, president
      and CEO of Wind Sail Receptor, Inc. “Our tests show that our
      product provides <span style="font-weight: bold;">three times
        more efficiency than existing turbines</span>.”<br>
      <br>
      The Wind Sail Receptor’s Quad Blade Construction uses Bayer
      MaterialScience’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">polyurethane
        raw materials to increase durability and weatherability, while
        reducing the weight of the blades and maintenance costs.</span><br>
      <br>
      The resulting polyurethane system offers flexibility and
      resistance to the elements that is vital to the success of
      Steinke’s design. Most rotor blades on the market are made of
      glass-fiber or carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and similar to an
      airplane propeller, according to the World Wind Energy
      Association.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Blades made of those materials are vulnerable to cracking or
      drooping after prolonged exposure to the elements, Steinke
      explained. The airplane design also doesn’t enable the best use of
      blade surface, he said. When combined, these problems lead to
      increased maintenance costs and downtime, reducing efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The unique design of the Wind Sail Receptor blades improves their
      ability to capture wind: They can generate power in winds of five
      miles per hour and continue generating at up to 50 miles per hour,
      depending on the size of a new technology for a variable
      generator, Steinke said.<br>
      <br>
      The Wind Sail Receptor’s design is also <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">more compact and lighter than existing blades</span>.
      Steinke estimates that a rotor blade for a standard one-megawatt
      turbine weighs roughly four tons and measures 100 feet. The Wind
      Sail Receptor blades will weigh no more than a half ton each and
      have a measurement of less than 50 feet, Steinke explained.<br>
      <br>
      Tests conducted showed that the blades developed by Wind Sail
      Receptor will <span style="font-weight: bold;">outperform
        existing blade designs without the high-pitched whooshing sound.</span>&nbsp;





      <br>
      <br>
      The Wind Sail Receptor design comes at an opportune time as wind
      power generation continues to expand. In the United States, wind
      power installations were expected to be 7,500 megawatts in 2008
      alone – enough power to generate electricity for 2.2 million
      homes, the American Wind Energy Association reported.<br>
      <br>
      Steinke estimates that he’ll have a market-ready product this year
      that could be distributed through utility companies, possibly via
      joint ventures. He anticipates being able to sell the design
      across three platforms—from smaller units targeted for home and
      commercial use to larger half-megawatt and one-megawatt units.<br>
      <br>
      For this project Steinke utilizes Bayer MaterialScience’s MDI
      aromatic isocyanate prepolymer and a mix of two different polyols.
      Steinke purchases them from The E.T. Horn Company, a distributor
      of Bayer MaterialScience’s polyurethane raw materials.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      “I’ve always used Bayer MaterialScience raw materials in my
      formulations because they have the highest quality controls. The
      quality is always right,” Steinke said. “The blades are the most
      important part, and with the high quality of Bayer MaterialScience
      materials, they will surely stand the test of time.”&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      This project was an ideal fit for Bayer MaterialScience as well,
      according to Tom Petricko, marketing manager – distribution, Bayer
      MaterialScience LLC. “Sustainability has always been top-of-mind
      at Bayer,” he explains. “For that reason, the opportunity to play
      a key role in a project that advances the use of renewable energy
      is in perfect alignment with our ongoing commitment to
      sustainability and company motto: Science for a better life.”<br>

      Jan. 15, 2010<br>
      <br>
      Boulder City has agreed to let a company build an experimental
      wind turbine on a tract of city land in exchange for the power it
      generates.<br>
      <br>
      “If this is successful, there is no other alternative energy that
      can match this technology,” said Richard Steinke, chairman of Wind
      Sail Receptor Inc.<br>
      <br>
      “This alternative energy would bring in a kilowatt of power much
      less than 5 cents per kilowatt. There is nothing that I know of
      that can compete with this, not even coal,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Steinke said he created his windmill design five years ago, and
      his calculations indicate his wind turbine will be able to produce
      more than one megawatt of power with winds of 25 mph. And it
      should generate energy with winds as light as 3 mph, he said.<br>
      <br>
      At Tuesday’s City Council meeting, Steinke submitted a request to
      use one acre north of Canyon Road to build and observe his wind
      turbine for a year. He said he also plans to build a
      blade-constructing facility nearby, which would bring an estimated
      91 jobs to the city.<br>
      <br>
      “We feel so confident in this that already I have eight countries
      that have flown in and looked at this technology,” Steinke said.
      “I have existing orders, but I need to build this to get the
      sizing of the unit.”<br>
      <br>
      The City Council voted unanimously to grant the land for the
      project. A license agreement will be presented to the council next
      month for approval.<br>
      <br>
      City Manager Vicki Mayes said the Canyon Road site was selected
      because it is a good location for wind and close to the city’s
      electric system. She said the city will not charge Steinke rent
      for the land as long as the output from the turbine is provided to
      Boulder City at no cost.<br>
      <br>
      Steinke told council members that he plans to make his windmill
      turbine design modular so it will be easier to move if it does not
      work. He also said he wants to make the equipment blend in with
      the landscape.<br>
      <br>
      Wind Sail Receptor will pay for all of the project’s expenses,
      including liability insurance, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Councilman Cam Walker said the wind turbine would help reduce
      their power rates and allow the community to become more
      self-reliant, especially with two or three wind turbines.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] This invention pertains to wind mill blades, blades for
      turning by a water flow and blades for turning in water, that are
      for mounting to an axle for turning in a frame that is fitted to a
      tower to turn in the wind and produce a power output for doing
      work, or for turning in water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Prior Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The present invention is in a new and substantially more
      efficient wind powered blade structure than any presently
      available wind mill blade or blade arrangements. Examples of a
      variety of both old and new blade configurations are shown in U.S.
      patents to Logsoon, Des. No. 141,589; to Amico, U.S. Pat. No.
      2,023,659; to Preston, U.S. Pat. No. 2,102,913; to Bunzer, U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,109,828; to Krolick, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,592;
      to Wortham, U.S. Pat. No. 4,779,006; to Arreola, Jr., U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,926,061; to Vainrub, U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,541; to Hosoda,
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,059; and to Zeng, U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,251, as
      well as in published U.S. patent applications to Gericke de Vega,
      US2001/0011825 and to Johann, US2002/0070558. Unlike these and
      other known earlier blade configurations, the wind sail receptor
      design of the invention employs a pair of quad blades where each
      quad blade is formed from a continuous section of material,
      providing a stronger finished construction than is possible where
      individual blades are axially fitted together. In which fitting
      together, at equal distances around a front disk and rear hub,
      sail portions of the individual blades are equidistant from one
      another and overlap. Which blades spacing provides a uniform air
      flow path to a wind flow through the blades, and with each blade
      bent to function as a sail, functioning like a headsail or jib on
      a sail boat. The blade arrangement provides a greatly improved
      force of blade turning from even a light or variable wind in that
      the blades, when attached between the front disk and rear hub, are
      stiff and will efficiently derive energy from turning that is
      transferred into an axle connect between the blades front disk and
      rear hub, with that turning converted to useful energy, such as
      electrical energy, from a turning of a connected generated and
      with that produced energy to be stored in a battery or batteries,
      or can be directed into an electrical grid.<br>
      [0005] Heretofore, wind mill blade configurations have lack
      efficiency, particularly the blades as are turned in a wind farm
      operation, and operate at only an efficiency of approximately
      twenty (20), thereby utilizing only a small percentage of the
      energy of a wind passing through the blades, and, accordingly,
      have had to be large to produce a worthwhile energy output.
      Present day examples of such wind farm type blades are long, heavy
      blades, usually three blades, that are both expensive to construct
      and maintain, particularly as to bearing wear. The wind sail
      receptor of the invention unlike such wind farm blades, or blades
      like those shown in the above cited prior art, provide a
      substantially greater efficiency, of approximately ninety (90)
      percent in winds of from eight (8) to ten (10) miles per hour and
      greater, and utilizes a blade arrangement whose diameter is
      measured in inches rather than in feet. Such blade arrangement, of
      course, is far less expensive to construct and maintain, is a
      significantly more efficient than earlier blade configurations and
      is therefore a very significant improvement in wind power
      generation systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0006] It is a principal object of the present invention to
      provide a wind sail receptor that has an arrangement of three to
      ten blades that are equally spaced and are connected axially,
      forming a blade arrangement of a wind powered device for
      converting wind energy into usable power.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Another object of the present invention is to provide, as a
      preferred blade arrangement, two sets of four equally spaced
      blades, that are connected axially, forming a single blade
      arrangement of a wind-powered device for converting wind energy
      into usable power.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another object of the present invention to provide a wind
      sail receptor were the individual blades are each curved from a
      leading to trailing edge to perform a function like that of a
      sail, like that of a head sail or jib of a sailing ship, and which
      blades are equally spaced from one another around a forward disk
      to where a flow of air passing across each blade leading edge acts
      around the curve of the blade to efficiently convert wind energy
      into blade rotation and turn an axle or shaft extending from the
      trailing face of a rear hub, turning a power generation device.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another object of the present invention is to provide a
      wind sail receptor where a trailing edge of each blade has an half
      round section proximate to a blade hub, that translates into a
      flat outer section that extends to the blade end, and is to
      provide a flow path for a wind traveling around the blade curved
      surface to discourage generation of turbulence in the flow at the
      blade trailing edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Still another object of the present invention is to provide
      a novel design of wind sail receptor blades that, by their
      construction from a light gauge material, will respond to an
      increase in wing speed by becoming more rigid making each blade
      suitable for turning in even a high wind and water.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Still another object of the present invention is to provide
      a wind sail receptor blade assembly having a minimum of one set of
      three to five blades, and preferably with two sets of blades
      forming a blade assembly of from six to ten blades, with the blade
      assemblies for axial assembly between an aligned forward disk and
      rear hub and with the individual blade bent around a selected arc
      and are attached, at equal spaced intervals to the forward disk,
      forming the three to ten equally spaced blades that overlap one
      another, providing uniform spacing between the blade leading
      edges, whereby an air or water flow will strike a curved blade
      portion, converting wind or water flow energy into blade turning,
      with the assembly to exhibit approximately a ninety (90) percent
      efficiency in a conversion of wind or water flow energy into blade
      turning.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Still another object of the present invention is to provide
      a wind sail receptor where each set of blades is formed from a
      flat section of light gauge material where the individual blades
      are formed by a removal or like spaced curved sections that extend
      from the center area of the flat section, out to the section edge,
      squaring off the blade outer end edges and connecting an outer
      edge end of each blade to a forward disk.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Still another object of the present invention is to provide
      a wind sail receptor that is simple and economical to produce
      where the single set or the two sets of blades are easily
      manufacture by stamping methods, and with the sets secured as a
      stack at their center rear hubs and with the individual blades
      formed by a connecting each blade outer edge end to a forward disk
      to form the wind sail receptor where the individual blades are
      equally spaced and including a shaft or axle fitted between the
      forward disk and rear hub to turn or be turned by a power
      producing device, producing a power output from the blade turning.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention is in a unique wind sail receptor
      configuration for inclusion in a wind power or water operated
      system where blade turning converts wind or water flow energy into
      usable power, or where blade turning provides thrust through
      water. Two wind sail receptor segments of three to five blades
      each can be used, with a four-blade assembly being preferred and
      are herein referred to as a quad blade assembly, for forming the
      wind sail receptor assembly. The two segments of three to five
      blades each are fitted one over the other and connected at rear
      hub sections, with ends of each of the blades then bent through a
      selected arc as determined by the relationship of the axial
      spacing distance between the rear hub and forward disk and the
      blade length between which hub and its connection point to the
      forward disk, with the blade ends connected, at spaced intervals,
      around the forward disk. A shaft or axle is secured between the
      rear hub sections and forward disk, and that shaft is journaled
      between bearings in a frame or housing to allow the shaft or axle
      to be turned by blade turning responsive to an air of water flow
      through the blades, or the axle itself can be turned to turn the
      blades in water to generate thrust. Each blade segment is formed
      from a flat section of a stiff material, such as from light gauge
      steel, plastic, fiberglass or an elastomeric material, such as
      urethane. In practice, for forming each of the blade segments,
      like spaced sections corresponding to the number of blades to be
      formed in the section, are removed at equal intervals from the
      flat section of stiff material, with the removed sections
      extending from an outside edge to a point spaced apart from the
      flat section center that becomes the rear hub. A hole is formed in
      a dog leg bend of each blade of each of two blade segments, and
      each blade is bent through an arc that is determined from the
      ratio of the length of the axle between the rear hub and forward
      disk to the length of the blade between its hub and the blade's
      mounting to the forward disk at the hole in the blade dog leg
      bend. Which ratio, to form the b lade of the invention, requires
      that the axle length be approximately point seventy-five (0.75) to
      point eighty-five (0.85) of the blade length.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] For an a six to ten bladed blade assembly, the pair of wind
      sail receptor sections are aligned over one another, and, with the
      rear hubs of each section aligned, each blade is bent through the
      arc determined by a ratio of the distance between the rear hub and
      front disk, with that hub to disk spacing ratio being from point
      seventy-five (0.75) to point eighty-five (0.85) of the blade
      length, connecting the blade dog leg bent to the forward disk, at
      one of spaced radial holes that are each equidistant from the
      center of which forward disk, forming the wind sail receptor. So
      arranged, for the six to ten blade assembly formed by the stack of
      two wind sail receptor segments, blade segment rear hubs are
      fitted over one another, aligning center holes through each. Which
      rear hubs holes align with a center hole formed through the
      forward disk to connect to an axle fixing the spacing distance
      therebetween as determined for the blade length. Which axle is
      journaled through bearings in a frame or mount, to be turned by a
      turning of the blade assembly to turn a power generation device,
      such as a generator. Or, where the blade assembly and axle are
      turned in a water flow to provide thrust, a motor or the like is
      connected to turn the axle. Where the blade assembly is turned by
      wind, the blade assembly, axle and frame the axle is mounted in,
      and the power generation device,<br>
      <br>
      [0016] For the preferred eight-blade assembly, the individual
      blades leading edges are spaced equidistantly apart approximately
      forty-five (45) degrees, and curve identically from the leading
      edge to a trailing edge that is itself curved outwardly from a
      lesser width across the blade end through approximately one
      hundred eighty (180) degrees to an end that butts against the
      blade rear hub. So arranged, the curved blade surface receives an
      air or water flow that passes between the adjacent blades that is
      essentially without turbulence and acts upon that curved area that
      functions like a head or jib sail, efficiently converting wind or
      water flow energy into blade turning. Which efficiency, in
      practice, is approximately ninety (90) percent efficient. The air
      or water flow, during its passage through the wind sail receptor
      is essentially turbulence free, with that flow smoothly directed
      over each blade surface to pass off of the outward curve formed as
      a trailing edge of the blade. In practice, for a wind sail
      receptor having a diameter of six (6) feet, a wind velocity of
      approximately eight (8) miles per hour directed into the wind sail
      receptor will produce approximately a megawatt of power. As a
      comparison, for a current three blade wind mill arrangement, to
      produce a like power output, the blade assembly diameter, across
      the hub must be approximately two hundred feet. Which wind mill
      will, of course, experience exponentially greater friction forces
      than those the six foot diameter wind sail receptor of the
      invention will experiences in like wind conditions. The wind sail
      receptor of the invention will, accordingly, have lesser
      maintenance requirements than such two hundred foot diameter wind
      mill, will be far cheaper to construct and maintain.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] While a wind sail receptor formed from blade segments
      having three to five blades, forming a six to ten blade assembly,
      the invention can incorporate the single blade section of three to
      five equal spaced blades that are fitted to an axle and, which
      blade assembly will still function like, though not as
      efficiently, as the stack of blade sections that form the six to
      ten blade assembly, within the scope of this disclosure. The
      invention can be mounted in a frame where the wind sail receptor
      is mounted to an axle journaled therein to turn freely to receive
      an air flow directed therethrough. Further, the invention mounted
      onto an axle can be turned by a power source in water to produce
      an output thrust. Where the blade assembly of the invention is to
      be turned by a wind or water flow, a frame is appropriate to mount
      the axle between bearing, and where the wind sail receptor is for
      use as a wind mill, such frame will be preferably mounted to a
      pivot that, in turn, will be fitted to pivot on, a pole, tower, or
      the like. Such frame can be a half or full hoop, or the like, that
      includes side brackets for attachment between sides of a yoke that
      is fitted onto, to rotate freely on a pole, to weather vane into a
      wind. Which frame to also provide for mounting a power generating
      device, such as a generator, to be turned by the turning blade
      assembly, generating power that can be transmitted to a power
      storage device, such as a battery or batteries, or the like.
      Additionally, the frame, rearwardly from the blade assembly, can
      mount a rudder arrangement to provide for turning the frame around
      its yoke pivot mount to weather vane and position the blade
      assembly into the wind.<br>

      <br>
      [0026] The invention is in a wind sail receptor for turning,
      responsive to a flow of air therethrough, for producing usable
      power. FIG. 1 shows a single four blade section 111 of a wind sail
      receptor 10, as shown in FIGS. 4 through 6. Though, it should be
      understood, such single section 11 can consist of three to five
      blades, within the scope of this disclosure. In FIG. 1 arrows A
      are included to illustrate the flow of air around a curved portion
      of each of the identical blades 12, and which curve is illustrated
      by arrows B in FIG. 2, and is produced by bending each blade 12
      between the rear hub 14 and end hole 13 in dog leg 16, shown as
      broken line D in FIG. 1, The bending to produce a curve or arc
      that is determined by a ratio of the distance between a rear hub
      14 and forward disk 18, shown as broken line E in FIG. 5, referred
      to as axial distance, to the forward disk 18, forming the blade
      12, as shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4. Which axial distance from the
      rear hub 14 to forward disk 18 ratio is from point seventy-five
      (0.75) to point eighty-five (0.85) of the blade length, taken from
      the rear hub 14 to a connection hole 13, shown in FIG. 2, that is
      on the end of a dog leg 16 and receives a fastener to connect the
      blade end to the forward disk at one of spaced radial holes by a
      screw 19, or like fastener, passed through holes 13 and turned
      into one of the forward disk holes. Which holes are each spaced
      equally apart and are equidistant from the center of which forward
      disk. The blade 12 curved portion is formed by bending each blade
      12, as indicated by arrow C. The blade 12, to provide for which
      bending, includes the dog leg 16, that extends from a rear hub
      section 15 wherethrough a center hole 14 is formed. The blade dog
      leg 16 has the hole 13 formed therethrough, and the blade dog leg
      is bent, shown as arrows C, to where the hole 13 aligns over one
      of from three to ten equal spaced radial holes, with four spaced
      holes shown in FIG. 3, formed through forward disk 18, as shown in
      FIG. 1, to receive a fastener, like a screw 19, coupling the blade
      dog leg end 16 at hole 13 onto the forward disk 18, at the center
      of a forward end of the four blade section 11 of the wind sail
      receptor 10. The forward disk 18 and rear hub 15 are thereby
      spaced apart the selected distance for the length of blade 12 to
      produce the desired smooth curved surface therein. An axle 20 is
      rigidly mounted to the extend across the forward disk 18 to the
      rear hub, spanning the distance therebetween, and extending, at a
      right angle from the rear hub 15 center, and which axle can extend
      beyond the rear hub 14, as shown in FIG. 5, or out from the
      forward disk 18, for mounting through bearings to turn in a frame
      or housing, like the frame 30, shown in FIG. 6, and to connect to
      a power generating device, as discussed herein below with respect
      to FIGS. 6 and 7. Further, the wind sail receptor blade 10, it
      should be understood, can be arranged to be turned in water at
      axle 20 by a power source, such as a motor, not shown, to provide
      an output thrust, within the scope of this disclosure. Also, where
      the wind sail receptor 19 is shown in the drawings as being turned
      by wind, it should be understood that it can positioned in, to be
      turned by a liquid, such as water, within the scope of this
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 2 shows the single section 11 of wind sail receptor 10
      as a flat section that has been cut out of a flat piece of a flat
      stiff material. As shown, like sections of material are removed at
      spaced radial intervals from around the center of the section,
      leaving blades 12 forward or leading edges 12a, dog leg bend sides
      16 with end holes 13 formed through the ends, rounded rear or
      trailing edges 12a, and with flat ends 12c. Which blades 12 are
      shown identically bent through smooth curves or arcs as shown in
      FIG. 2, and are connected, at radial points around, to a forward
      disk 18. Which connection can be made with fasteners 19 that are
      fitted through holes 13 formed at the ends of dog leg sections 16,
      producing the blade section 11 of FIGS. 1 and 3, as shown in FIG.
      3. The blade single section 11 can be stamped out of a sheet of an
      appropriate material, such as a thin gauge steel, plastic or an
      elastomeric material, such as a polyurethane, or can be formed by
      casting, molding or other appropriate methods, within the scope of
      this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As set out above, the invention involves the combination of
      the two single sections 11 that are fitted together at their rear
      hubs and with their blades 12 bent to and connected to the forward
      disk, forming the wind sail receptor 10, as shown in FIGS. 4
      through 7. Which wind sail receptor 10, if three, four of five
      blade sections 11, are used would have six, eight or ten blades
      respectively. The invention, provides, in practice, approximately
      a ninety (90) percent and greater efficiency in a utilization of
      an air flow passing into and through the assembly. While an
      eight-blade 12 assembly is shown, it should be understood that an
      assembly of two sections to form an assembly of six, eight or
      twelve blades 12, is within the scope of this disclosure and will
      produce a much more efficient wind conversion device than any
      early wind mill assembly. Such wind sail receptor 10 provides for
      efficiently converting wind energy into rotational energy by
      turning a power generation device, such as a generator 45, shown
      in FIGS. 6 and 7. Though, it should be understood, a wind sail
      receptor 10 that includes a single section 11 only of three, four
      or five blades, can be used to convert wind energy into rotation
      of an axle 20 for turning a power generation device, within the
      scope of this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 4 shows a top plan view of the wind sail receptor 10
      of the invention, illustrating that, prior to bending of the
      blades 12, two of the single sections 11 are fitted together, one
      over the other, and with the rear hubs 15 of each secured
      together. So arranged, the blades 12 are equidistant from one
      another. Thereafter, the blades 12 are individually bent to a
      selected arc or curve, as set out above, and are each blade is
      connected to one of spaced radial holes formed in the forward disk
      18 as with fasteners 19. The forward disk holes are equally spaced
      apart and are equidistant from the forward disk 18 center. The
      individual blades 12 dog leg sections 16 holes 13 are aligned with
      the forward disk 18 holes and screws 19, or like fasteners, are
      turned therein, securing the blades dog leg sections 16 to the
      forward disk 18. For the two four-blade sections 11, a spacing
      distance of approximately forty-five (45) degrees, is thereby
      provided between each of the eight blades 12 forward edges 12a,
      and the direction of that air flow through the blades is like that
      shown in FIG. 1 for the single section 11. Which air flow is
      directed around each blade 12, traveling across the blades, as
      shown by arrows A in FIG. 1, and off of the blades at trailing
      edge 12b. Air passage travels along and follows the blade arc or
      curve, with the blades functioning like a head or jib sail,
      converting approximately ninety (90) percent of the wind energy of
      an eight to ten mile per hour wind passed into blades 12. An axle
      20, is shown in FIG. 5, that is secured to extend at a right angle
      from the center of the joined rear hubs 15, within the wind sail
      receptor 10, and connects through the center of the forward disk
      18. The axle 20 provides for a spacing distance between which
      forward disk 18 and rear hubs 15 as relating to the blade length
      across the dog leg section 16 for determining blade curve or arc,
      as set out above, and may extend out from either, or both the
      forward disk 118 and rear hub 14 for mounting in bearings in a
      frame 30, shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 as a half hoop, and for turning a
      power generation assembly, like generator shown in FIGS. 6 and 7,
      for converting wind sail receptor 10 turning into a power output,
      as set out below.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIGS. 6 and 7 show the wind sail receptor 10 axle 20
      connected to the forward disk 18 and rear hubs 15, and journaled
      through bearings 35, shown best in FIG. 7 that are mounted through
      forward and rear horizontal members 31 and 32, respectively, of a
      frame 30. Which frame 30 is shown as having a half hoop shape. As
      shown, the frame 30 forward horizontal member 31 is a bar that
      connects on its opposite ends to the tops of the half frame 30
      forward edge 30a, and the rear horizontal member 32, is also a bar
      like the horizontal member 31 and connects at its opposite ends to
      opposite ends of the half frame 30 at a rear edge 33. To mount the
      frame 30 wherein the wind sail receptor 10 is journaled at
      bearings 35 to turn, the frame 30 includes a yoke 36 that is
      rigidly secured at its ends 36a to bottom or undersurfaces of
      brackets 37 that are secured, in horizontal alignment, to opposite
      sides of the outer surface 30b of frame 30, proximate to the frame
      ends. The yoke 36 further includes a straight male pole mount 38
      that is secured at a top end 38a to the frame undersurface,
      extending at a right angle downwardly therefrom, and equidistant
      from the brackets 37. Which straight male pole mount 38 is for
      fitting into, to turn freely in, a head end of a pole, not shown,
      whose opposite end is mounted to support the pole in a vertical
      attitude, with the forward end of the wind sail receptor 10 facing
      into a wind.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] To provide for wind sail receptor 10 positioning to face
      into a wind, the pivot mounting of the yoke male pole mount 38 to
      the pole head end is arranged to allow the wind sail receptor 10
      and frame 30 to turn through three hundred sixty (360) degrees.
      Shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, to provide for which wind sail receptor 10
      and frame 30 turning into a wind, the frame 30 includes braces 40
      that are each connected on a forward end 40a to one of the
      brackets 37 and extend rearwardly to connect, on rear ends 40b, to
      opposite sides of a tail or rudder 41. The rudder 41, when acted
      upon by a wind, tends to weather vane into the wind, turning the
      frame 30 and wind sail receptor 10 into, to face into, that wind.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The wind sail receptor 10, facing into a wind, will be
      turned by that wind, turning also the axially connected axle 20
      that, in turn, is connected to turn also a power generation
      device, converting wind energy into usable energy. While the wind
      sail receptor 10, can be connected to turn a number of power
      generation devices, for the purpose of this disclosure, FIGS. 6
      and 7 show an electrical generator 45 mounted to ends 46a of
      struts 46 that, in turn, are secured to the rear surfaces of
      brackets 37, suspending the generator behind the wind sail
      receptor 10, and ahead of the rudder 41. So arranged, the
      generator 45 rotor, not shown, connects to, and is turned by, the
      wind sail receptor 10 axle 20. That rotor is turned in an armature
      winding or stator creating electrical current that is transferred
      through wires 45a to transfer a flow of electricity from the
      generator 45 to an electrical energy-operated device, not shown,
      to batteries, not shown, or into a power grid, not shown. While an
      electrical generator 45 is shown herein as a device that the wind
      sail receptor 10 of the invention can be connected to so as to
      produce a power output, it should be understood that other devices
      that are turned to produce an energy output could be used within
      the scope of this disclosure, and that the wind sail receptor is
      suitable for turning in a liquid flow, such as water, and for
      turning in a liquid, such as water, to generate thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Where the wind sail receptor 10 preferably includes the
      pair of wind sail receptor sections 11 that are axially connected
      together, it should be understood that a single wind sail receptor
      section 11 can be utilized to produce wind power, within the scope
      of this disclosure. Such single section 11, would not, however, be
