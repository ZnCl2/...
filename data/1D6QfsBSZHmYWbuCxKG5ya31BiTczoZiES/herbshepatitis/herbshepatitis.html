      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>HERBAL REMEDIES FOR HEPATITIS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>St. Mary's Thistle.(Silybum marianum)</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Silybum marianum, milk thistle</b><br>
      <br>
      Also known as milk thistle and variegated thistle, it is a common
      weed of pastures in Eastern Australia as well as in Europe and
      North America. It is regarded as the standard amongst
      hepatoprotective herbs and remains the most well studied (up to 50
      studies and clinical trials).<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      <br>
      Flavonolignans. These are unusual polyphenolic compounds referred
      to collectively as silymarin.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      <br>
      Early studies conducted by Vogel and others demonstrated the dual
      effect of the flavonolignans from Silybum on the liver, ie. a
      membrane stabilizing effect (protecting liver cells from
      destruction from toxins) via anti-oxidant action, and protein
      synthesis enhancing effect, whereby the protected cells act as
      regeneration centres for new cells. The studies on silymarin
      conclusively show its effectiveness in protecting the liver
      against a wide range of toxins, from carbon tetrachloride to
      ethanol. It even prevents poisoning from the deadly Amanita or
      death cap mushroom if administered quickly enough.<br>
      <br>
      Thistle seed preparations are ideal for chronic and post-acute
      stages of hepatitis, rapidly bringing an improvement in appetite
      and well-being. It is also used in fatty degeneration and even
      cirrhosis of the liver. The seeds can be gathered (use gloves!)
      and made into decoctions, or ground up and used quite safely as
      foods. Avoid gathering in areas where chemical sprays are used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dandelion. (Taraxacum officinalis).</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Taraxacum sp., dandelions</b><br>
      <br>
      This is one of the most well known herbs and universal weed.
      Dandelion has a long history of use for liver ailments, and its
      nutrient content is outstanding. While the leaves tend to act as
      potent diuretics it is the roots that are used specifically to
      promote bile and restore liver function.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Vitamins- esp. beta carotine (vit.A) and ascorbic acid.; minerals
      including potassium and calcium; inulin and pectin; sterols.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Dandelion is classes as a choleretic, cholagogue, diuretic and
      mild laxative. It increases appetite and improves digestion. Its
      alkalising effect is beneficial in all detoxification treatments.
      The dried roots can be roasted and taken instead of coffee.
      However unroasted roots are more therapeutic. They can be taken in
      decoction form. Fresh juice of leaves and roots can be taken in 5
      ml doses. This is the most bitter preparation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Artichoke. (Cynara scolymus).</b><br>
      <br>
      Globe artichoke is a popular food originating in Europe which can
      be easily cultivated in Australia. It has a long history of use as
      a bitter digestive herb and is a major remedy for liver and gall
      bladder disorders. It is the leaf that contains these properties.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Cynarin and other phenolic acids; sesquiterpene lactones;
      flavonoids; inulin.<br>
      Minerals, vitamins and enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Choleretic; digestive tonic; diuretic; hypocholesterolemic;
      hepatoprotective.<br>
      <br>
      A safe and reliable herb for all liver disturbances including
      hepatitis. Helps lower cholesterol (made in the liver) and assists
      weight reduction. It can be made into a leaf decoction and take
      alone or in combination with the above two remedies. Artichoke,
      St.Mary's thistle and dandelion all belong to the Asteraceae
      family and work well in combination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Schizandra. (Schizandra sinensis).</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The dried fruits are derived from an aromatic, woody vine that
      grows in China and north-east Asia. It is a member of the Magnolia
      family. The fruits are sour tasting, subsequently stimulating bile
      production.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Lignans known as schizandrins.<br>
      Also contains essential oil, fatty oil and mucilage.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Tonic; astringent; sedative; hepatoprotective.<br>
      <br>
      Studies show it decreases liver enzymes rapidly in various forms
      of hepatitis. In mice it protects liver cells from toxins and
      viruses, and promotes liver protein synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      Schizandra is beneficial for insomnia, memory loss and vision
      impairment. Chinese herbalists make a decoction of the dried
      berries, though they are sometimes eaten. The herb is generally
      taken as part of a specific formula.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reishi Mushroom. (Ganoderma lucidum).</b><br>
      <br>
      This is a polyphore mushroom known in China as Ling-Zhi. It is
      rated as one of the greatest of all medicines, even rivalling the
      legendary ginseng. The wild fungus is now hard to find, but
      extensive cultivation occurs in many Asian countries so it is
      readily available though quite expensive.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Triterpenes including ganoderic acid; polysaccharides; organic
      germanium; adenosine.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Antiviral; antioxidant; antitumor; immuno-stimulant;
      hypoglycaemic; cardiotonic; anti-inflammatory. Hepatoprotective
      action in mice. Hepatitis patients show improved symptoms and less
      tiredness in clinical trials. In China it is frequently used for
      chronic hepatitis. It can be obtained in the dried form or in
      tablets. Daily doses range between 2 and 10g. This herb should to
      be taken under the supervision of a suitably qualified
      practitioner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Phyllanthus. (Phyllanthus amarus, P.gasstroemii).</b><br>
      <br>
      Phyllanthus are low shrubs common across southern Asia and
      Australia. In parts of India the herb is renowned for its success
      in treating hepatitis and jaundice. It has acheived international
      status since the publication of a clinical trial with hepatitis
      B(HVB) patients.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Ellagitannins including geraniin; lignans- phyllanthin;
      flavanoids; alkaloids.<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Astringent; diuretic; cholagogue; antiviral; hepatoprotective.<br>
      <br>
      Direct antiviral effects have been demonstrated in human and
      animal HVB studies, which could be measured by a reduction in the
      virus surface antigen. Several Australian species have also shown
      antiviral properties in animal studies on HVB but no clinical data
      is available. In India fresh roots are considered the most
      effective for jaundice. Australian use is restricted to
      prescription by medical herbalists.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Liquorice. (Glycyrrhiza glabra).</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the most widely used herbs throughout the world, liquorice
      is regarded by herbalists as a harmoniser or balancing agent. It
      certainly improves the flavour of herbal compounds but its
      properties extend much further than flavouring.<br>
      <br>
      Constituents:<br>
      Glycyrrhizin, a triterpenoid saponin; isoflavones<br>
      <br>
      Actions and use:<br>
      Demulcent; expectorant; antiulcer; tonic; antiviral;
      antiinflammatory; hepatoprotective.<br>
      <br>
      Chinese teaching hospitals found its effective rate in treatments
      of chronic HVB over 70%. The herb has a mineralcorticoid effect
      and can cause oedema and hypertension in some people. The popular
      liquorice stick candies are of little use therapeutically, since
      the percentage of liquorice is small while the sugar content is
      high. Pure liquorice root can be obtained in bulk , it has a
      distinct yellow colour due to its flavonoid content. Manufacturers
      use thick liquorice concentrates which are included into a wide
      range of products. Liquorice should not be used over long times
      unless under supervision of a practitioner.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>PRINCIPAL HERBS/ACTIVE COMPONENTS FOR TREATING HEPATITIS B</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Licorice and Its Component Glycyrrhizin</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the substances frequently mentioned in the Chinese
      literature regarding hepatitis B is glycyrrhizin, a component of
      licorice root (Glycyrrhiza uralensis is the species used in
      China). Licorice was an ingredient in many of the prescriptions
      used in ancient times to treat hepatitis. The root is well-known
      for its anti-inflammatory activity; the root, its crude extract,
      certain active components, and synthetic derivatives of the active
      components are used in modern pharmacies for the treatment of
      gastric ulcer. Glycyrrhizin zinc is useful topically as a
      treatment for skin inflammation and ulceration. In Japan, recent
      in vitro studies indicate that glycyrrhizin sulfate may be a
      useful compound for inhibiting HIV infection of cells, based on
      antiretroviral activity. Glycyrrhizin ammoniate is a common
      flavoring agent used in the U.S., so the recognition that
      glycyrrhizin is safe makes it attractive. Large doses of licorice
      or glycyrrhizin can, however, lead to increased aldosterone
      production (by the adrenals) and imbalance of serum sodium and
      potassium levels (both by affecting NaK-ATPase directly and via
      the action of aldosterone) in susceptible individuals. This
      response is not common when glycyrrhizin is used in standard
      therapeutic amounts for treatment of hepatitis; a typical dosage
      of glycyrrhizin corresponds to 15 grams per day of crude, dried
      licorice. Licorice and its active components can be used in the
      treatment of Addison's disease (characterized by reduced
      production of aldosterone and other corticosteroids). Glycyrrhizin
      is an antioxidant and it promotes production of interleukin-2
      (IL-2), two actions that help inhibit viral diseases. Glycyrrhizin
      sulfate appears more active than ammoniate or other forms. Crude
      licorice extract has the advantage of easy access, low cost, and a
      combination of several valuable active components, but isolated
      glycyrrhizin is more readily absorbed than the glycyrrhizin in the
      total herbal extract.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Schizandra and Its Component Schizandrin</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Schizandrin, a lignan, is an active component of schizandra, the
      fruit from Schizandra sinensis. Studies conducted in the 1970's in
      China revealed that schizandra and its component schizandrin could
      strongly lower ALT and AP in animal models of hepatitis and in
      human patients. However, it tended to have the problem that when
      administration of the compound ceased, there was a rebound in
      these enzyme levels. Screening of various analogues led to the
      production of a new drug for hepatitis known as DDB (dimethyl 1-4,
      4'-dimethoxy-5,6,5', 6'dimethylene dioxybiphenyl 1-2,
      2'-dicarboxylate). This compound is strongly hepatoprotective,
      lowering ALS and AP, reducing alpha-fetal protein levels and
      bilirubin, and reducing liver lesions, as indicated by biopsy.<br>
      <br>
      DDB, as a new drug, has undergone numerous trials in China, but is
      not an accepted drug in the West. Schizandra extract has the
      advantage of being a safe food product of China that is also
      widely used in the U.S. as an energy tonic and immune enhancing
      agent. In China, it is used in the treatment of many ailments,
      including asthma, poor memory, severe fatigue, enteritis, and
      diabetes, as well as for viral hepatitis. It enhances adrenal
      cortical function. In clinical tests of anicteric infective
      hepatitis, just 3 grams per day of powdered schizandra fruit for
      one to three months led to a clinical cure in 65% of cases. Higher
      doses, up to 15 grams per day, have been used in the treatment of
      chronic hepatitis. It has been reported that schizandra, like its
      isolated lignans, has a quick action and high rate of
      effectiveness for reducing plasma liver enzyme levels, but that
      relapse occurs relatively easily. It has been suggested that
      schizandra be used with other herbs to increase the therapeutic
      effect and prevent relapse.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Salvia and Its Components the Tanshinones</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Salvia is perhaps the most frequently used herb in the modern
      practice of Chinese herbal medicine. Salvia has been known to
      Chinese doctors for centuries, but had been used in only a few
      applications, while today it is applied in the treatment of a wide
      range of diseases and symptoms. Salvia has a complex chemistry,
      and as a result, the crude herb extract is often used rather than
      an isolated component. The main active constituents are the
      tanshinones, a type of naphthaquinone. Salvia is used in China as
      a health food product; regular ingestion is thought to prevent
      cardiovascular diseases and other problems of aging.<br>
      <br>
      Salvia plays two major roles in the treatment of liver disease.
      First, it has been learned that in cases of severe or chronic
      liver disease, there are alterations in microcirculation
      (capillary bed circulation) that appear to be part of the disease
      process. Patients treated with salvia who show clinical
      improvements also show normalization of the microcirculation.
      Second, salvia inhibits fibrinogen and aids in the resorption of
      fibrous plaques in the liver. It is thus widely used in the
      treatment of liver cirrhosis. Salvia is provided as a single herb
      or in complex formulas in the treatment of both acute and chronic
      hepatitis. As a single herb, it is given intravenously to quickly
      improve the condition of patients suffering from liver or kidney
      diseases. Usual oral dosages of salvia for treating severe
      diseases are 15-20 grams in decoction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hu-Chang and Its Anthraquinone Components</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hu-chang (Polygonum cuspidatum) refers to one of the many species
      of Polygonum used by Chinese doctors. It contains anthraquinones
      as main active components, as well as resveratrol, a stilbene. The
      herb, used alone, or in combination with other herbs, has been
      reported to cure both acute and chronic hepatitis, though it has
      been suggested to have greater impact on acute hepatitis. Hu-chang
      is one of the broad-spectrum antiviral agents under investigation
      in China and Japan. Hu-chang prevents lipid peroxidation, and thus
      prevents hepatic degeneration; it also promotes liver cell
      regeneration through RNA synthesis. The herb has been used in
      China to rescue patients with severe viral hepatitis who do not
      seem to recover when given standard Western therapies. In
      addition, hu-chang influences microcirculation in a manner similar
      to salvia.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Curcuma and Its Essential Oil Components</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Curcuma (yujin) refers to one of three major species of curcuma
      used in Chinese medicine, the other two are turmeric (huangjiang)
      and zedoaria (ezhu). It contains a complex essential oil that
      regulates blood lipids and treats infectious hepatitis. In a study
      of acute and chronic hepatitis involving 33 patients, all but one
      responded to the daily ingestion of a powder of curcuma (5 grams
      each time, three times daily), with 2/3 of the patients having
      subjective symptoms completely relieved. Curcuma stimulates bile
      secretion. Curcumin, a bright yellow complex ketone found in both
      turmeric and curcuma, is currently under investigation as an
      anti-HIV agent; it appears to block a long terminal repeat (LTR)
      during reproduction of the virus. This action may apply to other
      viruses and to preventing activation of cancer genes. Curcumin is
      also a powerful anti-inflammatory agent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ligustrum and Its Component Oleanolic Acid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ligustrum refers to the seed of Ligustrum lucidum. It is rich in
      oleanolic acid, a compound that appears to be effective in
      treatment of liver diseases, acting mainly as a liver-protective
      agent. It is reported to be efficacious in treating both acute and
      chronic hepatitis, with a cure rate of 70% for acute hepatitis and
      it was markedly effective in treating 44% of cases of chronic
      hepatitis. Ligustrum has been identified as one of the herbs that
      strongly enhances immune responses, reversing leukopenia from
      cancer therapeutic agents. Ligustrum is used as a health food in
      the U.S. to enhance immune functions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silybum and Its Component Silymarin</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silymarin is a complex flavonoid from Silybum marianum, an herb
      that was initially introduced as a therapeutic agent by European
      researchers, but soon taken up by their counterparts in China as a
      treatment for liver diseases. Its main action is to protect the
      liver from damage, and it is used, for example, in the early stage
      of liver destruction due to ingestion of poisonous mushrooms, to
      save the lives of victims. A concentrated extract of silybum, rich
      in silymarin, is sold as a health product in the U.S. and the
      isolate has been sold as a drug in Europe ("Legalon") for the
      treatment of liver disease for the past 15 years. A dosage of 140
      mg/day is reported to be liver protective and a dosage of 420
      mg/day is reported to help repair liver damage. It is not clear
      that silymarin can cure viral hepatitis. Silybum extracts are
      widely sold as health foods in the United States.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A PROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following formula is recommended for treatment of hepatitis B
      and was the subject of a clinical trial conducted in China during
      1994-1996, and later produced as a tablet for use in Western
      countries (Seven Forests Salvia/Ligustrum Tablets):<br>
      <br>
      <b>Salvia (danshen, root of Salvia miltiorrhiza): 21%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Licorice (gancao, root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis): 16%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hu-chang: (huzhang, rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum): 16%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Curcuma (yujin, tuber of Curcuma longa): 11%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Schizandra (wuweizi, fruit of Schizandra sinensis): 10%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Ligustrum (nüzhenzi, fruit of Ligustrum lucidium): 16%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Atractylodes (baizhu, rhizome of Atractylodes
        macrocephala): 11%</b><br>
      [total is 101% due to rounding]<br>
      <br>
      Atractylodes is included in this formulation as a digestive aid,
      though its use can also be justified on the basis of laboratory
      studies showing that it protects mice from liver injury induced by
      carbon tetrachloride and promotes liver cell regeneration; it is
      also used as an ingredient in several complex formulas for
      treatment of viral hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      The herb ingredients are made as a decoction, dried, and formed
      into tablets of 800 mg each (880 mg in the Chinese clinical
      trial). The dosage schedule for the herb materials is 9 tablets
      each time, three times daily, for a total dose of 27 tablets or
      about 23 grams of herb extracts. This corresponds, approximately,
      to 94 grams of crude herb materials used to prepare a decoction,
      after which the decoction is dried [the herb extract was
      manufactured by Sun Ten Laboratories, Irvine, California]. The
      daily dosage of licorice, which is the marker compound for
      determining dosage of the mixture to administer, is 15 grams.<br>
      <br>
      A vitamin tablet was used simultaneously, one tablet each time,
      three times daily in the Chinese trial. Each tablet contained:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silybum extract (8:1): 135 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin C (as calcium ascorbate): 250 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Beta carotene: 6 mg (10,000 IU)</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin E: 133 IU</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Zinc (acetate): 5 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Selenium (amino acid chelate): 40 mcg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Quercetin: 100 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>l-Cysteine: 40 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B1: 5 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B2: 3 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B3: 10 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B5: 10 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B6: 12 mg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Vitamin B12: 50 mcg</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Folic acid: 200 mcg</b><br>
      <br>
      In the U.S., this tablet is replaced by two formulas (produced by
      ITM, White Tiger label): Quercenol, an antioxidant mixture that
      includes silybum, and Calmagnium, a mineral/vitamin mixture. In
      addition, some protocols include Alpha-Curcumone (a source of
      alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant used in the treatment of
      hepatitis). At standard recommended dosage, these supplements
      provide a larger amount and wider range of nutrients and
      antioxidants that were applied in the Chinese trial.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DURATION OF TREATMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Based on clinical experience in China, a 12-week treatment period
      is satisfactory as a standard course of treatment for chronic
      hepatitis B, which can be repeated once more if necessary. The
      basis for recommending this treatment period is a compromise
      between maximizing compliance and assuring measurable activity of
      the prescribed compounds. For the purpose of assuring maximum
      compliance, the treatment duration should be as short as possible.
      The minimum duration of treatment depends on the amount of time
      that is reasonable to obtain a satisfactory therapeutic effect,
      which is defined for the purpose of the Chinese study as the
      ability to attain 50% of patients experiencing both seroconversion
      (of HBsAg and/or HBeAg), and a decline of ALT and AP to within 1.5
      times the maximal level of the normal range. For the other 50% (or
      fewer) of the patients, a second course of treatment is
      recommended. A certain number of non-responders is to be expected,
      even with two courses of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      A problem with long-term follow-up in the case of hepatitis B is
      that reinfection is always possible, especially since the disease
      can be sexually transmitted and the individual's partner may not
      have been treated at the same time. On the other hand, it is
      possible that the primed immune system of the successfully treated
      patient can prevent reinfection. According to Chinese reports,
      reversion to positive antigen test response occurs in only about
      10% of patients successfully treated with Chinese herbs if
      followed-up during the first year after conclusion of herb
      therapy. This apparent conversion to positive hepatitis test is
      probably the result of activation of remaining latent virus in
      most cases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SAMPLE STUDIES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Following are brief reviews of eight clinical trials in which a
      treatment time of three months or less was sufficient to obtain
      results such as those suggested above. The numbers in brackets
      after the study summary are the reference codes for the report
      abstract as found in the journal Abstracts of Chinese Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Study reported in 1989 of treatment of chronic active hepatitis B.
      The treatment protocol included a decoction, a tableted herb
      component, and vitamin E, used daily for three months. The control
      group used biphenyldicarboxylate (in place of herb decoction),
      plus the herb tablet and vitamin E. The seroconversion rate of
      HBsAg for those taking the herb decoction was 67%, while that for
      the control was just 7%; for HBeAg, the rates were 53% and 13%
      respectively. In a one year follow-up of 20 cases from each group,
      the relapse rates were 10% and 60% respectively. According to this
      study, a three month treatment time was adequate to obtain a 50%
      seroconversion rate. [891191]<br>
      <br>
      Study reported in 1989 of asymptomatic carriers with positive
      HBsAg treated with a decoction given twice daily for one month as
      a treatment course. If the HBsAg test became negative, the
      decoction was administered only every other day for one or more
      additional months, but if it remained positive, an additional herb
      was added and the treatment continued daily. When the test was
      negative twice consecutively, the treatment was discontinued. 58
      of 80 cases (73%) were cured within three courses of therapy and
      17 others had reduced HBsAg titers. This study shows that three
      months of therapy is adequate to obtain at least 50%
      seroconversion. [891152]<br>
      <br>
      Study reported in 1991 included 304 patients with chronic
      hepatitis B. They were treated with herbs in pill form for 2 to 3
      months. 128 of the patients, 63%, were rated cured, with HBsAg and
      HBeAg becoming negative. Only 32 patients failed to respond. This
      study shows that a three month treatment period is adequate for at
      least 50% seroconversion. [930249]<br>
      <br>
      Study reported in 1982 involving 80 patients with chronic or acute
      hepatitis. Glycyrrhizin was administered along with vitamins to
      the treatment group and the vitamins were given with injection of
      inosine in the control group. Treatment time was one month for
      acute hepatitis and three months for chronic hepatitis. Clinical
      cure was claimed for 85% of the acute hepatitis group and 75% of
      the chronic hepatitis group treated with herbs. Only a few of the
      patients treated here were positive for HBsAg and HBeAg. Of those
      who were positive, there was no seroconversion in the control
      group, but seroconversion occurred in about 50% of the
      glycyrrhizin treated group. Most of the seropositives at the
      beginning of the trial were in the chronic hepatitis group. This
      study indicates that 50% seroconversion can be achieved in a three
      month period of treatment. [Reported in the English language
      Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine 1982; 4(2): 127-132]<br>
      <br>
      A study reported in 1987 with 104 patients having hepatitis A and
      72 having hepatitis B, all acute cases, were treated with a
      decoction plus vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and diisoproplylamine
      ascorbate. It was claimed that 158 cases (90%) were cured in 6 to
      24 days, average duration of treatment was 16 days. Seroconversion
      information was not provided. This is consistent with the practice
      of treating acute hepatitis (A or B) for only about one month. In
      some other studies of acute hepatitis, a course of treatment was
      15 days and might be repeated once. [880291]<br>
      <br>
      A study reported in 1987, with 71 cases of hepatitis B with
      positive HBsAg, were treated with a decoction of herbs. Acute
      cases were given 3-4 doses per day for 20 days as a therapeutic
      course. Other cases were given just 2 doses per day for 30 days as
      a therapeutic course. When HBsAg became negative, the treatment
      was reduced to once every other day for one month. A control group
      received Western drugs and, if SGPT was elevated, an herb syrup
      known to control that condition was given. 47 cases in the
      treatment group (67%) seroconverted. The exact number of
      therapeutic courses was not reported in the abstract, but
      presumably was one to three courses, as standard practice.
      [880263]<br>
      <br>
      In a study reported in 1987, a treatment for hepatitis B in
      decoction form was given to 31 patients. The effect of this
      therapy, based on tonic herbs, was not especially great, but it
      was reported that it took "at least two months" to attain
      seroconversion. A three month trial with a more effective therapy
      would therefore appear adequate. [880251]<br>
      <br>
      According to this information, among the participants who respond
      to the therapy, those with acute hepatitis should be cured (or
      improved) within about two months and those with chronic hepatitis
      should be cured (or improved) within three months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>POSSIBLE ADVERSE REACTIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are some potential adverse reactions to any herb therapy, as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      a) gastro-intestinal reactions including nausea, bloating,
      flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting.<br>
      <br>
      b) allergy type reaction, including hepatic reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The above reactions are idiosyncratic, that is, they cannot be
      predicted in advance and do not represent inherent properties of
      the selected herbs. If such reactions occur, it may be necessary
      to have the individual experiencing the reaction discontinue the
      treatment. The gastro-intestinal reactions usually subside within
      three to five days and thus they should be tolerated for that long
      before discontinuing unless they are severe. Allergy-type
      reactions are not expected to resolve with longer use of the
      herbs.<br>
      <br>
      There are some possible specific reactions to the therapies.
      Licorice may cause excessive aldosterone production, with symptoms
      of edema, fatigue, and arrhythmia. The dosage of licorice in this
      protocol is set at a level for which this reaction is rare.
      Hu-chang, which contains anthraquinones, ligustrum, which contains
      oils, and curcuma, which increases bile flow, may induce
      intestinal peristalsis, loose stool, or diarrhea. In most
      individuals, this response will resolve with continued use of the
      herbs. However, in rare instances, the problem might persist.<br>
      <br>
      In the Chinese clinical trial of the herb formulation described
      here and in three years experience in the U.S. with the same
      preparation, adverse reactions to the herb/nutrient treatment have
      not been observed.<br>
      <br>
      In the event that such responses are noted and believed to be due
      to the herb therapy (as opposed to due to the hepatitis), the herb
      therapy should be discontinued for two consecutive days, to
      determine whether or not the observed problems are due to the
      ingestion of the herbs (for liver hypersensitivity reaction, the
      duration of symptom persistence could be longer). None of the
      herbs <br>
      are inherently toxic in the dosage range recommended.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HERB THERAPY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hepatitis begins as an acute disease (with manifestations of
      heat), which is described in Chinese medical terminology as a
      toxic heat syndrome. As the disease develops, it is said to
      manifest symptoms of accumulated dampness and liver qi stagnation.
      In the event that the disease becomes chronic, it is believed that
      the yin becomes deficient, there is blood stasis (mainly affecting
      the liver), and the qi is weakened (weakness of qi may be the
      cause of the acute disease becoming a chronic disease).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hu-chang</b> is the herb that has been selected to treat the
      toxic heat syndrome. It is described as a cold, bitter, mildly
      pungent, and sour agent that clears up heat, detoxifies,
      invigorates blood, and disperses swelling. Antibacterial and
      antiviral effects have been demonstrated in pharmacology
      experiments with this herb.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Curcuma</b> is the herb that has been selected to treat the
      stagnant qi that develops. The herb is said to have a cool
      property, with a bitter and pungent flavor. It is traditionally
      used to regulate the flow of qi, resolve qi stagnation, disperse
      stagnant blood, and control pain. It is applied to treatment of
      liver pain and jaundice. Modern research shows that it stimulates
      gastric secretion and bile secretion, to improve appetite and
      improve digestion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Salvia</b> is the herb that has been selected to treat blood
      stasis. It is described as having a mild cold property and bitter
      flavor. It is traditionally used to invigorate blood circulation,
      cool the blood, nourish the blood, and calm mental irritability.
      Modern research shows that it rectifies abnormal patterns of
      capillary bed circulation and successfully treats viral hepatitis
      when used in relatively large dosage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ligustrum</b> is the herb that has been selected to treat yin
      deficiency. It is described as having a neutral property and
      bitter taste. It is traditionally used for yin deficiency,
      internal heat, weakness of the lower back and legs, and insomnia.
      Recent studies indicate that it enhances immune functions and
      protects liver cells from damage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Licorice</b> has been selected as the qi tonic herb. It is
      described as having a neutral property and sweet flavor. It is
      traditionally used to supplement the spleen, replenish qi, clear
      heat, remove toxin, and harmonize the stomach. It has been applied
      in the treatment of toxic swellings, diarrhea, thirst, cough, and
      palpitation. Recent studies show that it has anti-inflammatory
      action similar to that of the corticosteroids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Atractylodes</b> has been selected as the herb to remove
      dampness. It is also a qi tonic herb. It is described as having a
      warm property, sweet, mildly bitter and aromatic flavor.
      Traditionally, it is used to supplement the spleen, tonify qi, dry
      dampness, deliver water, harmonize the stomach and spleen. It has
      been used for treatment of fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea,
      edema, spontaneous sweating, vomiting, and dizziness. Modern
      research shows that it promotes immune system functions, protects
      the liver from chemical injury, and has anticoagulant properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Schizandra</b> has been selected as an aid to the qi tonic
      (licorice) and the yin nourishing herb (ligustrum). It is
      traditionally described as having a warm property and sour flavor.
      It is used to nourish the kidneys, astringe the lungs, control
      diarrhea, and promote secretion of fluids (e.g., saliva). At
      higher dosage, it is said to reinforce the qi and nourish the yin.
      It has been applied to the treatment of fatigue, insomnia,
      amnesia, thirst, spontaneous sweating, cough, and thirst. Modern
      research shows that schizandra enhances adrenocortical function,
      promotes bile secretion, and reduces liver enzyme levels.<br>
      <br>
      The complex formula has the properties of tonifying and regulating
      qi, of nourishing and astringing yin, of vitalizing blood,
      clearing heat and toxin, and drying dampness. Its quality is
      cooling, its taste is mainly sweet and bitter, with some sour and
      acrid (pungent) properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HERB DOSAGES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Chinese doctors recommend herbal dosages that have been recorded
      in the classical and modern Materia Medica publications. Modern
      clinical trials confirm the validity of these dosage suggestions.
      Generally speaking, when making a complex formula, the dosage of
      most ingredients is lower than would be utilized if the herb was
      selected as a sole ingredient, due to the expectation of
      synergistic action (attaining the same goal through complementary
      pathways). Because of the relatively short duration of treatment
      in this study, the dosage of each item has been selected at a
      relatively high level within the range that is usually
      recommended.<br>
      <br>
      Hu-chang is recommended to be used in the dosage range 9-30
      grams/day. A daily dosage of 15 grams has been selected for this
      treatment. In higher dosage, the herb can cause dry mouth, bitter
      after taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      Curcuma is usually recommended in the dosage range 4.5-9
      grams/day. However, in a published trial for treatment of
      hepatitis, it was used in a dosage (as powder) of 15 grams/day. A
      daily dosage of 10 grams per day has been selected for this
      treatment. In higher dosage, this herb may cause abdominal aching
      and diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      Salvia is recommended in the dosage of 6-15 grams for typical
      uses, but 15-30 grams to treat severe diseases, and up to 30-60
      grams for severe blood stasis syndrome. The extract has been used
      intravenously in doses of 22.5 grams or higher (raw material
      equivalent) for treatment of hepatitis. A daily dosage of 20 grams
      has been selected for this treatment. Higher dosage may cause dry
      mouth, dizziness, lassitude, numb sensation of limbs, shortness of
      breath, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal disturbance; these
      responses tend to subside of themselves without suspending
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Ligustrum is recommended in dosages of 6-15 grams per day. Doses
      of up to 50 grams per day (made as fluid extract) have been used
      successfully to treat bronchitis. A daily dosage of 15 grams has
      been selected for this treatment. Higher dosage may cause bloating
      and diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      Licorice is recommended to be used in doses of 3-6 grams per day.
      Doses up to 18 grams per day have been used in treatment of
      tuberculosis. 7.5-15 grams per day have been used to treat gastric
      and duodenal ulcers. A daily dose of 15 grams has been selected
      for this treatment. Excessive dosage or long-term use of moderate
      dosage can cause an adverse reaction in up to 20% of patients,
      including possible symptoms of edema, weak limbs, spastic
      numbness, dizziness, headache, hypertension, hypokalamia.<br>
      <br>
      Atractylodes is recommended in the dosage range of 3-12 grams.
      Doses up to 60 grams per day have been used for short-term
      applications. A daily dose of 10 grams has been selected for this
      treatment. Adverse reactions to large dosage have not been
      described, but gastro-intestinal responses might be expected.<br>
      <br>
      Schizandra is recommended in the dosage range of 1.5-9 grams per
      day; with 6-9 grams per day recommended to reinforce qi and
      nourish yin. Up to 15 grams per day (powdered herb) have been used
      in the treatment of hepatitis. A daily dosage of 9 grams has been
      selected for this treatment. Higher dosage may cause heartburn,
      acid indigestion, stomach ache and anorexia.<br>
      <br>
      The total dosage of the seven herbs is 94 grams. In a review of
      hepatitis formulas listed in modern Chinese books (at the ITM
      library), formulation characteristics were as follows: except for
      the one formula used temporarily at very high dosage, the formula
      size and dosage range is reasonably consistent at 9-12 herbs and
      100-140 grams, typically 11-14 grams of each herb. In the
      formulation described in this article, the number of herbs is only
      7, and the total dosage is just 94 grams (average, about 13 grams
      each). This reduction in number of ingredients-compared to that
      used in several recent trials with complex formulas-has been
      purposefully chosen to simplify the treatment protocol. A few
      clinical trials rely on one to three herbs. The relatively lower
      total dosage was deemed likely to be effective as the higher
      dosage treatments because of the careful selection of ingredients
      (focused formula design). It should be noted that there is an
      additional herb extract present in the "vitamin tablet," namely
      silybum, thus raising the total number of herbs to 8 (the
      substitute item, Quercenol, contains other herb extracts,
      including those from green tea, sophora, and grape seed); the
      dosage of herbs is therefore slightly increased by the inclusion
      of the vitamin tablet. The additional vitamins and minerals may
      provide an action in the current protocol that would otherwise
      have been obtained from herb ingredients.<br>

      <b>RESULTS OF ONE CHINESE CLINICAL TRIAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a clinical trial carried out at three test sites in China,
      there were 94 inpatients treated and evaluated, utilizing three
      therapies (at each site). The main test therapy was the formula
      now called Salvia/Ligustrum Tablets, taken with the vitamin
      tablet. The primary control therapy was a tablet of the same size
      and same dosage made with lentinus extract (shiitake mushroom,
      used in Japanese treatment of hepatitis B), atractylodes, and
      schizandra; the control patients also took the vitamin supplement.
      The third control group took a patent medicine made in China that
      was understood, by the Chinese researchers, to be the most
      effective one available.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of 12 weeks treatment, in the Salvia/Ligustrum group
      and the Lentinus group there was marked improvement in symptoms
      and liver enzymes, more so than with the Chinese patent remedy.
      Antigen conversion from positive to negative occurred for HBeAg in
      2/3 of patients treated by Salvia/Ligustrum or Lentinus Tablets,
      but in only 1/3 of those receiving the Chinese patent. HBsAg
      conversion occurred only in a few patients, 2 receiving
      Salvia/Ligustrum, 1 receiving Lentinus, and none receiving the
      Chinese patent. Nearly half (9/20) of those tested showed viral
      DNA conversion from positive to negative in those receiving
      Salvia/Ligustrum, and in one-third (7/21) of those receiving
      Lentinus, but only in about one-fourth (6/26) of those receiving
      the Chinese patent.<br>
      <br>
      In sum, the Salvia/Ligustrum formula (used with a nutritional
      supplement) produced excellent results in treating hepatitis B
      patients. There were also obvious benefits, though less dramatic,
      for treatment with lentinus, schizandra, atractylodes, and the
      nutritional supplement. These treatments were superior to one that
      had been deemed the best available in China by the researchers.
      The study was conducted at the Hepo Medical Technical Research
      Institute in Beijing, the Haixia Hospital in Quanzhou (Fujian
      Province), and the Henan Medical Science Institute. Testing
      equipment and reagents were provided by the Tumor Virology
      Department of the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta.<br>
      <br>
      The original study design called for treatment of 200 patients.
      New government regulations in China require data on safety (such
      as laboratory animal tests) in order to carry out clinical trials,
      unless the herbs are in the form of decoction. This regulation
      halted (perhaps temporarily) continuation of the trial despite the
      fact that no significant adverse events were noted for any of the
      participants enrolled thus far.<br>

      </b><b>Reishi Mushroom </b>has shown favorable results in
      treating hepatitis, especially in cases without severe impairment
      of liver function (Chang &amp; But, 1986). In a study of 355 cases
      of hepatitis B treated with Wulingdan Pill, which includes the
      fruiting body of Reishi, 92.4% of the patients had positive
      results (Van et al, 1987).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Reishi Mushroom balances the immune system - a remedy of first
      choice for all auto-immune disorders, it also aids liver function
      and circulation.&nbsp; It is a broad acting remedyand can be taken
      on a long-term basis.&nbsp; Reishi has been classed as the highest
      value healing herb in China for thousands of years. Reishi fits
      well into any healing programme, as a general tonic and as an
      immune modulator that tends to calm down the destructive aspects
      of the immune system – often a stumbling block in the treatment of
      chronic health problems.&nbsp; At the same time Reishi will
      improve immune response where it is under functioning.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Milk Thistle</b> is renowned as a liver tonic.&nbsp; In 1960,
      German scientists identified a group of active ingredients
      collectively called silymarin from Milk Thistle, mainly from the
      seeds. Silymarin protects the liver by strengthening the outer
      membranes of liver cells, which prevents toxins from entering the
      cells. Silymarin also stimulates protein synthesis in liver cells,
      which helps to regenerate and repair the liver.&nbsp; Silymarin
      compounds are also strong antioxidants, and have been shown to
      reduce damage to liver cells caused by repeated use of some
      prescription drugs.&nbsp; They may protect liver from alcohol
      damage, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pollutants.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Black Seed Oil</b> improves liver function and associated
      digestive problems. The warming and bitter qualities seem to
      penetrate into blockages in the body and rapidly instigate
      normalisation.&nbsp; Black Seed has an unprecedented strengthening
      effect upon the immune system, and works in a host of other ways
      to promote optimum health and well being.&nbsp; This remarkable
      herb has a legendary status and has had a recent resurgence in
      Western medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its efficacy is solidly backed by
      three thousand years of folklore and the past fifty years have
      seen a burgeoning amount of scientific data to further support
      Black Seed's renowned healing properties.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In Japan, physicians use Liquorice to treat chronic Hepatitis B.
      Glycyrrhizin interferes with hepatitis B surface antigen and is
      synergistic with interferon against hepatitis A virus. It is also
      used at times to treat hepatitis C. Researchers have also
      demonstrated that liquorice helps protect the liver from damage
      due to chemotherapy. At low doses, the herb stimulates the liver
      to manufacture cholesterol and excrete it in bile. This can help
      lower serum cholesterol levels...<br>

      with symptoms, liver enzymes and slowing progression, but they do
      not repair the hardened areas. Cholagogue herbs also work only on
      removing inflammation. To deal with the hardness, I have been
      using, in addition to the above, <b>flax oil and lipoic acid</b>,
      to provide the softening omega three oils along with this lipid
      soluble. Dick Noble just sent me some info on
      SAMe/S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which seems to directly cause
      softening. I have no experience with it. From a TCM perspective
      you would use <b>white peony, salvia, Turtle shell</b> and <b>Curcuma


        tuber</b>, perhaps <b>rhubarb</b> for this aspect. <b>Licorice</b>
      is also useful, as a Japanese study showed halving of liver cancer

      contains 1/2 a gram of powdered herb.<br>
      <b>Garlic</b>, taken fresh, cooked, or in capsules; any commercial
      garlic product should have some garlic smell for full antiviral
      effect.<br>
      Consult an herbalist before taking Baptisia or Lomatium isolate.
      These powerful herbs are available in most natural food stores,
      but they are very strong.<br>
      <br>
      <b>General protective and rebuilding herbs for the liver</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Milk thistle</b> is the major herb for hepatitis; take it as a
      tablet in concentrated, powdered extract form. An average
      therapeutic dose of the 75 or 80 percent standardized extract is
      one tablet three or four times daily. A 10% standardized extract
      is also available, often blended with other liver-protective and
      healing herbs such as turmeric, artichoke leaf, gentian, and
      ginger. Of this preparation, take 1 or 2 tablets, 3 times daily.<br>
      <br>
      Use <b>schisandra </b>in teas, taking 4 to 12 grams daily
      depending on body weight, or as a powdered extract. Avoid alcohol
      tinctures of schisandra during the acute phase of hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      Herbs to prevent liver congestion (bile-moving herbs)<br>
      <br>
      These herbs include <b>artichoke leaf, yellow dock, burdock</b>,
      and <b>dandelion root.</b> Herbs for cooling the liver should be
      added to these three basic formulas in the acute stages of
      hepatitis, when “pathogenic heat” (active inflammation) is
      affecting the liver. Cooling herbs include <b>gentian, yellow
        dock, Oregon grape root, centaury</b>, and <b>coptis</b> (a
      Chinese herb). To determine if your liver is inflamed, consult
      with a licensed acupuncturist or herbalist trained in an
      energetic-based system of natural medicine such as Traditional
      Chinese Medicine or Ayurveda.<br>
      <br>
      Use cooling herbs in tea or as a powdered extract (dried tea) in
      capsule or tablet form. For tea, simmer 50 to 100 grams of cooling
      herbs in about 20 ounces of water for 45 minutes. Steep the herbs
      for 15 minutes, strain and drink 1 cup of the tea, 2 or 3 times
      daily. The herbs will be bitter, a property associated with the
      cooling effect. For sweetness, add 3 to 7 grams of licorice, which
      also has an antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect.<br>
      <br>
      Capsules or tablets of the dried teas (powdered extracts) of
      cooling herbs are available in natural food stores and herb shops.
      These extracts are much more potent than dried herbs ground up and
      placed in capsules or tablets because they contain the active
      ingredients of the plants, minus the sugars and cellulose and
      other fibers that make up the bulk of most herbs. In other words,
      the extraction process concentrates the herb’s activity many
      times.<br>
      <br>
      Once the acute phase of hepatitis has passed, eliminate the
      cooling liver herbs from your regime. Keep taking the other herbs
      and supplements for another month or two, especially the basic
      supportive one. Bile-moving herbs are still appropriate in many
      cases.<br>
      <br>
      If hepatitis becomes chronic, I recommend working with a qualified
      natural health-care practitioner or holistically minded physician
      to design an ongoing herbal formula that contains liver-building
      herbs, enzyme lowering-herbs, bile-movers, and appropriate dietary
      supplements. Such a person can order tests and provide nutritional
      and herbal guidance during the healing process.<br>
      Cool the Liver Tea<br>

      <b>Dandelion root, raw or dried (not roasted) 1 part</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Artichoke leaves 1 part</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Oregon grape root 1 /2 part</b><b><br>

      </b><b>Ginger root, fresh 1 /8 part</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Gentian root 1/8 part</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Simmer the herbs in a covered pot 20 minutes. Remove from heat and
      let steep, covered, for 10 minutes. Drink one cup morning and
      evening and one more if desired. Persist as long as you experience
      benefits.<br>

      </b><b>Ginger 5%</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Note that these percentages are approximate; blend the
      vegetable juices to taste. The ginger is optional. It makes the

      ...Because herbs can interfere with the action of Hepatitis C
      medications, it’s important to tell your doctor about everything
      you’re taking before starting treatment for Hepatitis C.&nbsp; And
      while getting treated, it’s important not to take any new herbs or

      <br>
      Many conventional drugs (for example, isoniazid and valproic acid)
      are well recognized as possible hepatotoxins.1 Several herbal
      medicines have also been reported to have hepatotoxic effects.
      However, herbal medicines may not always be considered as the
      etiologic agent in cases of unexplained liver injury. Current
      mechanisms to track adverse effects of herbal medicines are
      inadequate.2 Consumers generally consider herbal medicines to be
      safe and view them as natural alternatives to traditional
      medications. A recent study showed that only 40% of people who use
      herbal medicines informed their primary care physicians.3
      Therefore, cases of herbal medicine toxicity may go unrecognized.
      Establishing a diagnosis of herbal hepatotoxicity can be
      difficult. Even when herbal-related toxicity is suspected, a
      definitive diagnosis is difficult to establish without proper
      analysis of the product or plant material….<br>

      <b>Castor Oil Transdermal Packs</b><br>
      <br>
      Castor oil that is absorbed through the skin over the liver and
      spleen is of benefit during times of severe inflammation. A person
      will need to first determine where these organs are to accomplish
      this. A rag should be soaked in pure, cold-pressed castor oil
      beforehand. The excess oil should be squeezed out just prior to
      use. Next the rag should be placed onto bare skin over the organs.
      Put a piece of plastic on top of the rag. Then place a hot water
      bottle on top of that. The hot water bottle should be made as hot
      as is bearable. If the person is numbed by drugs or otherwise,
      then use some common sense in helping him to get a safe level of
      heat. This transdermal application should remain in place for a
      minimum of 30 minutes, and doing this ritual daily would benefit
      most patients. It is also recommend that the area underneath the
      patient be covered in plastic too, because some of the castor oil
      will run down onto furniture or floors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Things to Avoid</b><br>
      <br>
      Many substances aggravate the disease while simultaneously
      weakening the immune system for a double whammy. Victims of
      hepatitis should avoid them. This list is quite restrictive, but
      the restrictions do not need to be permanent. They would be very
      beneficial in fighting against a flare-up of the disease, or when
      attempting to cure it. Items to avoid include the over-the-counter
      "remedies", because none of them actually remedy anything.
      Discontinue all of them. If at all possible, discontinue all
      pharmaceuticals too. All pharmaceuticals, as foreign substances,
      stress the kidneys, spleen, and liver.<br>

      </b><b>...My Search for a Cure</b><br>
      <br>
      For years I seemed to get every little flu bug in the air, so I
      thought, but all along it had been flare ups from HCV. Realizing
      this lead me to alternative medicine and my ultimate holistic
      approach to a cure. Mom’s chicken soup and extra vitamin C when we
      get the flu helps, so why couldn’t this in theory help my liver? I
      started reading everything I could about the liver and what kinds
      of supplements could detoxify it. I learned the liver can repair
      itself if taken care of. So it made sense to me that nutrition and
      diet play a big role in keeping the liver healthy.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Encyclopedia of Natural medicines:<br>
      <br>
      A natural diet, low in natural and synthetically saturated fat,
      simple carbohydrates (sugar, white flour, fruit juice, honey,
      et...), oxidized fatty acids (fried oils) and animal fat, and high
      in fiber is recommended for a healthy liver and body.<br>
      <br>
      Natural substances to help your liver detoxify are as close as
      your kitchen cupboard. Eating foods rich in lecithin (soybean),
      essential fatty acids (salmon, flax oil) and green leafy
      vegetables rich in fiber and antioxidants like vitamins C and E,
      are all gourmet cuisine for your liver. Lowering your intake of
      saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and animal protein and
      avoiding excessive amounts of alcohol are other recommendations
      that are good both for your liver and overall body health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dandelion root and artichoke</b> are both excellent spring
      dietary condiments that are very helpful in improving liver bile
      flow. In addition to these good choices, supplements like <b>L-methionine</b>
      are an excellent choice for a congested liver.<b> Glutathione
        peroxidase</b> is one of the body major detoxification enzymes
      and is in part defended by methione during a toxic challenge to
      the liver...<br>
      <br>
      The article goes on to describe the function of <b>Milk Thistle</b>.
      It concludes that the most potent substances for protecting the
      liver are Milk Thistle, Dandelion and L-methionine. L-methionine
      is classed as a " supplement," and Milk Thistle and Dandelion as "
      botanical medicines." - "Protecting and Enhancing Liver
      Functions," by Ronald G Reichert, ND, Alive: Canadian Journal of
      Health and Nutrition #161, March 1996): pp. 14-16<br>
      <br>
      I began my program with a low fat diet that helped me loose fifty
      pounds. This inspired me to publish my first book, “The Body Shop
      Cookbook” that has over 350 low fat recipes and lots of great
      nutritional information. I also started a nutritional supplement
      program that included vitamin C, Vitamin B complex, Vitamin B12,
      and Folic Acid. I also take two products by Nature's Sunshine
      called LIV-A and LIV-Guard. LIV-A is a combination of herbs which
      include <b>Red Beet, Dandelion, Parsley, Horsetail, Liverwort,
        Black Cohosh, Birch, Blessed Thistle, Angelica, Chamomile,
        Gentian and Golden Rod </b>with an herbal source of <b>calcium,


        iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, silicon, sodium,
        riboflavin and Vitamin A</b>. All these herbs nourish the liver.
      LIV-Guard with milk thistle provides nutrients that must be
      present for the liver to perform its 500 or more functions. Each
      tablet contains: V<b>itamin A (as beta-carotene), Vitamin C, Iron
        (ferrous gluconate) and mixed in a base of milk thistle extract,
        dandelion root, choline bitartrate, and inositol.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are several other hepatic herbs available such as <b>Balmony,


        Barberry, Black Root, Blue Flag, Boldo, Fringetree Bark, Golden
        Seal, Vervain, Wahoo, Wild Yam and Yellow Dock</b>. All of these
      hepatic herbs help strengthen, tone and stimulate the secretionary
      function of the liver.<br>
      <br>
      After six months of taking these products my liver enzymes began
      to drop and I started feeling much better. The color in my skin
      began to come back and I did not have that sick look anymore. My
      doctor was pleased with the results but to this day is skeptical
      about what the supplements were doing for me. She also reminded me
      that even though my liver enzymes were going down - I still had
      HCV.<br>
      <br>
      I did not intend to give up my search for a cure because I truly
      believed that these herbs and vitamins would cure my HCV. Then I
      found a wonderful book called "Sharks Don't Get Cancer" by I.
      William Lane, PhD. He states, "Having survived virtually unchanged
      for four hundred million years, the shark is certainly one of the
      most remarkable creatures on the face of our planet. The shark
      appears to be the only animal with a natural immunity to cancer
      and practically every disease known to man. Researchers worldwide
      are investigating the shark's natural resistance to disease. There
      has been an explosion of medical research on shark cartilage's
      amazing ability."<br>
      <br>
      This book made me wonder, if shark cartilage has been killing some
      types of cancers and certain viruses, could it kill Hepatitis C?
      It is a virus. So, I added 1500 mg. of <b>shark cartilage</b> to
      my program and in six months my liver enzymes were even lower.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I found <b>MSM (methyl-sulfanyl methane)</b>. MSM is not
      a medicine, drug or a food additive. It is a mineral found in all
      foods, milk, fruits, meats and vegetables. MSM is a natural form
      of organic sulfur found in all living organisms. MSM is the 3rd
      largest ingredient found in your body. Your body is made up of
      water, salt and MSM. Unfortunately, MSM quickly disappears from
      foods when processed, cooked and/or stored. As soon you pick
      fruits or vegetables from the tree or vine, they begin rapidly
      losing MSM.<br>
      <br>
      Remember what Ronald G. Reichert said in his article, Protecting
      and Enhancing Liver Functions, "In addition to these good choices,
      supplements like L-methionine are an excellent choice for a
      congested liver". MSM is the transport molecule for elemental
      sulfur that is required for proper assimilation of the amino
      acids, methionine and cysteine. In addition, the peptize hormone,
      insulin, requires sulfur in its molecular structure, and numerous
      other proteins, catalysts, and enzymes incorporate sulfur into
      their molecular framework. The body uses MSM to create new, good
      healthy cells. Vitamins and amino acids work with MSM during this
      process. Without proper levels of MSM, our bodies are unable to
      build good healthy cells, and this leads to illness. Our bodies
      are producing new cells 24 hours per day and completely renews
      itself every eleven months. If our body does not receive the
      proper nutrition and building materials it needs, it will produce
      unhealthy, dysfunctional cells, deficient of the basic ingredients
      that constitute a healthy cell.<br>
      <br>
      Knowing that the liver can repair itself and that MSM creates new,
      healthy cells; I reasoned that MSM would help the liver in its
      healing process. For this reason, I added MSM to my program.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, when I stopped my interferon treatment in February
      1996, my liver enzymes were; ALT - 41, AST - 52 and Gamma GT - 87.
      On December 18th, 1998, my liver enzymes were; ALT - 22 (normal 0
      - 28); AST - 25 (normal 0 - 31) and Gamma GT - 31 (normal 0 - 35).
      For the first time in 16 years, I AM NORMAL!! The doctor was
      thrilled and told me to keep doing what I am doing because it is
      saving my life. I am still not sure that she believes that the
      vitamins and herbs are the reason but I think she must be
      wondering.<br>
      <br>
      In one year I will be re-tested to see if I have killed this
      horrible virus for good. I truly believe I have already. I have
      not felt this good since the day I contacted HCV… <br>
