        <p><b><font size="+1">The Pacheco Generator Story</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This article was first published in <i>The Messenger</i> (June
        1989). The Pacheco Story was subsequently presented to the
        United Nations Environmental Forum in a speech given by the
        author Karin Westdyk. Later that year, Francisco was invited to
        demonstrate his generator at the Green Energy Conference in
        Canada, and in 1990 he was invited to participate in the
        International Hydrogen Energy Conference in Hawaii where his
        invention was the only prototype producing hydrogen fuel on
        demand. A chapter was devoted to the Pacheco Generator in <i>Suppressed



          Energy Inventions</i>, published by the Aukland Institute of
        Technology in 1994, and his story is included in <i>The Coming
          Energy Revolution</i>, by Jeane Manning (1996). <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Fifty years ago in his native Bolivia, Francisco Pacheco became
        interested in electrical phenomena and especially in primary
        batteries. While in his early twenties he had heard a story
        about a Bolivian priest who had invented a battery that would
        give 3 volts instead of the normal 1.5 volts. The battery was
        called the Pila Bolivia but when Francisco tried to track it
        down and the priest, he was told that the priest had gone to
        Germany and neither he nor the battery was ever heard from
        again. </p>
      <p>In the mountains of Bolivia, there are many minerals (tin,
        titanium, etc) most of which are mined and exported. It was
        believed that the priest used one of the rivers near a mine
        where the minerals were washed by women workers. But no one
        seemed to know which stream, from which mine, or which minerals
        created the electrolyte water that was used to make the Pila
        Bolivia. </p>
      <p>Francisco`s dream was to reproduce the ?super battery? and he
        experimented with many metals until he finally came close to 2
        volts from the battery. One evening, while working alone in his
        laboratory with his array of glass jars and electrodes, he
        noticed bubbles of gas forming. Because pressure was building in
        one of the glass vessels, he vented the jar. But, it wasn´t
        until he lit a cigarette that he knew that the bubbles that were
        emerging from the water were filled with hydrogen gas. There was
        an explosion which dented the ceiling. After that, Francisco
        dropped his battery experiments and concentrated on improving
        the efficiency of the process he had discovered; that of
        extracting the hydrogen from salt water to use as fuel on
        demand. His first experiment involved a small unit which
        produced enough fuel to boil water. From there, he took his
        hydrogen fuel generator and used it to run a motorcycle. </p>
      <p>In 1942, U.S. Vice President, Henry Wallace, while on a Good
        Will Tour of South America, saw the Pacheco generator run an
        automobile engine and shortly thereafter, the president of
        Bolivia, General Enrique Penaranda, observed the same phenomena.
        Both men encouraged Francisco to bring his invention to the
        United States. </p>
      <p>In 1943, Francisco arrived in the U.S. with a letter addressed
        to the Chief Military Intelligence Service of the United States
        War Department from Colonel Clarence Barnett, the military
        attache to the American Embassy, introducing Francisco and
        requesting an audience to see his invention. At that time, it
        was believed that the hydrogen generator might be helpful to the
        U.S. war efforts. In April of that year, Mr. Pacheco
        successfully demonstrated his generator to the Bureau of
        Standards in Washington DC and applied for a U.S. patent. But,
        because there was a war going on, all U.S. patents had to be
        sealed for one year. After the year was up, Pacheco received a
        letter from the patent office stating that because of the high
        cost of aluminum and magnesium (the two metals used in his
        invention) that his patent was impractical. His patent attorney,
        after several letters to the patent office, also advised him to
        ?shelve? his patent until a later date, as petroleum was still
        believed plentiful and cheap. </p>
      <p>Pacheco took his lawyers advice and set aside his dream of
        giving his adopted country the technology that would provide an
        inexhaustible supply of fuel and would burn clean. He went home
        to Bolivia but shortly thereafter returned to the United States
        with his wife and infant daughter knowing that one day, the time
        would be right for his invention. Fancisco worked in defense
        plants during the war and later, until retirement , as an oil
        burner service mechanic in New York City. In1967, he moved his
        family to Upper Greenwood Lake, New Jersey. In his basement
        laboratory, he continued to perfect his invention. </p>
      <p>In the 1970 ´s, when air pollution and oil shortage became a
        problem, Francisco "unshelved" his generator believing that the
        time was finally right. He secured a U.S. patent and a few years
        later, he received patents from Germany, Brazil and Japan. In
        February of 1974, with the hopes of acquiring government backing
        and support, Pacheco demonstrated his pollution free hydrogen
        fuel cell to Congressman Robert Roe. With no outside power
        source, the self taught chemical engineer connected the fuel
        cell to a Homelite alternator unit with a 3 horse power 1000
        watt generator with a 4 stroke engine. The demonstration was
        successful. Mr. Roe seemed impressed and said that he would
        bring it to the attention of Washington officials. Upon leaving,
        Mr. Pacheco invited the congressman to another demonstration he
        had planned later that year at Point Pleasant, New
        Jersey.Congressman Roe was invited to take part in a history
        making voyage; the first power boat ride fueled by seawater?.
        Many newspapers were invited as well. </p>
      <p>Congressman Roe did not show up and neither did many
        newspapers. Mr. Pacheco never heard from the Congressman again
        about his invention or the promise to bring it to the attention
        of appropriate Washington officials, but his voyage was a
        success. History was made on July 17th, 1974 when a 26 foot
        power boat ran for nine hours using the Pacheco generator and
        seawater for fuel, putting back into the oceans its waste, only
        clean water. </p>
      <p>To good to be true?? Jules Verne, in his futuristic tale, <i>Twenty-thousands
Leagues




          Under The Sea</i>, fueled the famous Nautilus with hydrogen
        fuel. Today, it is the fuel that sends rockets into space. The
        source for hydrogen fuel is virtually inexhaustible and it burns
        clean. It is a perfect energy source which puts back into the
        environment something that is necessary to life and becoming
        scarce? clean water. </p>
      <p>In an effort to overcome the skepticism he was facing and the
        PhD he could not add to his name, Francisco had his invention
        analyzed by independent experts. The Pacheco generator passed
        all tests at the New Jersey Gollob Analytical Service
        Corporation Labs in September of 1973, and in 1979. Nan Waters,
        a consulting chemist with the Aesop Institute analyzed the
        generator and wrote the following report. </p>
      <p>I have read the literature relating to Pacheco´s hydrogen
        generator. In my opinion, there is no reason why it ought not
        work as described. Basically, he has combined in one device
        three very simple chemical principles; a) The use of active
        metals to produce hydrogen from water, b) The differing
        electrical potential of two metals to produce an electrical
        current, c) The use of electrical current to produce hydrogen
        from water by electrolysis. All the ideas are well known; they
        simply havn´t been put together this way before. It is so simple
        as to be elegant. </p>
      <p>When Francisco tried to interest the automobile industry in his
        invention, he was again confronted with skepticism or ignored.
        He contacted energy companies and one such company, Consolidated
        Edison, sent a research chemist to see the generator in action.
        The chemist was enthusiastic about the invention but when he
        took it back to his company, he told Mr. Pacheco later, his
        company had no interest. He sent details of his invention to all
        the major oil companies. The response was either cool or
        nonexistent. One oil company returned all papers to him in an
        unmarked envelope and then after a two hour meeting with him, a
        representative told him, ?We are in the oil business. Your
        invention, if we were to develop it, would be against our
        interests.? </p>
      <p>Because he was getting nowhere with government and industry, in
        an effort to bring the generator to the attention of the public,
        Francisco contacted Geraldo Rivera, who he had meet after his
        power boat demonstration. Mr. Rivera was excited about the
        invention and promised to help, but apparently the TV station
        nixed the idea of doing a show. </p>
      <p>In 1977, Mr. Pacheco adapted his generator to provide a
        complete energy system for his neighbor´s new home. A
        demonstration of the home generator was witnessed by the New
        Jersey Commissioner of Energy and staff, but again nothing
        happened. </p>
      <p>In 1979, for 5 consecutive days, the generator was demonstrated
        for the public generating on demand hydrogen, electric and
        thermal energy as its output at the International Inventors
        Exposition. He received at this time, a plaque and award
        presented by a Commissioner of the Patent Department. At the
        Massachusetts headquarters of the Inventor´s Club of America, he
        received 2 consecutive Hall of Fame Awards for 1978 and 1979. </p>
      <p>In 1980 the CBS program 60 Minutes contacted Francisco and told
        him they wanted to do an entire show on his invention. At last
        he believed on demand hydrogen would be recognized as a viable
        alternative energy source. Relieved and happy, he prepared for
        the show. </p>
      <p>A 60 Minutes crew arrived to film his demonstration which took
        place in a friends barn. The demonstration included showing a
        hydrogen fueled burner, running an electric motor, blowing up a
        balloon with the gas, cutting a number 2 from a ¾" thick steel
        plate with a torch using the hydrogen and running a 3hp
        lawnmower engine. All demonstrations worked perfectly except for
        the lawnmower engine. Because he was going to be on national TV,
        Francisco went out and bought a new lawnmower for the
        presentation and did not have time to test it. Unfortunately,
        the engine choked due to the excessive amount of fuel being
        produced. The 60 Minutes crew reassured Francisco and told him
        not to worry. They said they had enough footage of the
        successful demonstrations to complete a program. </p>
      <p>When the show was aired, however, it had quite a different
        focus. The only part of the demonstration that was shown was the
        failure of the lawnmower to work and was used to point out an
        example of an independent inventors non-working invention.
        Although Francisco was advised to sue the program for
        misrepresenting his work, he discovered that the cost to do so
        would be more than he could bear having already mortgaged his
        home to put the needed dollars into prototypes and demonstration
        models. </p>
      <p>At first devastated by this betrayal, his belief system that
        motivated his research for 50 years, despite the obstacles and
        frustrations experienced along the way, kept him focused. In
        1986, he wrote to the Department of Energy about his generator.
        He received a form letter in response from an "Information
        Specialist" which included brief information describing the
        virtues and drawbacks of hydrogen as fuel. </p>
      <p>Although the DoE will not deny the advantages of this fuel,
        comparatively little research or dollars have been spent on
        developing hydrogen as a viable source for generating energy.
        Our huge dollar commitment to the nuclear industry and to the
        fossil fuel cartels, who are also heavily involved in nuclear
        processes, have blinded them to all practical alternatives. The
        powers that be, seem to wish to remain and will do so until
        people demand they move over and make way for some real
        solutions. </p>
      <p>Francisco wrote back to the DoE, addressing each of their
        points with technical data on his system, showing them that the
        system he developed would overcome the obstacles they described.
        His detailed response was ignored. </p>
      <p>For 46 years, Francisco tried to give his technology to
        America, his adopted country. He believed there were solutions
        to the serious environmental and health problems caused by the
        use of fossil and nuclear fuels. The evidence as to the negative
        effects of these energy choices is strong and growing stronger.
        Our concerns about the destruction of the ozone layer, acid
        rain, the greenhouse effect, air and water pollution, and oil
        spills that destroy marine life, and the nightmares created by
        our pursuit of an incomplete nuclear technology are now costing
        the public a great deal more than dollars. Perhaps, since it is
        ?we? the public who ultimately pay, it is time ?we? begin to pay
        closer attention and stop looking to a government, which has
        been part of the problem, for the solutions we need to find. </p>
      <p>It has been a long time since Francisco Pacheco first came to
        the United States. After a lifetime of efforts to gain
        recognition for his work, which he offers to America as a
        tribute to liberty and as an instrument of peace, he remains
        firm in his convictions. He humbly but strongly believes in the
        words of an old wise man who once told him, ?SON, God put on
        your shoulders something very big. Do not ask yourself, why me?
        Think why not me.? </p>
      <p>Francisco died in 1992. His grandson Edmundo holds the patent
        rights to the Pacheco Generator. His wife and daughter returned
        to Bolivia where Francisco's ashes were spread throughout the
        mountains of his beloved homeland and the source of his
        inspiration. </p>

      <p>An autoelectrolytic hydrogen generator system constituted by
        one or a plurality of similar cells wherein a galvanic
        arrangement of magnesium and aluminum plates of sacrificial
        elements as anode; stainless steel as cathode and sea water as
        electrolyte, by its very nature is made to develop a voltage
        when connected in short circuit causing a current to flow within
        the system and hydrogen production of hydrogen in situ and on
        demand by the electrolytic action at one pole, the cathode, and
        additional hydrogen by the electrochemical reaction at the other
        pole, the anode. Surplus electric energy of the system applied
        to a optional electrolyzer will also be made to produce
        additional hydrogen at its two sacrificial aluminum electrodes.

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates in general to the production of
        electrolytic hydrogen from a suitable electrolyte: sea water,
        tap water sodium chloride solution or brine, particularly as a
        prime object to a technique that evolves hydrogen 99.98% pure at
        both electrodes of an electrolysis cell in which the arrangement
        and function of such electrodes are integrant parts of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>In the electrolysis of brine or sea water, chlorine is produced
        at the anode, hydrogen together with sodium hydroxides at the
        cathode, i.e. "Dow cell". </p>
      <p>Increasingly large amounts of hydrogen are used in industrial
        processes and actually as propeller fuel for space vehicles and
        in recent years is being recognized as the ideal one for
        automotive and other engines as well as utility fuel, inasmuch
        as its combustion with oxygen produces pure steam instead of
        pollutants, and with air minimal controllable emission of
        nitrogen oxides. While the proposed use of hydrogen for the
        above purposes is subject of many technical papers, actually,
        besides the NASA program there is not widespread commercial use
        of the concept, experimental work in projects to power
        automobiles fueled by hydrogen were and are actually performed
        in this Country, Europe and Japan, while every one demonstrated
        the excellence of the gas as energy carrier and its superior
        performance, in all cases hydrogen was and is supplied by the
        following methods: </p>
      <p>1--PRESSURIZED </p>
      <p>2--LIQUEFIED </p>
      <p>3--STORED IN METALLIC HYDRIDES </p>
      <p>The major factor that actually precludes the use of the gas
        hydrogen as automobile fuel or for that matter as utility fuel
        is that beside the problems of storage an delivery, the cost of
        production with the known techniques in amounts equivalent in
        terms of BTU's of energy, exceeds greatly the cost of
        conventional fossil fuels, even considering the fact that weight
        by weight, hydrogen is three times more powerful than gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>The invention's disclosure will lead to the evidence that the
        cost of hydrogen will be appreciably reduced inasmuch as it is
        evolved at both electrodes, cathode and anode of the generator.
        The invention represents the solution of storage and delivery
        problems since the gas is produced in situ and on demand as
        described further, also represents a radical departure from the
        conventional electrolysis of sea water or brine and its results.
      </p>
      <p>The electrolysis cell described in drawing (1) consists of:
        1--CATHODE, the stainless steel lining of the plastic vessel and
        its permanently connected twin stainless steel plates between
        the anode banks. 2--ANODE BANKS, consisting of an arrangement of
        magnesium plates (key element of the system), permeable
        separators and aluminum plates. 4--The sea water as the
        electrolyte. </p>
      <p>By its nature the cell as described above, is also a galvanic
        arrangement of elements that makes of it a source of electricity
        with a nominal 1.5 volts as difference of potential in open
        circuit at its plus and minus terminals and a negligible
        chemical reaction between magnesium and the electrolyte. </p>
      <p>Referring to a single cell; when a variable load closes the
        circuit, an electric current flows trough the system, current
        that is inversely related to the load resistance and directly to
        the surface of the electrodes. The electric energy causes the
        magnesium anode to produce chlorine, the chemical reaction of
        the magnesium with the electrolyte produces hydrogen that is
        liberated at this electrode (anode). Hydrogen and sodium
        hydroxides are produced by electrolysis at the stainless steel
        cathode, the hydrogen is liberated at this electrode (cathode);
        the aluminum component of the anode slowly at first, reacts also
        chemically with the sodium hydroxides produced, and the
        resultant hydrogen increases the total output. It is not well
        understood, other than by speculative theory (time element?),
        the action of the permeable separator between the metals
        magnesium and aluminum, however and being incontrovertible the
        fact that it causes to be produced an excess of hydrogen above
        the predictable quantities produced by electrochemical
        reactions, this fact is disclosed and incorporated as principal
        and very important part of the invention. </p>
      <p>The system produces analytically tested, hydrogen of 99.98
        percent purity being evolved at the two electrodes with no
        traces detected of chlorine. Also as byproducts the cell
        produces magnesium and aluminum hydroxides that when recuperated
        from the system, represent the stock material industrially
        obtained from sea water and bauxite as first step in the
        industrial production of the mentioned elements, magnesium and
        aluminum. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In view of the foregoing it is the main object of this
        invention to provide an autoelectrolytic hydrogen generator
        making use of 30% of the total electric energy employed to
        industrially produce the elements magnesium and aluminum from
        sea water and bauxite, the invention makes use of such elements
        as an ideal and fully charged electric storage system. </p>
      <p>More particularly it is an object of this invention to provide
        a hydrogen generator of the above identified type wherein the
        electric energy obtained by the arrangement of magnesium and
        aluminum as sacrificial metals is exploited to evolve
        electrolytic hydrogen at one electrode and electrochemical
        reactions to produce also hydrogen at the other electrode. </p>
      <p>Also an object of the invention is to provide a system
        eliminating the problem of hydrogen storage inasmuch as the so
        far disclosed arrangement of the metals will produce hydrogen
        directly from sea water, its natural storage as electrolyte,
        only on demand and in situ thus effectively eliminating
        consequent expenses and hazards that are related to hydrogen
        stored under pressure or in liquid form. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide a system in
        which the voltage generated in one or more cells wherein
        hydrogen is being produced electrochemically also serves to
        effect electrolysis in these cells and in a optional
        electrolyzer to increase the total volume of hydrogen output. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, these objects are attained in one basic
        embodiment of the invention wherein a voltaic sell constituted
        by magnesium-aluminum sacrificial anode, a stainless steel
        cathode and sea water as electrolyte is provided with an
        external flow loop and a pump powered by the cell surplus
        electric energy to: 1--circulate the electrolyte. 2--filter the
        same to separate it from the metal hydroxides. 3--to utilize the
        thermal output of the system in an independent heath exchange
        coil. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the invention, to a plurality system
        of said basic cells an optional, conventional electrolyzer is
        attached at, wherein the surplus electric energy of the system
        is applied and additional electrolytic hydrogen produced also at
        both electrodes made of aluminum. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>First embodiment</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a basic hydrogen
        generating cell in accordance with the invention in which sea
        water as electrolyte is contained in a tank 10 fabricated of a
        high strength non-reactive plastic material, the internally
        stainless steel tank lining 11 and the permanently connected
        twin plates 12 of the same metal constitutes the cathode. The
        cover 13 of the tank 10 includes a gas outlet 14 and the
        terminals 15A, 15B (-) and 16 (+). </p>
      <p>Immersed in the electrolyte and supported within the tank 10
        are the plates of magnesium 17 and aluminum 18 together with the
        separator 19, an arrangement that constitutes the anode.
        External terminals of magnesium and aluminum to be connected
        when operating the cell. Since the cell generates the electric
        energy for the electrolysis, the cell operates as an
        auto-electrolysis device requiring no external energy source. </p>
      <p><b>Second embodiment</b> </p>
      <p>The arrangement in FIG. 2, shows a group of hydrogen generator
        cells 1, 2, 3, and 4. identical in every detail as described in
        the first embodiment that are located within a plastic tank 20
        with three partitions 21, 22, and 23 and provided with
        electrolyte circulating ports such as 21A and 21B. </p>
      <p>In closing the circuit onto itself, the cells 1, 2, 3, and 4,
        connected in series, will develop about four times the voltage
        of a single cell. </p>
      <p>An external flow loop 24 may be coupled to the tank 21
        including a strainer 25 and a pump 26 that powered by the
        voltage derived from the system will separate the insoluble
        hydroxides from the electrolyte. </p>
      <p>As disclosed, the four cells electric energy output may be
        utilized to operate as an integrant part of this embodiment an
        optional electrolyzer cell 27 that will evolve additional
        hydrogen also at both electrodes 28 and 29, being these
        electrodes made of aluminum. A manifold 30 is provided to
        discharge the total volume of hydrogen produced by the system. </p>
      <p>While there has been shown preferred embodiments of the
        invention, it will be appreciated that many modifications and
        changes may be made without, however, departing from the
        essential spirit of the invention. For example, utilizing the
        electric energy developed by the system, the nature of the
        electrolyte and elements of the electrodes 28 and 29, of the
        electrolyzer cell 27. proper and known changes can be achieved.
