      <div align="center"><big><b>Ancient People Achieved Remarkably
            Clean Teeth With Noxious Weed?</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The purple nutsedge is one of the world's worst weeds, spreading
      stealthily underground and shrugging off herbicides as if they
      were soda water. But new research shows that for one ancient
      people, this noxious plant may have served as a tooth cleaner.<br>
      <br>
      A new analysis of skeletons reveals that people who lived in Sudan
      2,000 years ago were eating the purple nutsedge. Those people had
      surprisingly sound teeth — and the antibacterial properties of the
      weed may deserve the credit, scientists say in a study published
      in the journal PLOS ONE on Wednesday.<br>
      <br>
      Early humans generally had relatively few cavities, thanks in part
      to meals that were heavy on the meat, light on the carbs.<br>
      <br>
      Then humans invented farming and began eating more grain. Bacteria
      in the human mouth flourished, pouring out acids that eat away at
      the teeth. The first farmers tended to have much more tooth decay
      than hunter-gatherers did.<br>
      <br>
      But when scientists looked at the teeth of people buried roughly
      2,000 years ago in an ancient cemetery called Al Khiday 2, they
      found that fewer than one percent of the teeth had cavities,
      abscesses, or other signs of tooth decay, though those people were
      probably farmers, says study co-author Donatella Usai of Italy's
      Center for Sudanese and Sub-Saharan Studies.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of hardened bits of plaque on the teeth showed those
      interred at the cemetery had ingested the tubers of the purple
      nutsedge, perhaps as food, perhaps as medicine. People buried at
      Al Khiday at least 8,700 years ago — before the rise of farming
      there — also consumed the tubers, probably as food.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments by other researchers show that extracts of the weed
      impede the growth of the bacteria most widely implicated in tooth
      decay. So the weed could have served as both a nutritious dinner
      and a primitive, if unintentional, antibacterial potion, the
      scientists say, though they caution that they haven't proved a
      link.<br>
      <br>
      Such a function is certainly possible, says biological
      anthropologist Sarah Lacy of the University of Missouri-St. Louis,
      who is not associated with the new study. No other example has
      been reported of a specific plant that kept tooth decay in check
      among ancient people, says Lacy, who calls the results "very
      exciting."<br>
      <br>
      The purple nutsedge tuber may have many virtues, but a nice flavor
      isn't one of them. People might have tried to tame the tubers'
      bitterness by cooking them, says study co-author Karen Hardy of
      the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies at the
      Autonomous University of Barcelona, or they may have just
      tolerated the bad taste.<br>
      <br>
      "They might have been using it for some medicinal purpose," Hardy
      says. "Medicine always tastes horrible, so it would be par for the
      course."<br>

          into Food Items, Cooking and Plant Processing in Prehistoric
          Central Sudan</b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accessing information on plant consumption before the adoption of
      agriculture is challenging. However, there is growing evidence for
      use of locally available wild plants from an increasing number of
      pre-agrarian sites, suggesting broad ecological knowledge. The
      extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental
      calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new
      perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical
      results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present
      a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of
      Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural
      and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is
      a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and
      aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the
      world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus
      mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of
      caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence
      extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry
      (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant
      possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of
      raw material preparation through chewing. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The identification of chemical compounds and identifiable
      microfossils from dental calculus extracted from archaeological
      skeletons is providing new insights into dietary composition and
      biographical detail. These new insights are proving to be useful
      in accessing evidence for ingested plants, particularly in
      pre-agrarian periods for which evidence of plant use is rare.
      Stable isotope analysis has been used extensively to investigate
      pre-agrarian dietary composition [1] [2]. It provides non-specific
      identification, principally of primary protein sources, but offers
      little information on dietary plant sources. Carbon isotope
      analyses differentiate between C3 and C4 plants, but provide
      little insight into what the actual plants were. The extraction of
      chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus offers an
      entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction. Because of its
      location within the mouth, dental calculus offers a direct link to
      material that was inhaled or ingested and its value as a source of
      biographical information for past human populations has recently
      become evident in terms of microfossils [3] [4] [5] [6], chemical
      compounds [7], and as a source of bacterial DNA [8]. Here we offer
      the results of a combined analytical and morphological analysis of
      the material extracted from samples of dental calculus from the
      multi period site of Al Khiday, Sudan. This has enabled us to
      identify specific food items, inhaled micro-environmental data and
      the use of teeth for processing plant-based raw materials. The
      material from Al Khiday is of particular interest as it is a
      multi-period cemetery. This permits a long-term perspective on the
      material recovered. Indeed, one of the original aims of this study
      was to evaluate the limits of survival of both chemical compounds
      and microfossils given the extreme climate of the Sahara; however,
      no difference in survival or degradation of materials was
      encountered through the sequence.<br>
      <br>
      Dental calculus occurs when plaque biofilms accumulate and
      mineralize. It is associated with chronically poor oral hygiene
      and is common on archaeological skeletons of all periods. Dental
      calculus is found around the teeth in the supragingival and
      subgingival areas and is linked to high levels of carbohydrate
      consumption due to the sugars that are eventually converted into
      glucose. Subgingival calculus, which has been identified on
      material several million years old [9], occurs below the gum-line
      in the gingival crevice. Subgingival calculus is particularly
      useful for analysis as it can accumulate and endure indefinitely
      if it is not mechanically removed [10]. Microbial communities in
      subgingival calculus are proteolytic rather than sacchrolytic. The
      metabolic by-products of proteolytic metabolism, such as ammonia,
      result in localized raised pH. This in turn encourages plaque
      mineralization as precipitation of calcium phosphate is favoured.<br>
      <br>
      Al Khiday is a complex of five archaeological sites which lie 25
      kilometres south of Omdurman, on the White Nile, in Central Sudan.
      Al Khiday 2 is predominantly a burial ground of pre-Mesolithic,
      Neolithic and Late Meroitic age though it was also used as an
      occupation site during the Mesolithic period (Figure 1) [11]. The
      Mesolithic phase is represented by 104 pits which include
      fireplaces and disposal areas containing Mesolithic material.
      Although the pre-Mesolithic human remains cannot be directly dated
      due to insufficient collagen and bio-apatite which have been
      replaced by environmental carbonatic formations, their graves are
      cut by the creation of these pits during the Mesolithic which
      provide a Terminus ante quem of 6700 cal. BC [11]. The Neolithic
      and Meroitic skeletons were dated using charcoal and shells found
      in the graves [11]. The period covered by these samples stretches
      from the pre-agricultural fisher-hunter-gatherer based economy
      through the early Neolithic with its incipient agriculture, and on
      to the fully developed agricultural context of the Meroitic...<br>
      <br>
      The chemical evidence for C. rotundus is most clearly demonstrated
      in the Meroitic burial 74 (Figure 3) with the identification of a
      number of characteristic mono- and sesquiterpenoids, including
      norrotundene and rotundene (Figure 3b) (Information S1. Methods
      and TD/Py-GC-MS detailed results, Table 2), which were present in
      minor abundance, these same terpenoids having been previously
      identified in minor to moderate abundance in the essential oil of
      the C. rotundus rhizome/tuber [23] [24] (Information S1. Methods
      and TD/Py-GC-MS detailed results). These minor C. rotundus
      components were not detected in burials 10-I, 103 due to the
      relatively small amount of organic material present in these
      samples (Figure 3a). Although calamene, calamenene and cadalene,
      identified as significant components in these samples, are known
      to be constituents of the essential oil of fresh C. rotundus
      rhizome/tuber, their potential origin as diagenetic products from
      other more labile sequiterpenoids such as cadinenes must also be
      considered. However, the presence of calarene (ß-gurjunene) in all
      four samples, which would not be a product of diagenesis and is
      known to be present in the essential oil component of C. rotundus
      in minor to moderate abundance [23] [24] (Information S1. Methods
      and TD/Py-GC-MS detailed results), together with the suite of
      monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoids identified in the calculus
      samples and previously observed in the rhizomes/tubers of C.
      rotundus [22] [23] [24] (Information S1. Methods and TD/Py-GC-MS
      detailed results), is indicative of this plant species in these
      samples. It should also be noted that the lack of oxygenated mono-
      and sesquiterpenoids normally present in C. rotundus reflects the
      bio-transformations in the mouth as a result of human oral
      bacteria [7]. Notably, dialkyl branched alkanes were identified in
      samples 35, 10-I, 103 and 74, dominated by the 5,5-diethylalkanes,
      in addition to lesser amounts of 3,3-diethyl-, 3-ethyl-3-methyl,
      5,5-dibutyl-, 5-butyl-5-ethyl- and 6,6-dibutyl-alkanes [24]
      (Figure 3) (Information S1. Methods and TD/Py-GC-MS detailed
      results). These methyl, ethyl and butyl branched alkanes of C15 to
      C23 are indicative of microorganisms [24] [25] (Information S1.
      Methods and TD/Py-GC-MS detailed results). Their association with
      the C. rotundus terpenoids, combined with the information outlined
      above suggests that they most likely derive from a microorganism
      associated with the tubers and rhizomes, or the immediate
      environment in which they grew.<br>
      <br>
      Given the chemical evidence for ingestion of C. rotundus, the
      starch granules were compared to modern C. rotundus L. reference
      material. There is a tentative morphological correlation between
      the modern reference material and the starch granules in the
      pre-Mesolithic samples, though modern examples from the Near East
      appear more rounded and lack fissures emerging from the hilum.
      Identification of the botanical origin of starch granules is
      challenging, however. The general morphology of the type 1
      granules is also reminiscent of starch granules found in certain
      tribes of the Poaceae family, such as Paniceae and Andropogoneae
      [26]. For example some species of the genus Setaria have starch
      granules that are morphologically similar with a fissured hilum,
      often stellate, though slightly smaller. A large number of species
      of these tribes are gathered still today in many regions of Africa
      [27]. It is therefore currently not possible, to provide a secure
      provenance for these starch granules...<br>
      <br>
      Cyperus rotundus is particularly interesting as it is present in
      all periods. C.rotundus or ‘purple nut sedge’ is a C4 plant that
      is profligate in moist tropical environments. It has been called
      the ‘world’s most expensive weed’ [39] due to its ability to
      spread rapidly through its underground storage system of bulbs,
      rhizomes and tubers, whose proliferation may be caused by an
      excess of carbohydrates [40]. C. rotundus was highlighted as a
      potentially key component of the diet of the Late Palaeolithic
      population of Wadi Kubbaniya in southern Egypt (17,000–15,000 BC)
      1000 km north of Al Khiday, where it predominated in the abundant
      assemblages of charred plant remains [41]. However, despite
      identification of several plant species in charred human
      coprolites, C. rotundus was not detected [41].<br>
      <br>
      Chewing, followed by expulsion of pithy quid, is common among
      traditional tuber-eaters such as the Hadza [42] even after these
      have been cooked [43]. C. rotundus tubers can be pithy and
      expelling the quid after chewing may explain why no physical
      evidence for C. rotundus was found in the coprolites at Wadi
      Kubbaniya despite the abundant carbonised remains.<br>
      <br>
      The use of C. rotundus as a carbohydrate staple is documented
      across tropical regions among recent hunter-gatherers and as a
      famine food in some agrarian societies; its nutritional value is
      enhanced by the presence of lysine, an essential amino acid [41].
      C. rotundus has also been considered as part of a package of high
      starch, tuber-rich sedges that may have been exploited by Pliocene
      hominins [44] [45]. Though today it is considered to have a bitter
      taste [41], C. rotundus was one of three tuber staples among
      Aboriginal populations in Central Australia [46]. While the tubers
      can be small and time-consuming to harvest, experimental
      harvesting recovered over 21,000 tubers per m2 in permanently wet
      environments; in drier areas, although the quantity decreased,
      tuber size increased and bitterness was diminished [41]. The
      availability of other, possibly better tasting C3 plants, most
      likely cultivated crops, in the Neolithic and Meroitic periods
      begs the question of why C. rotundus continued to be ingested.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to its value as a source of carbohydrates, C.
      rotundus, has many other qualities that have been widely
      recognised. Numerous accounts of the non-nutritional use of C.
      rotundus from ancient Egypt [47], Mycenean Greece [48] and
      elsewhere exist, including its use for aromatic purposes and in
      water purification [41]. C. rotundus is mentioned by the
      Hippocratic doctors (5th century BC), Theophrastus, Pliny and
      Dioscorides (1st century AD), as a source of perfume and medicine
      [49]. Dioscorides also highlights the use of C. rotundus tubers as
      an ingredient of ancient Egypt's best known perfume, kuphi or
      kyphi, an incense that also had medicinal properties and provides
      a preparation to perfume goose or pork fat made by mixing C.
      rotundus with other vegetable agents [49]. A wide range of
      medicinal uses have been recorded [22] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54]
      [55] and anti-microbial [56] [57], anti-malarial [58],
      anti-oxidant [59] [60] [61] [62] and anti-diabetic [63] compounds
      have been isolated and identified. Tubers are still used today in
      herbal medicine in the Middle East, Far East and India [48], for
      perfume and animal fodder [51] [64] and as incense in Burkina Faso
      [65].<br>
      <br>
      C. rotundus tubers are very likely to have been eaten principally
      for their nutritious qualities during pre-Mesolithic periods;
      however, their continued use in agricultural periods suggests they
      may also have been used for other purposes, instead of, or in
      addition to their value as a nutritional resource. Though the
      ingestion of plants specifically for medicinal purposes is now
      accepted among higher primates [66], demonstrating similar
      behaviour among early human populations is challenging [7] [67].
      However, the non-nutritional qualities of C. rotundus suggest that
      it could have been appreciated for its aromatic or medicinal
      qualities in addition to its potential value as a lean period or
      fall-back food.<br>
      <br>
      The development of dental caries is strongly associated with diet,
      most notably the presence of sugars including fermentable
      carbohydrates which interact with plaque bacteria to cause
      demineralisation; the presence of caries also increases with age
      (68). At the late Palaeolithic site in Taforalt, Morocco [69] a
      link has been made between specific highly starchy cariogenic
      foodstuffs found at this site, the time period of expansion of
      Streptococcus mutans which is a leading contributor of tooth decay
      today, and the unexpectedly high prevalence of caries in teeth, to
      suggest that the food items ingested caused the high caries rate
      found in the population here. Laboratory testing of C. rotundus
      extract has demonstrated that this inhibits S. mutans [70] [71].
      As the type of food ingested can have a direct effect on the
      health of teeth (68), we suggest that chewing C. rotundus tubers
      may have contributed to the unexpectedly low prevalence of dental
      caries in the Meroitic samples at Al Khiday and possibly also
      Gabati...<br>
      <br>
      Biomolecular studies of dental calculus are highly challenging, as
      the organic material entrapped is variable and the quantities are
      often small, yet despite this, the study presented here has not
      only detected and identified a wide range of organic compounds in
      the samples analysed, but has also permitted the identification of
      C. rotundus. These results highlight the potential for future
      biomolecular studies which complement ongoing research focussed on
      the more labile biomolecule of DNA...<br>
      <br>
      The extensive evidence extracted from the dental calculus for the
      ingestion and working of plants, as well as the use of C. rotundus
      tubers as a source of carbohydrates and possibly as medicine or as
      flavouring, fits well within the perspective of broad
      environmental and ecological knowledge in prehistoric periods.
      Today, Cyperus rotundus is used as animal fodder and is considered
      the world's most costly weed as its prolific tubers spread
      underground, but while its tenacity and prolificity is problematic
      for farmers now[39] [40], these qualities made it an abundant and
      accessible resource in the past.<br>
      <br>
      The development of studies on chemical compounds and microfossils
      extracted from dental calculus will help to counterbalance the
      dominant focus on meat and protein that has been a feature of
      pre-agricultural dietary interpretation, up until now The new
      access to plants ingested, which is provided by dental calculus
      analysis, will increase, if not revolutionise, the perception of
      ecological knowledge and use of plants among earlier prehistoric
      and pre-agrarian populations.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present study was aimed to evaluate the wound healing activity
      of extract of tuber parts of Cyperus rotundus . It is a well-known
      plant in Indian traditional medicine. On the basis of traditional
      use and literature references, this plant was selected for
      evaluation of wound healing potential. An alcoholic extract of
      tuber parts of Cyperus rotundus was examined for wound healing
      activity in the form of ointment in three types of wound models on
      rats: the excision, the incision and dead space wound model. The
      extract ointments showed considerable difference in response in
      all the above said wound models as comparable to those of a
      standard drug nitrofurazone ointment (0.2% w/w NFZ) in terms of
      wound contracting ability, wound closure time and tensile
      strength.<br>
      <br>
      Wound may be defined as a loss or breaking of cellular and
      anatomic or functional continuity of living tissue[1]. Wound
      healing is a complex phenomenon involving a number of processes,
      including induction of an acute inflammatory process, regeneration
      of parenchymal inflammatory process[2], migration and
      proliferation of both parenchymal and connective tissue cells,
      synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, remodelling of
      connective tissue and parenchymal components, and acquisition of
      wound strength[3]. All these steps are orchestrated in a
      controlled manner by a variety of cytokines including growth
      factors[4]. Some of these growth factors like platelet-derived
      growth factor B (PDGF), transforming growth factor B (TGF-B),
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      have been identified in self-healing wounds[2]. In chronic wounds,
      the normal healing process is disrupted due to some unknown
      reasons, and in such cases, exogenous application of certain
      growth-promoting agents or compounds which can enhance the in situ
      generation of these growth factors is required to augment the
      healing process. Several factors delay or reduce wound healing,
      including bacterial infection, necrotic tissue, interference with
      blood supply, lymphatic blockage and diabetes mellitus. Generally
      if the above factors could be inhibited/controlled by any agent,
      increasing healing rate could be achieved[5].<br>
      <br>
      Cyperus rotundus Linn. (Family Cyperaceae), commonly known as
      mustaka, is a pestiferous perennial weed with dark green glabrous
      culms, arising from a system of underground tubers found
      throughout India[6],[7]. The tubers are useful as infusion or as a
      soup in fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, dyspepsia, vomiting and
      cholera. Fresh tubers are applied on the breast in the form of
      paste or plaster as galactagogue. Paste is applied to scorpion
      stings and when dried, to spreading ulcers[7]. The acetone and
      ethanol extracts of tubers were found to possess anti-bacterial
      activity[8]. It is one of the plants mentioned in the literature
      having claims of activity against liver disorders[9]. The tubers
      of the plant are used as anthelmintic, antihistaminic, antiemetic,
      antipyretic, hypotensive, smooth-muscle relaxant and emmenagogue
      in uterine complaints[10]. The plant has also been reported to
      have antimalarial, tranquillizing, hepatoprotective against carbon
      tetrachloride induced liver damage, lipolytic action and reduced
      obesity by releasing enhanced concentration of biogenic amines
      from nerve terminals of the brain, which suppressed the appetite
      centre[11]. The plant has also been reported to have antimalarial,
      tranquillizing action as well as hepatoprotective action against
      carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage. It is said to have
      lipolytic action and also property that helps reduce obesity by
      releasing enhanced concentration of biogenic amines from nerve
      terminals of the brain that suppress the appetite centre[11]. It
      is also reported to have anti-inflammatory activity [12].<br>
      <br>
      It contains a wide variety of phytoconstituents that are useful in
      the treatment of different ailments and includes sesquiterpene
      4a-, 5a-, oxidoeudesm-11-en-3a-ol, cyperene-1 (a tricyclic
      sesquiterpene), cyperene-2 (a bicyclic sesquesterpene
      hydrocarbon), cyperenone, and a-cyperone[12], mustakone (a new
      sesquesterpene ketone), ß -selinene, sugetriol triacetate (a new
      sesquesterpenoid), sugenol (sesquesterpenic ketol)[13]; the
      essential oil including copadiene, epoxyguaiene rotundone,
      cyperenol, cyperolone, eugenol, cyperol, isocyperol, a-and ß
      -rotunol, kobusone, isokobusone[12], d-cadinene and calamenone; a
      flavonol glycoside, rhamnetin 3-O-rhamnosyl-(1®4) rhamnopyranoside
      and ß -sitosterol[11]. A survey of literature reveals that no
      systematic approach has been made to study the wound healing
      activity of tubers of this plant. In the present work, we have
      investigated the wound healing activity of the ethanol extract of
      Cyperus rotundus in an ointment form.<br>
      <br>
      Fresh rhizomes of Cyperus rotundus Linn. were collected from
      Namakkal District, Tamilnadu, during the months of May-June 2003.
      The identity of the tubers has been confirmed by using all
      official monographic specifications[14]. Tubers were dried under
      shade, pulverised by a mechanical grinder and passed through a 40
      mesh and then stored in a well-closed container for further use.<br>
      <br>
      The powdered tubers (500 g) were extracted with ethanol (90% w/v)
      for 24 h using a Soxhlet extractor. This ethanol extract was
      concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and controlled
      temperature (50-60o) to yield solid masses that were completely
      free from solvents (12.3%). The different concentrations (0.5, 1
      and 2% w/w) of extract ointment were prepared using simple
      ointment base BP[15].<br>
      <br>
      Male Wistar rats (150-180 g) were selected for the present
      investigation. The animals were maintained at a well-ventilated,
      temperature-controlled (30±1o) animal room for 7 d prior to the
      experimental period. The animals were provided with food and water
      ad libitum. The animals were divided into six groups of six rats
      each as follows: Group I rats were treated with simple ointment
      base (control). Group-II rats were treated with a reference
      standard 0.2% w/w nitrofurazone (NFZ) ointment. Group III, IV and
      V rats were treated with 0.5, 1 and 2% w/w of extract ointments
      respectively. The extract ointments (0.5, 1 and 2% w/w) at a
      quantity of 0.5 g were applied once daily to treat different
      groups of animals. The simple ointment base and 0.2% w/w NFZ
      ointment were applied in the same quantity to serve as control and
      standard respectively. Before performing these experiments,
      ethical clearance was obtained from Institutional Animal Ethics
      Committee (CPCSEA Registration No. 418).<br>
      <br>
      In the excision wound model[16],[17],[18], the full-thickness
      excision wounds were made on the rats by removing a 500 mm2 piece
      of skin from the depilated backs after being anaesthetized with
      anaesthetic ether by the open-mask method. After skin excision,
      the wound was left open to the environment. Male Wistar rats
      (150-180 g) were used in this study and worked-up as above. The
      groups were treated in the same manner as mentioned in the animal
      experimentation. Wound healing potential was monitored by wound
      contraction and wound closure time [Table - 1]. Wound contraction
      was calculated as percentage reduction in wound area [Figure - 1].
      The progressive changes in wound area were monitored
      planimetrically by tracing the wound margin on graph paper on
      wounding day, followed by 6th, 12th and 18th day.<br>
      <br>
      For the incision wound model[19],[20],[21], the animals in each
      group were anaesthetized with anaesthetic ether, and two
      paravertebral long incisions of 6 cm length were made through the
      skin and cutaneous muscles at a distance of about 1.5 cm from the
      midline on each side of the depilated back of the rats. After the
      incision was made, the parted skin was kept together and stitched
      at 0.5 cm intervals continuously and tightly using surgical thread
      (No. 000) and a curved needle (No.11). All the groups were treated
      in the same manner as mentioned in the case of excision wound
      model. Extract ointments, simple ointment base (control), and
      standard drug were applied once daily for 9 d. When the wounds
      were cured thoroughly, the sutures were removed on day 9 and the
      tensile strength of the healed wound was measured on day 10 by
      continuous and constant water flow technique by the method of Lee
      [Table - 1][22],[23].<br>
      <br>
      Physical changes in the granuloma tissue were studied in this
      model. Under light ether anaesthesia, in the rats, subcutaneous
      dead space wounds were inflicted in the region of the axilla and
      groin by making a pouch through a small nick in the skin.[24]
      Granuloma formation was induced by implanting grass piths in those
      regions. Cylindrical grass pith measuring 2.5 cm in length and 0.3
      cm in diameter was introduced into the pouch. The wounds were
      sutured and mopped with alcoholic swabs. Animals were placed into
      their individual cages after recovery from anaesthesia. Excision
      of the granulomas from the surrounding tissues were performed on
      the 10th post-wounding day under light ether anaesthesia.
      Granuloma surrounding the grass piths were excised and slit open.
      The tensile strength of the piece measuring about 15 mm in length
      and 8 mm in width (obtained by trimming the rectangular strip of
      granuloma tissue) was determined on the 10th post-wounding day by
      adopting continuous water flow technique of Lee[22],[23]. The
      buffer extract of the wet granuloma tissue was used for the
      determination of tensile strength[25]. The results are expressed
      as mean±SEM and statistical significance was evaluated zby using
      Student's t test Vs control group. P &lt;0.001 implies
      significance[26].<br>
      <br>
      The effect of extract ointments, NFZ ointment (standard) and
      simple ointment base (control) in the excision wound model and in
      the incision wound model were assessed by measuring the wound area
      and tensile strength respectively. The data including wound area
      (mm 2) and tensile strength of healed wound was furnished in
      [Table - 1]. The present investigation revealed that the test
      extract in varying concentrations in the ointment base were
      capable of producing significant wound healing activity on both
      wound models. The entire test extract ointments used in excision
      wound model showed significant wound healing effect on days 12 and
      18. The results in [Table - 1] indicate that out of the three
      extract ointments used in the experiment, ointment prepared with
      2% w/w of alcoholic extract of Cyperus rotundus has been found to
      have relatively more wound healing activity with 100% of wound
      closure on day 18 as compared to the standard NFZ. A considerable
      difference in response between the two extract ointments (0.5 and
      1% w/w) was noted on wound closure. The percentage wound
      contraction is shown in [Figure - 1]. In the incision wound
      studies, there was a significant increase in tensile strength on
      day 10 due to treatment with either the extract ointments or the
      standard NFZ when compared to control. The effect produced by the
      NFZ ointment (0.2% w/w) application was found to be same as that
      obtained with the application of the extract ointment (2% w/w) [
      Table 1].<br>
      <br>
      The results of dead space wound model are given in [Table - 2].
      The tensile strengths of the granuloma tissues were determined by
      water-flow technique of Lee[22],[23]. Extract ointment (1% w/w and
      2% w/w) were found to enhance the tensile strength as compared to
      the control group ( P &lt;0.001). The relative distribution of
      cells, collagen fibres and vessels in different parts of the
      10-day-old granulation tissue in inner and outer zone of control
      group, 1% and 2% w/w extract ointment is shown in [Figure -
      2][Figure - 3][Figure - 4][Figure - 5], respectively. In this
      wound model, the increase in tensile strength of treated wound may
      be due to increase in collagen concentration/unit area and
      stabilisation of the fibres[27].<br>
      <br>
      This plant is previously reported to possess anti-inflammatory
      activity and used in spreading ulcers. The process of wound
      healing occurs in four phases: (i) coagulation, which prevents
      blood loss, (ii) inflammation and debridement of wound, (iii)
      repair, including cellular proliferation, and (iv) tissue
      remodelling and collagen deposition[28]. Any agent that
      accelerates the above process is a promoter of wound healing, due
      to the presence of active terpenes[29], flavonol
      glycosides[30],[31] and ß -sitosterol in tuber part of Cyperus
      rotundus . This may be effective in reducing tissue swelling, and
      oozing of tissue fluids accompanying inflammation revealed a
      positive healing profile.<br>
      <br>
      The wound healing property of Cyperus rotundus appears to be due
      to the presence of its active principles, which accelerates the
      healing process and confers breaking strength to the healed wound.
      On the basis of the results obtained in the present investigation,
      it is possible to conclude that the ointment of the extract of
      Cyperus rotundus has significant wound healing activity at all the
      doses tested.<br>

      This study evaluates mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of

      methanol extracts from aerial parts of Cyperus rotundus with the
      Salmonella typhimurium assay system.<br>
      <br>
      The different extracts showed no mutagenicity when tested with
      Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1538
      either with or without the S9 mix. On the other hand, our results
      showed that all extracts have antimutagenic activity against
      Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in TA100 and TA98 assay system, and against
      sodium azide in TA100 and TA1535 assay system. TOF, ethyl acetate
      and methanol extracts exhibited the highest inhibition level of
      the Ames response induced by the indirect mutagen AFB1. Whereas,
      ethyl acetate and methanol extracts exhibited the highest level of
      protection towards the direct mutagen, sodium azide, induced
      response. In addition to antimutagenic activity, these extracts
      showed an important free radical scavenging activity towards the
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. TOF, ethyl
      acetate and methanol extracts showed IC50 value of 15, 14 and 20
      µg/ml, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Taken together, our finding showed that C. rotundus exhibits
      significant antioxidant and antimutagenic activities.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The aqueous, ethyl acetate, methanolic and Total Oligomer
      Flavonoids (TOF) enriched extracts, obtained from the aerial parts
      of Cyperus rotundus, were investigated for their contents in
      phenolic compounds. Antioxidative activity using the
      NBT/riboflavin assay system, antimicrobial activity against Gram
      positive and Gram negative bacterial reference strains as well as
      antigenotoxic activity tested with the SOS chromotest assay were
      also studied. Significant antibacterial activity against reference
      strains; Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella
      enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium, was detected in the
      presence of ethyl acetate and TOF enriched extracts. In addition
      to their antimicrobial activity, the same extracts showed a
      significant ability to inhibit nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by
      the superoxide radical in a non enzymatic O2.- generating system,
      and were also able to reduce significantly the genotoxicity
      induced by nifuroxazide and Aflatoxin B1. The antioxidant,
      antimicrobial and antigenotoxic activities exhibited by C.
      rotundus depend on the chemical composition of the tested
      extracts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Research Highlights</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We determined phenolic content of C. rotundus aerial part extract.
      Significant antibacterial activity was detected with ethyl acetate
      and TOF enriched extracts. Same extracts showed a significant
      ability to inhibit superoxide radicals. These extracts were able
      to reduce significantly the genotoxicity induced by genotoxic AFB1
      and NF. We established correlations between tested activities and
      chemical composition.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), using
      both electron impact (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) detection
      modes on apolar and polar stationary phases, led to the
      determination of the volatile composition of the essential oil
      obtained from tubers of Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae). In this
      study, more than 33 compounds were identified and then compared
      with the results obtained in our previous work. Cyperene,
      a-cyperone, isolongifolen-5-one, rotundene, and cyperorotundene
      were the principal compounds comprising 62% of the oil. An in
      vitro cytotoxicity assay with MTT indicated that this oil was very
      effective against L1210 leukaemia cells line. This result
      correlates with significantly increased apoptotic DNA
      fragmentation. The oxidative effects of the essential oil were
      evaluated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
      xanthine/xanthine oxidase assays, and the scavenging of superoxide
      radical assay generated by photo-reduction of riboflavin. The
      antimutagenic activity of essential oil has been examined by
      following the inhibition of H2O2 UV photolysis which induced
      strand-break formation in pBS plasmid DNA scission assay. Based on
      all these results, it is concluded that C. rotundus essential-oil
      composition established by GC/MS analysis, in EI- and CI-MS modes,
      presents a variety of a chemical composition we were not able to
      detect with only GC/MS analysis in our previous work. This
      essential oil exhibited antioxidant, cytotoxic, and apoptotic
      properties.<br>

      extract (CRRE) was evaluveted in a series of in vitro assay
      involving free radicals and reactive oxygen species and IC50
      values were determined. CRRE exhibited its scavenging effect in
      concentration dependent manner on superoxide anion radicals,
      hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and
      property of metal chelating and reducing power. The extract was
      also studied for lipid peroxidation assay by thiobarbituric

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cyperus rotundus (Family Cyperaceae) is used both as a functional
      food and as a drug. In this study, the antioxidative potential of
      a hydroalcoholic extract of C. rotundus (CRE) was evaluated by
      various antioxidant assays, including antioxidant capacity by the
      phosphomolybdenum method, total antioxidant activity in linoleic
      acid emulsion systems, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
      superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging.
      We further evaluated the reducing potential of the extract as well
      as Fe2+/ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver
      homogenate. These various antioxidant activities were compared to
      standard antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene,
      tocopherol, L-ascorbic acid, and catechin. Total phenolic and
      flavonoid content of CRE was also determined by a colorimetric
      method. The extract exhibited high reduction capability and
      powerful free radical scavenging, especially against DPPH and
      superoxide anions as well as a moderate effect on NO. CRE also
      showed inhibited lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate
      induced by Fe2+/ascorbate and prevented deoxyribose degradation in
      both non–site-specific and site-specific assays showing the
      hydroxyl radical scavenging and metal chelating activity of the
      hydroalcoholic extract. Moreover, the peroxidation inhibiting
      activity of CRE was demonstrated in the linoleic acid emulsion
      system. These results clearly established the antioxidative
      potency of C. rotundus, which may account for some of the medical
      claims attributed to this plant.<br>

      <br>
      The in vitro antioxidant activity of the roots and rhizomes of
      Cyperus rotundus L. has been investigated by estimating degree of
      non-enzymatic haemoglobin glycosylation, measured colorimetrically
      at 520 nm. The ethanol extract of the roots and rhizomes of C.
      rotundus showed higher activity, than other extracts of it. The
      antioxidant activity of the extracts are close and identical in
      magnitude, and comparable to that of standard antioxidant
      compounds used...<br>
      <br>
      The roots and rhizomes of C. rotundus L. were collected from
      Panua, in the district of Bankura, West Bengal in the month of
      June, and were authenticated at the Central National Herbarium,
      Botanical Survey of India, Howrah, West Bengal. A voucher specimen
      has been preserved in our laboratory for future reference (DPS 1).
      Shade-dried, powdered, sieved (40 mesh size) plant materials were
      exhaustively extracted successively with petroleum ether (40-60
      C), chloroform, ethanol, and distilled water, using a soxhlet
      extractor. The extracts were concentrated to dryness in vacuum.
      The yield of petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol, and water
      extracts, were 1.5%, 2.4%, 12.3% and 9.2%, respectively. The
      ethanol extract was subjected to silica gel preparative TLC, where
      two compounds were isolated using chloroform : ethanol (9:1) as
      solvent system.<br>

      Purple nutsedge is a perennial weed in the sedge family and
      superficially resembles grass. Nutsedges are among the most
      noxious weeds of agriculture in temperate to tropical zones
      worldwide. They are difficult to control, often form dense
      colonies, and can greatly reduce crop yields. In California,
      nutsedges are particularly problematic in summer-irrigated annual
      and perennial crops. Purple nutsedge is not as widespread in
      California as yellow nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus, and grows in
      the Central Valley, South Coast, and low desert to an altitude of
      about 820 feet (250 m). It also resembles another sedge, green
      kyllinga, Kyllinga brevifolia. Purple nutsedge tubers are bitter
      and are used medicinally in India and China.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seedling</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Seedlings are rare. When found, seedling leaves are similar to
      that of the mature plants, but smaller. The stem base is slightly
      triangular and the midvein area is usually pale. The first two to
      three leaves emerge together, folded lengthwise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Young plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Purple nutsedge propagates by tubers formed on underground,
      horizontal creeping stems called rhizomes, mostly in the upper
      foot of soil. Sprouts from tubers are similar in appearance to the
      mature plant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mature plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The purple nutsedge stem is erect, glossy, and hairless. Although
      its leaves superficially resemble grass leaves, they lack collars,
      ligules, and auricles. The leaves of purple nutsedge are thicker
      and stiffer than most grasses, are V-shaped in cross-section, and
      arranged in sets of three from the base rather than sets of two as
      in grass leaves. Purple nutsedge flowering stems are triangular in
      cross-section; grass stems are hollow and round. Purple nutsedge
      can be distinguished from yellow nutsedge because it has shorter
      stems and grows only up to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) tall, whereas yellow
      nutsedge stems can grow to 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. Purple nutsedge
      leaves are dark green, 1/8 to 4/17 of an inch (3–6 mm) wide, and
      have rounded tips; yellow nutsedge has light green leaves, a
      pointed tip, and a leaf width of 1/6 to 2/5 of an inch (4–9 mm).
      Purple and yellow nutsedge are also distinguished by their tubers.
      Tubers of purple nutsedge are produced in chains, with several on
      a single, horizontal, underground creeping stem (rhizome), while
      those of yellow nutsedge are produced singly. Another similar
      sedge, green kyllinga, Kyllinga brevifolia, has rhizomes but no
      underground tubers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flowers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Purple nutsedge spikelets are dark reddish to purplish brown with
      few flowers in each cluster. Yellow nustsedge spikelets are
      straw-colored to gold-brown with many flowers. Green kyllinga has
      green flowers on a compressed flower head.<br>
      <b><br>
        Fruits</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Purple nutsedge does not typically produce seeds in the United
      States. This is in contrast to yellow nutsedge, which produces
      tiny single-seeded fruit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reproduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Purple nutsedge grows mainly from tubers formed on horizontal,
      underground, creeping stems called rhizomes, mostly in the upper
      foot of soil. <br>

      Cyperus rotundus (coco-grass,[1] Java grass,[1] nut grass,[1]
      purple nut sedge,[1] red nut sedge,[1] Khmer kravanh chruk[2]) is
      a species of sedge (Cyperaceae) native to Africa, southern and
      central Europe (north to France and Austria), and southern Asia.
      The word cyperus derives from the Greek ??pe???, kyperos,[3] and
      rotundus is from Latin, meaning "round".[4] The earliest attested
      form of the word cyperus is the Mycenaean Greek ??????, ku-pa-ro,
      written in Linear B syllabic script.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Cyperus rotundus is a perennial plant, that may reach a height of
      up to 140 cm (55 inches). The names "nut grass" and "nut sedge" –
      shared with the related species Cyperus esculentus – are derived
      from its tubers, that somewhat resemble nuts, although botanically
      they have nothing to do with nuts.<br>
      <br>
      As in other Cyperaceae, the leaves sprout in ranks of three from
      the base of the plant, around 5–20 cm long. The flower stems have
      a triangular cross-section. The flower is bisexual and has three
      stamina and a three-stigma carpel, with the flower head have 3-8
      unequal rays. The fruit is a three-angled achene.<br>
      <br>
      The root system of a young plant initially forms white, fleshy
      rhizomes, up to 25 mm in dimension, in chains. Some rhizomes grow
      upward in the soil, then form a bulb-like structure from which new
      shoots and roots grow, and from the new roots, new rhizomes grow.
      Other rhizomes grow horizontally or downward, and form dark
      reddish-brown tubers or chains of tubers.<br>
      <br>
      It prefers dry conditions, but will tolerate moist soils, it often
      grows in wastelands and in crop fields.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Invasive problems and eradication</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cyperus rotundus is one of the most invasive weeds known, having
      spread out to a worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate
      regions. It has been called "the world's worst weed"[6] as it is
      known as a weed in over 90 countries, and infests over 50 crops
      worldwide.[citation needed] In the United States it occurs from
      Florida north to New York and Minnesota and west to California and
      most of the states in between. In the uplands of Cambodia, it is
      described as an important agricultural weed.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Its existence in a field significantly reduces crop yield, both
      because it is a tough competitor for ground resources, and because
      it is allelopathic, the roots releasing substances harmful to
      other plants. Similarly, it also has a bad effect on ornamental
      gardening. The difficulty to control it is a result of its
      intensive system of underground tubers, and its resistance to most
      herbicides. It is also one of the few weeds that cannot be stopped
      with plastic mulch.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Weed pulling in gardens usually results in breakage of roots,
      leaving tubers in the ground from which new plants emerge quickly.
      Ploughing distributes the tubers in the field, worsening the
      infestation; even if the plough cuts up the tubers to pieces, new
      plants can still grow from them. In addition, the tubers can
      survive harsh conditions, further contributing to the difficulty
      to eradicate the plant. Hoeing in traditional agriculture of South
      East Asia does not remove the plant but leads to rapid
      regrowth.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Most herbicides may kill the plant's leaves, but most have no
      effect on the root system and the tubers. Glyphosate will kill
      some of the tubers (along with most other plants) and repeated
      application can be successful. Halosulfuron-methyl (chemical name:
      Methyl
      5-[((4,6-dimethoxy-2pyrimidinyl)amino)carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate),[7]









      brand name "Manage" (now renamed "SedgeHammer" in the USA) or
      "Sempra" in Australia, will control nut grass after repeated
      applications without damaging lawns.[citation needed]. In Cambodia
      the plant does not tolerate shading, while 2,4-D
      (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid slows growth in pastures and mulch
      crops.<br>

      <b>Uses and positive aspects</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Despite its bad reputation, Cyperus rotundus has several
      beneficial uses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Folk medicine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The plant is used in popular medicine:<br>
      <br>
      In traditional Chinese medicine it is considered the primary qi
      regulating herb.<br>
      <br>
      The plant is mentioned in the ancient Indian ayurvedic medicine
      Charaka Samhita (ca. 100 CE). Modern ayurvedic medicine uses the
      plant, known as musta or musta moola churna,[8][9] for treating
      fevers, digestive system disorders, dysmenorrhea and other
      maladies.<br>
      <br>
      Arabs of the Levant traditionally use roasted tubers, while they
      are still hot, or hot ashes from burned tubers, to treat wounds,
      bruises, carbuncles, etc. Western and Islamic herbalists including
      Dioscorides, Galen, Serapion, Paulus Aegineta, Avicenna, Rhazes,
      and Charles Alston have described medical uses as stomachic,
      emmenagogue, deobstruent and in emollient plasters.[10][11]<br>
      <br>
      The antibacterial properties of the ingested tubers also
      apparently helped prevent tooth decay in people who lived in Sudan
      2000 years ago. Less than one percent of that local population's
      teeth had cavities, abscesses, or other signs of tooth decay, even
      though those people were probably farmers (early farmers teeth
      typically had more tooth decay than hunter gatherers because the
      high grain content in their diet created a hospitable environment
      for bacteria that flourish in the human mouth , excreting acids
      that eat away at the teeth).[12][13]-<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modern uses and studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Modern alternative medicine recommends using the plant to treat
      nausea, fever and inflammation; for pain reduction; for muscle
      relaxation and many other disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Several pharmacologically active substances have been identified
      in Cyperus rotundus: a-cyperone, ß-selinene, cyperene,
      patchoulenone, sugeonol, kobusone, and isokobusone, that may
      scientifically explain the folk- and alternative-medicine uses. A
      sesquiterpene, rotundone, so called because it was originally
      extracted from the tuber of this plant, is responsible for the
      spicy aroma of black pepper and the peppery taste of certain
      Australian Shiraz wines.[14]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Food</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Despite the bitter taste of the tubers, they are edible and have
      nutritional value. Some part of the plant was eaten by humans at
      some point in ancient history. The plant is known to have a high
      amount of carbohydrates.[15] The plant is known to have been eaten
      in Africa in famine-stricken areas. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the tubers are an important nutritional source of
      minerals and trace elements for migrating birds such as
      cranes.[citation needed]<br>
