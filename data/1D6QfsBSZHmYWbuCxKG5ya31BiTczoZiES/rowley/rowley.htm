      <p>DELRAY BEACH, Fla. --- Gerald Rowley keeps his dreams in his
        garage. There, on a quiet street in this southeast Florida town,
        he stores an aging Mazda 626 sedan, cream white with a worn
        interior, unremarkable in nearly all respects with the exception
        of a precisely machined, one-gallon steel box in the trunk
        connected to fuel lines leading to a gasoline vaporizing device
        under the hood. </p>
      <p>The steel box holds one gallon of regular unleaded gasoline.
        The device beneath the hood is called the VFS, Vaporizing Fuel
        System--not the most elegant name, but one considerably more
        acceptable and descriptive than the "Vapster" badge Rowley
        originally stuck on his invention. </p>
      <p>I came here to drive Rowley's VFS-equipped car. For years, I
        had spurned the invitations of homespun inventors worldwide to
        travel to distant points to witness first-hand machines that
        could deliver 100 miles per gallon or 200 miles per gallon. </p>
      <p>The claims sounded too incredible to believe -- ridiculous, in
        fact. If such devices really worked, really did what their
        inventors said they did, why would they still be sitting on
        shelves in anonymous workshops -- ignored by the driving public
        and all of the vehicle manufacturers who serve them? What
        automobile manufacturer in its right mind, especially with
        rising concerns about future oil availability and with gasoline
        prices escalating worldwide, would not jump at the opportunity
        to acquire a device that delivered 100 miles per gallon? </p>
      <p>The inventors' claims didn't make sense. So, I did what any
        sensible, hardened journalist would do. I ignored them. </p>
      <p>But then a good friend, Sasha Tapie, a computer geek and an
        absolute nut about fuel efficiency, called me boasting about yet
        another "fantastic" fuel-saving device "you have to see to
        believe." </p>
      <p>Sasha is a master salesman. He could sell God heaven at a
        higher price and make the Almighty believe He got a deal. </p>
      <p>"You just can't brush this off," said Sasha, who, as usual, had
        a financial interest in the project he was extolling. "You just
        can't walk away from this without at least driving it yourself.
        You are a better journalist than that." </p>
      <p>You can sell anybody, especially a journalist, by appealing to
        ego. I was sold. And so here I was with Rowley, a man who grew
        up making race car engines, standing in front of his
        VFS-equipped car, ready to do something that defied common sense
        -- take a long ride in an old car down a Florida highway on one
        gallon of gas. </p>
      <p>But, first, a primer: Rowley's patented device is nothing new.
        It's just the latest iteration of an idea already developed by
        others -- the notion that you could get more miles per gallon
        out of a traditional gasoline engine if you pre-heated the fuel
        to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit, thus turning it into a vapor
        before it enters the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>Vaporized fuel, when properly mixed with air, burns more
        efficiently, saves fuel and emits fewer tailpipe pollutants than
        traditional fuel-air mixtures in which gasoline is sprayed into
        a combustion chamber in tiny droplets and then mixed with air
        before burning. </p>
      <p>All car companies know this. Most have sought to increase
        combustion efficiency by swirling gasoline in intake valves
        before mixing it with air and by using computers to more
        precisely open and close engine intake and exhaust valves to
        better meter fuel-air mixtures. The manufacturers' rapid-swirl,
        electronically controlled variable-valve lift technology has
        brought about substantial increases in fuel efficiency--but
        nothing near the reported 40 percent to 60 percent improvements
        in efficiency touted by inventors of the pre-heating, fuel
        vaporizing equipment. </p>
      <p>It turned out that the steel box in the trunk of Rowley's old
        Mazda 626 had an on-off valve leading to a separate fuel line.
        The car's original fuel line was connected to a larger fuel
        tank. </p>
      <p>"Don't worry," Rowley assured me. "When we run out of fuel in
        the gasoline cell [the steel box] the car will coast to a stop.
        I'll get out and switch the valve to the regular tank. We won't
        get stranded." </p>
      <p>I was relieved. </p>
      <p>Powered by the fuel in the test-control box, we entered a
        nearby highway and cruised at a steady pace of 65 mph for 45
        miles before the engine sputtered and died, forcing us to coast
        to a roadway shoulder. I was impressed. That early 1990s Mazda
        626 normally would have gotten 30 miles per gallon under those
        conditions. Rowley's device yielded a 50 percent improvement. It
        worked. Or, at least, it certainly seemed to work. </p>
      <p>Other fuel vaporizer pioneers, such as Canadian engineer
        Charles Nelson Pogue, inventor of the double-chamber Pogue
        Carburetor, have made similar claims about their fuel vaporizing
        devices. And their claims are framed with conspiracy theories
        about why such technology remains isolated, generally removed
        from the marketplace. Pogue has pointed a finger at oil
        companies, allegedly working to keep fuel-efficient technology
        off the market. Others have accused the car companies of
        ignoring the technology to protect their multibillion-dollar
        investments in their current gasoline-engine infrastructure. </p>
      <p>There is no proof behind any of those allegations. And, as I
        pointed out earlier, the car companies have not ignored the idea
        of getting a more efficient burn through a more thorough
        vaporization of fuel entering combustion chambers. </p>
      <p>The real problem? </p>
      <p>My guess is that it has everything to do with our increasingly
        litigious culture, which is woefully intolerant of the
        trial-and-error nature of anything related to invention and
        innovation. What happens to those fuel vaporizers in a crash?
        What is the increased potential of fire and explosion? How do
        you maintain government-mandated fuel system integrity with a
        bolted-on fuel vaporizing device? Is there any increase in
        ambient gasoline vapor emissions with the vaporizers? Who gets
        sued if a vaporizer fails and someone is injured or killed, or
        if a state or federal agency determines that ambient emissions
        from the devices violate clean-air standards? Who carries the
        legal and financial weight? </p>
      <p>Inventors tend to be shallow-pocket solo artists, men and women
        with big ideas absent big boards of directors and large
        shareholder groups. Inventors have more freedom to take chances.
        Corporations are different. They have deep pockets, which makes
        them big litigation targets. They are well aware that a good
        deed gone wrong, even for a moment, can lead to a big and
        potentially ruinous lawsuit. As a result, they tread more
        carefully, which means it will be a long while before any of
        them is willing to take a risk with an externally mounted fuel
        vaporizing device. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to the field of fuel
        combustion and internal combustion engine design. More
        specifically the present invention relates to a fuel
        vaporization and mixing system for producing a mixture of fuel
        vapor, atomized water and air for delivery into an internal
        combustion engine, the system being configured and positioned
        relative to the internal combustion engine to draw heat from the
        engine exhaust system to vaporize fuel for combining into the
        mixture. While it is known that properly combining sprayed fuel
        and air with atomized water can boost horsepower and fuel
        efficiency, the automobile industry has failed to recognize that
        vaporizing the fuel with engine exhaust system heat prior to
        mixing with air and water is an efficient way of still further
        enhancing horsepower and fuel mileage. </p>
      <p>The system includes a fuel tank for holding fuel prior to
        vaporization and mixing, a fuel pump in fluid communication with
        the fuel tank for delivering fuel from the fuel tank, a vacuum
        pump/or vacuum drawn off engine intake manifold with check
        valve, a fuel metering valve in fluid communication with the
        fuel pump for metering the flow of fuel from the fuel tank, a
        vapor collecting chamber in fluid communication with the fuel
        metering valve for holding fuel while the fuel is vaporized, the
        vapor collecting chamber being in thermal communication with the
        engine exhaust system to draw fuel vaporizing heat from the
        exhaust system, fuel blowing means mounted within the vapor
        collecting chamber for stirring and uniformly distributing the
        fuel vapor, a molecule mixture box in fluid communication with
        the vapor collecting chamber for receiving vaporized fuel from
        the chamber, a throttle mounting opening in the molecule mixture
        box wall containing a throttle, having a throttle body, for
        regulating the flow of air from the surrounding atmosphere into
        the molecule mixture box, an air filter mounted to the throttle
        body to filter air entering the throttle, a pressurizing
        air/water pump in fluid communication with the molecule mixture
        box, an air intake structure in fluid communication with the
        air/water pump for delivering air through the air/water pump
        into the molecule mixture box, a water holding tank in fluid
        communication with the air/water pump for delivering water
        through the air/water pump into the mixture box, an air/water
        injector positioned to receive and transform the air and water
        exiting the pump into a combined spray as the air and water
        enter the mixture box, and a spiral mixture delivery means for
        guiding the resulting mixture from the molecule mixture box into
        an intake manifold or port of an internal combustion engine. A
        method is also provided, including the steps of delivering
        sufficient heat into the fuel to transform the fuel into
        vaporized fuel; atomizing water; mixing metered quantities of
        the vaporized fuel and atomized water mist with a metered
        quantity of air to produce a fuel mixture; and delivering the
        fuel mixture into an internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Many efforts have been made over the years to boost the
        performance of internal combustion engines running on standard,
        commercially available gasoline and other hydrocarbon based
        fuels. A good summary of known methods is provided in an article
        published on page 59 of the July 1983 edition of HOT ROD.TM.
        magazine, entitled </p>
      <p><b>Water Injection</b> </p>
      <p>"Nearly all of the changes that an enthusiast might attempt [to
        boost horsepower] are designed to raise cylinder pressure: a
        higher compression ratio raises pressure by squeezing the
        mixture into a smaller combustion area; increasing spark advance
        raises cylinder pressure by giving the hot gases more time to
        expand; even valve timing and fuel system changes result in more
        cylinder pressure because they allow the cylinders to fill more
        completely. </p>
      <p>"Low-octane fuels are incompatible with high cylinder pressure
        because they ignite easily. As a fuel's octane number increases,
        it becomes more resistant to self-ignition. As an engine's
        cylinder pressure increases, the combustion chamber temperature
        increases. A combination of relatively low-octane fuel and high
        combustion chamber temperature causes the fuel to ignite before
        the time of spark ignition. This means that the gases in the
        cylinder start burning and expanding before they should. When
        spark ignition does occur, a second flame front is developed.
        The two areas of combustion expand, causing tremendous pressure
        and heat between them. This results in uncontrolled, violent
        explosion of the unburned parts of the charge. This effect,
        known as detonation, breaks pistons, flattens bearings, and
        destroys engines. </p>
      <p>"There are three ways to deal with detonation. You can (1)
        reduce cylinder pressure and sacrifice horsepower and
        efficiency, (2) buy expensive racing gasoline, or (3) inject
        water to control rising combustion chamber temperatures
        --undoubtedly the best solution. </p>
      <p>"Water injection can work for you in two different ways . . .
        if it is injected properly and in the right amounts. A fully
        aerated water mist that mixes completely with the incoming
        charge can keep chamber temperatures below the flash point of
        low-octane fuel until the point of spark ignition. If the amount
        of water injected is not excessive, it will only keep the
        temperature just barely within limits and will not hinder
        combustion when the spark does occur. On the other hand, a well
        distributed, fully aerated charge will turn into a steam at the
        moment of combustion, expanding nearly 1700 times. . . . The
        expanding water vapor will actually increase pressure and,
        consequently, horsepower if it turns to steam at exactly the
        right time . . . </p>
      <p>"Many water injection systems fail to accomplish this because
        the're really nothing more than squirt guns. . . .[T]hey merely
        deliver water under pressure to a carburetor without properly
        aerating it first." </p>
      <p>The benefits of combining atomized water with the fuel/air
        mixture and the need to fully aerate the water component prior
        to mixing have been recognized for nearly two decades. Yet there
        has been no recognition of the need to fully aerate the fuel,
        which has at least equal capacity for boosting engine power and
        fuel mileage. </p>

        combustion engines. A problem with these prior devices and
        systems is that none teach or suggest the advantage of combining
        air and water with fuel which has been vaporized by engine
        exhaust system heat. </p>
      <p>It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a fuel
        vaporization system which produces a fuel mixture including
        metered quantities of vaporized fuel, misted water and air, for
        high power combustion within an internal combustion engine. </p>

        fuel vaporization system which vaporizes fuel with heat received
        from the engine exhaust system. </p>
      <p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide
        a fuel vaporization method for execution by the disclosed fuel
        vaporization system which includes the steps of vaporizing fuel
        with heat from an engine exhaust system and mixing the vaporized
        fuel with atomized water and with air to produce a fuel mixture,
        and delivering the fuel mixture into an internal combustion
        engine. </p>
      <p>It is finally an object of the present invention to provide
        such a system which is reliable and inexpensive to manufacture.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention accomplishes the above-stated objectives,
        as well as others, as may be determined by a fair reading and
        interpretation of the entire specification. </p>
      <p>A fuel vaporization and mixing system is provided for producing
        a mixture of fuel vapor, atomized water and air for delivery
        into an internal combustion engine having an engine exhaust
        system, including a fuel source under vacuum to reduce the
        vaporization point of the fuel and for holding fuel prior to
        vaporization; a fuel pump in fluid communication with the fuel
        source for delivering fuel from the fuel source; a vapor
        collecting chamber in fluid communication with fuel pump for
        holding a quantity of fuel while the quantity of fuel is
        vaporized, the vapor collecting chamber being in thermal
        communication with the engine exhaust system to draw fuel
