        <b>by </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Lorenz Huber</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In collaboration with the start-up "Polarmond," scientists at Empa
      developed an "all-in-one" shelter system. Inside the shelter
      conditions remain comfortable whatever the weather outdoors,
      thanks to a sophisticated dehumidifying system and a fine-tuned
      temperature control mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      At the Swiss Textiles Association's Innovation Day, the new
      start-up firm Polarmond presented its patented "all-in-one"
      sleeping system. This combines the functions of a sleeping bag,
      sleeping mat and bivouac in one product. What is particularly
      special about it is that the spacious inner room allows the user
      to sleep comfortably -- as if in their own bed -- at temperatures
      down to -30Â°C, and yet it is heated by nothing more than the
      occupant's body heat. Empa researchers Martin Camenzind and
      Matthew Morrissey assisted Polarmond in the search for suitable
      materials, and helped in finding a solution to the problems of
      thermal insulation and dealing with moisture.<br>
      <br>
      The great challenge in terms of thermal insulation was the size of
      the space to be insulated. Despite the spacious inner room, the
      weight of the total system has to be kept as low as possible to
      make the product attractive for trekkers and mountaineers. "An
      inner room of this size is not the easiest option for a product
      that must be as light as possible," explains Camenzind. "It would
      be more efficient to have the insulation layer in direct contact
      with the body." Because of several requirements, like this one,
      which were contradictory, Morrissey and Camenzind initially
      decided to name the sleeping system "magic tent."<br>
      <br>
      The Empa researchers combined approaches, materials and techniques
      from very varied fields in an innovative way. "If you want to find
      new solutions, you have to think outside the box and look beyond
      the standard methods," says Camenzind. And so the two scientists
      developed a so-called sandwich construction for the insulation,
      consisting of a fluffy synthetic filling with reflective layers,
      as is also used in spacesuits. Step by step, the "magic tent"
      became a real tent.<br>
      <br>
      The difficulty in dealing with humidity is that it must be removed
      from the body whilst simultaneously keeping the insulation layer
      dry. A special kind of liner, a sort of cover, partially solves
      this problem. The side facing the body is covered in a permeable
      layer which allows water vapour to pass through it. However, the
      liner is sealed from the upper side into the inner room, so
      humidity from the user's body is trapped in the liner and can,
      next morning quite simply be shaken out of it in the form of water
      drops or ice crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Because, however, the liner is not enclosed (as in a sleeping
      bag), but "only" a cover, an exchange of air -- and therefore also
      humidity -- in the inner room is unavoidable. In order that the
      insulation layer remains dry despite this, it is given a coating
      which is non-permeable to water vapour on the side facing into the
      sleeping room. The residual humidity is taken up by the warmed air
      in the sleeping cell and escapes via a zippered opening. This
      allows a practically constant temperature to be maintained in the
      sleeping cell even if the outdoor temperature varies, and
      therefore eliminates the problem caused by the user perspiring.<br>

      </b><b>Gold Award at "Outdoor 2015" fair in Germany.</b><br>
      <br>
      Not least thanks to Empa's contribution, Polarmond won the Gold
      Industry Award at the leading European trade show "Outdoor 2015."
      This is considered to be one of the most prestigious international
      awards that a company involved in the outdoor field can be given,
      and is awarded every year at the "Outdoor." exhibition in
      Friedrichshafen, Germany. In the jury's words of praise, "The
      entire research experience of the last 20 years has gone into the
      development of Polarmond's "All-in-one- Sleeping System," adding
      that the modularly constructed system was innovative and extremely
      functional. It takes into account all the factors involved in
      sleeping outdoors under all conditions, and mutually optimizes
      them. The next step is for Polarmond to close contracts with the
      material suppliers they have been evaluating. In addition, some
      details must still be optimized, according to the company's CEO,
      Walter Krummenacher. "We are already very satisfied with our
      product, but not quite finished yet." If all goes as planned the
      "All-in-one-Sleeping System" will appear on the market in March
      2016.<br>

      <br>
      A bivouac shelter for residing outdoors, including a basis unit
      that forms a tunnel-like or sack-like body receiving space with an
      access opening for a person. The bivouac shelter includes a
      closure unit, by way of which the body receiving space is closable
      in a thermally insulating and airtight manner. The closure unit
      moreover includes a connection body that can be assembled
      transversely over the access opening and that is connectable to
      the basis unit in a thermally insulating manner. The closure unit
      moreover includes a hood attached onto the connection body for
      receipt of a head of a person lying with the body in the body
      receiving space. The basis unit can also include a foot-side
      terminating element.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a bivouac shelter for residing outdoors
      or in non-heated accommodation, said bivouac shelter comprising a
      basis unit which forms a tunnel-like or tube-like body receiving
      space with a foot region as well as with at least one access
      opening for at least one person.<br>
      <br>
      Bivouac shelters provide a person with protection from weather
      conditions when residing outdoors. Such weather conditions can be
      wind, downpour, such as snow, hail or rain, as well as temperature
      conditions. Bivouac shelters in particular should also serve for
      permitting spending the night outdoors and provide a sleeping
      person with adequate protection from the mentioned weather
      conditions. Bivouac shelters are used by the most varied of groups
      of people. Of course, the use of bivouac shelters for outdoor
      activities such as trekking, mountain tours, expeditions etc. are
      known. Here, the bivouac shelters permit the stopover over several
      days, in regions, in which no fixed sheltered accommodation is
      otherwise available. Moreover, bivouac shelters are also applied
      for homeless people who for various reasons permanently or
      temporarily have no fixed accommodation. These can be persons who
      can no longer live in their fixed accommodation due to the event
      of damage, such as with earthquakes, fire, flooding or storms.
      Moreover, the homelessness can also relate to refugees who had to
      leave their fixed accommodation for various reasons. Moreover,
      bivouac shelters are also used by emergency services, such as the
      military with their deployment lasting several days, in regions in
      which no fixed sheltered accommodation is available and where
      mobility is highly important. Bivouac shelters are also used in
      the field of rescue.<br>
      <br>
      Known to a lesser extent is the provision of bivouac shelters to
      homeless people whom one comes across in large cities and who
      cannot afford fixed accommodation due to economic reasons for
      example. This type of homeless people either spends the night out
      in the open in self-constructed, makeshift dwellings or in
      overnight shelters for the homeless. It is particularly the case
      in harsh winters that such overnight shelters are however fully
      occupied, so that indeed with freezing temperatures many homeless
      people must spend the night in their makeshift dwellings or at
      locations out in the open which provide a little shelter. These
      opportunities for spending the night however provide much too
      little protection from the weather conditions and in particular
      low temperatures, so that it is indeed in harsh winters that death
      and freezing often occurs amongst the homeless.<br>
      <br>
      2. Description of Related Art<br>
      <br>
      Apart from bivouac shelters, sleeping bags are also known for
      spending the night out in the open, and these are to insulate the
      body against low outside temperatures. Such sleeping bags are
      disclosed for example in US 2004/0040087 and U.S. Pat. No.
      3,959,834A. The body with such sleeping bags however is not
      hermetically sealed to the outside, since the head lies outside
      the sleeping bag and air can therefore circulate through the head
      opening. The head and in particular the face portion as a rule are
      insufficiently protected from low temperatures, even if integrated
      hoods are provided for this. Although it is known to span hood
      coverings over the head for the reasons mentioned above, this
      solution is likewise not satisfactory since such hood coverings
      e.g. are not windproof.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the conventional sleeping bags mentioned above,
      bivouac shelters also provide protection from further weather
      influences such as wind and downpour. A multitude of bivouac
      shelters for residing outdoors is known from the state of the art.
      Thus e.g. WO 2004/109041 describes a mobile protective shelter
      with an inflatable element. The protective shelter forms a
      tunnel-like cavity which can provide a lying person with
      protection and can be closed off to the outside. According to this
      sheltering device, the complete person is located in the
      tunnel-like cavity, so that a separate air feed is provided, via
      which the person is supplied with air for breathing. In another
      example, the person is supplied with oxygen by an oxygen bottle
      brought along.<br>
      <br>
      WO94/17266 describes an inflatable sheltering device with an
      inflatable mattress and, arranged above this, a likewise
      inflatable cover hood which together with the mattress forms a
      cavity for completely receiving a person. Air openings are
      provided for the supply of fresh air.<br>
      <br>
      In certain embodiments of bivouac shelters, the head therefore in
      each case together with the remaining body is accommodated in a
      thermally insulating receiving space. This however necessitates
      the provision of means for the fresh air supply such as e.g. air
      openings. Moreover, air openings must also be provided in order to
      prevent the formation of condensation water in the receiving space
      due to exhaled air. Such air openings however reduce the heat
      insulation capacity and are moreover problematic with regard to
      their sealedness with respect to water, such as rain, or surface
      water. Other means for the supply of fresh air are also elaborate
      and complicated with regard to their implementation.<br>
      <br>
      According to alternative embodiments of bivouac shelters, the head
      is arranged outside the thermally insulating receiving space for
      the body. The supply of breathing air is therefore ensured.
      Instead, the thermal insulation capacity is likewise reduced by
      way of leaky or permeable transition region between the
      outer-lying head portion and the remaining body. Moreover, the
      head portion is insufficiently protected from the influences of
      the weather.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is therefore the object of the invention, to provide a mobile
      and lightweight bivouac shelter of the initially mentioned type,
      with which on the one hand the body is ideally protected from
      weather influences and in particularly optimally thermally
      insulated from the cold, and on the other hand the adequate supply
      of fresh air for breathing is ensured without complicated
      technical measures. The bivouac shelter should moreover be simple
      with regard to design and assembly, as well as inexpensively
      manufacturable.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved by the characterising features of claim 1.
      The dependent claims claim particular further developments and
      alternative solutions of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter is thus characterised in that the basis unit
      comprises a connection opening for a closure unit, said connection
      opening lying opposite the foot region. The basis unit is moreover
      designed in a self-supporting manner in the operating position and
      forms a shape-retaining body receiving space. The basis unit
      moreover comprises an at least partially, preferably completely
      multi-walled construction with at least one, preferably a
      plurality of air-filled hollow chambers lying therebetween,
      wherein the basis unit obtains its intrinsic stability due to the
      multi-walled construction.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particular embodiment, the basis unit comprises an
      inner (insulating) body as well as an outer (insulating) body. The
      outer body bears on the inner insulating body and envelops this at
      least partly and preferably completely. The outer body in
      particular forms a tunnel-like or tubular receiving space for the
      inner body. The inner body for its part forms a tunnel-like or
      tubular body receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      The inner body can e.g. be inserted into the outer body. The two
      insulating bodies moreover form a ground part.<br>
      <br>
      Hollow chambers which are closed or connected to one another and
      are preferably air-filled are arranged between the two insulating
      bodies. These hollow chambers have a further insulation effect.
      For this, the inner body towards the outer body, and/or the outer
      body towards the inner body preferably has an outer contour with
      prominences and recesses. The outer contour can e.g. be wavelike,
      zigzagged, and in particular square-wave-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      Both bodies are preferably designed in a multi-walled manner, with
      one or more air-filled hollow chambers lying therebetween. The
      bodies for this contain valves, with which the hollow chambers can
      be filled with air.<br>
      <br>
      In a further development of the invention, the closure unit is
      attached onto the connection opening in a releasable or fixed
      manner and closes the body receiving space in a thermally
      insulating manner.<br>
      <br>
      The connection opening preferably corresponds to an end-side
      opening of the tunnel-like or tubular body receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the connection
      opening corresponds to the access opening. This does not
      necessarily need to be the case. Thus the access opening can also
      be attached or incorporated laterally, on a wall section which
      laterally delimits the body receiving space in the longitudinal
      direction. The access opening here can e.g. be designed as an
      access slot or access gap or by way of a detachable access flap
      which forms hatch. The access slot or access gap are arranged e.g.
      in the longitudinal direction.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the access opening can also be designed by a liftable
      basis upper part. The basis upper part can be completely separated
      from the remaining basis unit or be connected to this via a hinge
      connection. The basis upper part can be connected to the lower
      part of the basis upper part via a tongue-and-groove connection
      which is at least partly peripheral.<br>
      <br>
      The access opening defines that opening, through which the user
      enters into the body receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit is releasably connected to the basis unit via
      closure means, such as with a positive fit, a friction fit, in
      particular via a Velcro-type closure, zip closure or button
      closure.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit can comprise a connection body which can be
      assembled transversely over the connection opening or access
      opening and which is connectable to the basis unit in a thermally
      insulating manner.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the closure unit preferably comprises a hood for
      receiving a head of a person lying with his body in the body
      receiving space, said hood being attached in a releasable manner
      or in non-releasable manner which is to say integrally. The hood
      preferably comprises a flexible two-dimensional (sheet-like)
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The body receiving space is closable preferably in a thermally
      insulating as well as watertight and/or airtight manner by way of
      the closure unit. Watertight means that no moisture and in
      particular no rainwater or surface water can penetrate into the
      body receiving space. Airtight means that no uncontrolled exchange
      of air can take place, wherein an air exchange controlled by
      valves is not to be excluded by this.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit is thus preferably connectable via the connection
      body to the basis unit, preferably in an airtight, watertight and
      thermally insulating manner. Accordingly of course, the basis unit
      or its wall region is also designed in a thermally insulating and
      preferably also airtight as well as watertight manner. The body
      receiving space serves for receiving at least the legs or parts
      thereof and preferably the torso as well as the arms and legs of a
      lying person, hereinafter called body. The head in contrast is
      placed outside the body receiving spaced closed by the closure
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      The thermally insulated body receiving space is heated up by the
      body's own heat of the person lying therein, and is kept warm.
      I.e., no external heat source such as a heater is necessary for
      heating the body receiving space. With particularly harsh weather
      conditions, additional heating means can be provided in the body
      receiving space for heating this. Since the body receiving space
      is however hermetically closed to the outside and permits no air
      circulation and moreover is thermally insulated in an optimal
      manner by the air chambers of the basis unit, the body receiving
      space can be kept comfortably warm with a comparatively low heat
      output. Moreover, additionally a sleeping bag or a sleeping
      envelope or a sleeping cover arranged in the body receiving space
      and for increasing the comfort can be provided. The sleeping bag
      or the sleeping envelope can e.g. be releasably or non-releasably
      connected to the closure unit.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit preferably at least in sections and preferably
      completely or over the whole periphery is designed in a
      multi-walled, in particular double-walled manner. The basis unit
      thus comprises at least two walls which are distanced to one
      another. At least one, preferably several hollow chambers which
      are separated from one another and are filled with air (e.g.
      inflatable) is contained therebetween in a lying manner. The
      chambers e.g. are inflatable via one or more valves e.g. by way of
      a pump such as a hand pump or foot pump, with a gas such as air.
      The chambers can also be self-inflatable. Inflatable is therefore
      to be understood hereinafter as self-inflatable as well as
      actively inflatable, e.g. by way of a pump.<br>
      <br>
      The chambers can be separated from one another in an airtight
      manner or designed in a manner communicating with one another. The
      hollow chambers which are formed between the outer wall and the
      inner wall and which are filled with air ensure an optimal thermal
      insulation of the bivouac shelter with respect to the environment.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit likewise forms the ground part which lies on the
      ground and which is usefully an integral part of the basis unit.
      This ground part is usefully likewise designed in a multi-walled
      manner with hollow chambers which are filled with air (e.g.
      inflatable) and lie therebetween, and therefore simultaneously
      also assumes the function of a mattress. I.e. the ground part with
      the air-filled hollow chamber(s) not only serves for the thermal
      insulation but also for cushioning or spring support.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first embodiment variant, the multi-walled
      construction of the basis unit comprises two outer-lying walls as
      well as a self-expanding inner structure lying therebetween and
      having at least one hollow chamber. The inner structure is
      elastically expandable into an operating position e.g. by way of
      pressure relief. The air is sucked through a valve by way of this.
      The filling of the hollow chambers with air is thus effected
      without the active supply of air. The inner structure can e.g.
      contain an elastically deformable foam material. The hollow
      chambers here are formed by the pores of the foam material. The
      shape retention is effected here essentially via the inner
      structure, e.g. the foam and not necessarily via the enclosed air
      volume. The air according to this embodiment variant specifically
      usefully has atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In the transport condition, the basis unit is folded or rolled in
      a compact manner, and well as the air pressed out of the hollow
      chambers. The inner structure experiences a compression in this
      condition. Only on unfolding or unrolling and the pressure relief
      entailed by this does the basis unit begin to automatically
      inflate with air through the valves.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second embodiment variant, the multi-walled
      construction of the basis unit comprises two outer-lying walls as
      well as flexible connection webs or chamber walls which lie
      therebetween and which connect the two walls to one another. The
      connection webs or chamber walls are a type of spacer between the
      walls which are connected to these. They form one or more open or
      closed hollow chambers which can be filled with air via one or
      more valves. The hollow chambers here must be actively inflated.
      The shape retention is effected here essentially via the air
      volume enclosed in the hollow chambers. The air according to this
      embodiment variant specifically preferably has an overpressure
      compared to the ambient pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Whilst the ground part is preferably designed in a plane manner,
      the roof part arranged thereabove is preferably formed in an
      arched manner. The roof part can however also be designed
      differently, e.g. with plane surfaces which meet at an angle. The
      roof part with its lateral wall sections is connected to the
      ground part, preferably in an integral manner. The roof part can
      moreover comprise reinforcement structures which are separate or
      integrated into this, and which ensure the intrinsic stability of
      the basis unit.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit can be designed as a plane component which is
      flexible in the inflated condition and which can be bent into a
      tubular structure for creating the bivouac shelter, wherein the
      two lateral end sections or end edges which are led together are
      connected to one another in a thermally insulating and preferably
      also watertight and/or airtight manner.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit comprises a foot region which lies opposite the
      connection opening. The body receiving space is terminated or
      closed off to the outside in a thermally insulating manner and
      preferably also in a watertight and/or airtight manner, in the
      foot region.<br>
      <br>
      In a particular embodiment, a separately formed terminating
      element can be provided, via which the body receiving space in the
      foot region can be closed in a thermally insulating and preferably
      also watertight and/or airtight manner. The terminating element
      can be designed as a separate element which can be completely
      disassembled from the basis unit, or as an element which at least
      partly can be released from the basis unit amid the release of a
      connection opening to the outside. According to this embodiment,
      with a disassembled terminating element, warm air can be led into
      the body receiving space via the foot opening. The terminating
      element can be connected to the remaining basis unit via a type of
      tongue-and-groove connection designed in an annular and closed
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      The terminating element can however also be designed as an
      integral, non-releasable part of the basis unit. The terminating
      element preferably at least in sections, preferably completely is
      likewise designed in a multi-walled manner, in particular in a
      double-walled manner. Preferably, one or more inflatable chambers
      for the thermal insulation of the body receiving space are formed
      between an outer wall and the inner wall. In a preferred
      embodiment of the invention, the basis unit, preferably together
      with the terminating element forms a body which over the whole
      periphery is designed in at least double-walled manner, with one
      or more inflatable chambers lying therebetween, for the thermal
      insulation of the body receiving space. This means that with the
      exception of connection webs which as the case may be are provided
      between the walls, a thermally insulating hollow chamber is always
      arranged between an inner wall and outer wall of the basis unit,
      as the case may be also of the terminating element.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit in the operating position is also designed in a
      self-supporting and intrinsically stable manner, and forms a
      tunnel-like or tubular permanent body receiving space,
      independently of whether a person is located thereon or not. The
      body receiving space in cross section can have any polygonal or
      round or other type of shape. The cross-sectional shape of the
      outer contour of the basis unit and/or its tunnel-like body
      receiving space can be polygon-shaped, e.g. triangle-shaped,
      rectangle-shaped, trapezium-shaped or semicircular. The basis unit
      can have a height reducing from the head region to the foot
      region. An aerodynamic design of the basis unit as well as of the
      tent structures such as awnings which belong thereto as the case
      may be, can be advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit is preferably designed as a separate element
      which can be partly or completely disassembled from the basis
      unit. One however can also envisage the closure unit being
      designed as an element which is at least partly separable from the
      basis unit amid the release of a connection opening or access
      opening. The closure unit must however be at least separable in a
      manner such that a person can move through the released connection
      opening or access opening, into the body receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit in a preferred development of the invention
      comprises a connection body which is designed in a peripheral and
      annular or bead-like manner, for connection to the basis unit. The
      connection body can be designed in a single-part or multi-part
      manner. The connection body can however also be a differently
      designed closure means, such as part of a zip closure, Velcro-type
      closure or button closure.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit moreover comprises a flexible, sheet-like sealing
      element which spans the opening outlined by the annular connection
      body for example. The sheet-like sealing element as the case may
      be is connected to the connection body preferably in a
      non-releasable and in particular watertight and/or airtight
      manner. The hood is moreover connected to the sheet-like sealing
      element in a releasable or non-releasable, i.e. integral manner.<br>
      <br>
      The sheet-like sealing element and the hood are preferably
      manufactured of the same material and particularly preferably in a
      single-part manner.<br>
      <br>
      The sheet-like sealing element and/or the hood are preferably
      manufactured from or with a single-layer or multi-layer material
      and particularly preferably from or with a textile sheet
      formation. In contrast to the basis unit, the sheet-like sealing
      element and/or the hood preferably have no inflatable chambers.
      The sealing element and/or the hood particularly preferably have
      elastically stretchable characteristics, and consist preferably of
      a natural or synthetic rubber or contain these. The sealing
      element and/or the hood particularly preferably consist of
      chloroprene rubber, or polychloroprene or chlorbutadiene rubber,
      as known under the trademark NeopreneÂ® or contain these.<br>
      <br>
      The sheet-like sealing element and/or the hood can also be of a
      double-layered or multi-layered textile material with chambers
      which are filled with an insulating solid matter material, such as
      downs, plastic foam or plastic fibres.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the upper
      part of the basis unit and thus also the connection opening is set
      back with respect to the ground part, in the direction of the foot
      region, in a manner such that the user with the closure unit
      formed as a connection element can assume an upright seated
      position in the basis unit. The legs thereby at least partly,
      preferably completely are accommodated in the tunnel-like
      receiving space. The upper body is preferably arranged outside the
      body receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit can in particular be designed for the use in the
      embodiment mentioned above, as a jacket-like connection element or
      sealing element in the form of a pull-over part for receiving the
      upper body. The jacket-like connection element further comprises
      arms for receiving the arms as well as a hood for receiving the
      head. The jacket-like connection element is designed as a type of
      sleeping envelope.<br>
      <br>
      The jacket-like connection element can itself form a closable
      access, through which the user can enter into the jacket-like
      connection element as well as into the body receiving space. The
      closure of the access can be a zip closure, Velcro-type closure,
      button closure or a combined closure, which is incorporated into
      the connection element. The access can be slot-like or gap-like.<br>
      <br>
      The jacket-like connection element can be connected to the basis
      unit in a fixed or integral manner, or in a releasable manner. The
      releasable connection can be a zip closure, a Velcro-type closure,
      button closure or a combined closure. The connection is
      accordingly designed in an annularly closed manner. In this case,
      the access into the body receiving space can be effected via this
      releasable connection. For this, the user firstly pulls over the
      jacket-like connection element, gets into the body receiving space
      and fastens the jacket-like connection element on the basis unit.
      Analogously to this, the jacket-like connection element can
      already be preassembled on the basis unit. In this case, the user
      opens the connection firstly partially, gets in and pulls over the
      jacket-like connection element and closes the connection.<br>
      <br>
      The hood is preferably designed as a so-called balaclava, also
      called ski mask or slip-over hood. This is a hood enveloping the
      complete head and the neck and either leaves free only the face or
      only the eyes, mouth and nose, in a targeted manner. The balaclava
      thereby is connected to the sheet-like sealing element via the
      neck part. If the hood comprises rubber-elastic characteristics,
      then this is designed in a manner such that the hood bears on the
      contour of the head and, as the case may be, of the neck, in a
      tight or snug manner, so that the body receiving space with the
      body located therein, via the hood lying snugly on the head
      arranged outside the body receiving space, is closed to the
      outside in a sealed, in particular watertight and/or airtight
      manner. The hood thus seals the facial contours.<br>
      <br>
      The annular connection body is preferably designed in a bead-like
      manner and particularly preferably forms one or more chambers
      which are inflatable via preferably at least one valve. The
      connection body in the operational position is preferably designed
      as a supporting or self-supporting element which serves as a
      support mount for the flexible, sheet-like sealing element. With
      an inflatable connection body, this preferably has the previously
      mentioned characteristics not until in the inflated condition. The
      connection body however can also contain foam or consist of this.
      The connection body can be connected to the remaining basis unit
      via a type of tongue-and-groove connection which is designed in an
      annular and closed manner.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit and, with it, the connection opening, preferably
      in the longitudinal direction are arranged in a manner displaced
      inwards, i.e. towards the foot region, so that an outer-lying
      tunnel-like receiving section is formed, in which the head
      inserted into the hood can be positioned. The receiving section
      can be open to the outside at the end side. However, it is also
      possible for the receiving section to be closed to the outside by
      way of a further closure element, even if not necessary in an
      airtight and watertight manner. This additional closure element
      can likewise be designed in an inflatable manner with suitable
      hollow chambers, or also consist of an awning.<br>
      <br>
      The receiving section can also be characterised in that the upper
      part of the basis unit in the region of the receiving section is
      set back with respect to the ground part in the direction of the
      foot region, in a manner such that the user with or without the
      closure unit designed as a connection element can assume an
      upright sitting position on the ground part, wherein the legs are
      accommodated in the tunnel-like receiving space.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit preferably comprises gripper elements arranged
      towards the body receiving space, such as grips or straps, by way
      of which the person lying in the body receiving space can pull the
      closure unit inwards in the direction of the foot region and bring
      it into the closure position. The grip elements are preferably
      fastened on the connection body.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit is preferably connected to the basis unit via a
      friction fit connection and/or positive fit connection. The
      closure unit can e.g. be connected to the basis unit via a type of
      tongue-and-groove connection, wherein e.g. a part-peripheral or
      fully peripheral groove or recess is provided in the basis unit,
      into which groove the connection body engages in a partially
      peripheral or fully peripheral manner. Other thermally insulating
      and preferably also watertight and/or airtight connection types
      are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      Means which on the one hand are water impermeable and on the other
      hand are vapour diffusion permeable can be provided on the basis
      unit and in particular in the closure unit, for leading away air
      humidity out of the body receiving space. This can e.g. be
      effected via water impermeable but vapour diffusion permeable
      membrane which is known per se. Thus e.g. the flexible sealing
      element can comprise such means or such a membrane.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter is designed such that it can be assembled and
      disassembled for multiple use. The bivouac shelter after emptying
      the hollow chambers can be brought into a compact unit for the
      transport and the storage, thanks to the basis unit and, as the
      case may be, the connection body and terminating element, which
      are inflatable or fillable with air in a pressure-free manner. The
      bivouac shelter or its elements such as basis unit and closure
      unit achieve their intrinsic stability by way of the inflation and
      filling of these with air, and the design of air-filled hollow
      chambers. Basically, the chambers can of course also be filled
      with a gas or gas mixture other than air.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit, as the case may be, with the terminating element
      as well as with the connection body as the case may be, comprises
      a flexible, sheet-like, watertight and airtight and, as the case
      may be, also elastic and stretchable material. The material can
      e.g. contain a plastic, in particular PVC and/or a natural or
      synthetic rubber or consist of these. The mentioned material forms
      the outer-lying walls and, as the case may be, webs of the hollow
      chambers. The material preferably consists of a textile sheet
      formation or contains such. A fibre-reinforced, in particular
      carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic fabric can also be used as a
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter according to the invention is therefore of a
      comparatively low weight and thus is suitable for being carried by
      a person. The bivouac shelter in its operational position (without
      awning) can e.g. have a length of 1 to 3 m, a width of 0.4 to 2 m
      and a foot height and head height of 0.3 and 1 m respectively. If
      the bivouac shelter is to provide space for more than one person,
      then it is designed accordingly wider. The bivouac shelter can be
      deployed e.g. at temperatures from -40Â° to +70Â° and has a weight
      e.g. of less than 6 kg.<br>
      <br>
      For application with high temperatures, e.g. in summer, the
      closure unit and, as the case may be, also the terminating element
      can be omitted, so that the person lies in a tunnel-like body
      receiving space which is open to the outside at one end or at both
      ends. The openings in the head region and/or foot region can be
      shielded to the outside by way of a suitable awning as a minimum
      weather protection, viewing protection and light protection. The
      connection locations of the awnings to the basis unit however are
      preferably designed in a watertight manner in each case. The
      awnings can be connected to the basis unit in a releasable or
      non-releasable manner, wherein in the latter case, the flexible
      textile sheet formation of the awnings can be folded or rolled
      together with the basis unit and stored away.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter can be designed for one, two or as the case
      may be, also several persons. Thus the bivouac shelter can be
      designed e.g. for two or more than two persons. In a first
      variant, the bivouac shelter comprises connection openings or
      access openings which lie opposite one another and which are
      closable via suitable closure units of the described type. The
      persons here are arranged next to one another, but lying opposite
      one another in an alternating manner.<br>
      <br>
      In a second variant, one or more closure units are arranged on
      only one side and the persons lie next to one another in an
      equally directed manner, The persons can be arranged e.g. parallel
      next to one another in both variants.<br>
      <br>
      According to the two variants mentioned above, a common closure
      unit can be provided for in each case one, two, several or all
      persons of a bivouac shelter, wherein an individual hood is
      allocated to each person. Preferably however, an individual
      closure unit is provided for the individual access and leaving.<br>
      <br>
      According to a third variant, the bivouac shelter in a plan view
      is designed in the shape of an open ring, wherein the open inner
      circle forms a common receiving section or open receiving sections
      in the form of segments which are at least partly separated from
      one another by way of separating elements. The body receiving
      space is designed in each case as a ring segment. The persons are
      arranged with the head to the inner circle and with the feet
      radially outwards. The bivouac shelter and its spatial elements
      can also differ from the circular shape and e.g. be designed in an
      oval or elliptical or polygonal, in particular rectangular manner.<br>
      <br>
      According to the variants mentioned above, in each case an
      individual open receiving section which e.g. are spatially
      separated from one another via separation elements, can be
      provided for the head of the individual person. One can also
      envisage two, more or all persons of a bivouac shelter sharing a
      common, open receiving section.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the bivouac shelter according to the invention, with the
      described closure unit, it is possible to keep the body of a
      person warm in a body receiving space which is extremely well
      thermally insulating and is preferably also watertight and/or
      airtight, whist the head is in contact with the environment and
      despite this is likewise well protected from the cold and other
      weather conditions. Thanks to the closure unit according to the
      invention, the body receiving space is hermetically closed to the
      outside despite the head being arranged outside. In particular,
      there are no regions, via which an air exchange between the body
      receiving space and the environment is possible, wherein this
      would compromise the insulation effect. Despite this, the user has
      a certain freedom of movement, since the flexible, and, as the
      case may, be elastically designed, sheet-like sealing element of
      the closure unit permits a rotation of be body between a belly
      position, back position and side position, as well as a
      displacement of the body along its longitudinal axis.<br>
      <br>
      Since the head is preferably arranged in a tunnel-like receiving
      section, although being arranged outside the body receiving space,
      this despite this is minimally protected from weather influences.
      For the supplementary protection of the head e.g. from wind,
      downpour, but also from the incidence of light, the receiving
      section can be shielded to the outside via an awning. The user can
      additionally or alternatively use the body receiving space for
      depositing his personal belongings, such as clothes, provisions
      and valuables, since the self-supporting basis unit forms a
      permanent body receiving space. The belongings are particularly
      secure from theft during sleep, since these are hermetically
      shielded to the outside in the body receiving space. The awning in
      front of the outer-lying receiving section, apart from an
      additional weather protection, viewing protection and light
      protection, also provides a protective space for personal
      belongings. As can be deduced from the embodiments mentioned
      above, the bivouac shelter thus simultaneously has the function of
      a sleeping bag with an integrated, air-filled mattress as well as
      the function of a bivouac and material store.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter according to the invention is moreover
      assemblable in a rapid and simple manner, i.e. without particular
      prior knowledge, as well as without any tools. Only an air pump or
      compressed air cartridges for inflating the individual elements
      are to be recommended as the case may be. The bivouac shelter
      provides protection for at least one person as well as for
      personal objects. The access can be designed in a kneeling or
      crawling manner. The height of the body receiving space can be
      dimensioned such that a person can sit therein, which is an
      increase in comfort, in particular for summer operation when the
      closure unit is not envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter can be applied for the initially mentioned
      application purposes. The bivouac shelter according to the
      invention can also serve as an emergency shelter for homeless
      people. Since the bivouac shelter is simple to handle, easily and
      compactly transportable and storable as well as inexpensive, this
      is also particularly suitable also for the application in troubled
      regions by charity organisations or for the homeless in urban
      areas. Moreover, the bivouac shelter is also suitable preferably
      for outdoor activities, in particular for ski tours, mountain
      climbers, hunters, wilderness adventurers, expeditions, for
      travels with a vehicle, for rescue deployment or for the military.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter is multifunctional from a varied point of
      view. Thus e.g. it is suitable for sleeping, for warming up, as a
      provisional accommodation with privacy, as well as for the storage
      and for the protection of personal belongings. Moreover, the
      bivouac shelter is suitable for all seasons, by way of the amount
      of thermal insulation being able to be adapted to the prevailing
      outer temperatures by way of removing or adding closure elements.
      Moreover, shoulder straps can be provided on the basis unit,
      wherein a type of rucksack can which can be carried by way of the
      shoulder straps can be formed by way of folding up the basis unit
      in accordance with instructions.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the bivouac shelter according to the invention is preferably
      constructed in a modular manner. Such a modular bivouac shelter as
      has been previously described in detail comprises a basis unit
      forming a body receiving space as well as an open receiving
      section.<br>
      <br>
      The body receiving space and the open receiving section of the
      basis unit are coherent, so that the bivouac shelter can be used
      as an open camp.<br>
      <br>
      The modular bivouac shelter further comprises a closure unit which
      is connectable to the basis unit and spatially delimits the body
      receiving space from the open receiving section, so that the
      bivouac shelter can be used as sleeping envelope.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the bivouac shelter preferably also comprises a tent
      unit which in the assembled condition spans the open receiving
      section of the basis unit, so that the bivouac shelter can be used
      as a tent.<br>
      <br>
      The features of the bivouac shelter described in detail in the
      description and its embodiment variants are likewise valid with
      regard to the claim of a modular bivouac shelter.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter with a load is even capable of floating and
      can therefore be used as a type of raft or for crossing waters,
      thanks to the multi-walled design of the basis unit with air
      chambers lying therebetween.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The bivouac shelter 1 according to the invention which is shown in
      FIGS. 1, 2 and 3a, 3b as an embodiment example comprises a basis
      unit 2 which forms a tunnel-like body receiving space 7. The basis
      unit 2 is thus designed in a tubular or tunnel-like manner. The
      basis unit 2 is designed in a double-walled manner of the complete
      periphery, with an outer-lying first wall 27 and an inner-lying
      second wall 28. Inflatable hollow chambers are arranged between
      the two walls 27, 28. As soon as the hollow chambers of the basis
      unit 2 are filled with air, these assume a self-supporting shape
      amid the formation of the mentioned body receiving space. It is of
      course self-evident that the shown basis unit 2 can generally be
      designed in a multi-walled manner with hollow chambers arranged in
      an infinitely suitable manner. A ground part 29 which is likewise
      designed in an at least double-walled manner with inflatable
      hollow chambers lying therebetween is integrated into the basis
      unit. The ground part 29 simultaneously serves as a mattress. The
      basis unit 2 lies with its ground part 29 lies on a ground
      underlay 10, for the protection from sharp objects. The ground
      underlay as a protection from damage can generally also be
      integrated into the ground part of the basis unit, or the ground
      part can be designed in a suitably reinforced manner towards the
      ground on its resting side.<br>
      <br>
      The body receiving space 7 in the operational position forms a
      foot region 23 which is closed to the outside by way of a
      terminating element 30. The terminating element 30 is connected to
      the basis unit 2 in a thermally insulating and preferably airtight
      and/or watertight manner. The terminating element 30 is likewise
      designed in at least double-walled manner with inflatable hollow
      chambers lying therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      A first awning 11 is fastened on the head-side end of the basis
      unit 2. A second awning 12 is fastened on the foot-side end of the
      basis unit 2. Both awnings 11, 12 are stentered via anchoring
      means such as tent pegs which are admitted in the ground. The
      first awning 11 in particular serves for the protection of an open
      receiving section 25 from wind, the incidence of light, rainfall,
      and as a viewing protection together with the basis unit 2 ensures
      a minimum of privacy. Both awnings 11, 12 further serve as storage
      space for personal belongings and provide a minimal of protection
      from the influences of the weather for these articles or also an
      animal such as a dog or cat.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit is additionally secured against dislocation via guy
      means 14a, 14b such as ropes or cables which are attached on the
      basis unit 2 via fastening loops 15, 16. The additional fastening
      serves for securing the bivouac shelter against strong winds, in
      particular when this is not being used and is therefore not
      weighed down by the weight of a person. The basis unit 2 can also
      be anchored on the ground (not shown) via anchoring elements. The
      guy means 14a, 14b, 15, 16 as well as the awnings 11, 12 as well
      as the anchoring elements 13 with the associated fastening means
      on the basis unit 2 are however optional features.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter 1 does not lie directly on the ground. In
      contrast it is arranged on a ground underlay 10. The ground
      underlay 10 serves as a protection from damage to the basis unit 2
      by sharp objects as well as for preventing the bivouac shelter 1
      from getting dirty. The ground underlay 10 is also to repel
      moisture.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 2, the terminating element 30 as well as the
      connection body 4 comprise valves, in particular check valves for
      inflating the mentioned parts (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      According to the representation in FIG. 1, the body receiving
      space 7 of the basis unit 2 is closed off to the outside in a
      thermally insulating and airtight manner by way of a closure unit
      3. The closure unit 3 for this is introduced transversely to the
      longitudinal direction L of the basis unit 2 and transversely to
      the connection and access opening 26, 27 in the direction of the
      body receiving space and closes the latter. The closure unit 3 is
      moreover arranged displaced towards the foot region 23 in the
      longitudinal direction L, so that an open, tunnel-like receiving
      section 25 which receives the head 19 of the user is formed.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit 3 comprises a connection body 4 which is designed
      in an annular manner and via which this closure unit with the
      basis unit 2 assumes the thermally insulating and, as the case may
      be, watertight and/or airtight connection. The connection body 4
      is inflatable into a bead-like, self-supporting element and
      accordingly comprises one or more inflatable hollow chambers (not
      shown). The shape and size of the connection body 4 is usefully
      adapted to the inner cross-sectional contour of the tunnel-like
      access opening at the connection location.<br>
      <br>
      A flexible, sheet-like sealing element 6 spans the opening
      outlined by the annular connection body 4 and is connected to the
      connection body 4 in an airtight manner. A hood 5 is integrated
      into the sheet-like sealing element. The hood 5 is designed as a
      balaclava which bears snugly on the head 19 and which completely
      covers the head 19 with the exception of the facial region,
      including the neck portion and in this manner keeps it optimally
      warm.<br>
      <br>
      The sealing element 6 and the hood 5 preferably consist of the
      same rubber-elastically stretchable material. The sealing element
      6 separates off the body receiving space 7 from the surroundings
      in an airtight manner, in the manner of a flexible, elastically
      stretchable membrane. The head region is also closed to the body
      receiving space 7 in an airtight manner since the hood integrated
      into the sealing element 6 is likewise designed with elastically
      stretchable characteristics, for a snug bearing on the head and as
      the case may be, the neck portion. This being the case despite the
      face positioned outside the body receiving space 7 being
      uncovered. The sealing element 6 in the present embodiment
      comprises a hand opening 21 which can be closed in a water-tight
      or airtight manner and through which the user can engage with the
      hand for the purpose of carrying out task such as eating or
      drinking. The hand opening 21 here can be closed e.g. by way of a
      zip closure.<br>
      <br>
      A head underlay 20, e.g. a cushion, additionally supports the head
      10 in the correct position. The head underlay 20 can be designed
      as a separate element or can be integrated into the ground part 29
      of the basis unit 2 at a suitable location. The head underlay 20
      preferably likewise contains one or more inflatable hollow
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      For setting up the bivouac shelter 2 and for creating the
      operating position, the basis unit 2, the terminating element 30
      and the connection body 4 are inflated until the envisaged
      pressure is achieved in the air chambers. Subsequently, the
      terminating element 30 is assembled into the basis unit. For
      assuming the lying position for the purpose of sleeping or keeping
      the body warm, the person 18 concerned with his feet in front
      slips through the access opening 17, also called entry opening,
      into the body receiving space extending in the longitudinal
      direction. For the closure of the body receiving space 7 the
      person 18 grips the previously arranged closure unit 3 at the
      grips 8a . . . d with both hands and pulls the closure unit 3 over
      his head 19, so that the head comes to lie in the hood 5.
      Simultaneously or subsequently, the person 18 via the connection
      body 4 fixes the closure unit 3 in a connection section (not
      shown) provided especially for this, in the access opening 17. Of
      course, the person 18 can also insert the head 19 into the hood 5
      not until after the fixation of the closure unit 3 in the
      envisaged position. Tightening means 9 are provided for this, via
      which the user 18 can pull the hood 5 over the head 19. The user
      18 can optionally tighten the hood via the tightening means 9 or
      via a separate pull cord, on the chin.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, optionally a flexible tube with a check valve can be
      integrated into the closure unit 3 and in particular into the
      sealing element 6, via which tube the exhaled air heated by the
      body can be blown into the body receiving space 17 for the purpose
      of a quicker heating. The valve can be equipped with a filter unit
      for separating air moisture.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter 1' according to FIG. 1, as can be used in
      summer operation, which is to say at mild temperatures and
      friendly weather, is shown in FIG. 2. The terminating element 30
      is separated from the basis unit 2, so that a foot-side opening 22
      is released in the foot region 23. Moreover, the closure unit 3 is
      also removed, so that the access opening 17 is also open and the
      person 18 lies in an extended receiving space which apart from the
      body receiving space 17 also includes the receiving section 25.
      The extended receiving space which is open at both ends is well
      ventilated in this manner.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of a bivouac shelter 51 according to FIG. 4
      provides space for two persons. The bivouac shelter 51 likewise
      has a tunnel-like or tubular basis unit 52 of the described type,
      which forms a body receiving space 7 for two persons 18, 18'. The
      bivouac shelter 51 comprises two connection openings and access
      openings 66a, 66b, 57a, 57b which lie opposite one another and
      which are closable via suitable closure units 53a, 53b of the
      described type. The closure units 53a, 53b are likewise arranged
      in a manner displaced towards the oppositely lying access opening
      57a, 57b in the longitudinal direction L, so that in each case an
      open, tunnel-like receiving section 55a, 55b which receives the
      head of the person 18, 18? is formed.<br>
      <br>
      The persons 18, 18' are then arranged next to one another, but
      lying opposite one another in an alternating manner. Of course the
      bivouac shelter 52 can also be designed for more than two persons
      arranged next to one another in an alternate manner. Disregarding
      the modification or extension described above, the bivouac shelter
      51 is provided with functionally equal elements as the bivouac
      shelter 1 according to FIG. 1, so that these elements are not
      further provided with reference numerals at this location.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows the bivouac shelter 51 in summer operation which in
      contrast to the bivouac shelter for winter operation according to
      FIG. 4 amongst other things can be analogously retrofitted by way
      of removing the two closure units 53a, 53b, as with the bivouac
      shelter 1 according to FIGS. 1 and 2. Here too, a repeated
      explanation is therefore omitted at this location.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6a shows a front view of the bivouac shelter according to
      FIG. 4 (line A-A). A separate closure unit 53a, 53b is provided
      for the individual person. The FIG. 6b shows a cross section
      through the bivouac shelter according to FIG. 4 along the line
      B-B. The body receiving space 7 is designed such that two to four
      persons 18, 18' have enough space thereon. If e.g. a 4-some
      bivouac shelter is only used by 3 persons (or even less), then the
      non-used hood can be thermally optimally sealed by an inflatable
      balloon.<br>
      <br>
      A further embodiment of a bivouac shelter 81 for several persons
      is represented in FIG. 7. The bivouac shelter 81 in a plan view is
      designed in the shape of an open ring. The sector shaped recess 89
      forms the common entry region E which leads into an inner circle
      90 which is open at the top. The inner circle 90 forms a common,
      annular receiving section 85 which is open to the circle centre.
      This can also be divided up into individual sectors by way of e.g.
      radially arranged separation elements (not shown). The body
      receiving space 87a . . . c is designed in each case as a ring
      segment. The closure units 83a . . . c with the hoods which close
      the connection openings and access openings, are set back radially
      in the direction of the foot region, so that a channel-like
      receiving section 85 is formed with a channel opening directed to
      the middle point. The receiving section 85 is thus shielded to the
      top and to the bottom by the roof part and the ground part of the
      basis element 82 respectively. The persons 18, 18', 18? are
      arranged with the head to the inner circle 90 and with the feet
      radially outwards. The bivouac shelter 81 or at least the open
      inner circle 90 can be spanned with a tent roof (not shown). The
      closure units 83a . . . c as well as the basis unit 82 and any
      terminating elements (not shown), with regard to functioning are
      designed in an analogous manner to the corresponding elements of
      the other embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      The bivouac shelter 101, 201, 251 represented in the FIGS. 8a-8c
      as well as 9a-9c comprises a basis unit 102, 202, 252 which forms
      a tunnel-like receiving space 107, 207. The basis unit 102, 202,
      252 is likewise designed in a tubular or tunnel-like manner. The
      basis unit 102, 202, 252 is designed in a multi-walled, in
      particular double-walled manner over the whole periphery, with an
      outer-lying first wall and an inner-lying second wall. Hollow
      chambers fillable with air are arranged between the two walls. As
      soon as the hollow chambers of the basis unit 102, 202, 252 are
      filled with air, these assume a self-supporting, intrinsically
      stable shape amid the formation of the mentioned body receiving
      space 107, 207, 257. The shown basis unit 102, 202, 252 can have
      different, suitably designed hollow chambers.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 102, 202, 252 moreover at the end of the
      tunnel-like or tubular receiving space 107, 207 which lies
      opposite the foot-side region forms a connection opening 126, 226,
      276, onto which a closure unit 103, 203, 253 is integrally or
      releasably attached.<br>
      <br>
      A ground part 129, 229, 279 which is likewise designed in a
      multi-walled, in particular double-walled manner, with
      air-fillable hollow chambers lying therebetween is also integrated
      into the basis unit. The ground part 129, 229, 279 simultaneously
      serves as a mattress.<br>
      <br>
      The body receiving space 107, 207, 257 forms a foot region 123,
      223, 273 in the operating position. Moreover, an awning 112, 212
      can be fastened at the foot-side end of the basis unit 102, 202.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 102, 202, 252 is secured on the ground preferably
      via suitable securing means as are already described in the
      context of the embodiment examples according to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 102, 202, 252 moreover comprises one or more
      valves, in particular check valves, for filling the mentioned
      chambers (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      According to the embodiment according to FIGS. 8a-8c, in the
      region of the receiving section 125, the upper part of the basis
      unit 102 is set back in the direction of the foot region 123 with
      respect to the ground part 129, in a manner such that the user 18
      with the pulled-over closure unit 103 designed as a connection
      element 106, as described further below, can assume an uprightly
      seated position, wherein the legs are accommodated in the
      tunnel-like receiving space 107.<br>
      <br>
      The connection opening 126 which simultaneously is the access
      opening 117 is accordingly arranged in the set-back end region of
      the tunnel-like body receiving space 107. The upper body thus lies
      out in the open (see FIG. 8a). The user can therefore also sit
      freely on the ground underlay 129 in the region of the basis unit
      102 which is open to the top, wherein for this, the closure unit
      103 which is not used can be pushed into the body receiving space
      107 (see FIG. 8c).<br>
      <br>
      The body receiving space 107 is closed off to the outside in a
      thermally insulating and airtight manner at the connection opening
      126 by way of the closure unit 126. The closure unit 103 for this
      is arranged transversely to the longitudinal direction L of the
      basis unit 102 and transversely to the access opening 117 or
      connection opening 126.<br>
      <br>
      Since the tunnel-like body receiving space 107 is only designed
      for receiving the legs or parts thereof, the closure unit 103 is
      designed as a jacket-like connection element 106 of a flexible,
      sheet-like material, and comprises arms for receiving the arms, as
      well as a hood 105 (see FIG. 8d). Suitable, flexible sheet-like
      materials are already described for the embodiment according to
      FIGS. 1 and 2 as well as in the general description part.<br>
      <br>
      The jacket-like connection element 106 can itself form a closable
      access 130, through which the user can get into the jacket-like
      closure element 106 as well as into the body receiving space 107.
      The closure of the access 130 can be a zip closure, Velcro-type
      closure, button closure or a combined closure. The access can be
      slot-like or gap-like. The ground part 129 extends up to the head
      portion of the jacket-like connection element 106. The head can be
      supported via a head underlay 120 which is separate or is
      integrated into the ground part 129.<br>
      <br>
      The jacket-like connection element 106 can be connected to the
      basis unit 102 in a fixed which is to say integral manner, or in a
      releasable manner. The releasable connection can be a zip closure,
      Velcro-type closure, button closure or a combined closure. The
      connection is accordingly designed in an annularly closed manner.
      In this case, the access into the body receiving space can be
      effected via this releasable connection. For this, the user first
      pulls over the jacket-like connection element 106, gets into the
      body receiving space 107 and fastens the jacket-like connection
      element 106 on the basis unit 102.<br>
      <br>
      The jacket-like connection element can however also be fastened on
      the basis unit in a fixed, i.e. non-releasable manner, so that the
      user gets in through an opening on the jacket-like connection
      element.<br>
      <br>
      The region of the basis unit 102 which is open to the top and to
      the side and which forms an open receiving section 125, can be
      closed via a tent construction 131a, 131b (see FIGS. 8b and 8c).
      The tent construction 131a, 131b in particular ensures a light
      protection, viewing protection and wind protection and moreover
      protects from downpours. The tent construction 131b can e.g. form
      an arched dome so that the user 18 can also still sit upright when
      they tent construction 131b is assembled (see FIG. 8c). Moreover,
      an awning 111 can yet be provided on the head side, subsequently
      to the ground part 129 (see in particular FIG. 8b).<br>
      <br>
      According to the embodiment according to FIGS. 9a 9c, the body
      receiving space 207, 257 of the basis unit 202, 252 is closed off
      to the outside in a thermally insulating and airtight manner at
      the connection opening 226, 276 by way of the closure unit 203,
      253. The closure unit 203, 253 for this is arranged transversely
      to the longitudinal direction L of the basis unit 202, 252 and
      transversely to the connection opening 226, 276 which can
      simultaneously from the access opening 217. The closure unit 203
      is moreover arranged set back towards the foot region 233, 275, so
      that a tunnel-like receiving section 225, 275 which is open at the
      face side and which receives the head of the user 18 is formed.<br>
      <br>
      The closure unit 203, 253 is designed as a flexible, sheet-like
      sealing element 206, 256 with a hood 205, 255 which spans the
      connection opening 226276. Suitable, flexible, sheet-like
      materials are already described with respect to the embodiment
      according to FIGS. 1 and 2 as well as in the general description
      part.<br>
      <br>
      The sealing element 206 can itself comprise a closable opening
      217? which e.g. serves as hand opening (see FIG. 9b). The sealing
      element 206 can furthermore be connected to the basis unit 202 in
      a fixed which is to say integral manner or via a releasable
      connection.<br>
      <br>
      Here too, the ground part 229, 279 extends up to the head portion,
      wherein the head can be supported via a e.g. integrated head
      underlay 220.<br>
      <br>
      A further awning 211 can be provided subsequently to the ground
      part 229 (see FIG. 9a) at the head side. The head-side and
      foot-side awnings 111, 112, 211, 212 according to the embodiment
      examples according to FIGS. 8a-9a can moreover be provided for the
      purposes already mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      Variants of the access openings 217, 217', 217?, 217'? are now
      represented in FIG. 9b and these are shown by way of example and
      by way of the same basis unit 202.<br>
      <br>
      If the sealing element 206 is connected to the basis unit 202 in a
      releasable manner, then this releasable connection can also form
      the access opening 217?. For this, the user firstly gets into the
      body receiving space 207 and subsequently fastens the sealing
      element 206 on the basis unit 102.<br>
      <br>
      If the sealing element 206 has itself a closable opening, then
      this can not only be designed as a hand opening, but as an access
      opening 217'?.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, an access flap 230 can be provided on the basis unit 202
      itself and can be separated at least partly from the remaining
      basis unit 202 via a releasable connection, amid the formation of
      an access opening 217. The basis unit 202 however as an access
      opening 217' can however also only have a releasable connection
      which releases an opening slot or opening gap in the opened
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      The releasable closures which are mentioned above can be zip
      closures, Velcro-type closures, button closures or combined
      closures.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9c shows a further variant of an access opening 267 on a
      basis unit 252 of a bivouac shelter 251. The bivouac shelter 251
      with the exception of the mentioned access opening 267 is designed
      analogously to the embodiment according to FIGS. 9a, 9b.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 252 comprises a shell-like, removable basis upper
      part 280. The basis upper part 280 can be lifted from the
      remaining basis unit 252 in manner departing from the head region
      towards the foot region, via the direction shown by the arrows.
      The user can get into the body receiving space 257 and climb out
      of this again via an upper access opening 267 which becomes free
      and which lies opposite the ground part 279, by way of removing
      the basis upper part 280. The basis upper part 280 can be
      connected with a positive fit to the remaining basis unit 252 via
      a type of tongue-and-groove connection and be locked on this unit
      by way of additional fastening means (e.g. clip-lock). The basis
      upper part 280 can be completely separated from the remaining
      basis unit or be connected to this via a hinge connection.<br>
      <br>
      The hollow chambers of the multi-walled basis unit 102, 202 are
      filled with air for setting up the bivouac shelter 101, 201, 251
      and for creating the operating position, wherein the multi-wall
      structure swells up and ensures its intrinsic stability.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10a shows a cross-sectional view through one possible
      embodiment of a basis unit 302, 402 of a bivouac shelter 301, 401
      according to the invention, as can be applied for example in the
      embodiment variants according to the FIGS. 1 to 9.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit 302, 402 comprises an inner (insulating) body 305,
      405 as well as an outer (insulating) body 304, 404. The inner
      insulating body 304, 305 forming a tunnel-like or tubular body
      receiving space 307, 407 can be inserted into the outer insulating
      body 304, 404. The outer insulating body 304, 404 in any case
      bears on the inner insulating body 305, 405 and envelops this at
      least partly and preferably completely. Air filled hollow chambers
      303, 403 which are closed or connected to one another are arranged
      between the two insulating bodies 304, 404; 305, 405. These have a
      further insulation effect. The inner insulation body 305, 405 for
      this has a corrugated outer contour. The mentioned outer contour
      can also be zigzag-shaped or square-wave shaped. The two
      insulation bodies 305, 405 moreover form a ground part 329, 429.<br>
      <br>
      Both insulation bodies 304, 404; 305, 405 are designed in a
      multi-walled manner with one or more air-filled hollow chambers
      308, 408; 310, 410 which lie therebetween. The insulation bodies
      304, 404; 305, 405 comprise valves 306, 406, with which the hollow
      chambers 308, 408; 310, 410 can be filled with air.<br>
      <br>
      The FIGS. 10b and 10c in each case show an enlarged detail of a
      corner region of the basis unit 302, 402 according to FIG. 10a.
      Whereas the outer contour is essentially the same, FIGS. 10b and
      10c describe two different embodiment variants with regard to the
      inner structure of the insulating bodies 304, 404; 305, 405.<br>
      <br>
      According to the embodiment variant according to FIG. 10b, the two
      insulating bodies 304, 305 comprise two outer outside walls which
      are distanced to one another, as well as a self-expanding inner
      structure with at least one hollow chamber which with a pressure
      relief expands e.g. elastically into an operating position and
      sucks air through the valve 306 by way of this. The filling of the
      hollow chamber with air is thus effected without any active
      feeding of air. This principle is known from self-inflatable air
      mattresses. The inner structure here is of an elastically
      deformable foam. The hollow chambers are formed by way of the open
      pores of the foam.<br>
      <br>
      According to the embodiment according to FIG. 10c, the two
      insulation bodies 404, 405 comprise two outer outside walls which
      are distanced to one another. The outside walls are connected to
      one another via flexible connection webs or chamber walls 409, 411
      which lie therebetween. These form one or more open or closed
      hollow chambers 408 which are fillable with air via valves 406.
      The insulation bodies 404, 405 according to this embodiment must
      here be actively inflated, e.g. by way of a pump.<br>
      <br>
      The shape retention here is effected essentially via the air
      volume enclosed in the hollow chambers. The air according to this
      embodiment variant specifically preferably has an excess pressure
      compared to the ambient pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The basis unit can moreover comprise a reflecting coating which
      reflects the body heat into the body receiving space, on the inner
      side to the body receiving space.<br>

      system (1) contains a lying side (2), which forms a lying surface,
      and a support side (3). The at least one leveling chamber (4) that
      can be filled with air is part of a leveling device (4) or forms
      part of a leveling device and can be filled with air in such a way
      that the lying system (1) has locally different heights outside of
      the usage position. Thus, the support side (3) can be at least
      partially adapted to the inclination and/or the unevenness of the
      ground, such that the lying surface is more even and/or less
      inclined than the ground in the usage position.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of outdoor equipment.<br>
      It relates to a reclining system and a compensation device for a
      deck system for use on an uneven floor.<br>
      The system includes a sun deck and a side, the deck side opposite
      bearing side.<br>
      The contact page is provided for supporting the deck system on an
      uneven floor.<br>
      The prior Teclinik a variety of mats are known which contain
      air-filled chambers. As a damping and insulating the floor, and to
      compensate for small bumps on the ground as such<br>
      B. caused by smaller stones, serve.<br>
      Small irregularities in the use position generate dents on the
      contact side of the mat for lying.<br>
      The indentations are generated by the print run.<br>
      They are possible because the wall of the sleeping pad is flexible
      and the air in the chambers can yield and avoid the pressure.<br>
      The indentations mentioned arise, however, only if the hammock in
      the use position and the ground rests, and when a contact
      pressure, eg.<br>
      As generated by a lying person.<br>
      However, such a sleeping pad can compensate only very small bumps.<br>
      Bigger unevenness in the form of wells, rocks or hills penetrate
      through to the lying surface and reduce the sleeping comfort
      considerably.<br>
      The same is true also when the ground is inclined.<br>
      In conventional mats has also the lying surface to a corresponding
      inclination.<br>
      However, an inclined lying area leads to a slippage of the person
      lying on the bed.<br>
      It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a system and
      a deck Ausgleichsein- direction of the aforementioned kind to
      create that or what a high sleeping comfort guarantees even with
      larger uneven ground or floor inclinations.<br>
      The object is solved by the features of independent claims 1 and
      14.<br>
      Further developments and special embodiments of the invention will
      become apparent from the dependent claims, the description and the
      drawings.<br>
      The erfmdungsgemÃ¤sse deck system is now distinguished from that it
      comprises a compensation device with at least one compensation
      chamber, said at least one compensation chamber is so filled with
      air that the sun system beyond the use position to Aufiageseite
      may have towards locally adjustable different heights.<br>
      The at least one equalizing chamber is optionally filled in
