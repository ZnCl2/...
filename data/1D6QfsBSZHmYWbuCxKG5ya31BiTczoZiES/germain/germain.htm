        <p>It is in the retreat of criminals in the dungeons of the
          Inquisition that your friend writes these lines which are to
          serve for your instruction. At the thought of the inestimable
          advantages which this document of friendship will procure for
          you, the horrors of a long and little deserved captivity seem
          to be mitigated… It gives me pleasure to think that while
          surrounded by guards and encumbered by chains, a slave may
          still be able to raise his friend above the mighty, the
          monarchs who rule this place of exile. </p>
        <p>My dear Philochatus, you are about to penetrate into the
          sanctuary of the sublime sciences; my hand is about to raise
          for you the impenetrable veil which hides from the eyes of
          common men the tabernacle, the sanctuary wherein the Eternal
          has lodged the secrets of nature, kept for a few that are
          privileged, the few Elect whom His omnipotence created that
          they may SEE, and seeing may soar after Him in the vast
          expanse of His Glory and deflect upon mankind one of the Rays
          that shine round about His golden Throne. </p>
        <p>If your friend’s example proves a salutary lesson for you, I
          shall bless the long years of tribulation which the wicked
          have made me suffer. </p>
        <p>Two stumbling blocks equally dangerous will constantly
          present themselves to you. One of them would outrage the
          sacred rights of every individual. It is Misuse of the power
          which God will have entrusted to you; the other, which would
          bring ruin upon you, is Indiscretion… Both are born of the
          same mother, both owe their existence to pride. Human frailty
          nourishes them; they are blind; their mother leads them. With
          her aid these two Monsters carry their foul breath even into
          the hearts of the Lord’s Elect. Woe unto him who misuses the
          gifts of heaven in order to serve his passions. The Almighty
          Hand that made the elements subject to him, would break him
          like a fragile reed. An eternity of torments could hardly
          expiate his crime. The Infernal Spirits would smile with
          contempt at the tears of one whose menacing voice had so often
          made them tremble in the bosom of their fiery depths. </p>
        <p>It is not for you, Philocratus, that I sketch this dreadful
          picture. The friend of humanity will never become its
          persecutor… The precipice, my son, which I fear for you, is
          Indiscretion, the imperious craving to inspire astonishment
          and admiration. God leaves men the task of punishing the
          imprudent minister who permits the eye of the profane to look
          into the mysterious sanctuary. Oh Philocratus, may my sorrows
          be ever present in your mind. I, too have known happiness, was
          showered with the blessings of heaven ad surrounded by power
          such as the human mind cannot conceive. Commanding the genii
          that guide the world, happy in the happiness that I created, I
          enjoyed within the bosom of an adored family the felicity
          which the Eternal accords to His beloved children. One moment
          destroyed everything. I spoke, and it all vanished like a
          cloud. O my son follow not in my steps… Let no vain desire to
          shine before men brig you, too, to disaster… Think of me, your
          friend, writing to you from this dungeon, my body broken by
          torture! Remember, Philochatus, that the hand which traces
          these characters bears the marks of the chains which weight it
          down. God has punished me, but what have I done to the cruel
          men that persecute me? What right have they to interrogate the
          minister of the Eternal? They ask me what are the proofs of my
          mission. My witnesses are prodigies, and my virtues are my
          defenders --- a clean life, a pure heart. But what am I
          saying? Have I still the right to complain? I spoke, and the
          Lord delivered me, deprived of strength and power, to the
          furies of greedy fanaticism. The arm which once could
          overthrow an army can today hardly lift the chains that weight
          it down. </p>
        <p>I wander. I should give thanks to eternal Justice… The
          avenging God has pardoned His repentant child.&nbsp; An aerial
          spirit has entered through the walls which separate me from
          the world; he has shown himself to me resplendent with light
          and has determined the duration of my captivity. Within two
          years my sufferings will end, My torturers upon entering my
          cell will find it empty and, soon purified by the four
          elements, pure as the genius of fire, I shall resume the
          glorious station to which Divine goodness has raised me. But
          how distant as yet is this time! How long two years seem to
          one who spends them in suffering and humiliation. Not content
          with making me undergo the most horrible agony, my oppressors,
          to torture me further have devised still surer, still more
          revolting means. They have brought infamy on my head, have
          made my name a thing of disgrace. The children of men recoil
          in terror when by chance they approach the walls of my prison;
          they fear lest some deadly vapour escape through the narrow
          slit that reluctantly admits a ray of light to my cell. That,
          O Philocratus, is the cruelest of all blows that they could
          bear down upon me. </p>
        <p>I know not whether I shall be able to get this document into
          your hands… I judge the difficulty I shall have in contriving
          for it a way out of this place of torture by those I have had
          in order to write it. Deprived of all help, I myself have
          composed the agents I needed. The flame of my lamp, some
          coins, and a few chemical substances overlooked by the
          scrutinizing eyes of my tormentors have yielded the colors
          which adorn this fruit of a prisoner’s leisure. </p>
        <p>Profit by the instructions of you unhappy friend! They are so
          clear that danger exists for them to fall into hands other
          than yours… Remember only that all of it is to serve you… an
          obscure line, an omitted character would prevent your lifting
          the veil which the hand of the Creator has placed over the
          Sphinx. </p>
        <p>Adieu, Philochatus! Do not mourn me. The clemency of the
          Eternal equals his justice. At the first mysterious assembly
          you will see your friend again. I salute you in the name of
          God. Soon I shall give the kiss of peace to by brother. </p>

        <p>It was night. The moon, veiled by dark clouds, cast but an
          uncertain light on the crags of lava that hemmed in the
          Solfatara. My head covered with the linen veil, holding in my
          hands the golden bough, I advanced without fear toward the
          spot where I had been ordered to pass the night. I was groping
          over hot sand which I felt give way under my every step. The
          clouds gathered overhead. Lightning flashed through the night
          and gave to the flames of the volcano a bloodlike appearance.
          At last I arrived and found an iron altar where I placed the
          mysterious bough… I pronounce the formidable words… instantly
          the earth trembles under my feet, thunder peals… Vesuvius
          roars in answer to the repeated strokes; its fires join the
          fires of lightning… The choirs of the genii rise into the air
          and make the echoes repeat the praises of the Creator… The
          hallowed bough which I had placed on the triangular altar
          suddenly is ablaze. A thick smoke envelops me. I cease to see.
          Wrapped in darkness. I seemed to descend into an abyss. I know
          not how long I remained in that situation. When I opened my
          eyes I vainly looked for the objects which had surrounded me a
          little time ago. The altar, Vesuvius, the country round Naples
          had vanished from my sight. I was in a cast cavern, alone, far
          away from the whole world… near by me lay a long, white robe;
          its loosely woven tissue seemed to me to be of linen. On a
          granite boulder stood a copper lamp upon a black table covered
          with Greek words indicating the way I was to follow. I took
          the lamp, and after having put on the robe I entered a narrow
          passage the walls of which were covered with black marble… It
          was three miles long and my steps resounded fearfully under
          its silent vault. At last I found a door that opened on a
          flight of steps which I descended. After having walked a long
          time I seemed to see a wandering light before me. I hid my
          lamp and fixed my eyes on the object which I beheld. It
          dissipated, vanishing like a shadow. </p>
        <p>Without the reproach of the past, without fear of the future,
          I went on. The way became increasingly difficult… always
          confined within galleries composed of black stone blocks… I
          did not dare to guess at the length of my underground travel.
          At last, after a long, long march I came to a square chamber.
          A door in the middle of each of its four sides opened; they
          were of different colors, and each door was placed at one of
          the four cardinal points. I entered through the north door
          which was black; the opposite was red; the door to the east
          was blue and the one facing it was of dazzling white… In the
          middle of this camber was a square mass; on its center shone a
          crystal star. On the north side was a painting representing a
          woman naked to the waist; a black drapery fell over her knees
          and two silver bands adorned her garment. In her hand was a
          rod which she placed against the forehead of a man facing her
          across a table which stood on a single support and bore a cup
          and a lance-head. A sudden flame rose from the ground and
          seemed to turn toward the man. An inscription explained this
          picture; another indicated the means I was to employ in order
          to leave this chamber. </p>
        <p>After having contemplated the picture and the star I was
          about to pass through the red door when, turning on its hinges
          with terrific noise, it closed before me. I made the same
          attempt with the door of sky-blue color; it did not close but
          a sudden noise induced me to turn my head. I saw the star
          flicker, rise from its place, revolve, then dart rapidly
          through the opening of the white door. I followed it at once.

        <p>A strong wind arose and I had difficulty in keeping my lamp
          alight. At last I saw a white marble platform to which I
          mounted by nine steps. Arrived at the last one I beheld a vast
          expanse of water. To my right I heard the impetuous tumbling
          of torrents; to my left a cold rain mixed with masses of ail
          fell near me. I was contemplating this majestic scene when the
          star which had guided me to the platform and which was slowly
          swinging overhead, plunged into the gulf. Believing that I was
          reading the commands of the Most High, I threw myself into the
          midst of the waves. An invisible hand seized my lamp and
          placed it on the crown of my head. I breasted the foamy wave
          and struggle to reach the side opposite the one which I had
          left. At last I saw on the horizon a feeble gleam and hastened
          forward. Perspiration streamed down my face and I exhausted
          myself in vain efforts. The shore which I could scarcely
          discern seemed to recede to the degree I advanced. My strength
          was ebbing. I feared not to die, but to die without
          illumination… I lost courage, and lifting to the vault my
          tear-streaming ayes I cried out: ‘Judica Judicium meum et
          redime me, propter eloquium tuum vivifica me’ (Judge thou my
          judgment and redeem me, by thy eloquence make me live). I
          could hardly move my tired limbs and was sinking more and more
          when near me I saw a boat. A richly dressed man guided it. I
          noticed that the prow was turned toward the shore which I had
          left. He drew near. A golden crown shone on his forehead.
          ‘Vade me cum’, said he, ‘mecum principium in terries, intruam
          te in via hac qua gradueris’ (Come with me, with me, the
          foremost in the world; I will show thee the way thou must
          follow). I instantly answered him: ‘Bonum est sperare in
          Domino quam considere in princibus’ (It is better to trust in
          the Lord than to sit among the mighty). Whereupon the boat
          sank and the monarch with it. Fresh energy coursed through my
          veins and I gained the goal of my efforts. I found myself on a
          shore covered with green sand. A silver wall was before me
          inlaid with two panels of red marble. Approaching I noticed on
          one of them a sacred script, the other being engraved with a
          line of Greek letters; between the two plates was an iron
          circle. Two lions, one red and the other black, rested on
          clouds and appeared to guard a golden crown above them. Also
          near the circle were to be seen a bow and two arrows. I read
          several characters written on the flanks of one of the lions.
          I had barely observed these different emblems when they
          vanished together with the wall which contained them. </p>

        <p>In its place a lake of fire presented itself to my sight.
          Sulphur and bitumen rolled in flaming waves. I trembled. A
          loud voice commanded me to pass through the flames. I obeyed,
          and the flames seemed to have lost their power. For a long
          time I walked within the conflagration. Arrived at a circular
          space I contemplated the gorgeous spectacle which by the grace
          of heaven it was given me to enjoy. </p>
        <p>Forty columns of fire ornamented the hall in which found
          myself. One side of the columns shone with a white and vivid
          fire, the other side seemed to be in shadow; a blackish flame
          covered it. In the center of this place stood an altar in the
          form of a serpent. A greenish gold embellished its diapered
          scales in which the surrounding flames were reflected. Its
          eyes looked like rubies. A silvery inscription was placed near
          it and a rich sword had been driven into the ground near the
          serpent, on whose head rested a cup… I heard the choir of the
          celestial spirits and a voice said to me: ‘The end of thy
          labours draws near. Take the sword and smite the serpent’. </p>
        <p>I drew the sword from its sheath and approaching the altar I
          took the cup with one hand and with the other I struck a
          terrific blow upon the neck of the serpent. The sword
          rebounded and the blow re-echoed as if I has struck on a bass
          bell. No sooner had I obeyed the voice than the altar
          disappeared and the columns vanished in boundless space. The
          sound which I had heard when striking the altar repeated
          itself as if a thousand blows had been struck at the same
          time. A hand seized me by the hair and lifted me toward the
          vault which opened to let me through. Shadowy phantoms
          appeared before me --- Hydras, Lamias and serpents surrounded
          me. The sight of the sword in my hand scattered the foul
          throng even as the first rays of light dissipate the frail
          dream-children of the night. After mounting straight upward
          through the layers that composed the walls of the globe, I saw
          again the light of day. </p>

        <p>Scarcely had I risen to the surface of the earth, when my
          unseen guide led me still more swiftly. The velocity with
          which we sped through space can be compared with naught but
          itself. In an instant I had lost sight of the plains below. I
          noticed with astonishment that I had emerged from the bowels
          of the earth far from the country about Naples. A desert and
          some triangular masses were the only objects I could see.
          Soon, in spite of the trials which I had undergone, a new
          terror assailed me. The earth seemed to me only a vague cloud.
          I had been lifted to a tremendous height. My invisible guide
          left me and I descended again. For quite a long time I rolled
          through space; already the earth spread out before my confused
          vision… I could estimate how many minutes would pass until I
          would be crushed on the rocks. But quick as thought my guide
          darts down beside me, takes hold of me, lifts me up again, and
          again lets me fall. Finally he raises me with him to an
          immeasurable distance. I saw globes revolve around me and
          earths gravitate at my feet. Suddenly the genius who bore me
          touched my eyes and I swooned. I know not how long I remained
          in this condition. When I awoke I was lying on a luxurious
          cushion; the air I breathed was saturated with the fragrance
          of flowers… A blue robe spangled with golden stars had
          replaced my linen garment. A yellow altar stood opposite me
          from which a pure flame ascended having no other substance for
          its alimentation than the altar itself. Letters in black were
          engraved at the base of the altar. A lighted torch stood
          beside it, shining like the sun; hovering above it was a bird
          with black feet, silvery body, a red head, black wings and a
          golden neck. It was in constant motion without however using
          its wings. It could only fly when in the midst of the flames.

        <p>I turned aside and noticed an immense palace the base of
          which rested on clouds. Its mass was composed of marble and
          its form was triangular. Four tiers of columns were raised one
          above the other. A golden ball topped the edifice. The first
          tier of columns was white, the second black, the third green
          and the last one a brilliant red. I intended, after having
          admired this work of immortal artists, to return to the palace
          of the altar, the bird and the torch; I desired to study them
          further. They had disappeared and with my eyes I was searching
          for them when the doors of the palace opened. A venerable old
          man came forth clad in a robe like mine, except that a golden
          sun shone on his breast. His right hand held a green branch,
          the other upheld a censer. A wooden chain was about his neck
          and a pointed tiara like that of Zoroaster covered his white
          head. He came toward me, a benevolent smile on his lips.
          ‘Adore God’, he said to me in Persian. ‘It is He who sustained
          thee in thy trials; His spirit was with thee. My son, thou
          hast let slip the opportunity. Thou couldst have seized
          instantly the bird, </p>

          all present thee to my brothers’. He took me by the hand and
          led me into a vast hall. </p>
        <p>The eyes of the vulgar cannot conceive the form and richness
          of the ornaments which embellished it. Three hundred and sixty
          columns enclosed it on all sides. Suspended from a golden ring
          in the ceiling was a cross of red, white, blue and black. In
          the center of the hall was a triangular altar composed of the
          four elements; on its three points were placed the bird, the
          altar and the torch. ‘Their names are now changed’, said my

        <p>Around the altar were placed eighty-one thrones, to each of

          attired like my guide. Slowly they came near and seated
          themselves on the thrones while my guide stood beside me. An
          old man, distinguished from his brothers by a purple mantle
          the hem of which was covered with embroidered characters,
          arose, and my guide, addressing them I the sacred tongue,
          said: ‘Behold one of our children whom it is the will of God
          to make as great as his fathers’. ‘May the will of the Lord be
          done’, responded the old man, and turning to me he added: ‘My
          son, the time of thy physical trial is now ended… There remain
          long journeys for thee to undertake. Henceforth thy name shall

        <p>but it had not its brilliant hues; it was of silver. ‘It has
          the same name’, he said to me; ‘it is for thee to give it the
          same virtues’. The eighth gave me a small altar, resembling
          the altar </p>

        <p>of brilliant particles; however, it was not lighted. ‘It is
          for thee’, he added, ‘like those that have preceded it to give
          it the same virtues’. ‘Reflect on these gifts’ then said the
          chief sage. ‘They all lead equally to perfection, but none of
          them is perfect in itself. It is from their admixture that the
          divine product must come. Know also that all of them are null
          if thou employ them not in the order in which thou hast
          received them. The second, which serves for the use of the
          first, remains merely crude matter without warmth and without
          usefulness unless in its turn it is aided by that which comes
          after it. Guard carefully the gifts thou hast received and set
          out upon thy journeys after thou hast drunk from the cup of
          life’. Hereupon he handed me in a crystal cup a shining liquor
          of saffron hue; its taste was delicious and it emitted an
          exquisite aroma. I was about to hand the cup back to him after
          moistening my lips in the liquor, when the old man said:
          ‘Drink it all; it will be thy only nourishment during thy
          journeys’. I obeyed and felt a divine fire course through all
          the fibers of my body. I was stronger, braver; even my
          intellectual powers seemed doubled. </p>
        <p>I hastened to give the greeting of the wise men to the august
          assembly I was about to leave, and at my guide’s command I
          entered a long gallery on my right hand. </p>

        <p>At the entrance of this gallery stood an oval steel vessel
          which upon my approach filled with crystal-clear water,
          purified by fien white sand. The vessel rested on three brass
          feet. A black panel had engraved on it several characters on
          the side facing the door. Near thevessel was a linen veil and
          above the vessel two green marble columns supported a round
          marble plaque. One saw there, surrounded by two inscriptions,
          the figure of the sacred seal formed of a cross in four
          colours, attached to a golden crosspiece which upheld two
          other concentric circles, the larger one being black, the
          other red. To one of the columns was attached a silver ax with
          a blue handle; it is called </p>

          <p><img src="lxi.jpg" height="78" width="291"></p>
        </center>
        <p>After reading the inscriptions I went up to the vessel and
          washed, first my hands, but finished by plunging in bodily. I
          stayed there three days, and on coming out of the water I saw
          that it had lost its transparency. Its sand had become grayish
          and rust-coloured particles stirred in the fluid. I tried to
          dry myself with the linen veil but fresh drops of water kept
          taking the place of those the linen absorbed. I gave up trying
          to dry myself wit the veil and, keeping in the shade, I
          remained motionless for six whole days. At the end of this
          time the source of these waters was exhausted. I found that I
          was dry and lighter though my strength seemed to be increased.
          After walking about for a little while I returned to the
          vessel. The water which had been in it was gone. In its place
          was a reddish liquid; the sand was gray and metallic. I again
          bathed in it, being careful however to remain there only a few
          moments. When stepping out of it I noticed that I had absorbed
          part of the liquid. This time I did not try to dry myself with
          the cloth, for the liquor with which I was saturated was so
          strong and corrosive that it would have instantly destroyed
          the fabric. I found myself at the other end of the gallery
          stretched out on a bed of warm sand where I spent seven days.
          After this time I returned to the vessel. The water was as it
          had first appeared. Once more I plunged into it and after
          having washed myself carefully, came out. This time I had no
          difficulty in drying myself. Finally, after having purified
          myself according to the instructions I had received, I
          prepared to leave this gallery in which I had spent sixteen
          days. </p>

        <p>I left the gallery by a low and narrow door and entered a
          circular apartment the paneling of which was made of ash and
          sandal wood. At the further end of the apartment on a pedestal
          composed of the trunk of a vine lay a mass of white and
          shining salt. Above was a picture showing a crowned white lion
          and a cluster of grapes; both rested on a salver suspended in
          the air by the smoke of a lighted brazier. To my right and
          left two doors opened, one giving unto an arid plain. A dry
          and scorching wind blew over it continually. The other door
          opened on a lake at the extreme end of which a black marble
          façade could be seen. </p>
        <p>I approached the altar and took into my hands some of the

        <p>and rubbed my entire body with it. I impregnated myself with
          it, and after having read the hieroglyphics accompanying the
          picture I prepared to leave this hall. My first intention was
          to leave by the door opening upon the plain, but there issued
          therefrom a hot vapor and I preferred the opposite path. I had
          the freedom of choice with the condition, however, not to
          leave the once chosen… I decided to cross the lake; its waters
          were somber and sleeping.&nbsp; At a certain distance I
          clearly noticed a bridge called </p>

        <p>To reach it I would have been obliged to follow the windings
          of a shore covered with rocks, and I preferred to cross the
          lake. I entered the water which was as thick as cement. I
          noticed that it was useless for me to swim since my feet
          touched bottom everywhere. I walked in the lake for thirteen
          days. At last I came to the other shore. </p>

        <p>The earth was as dark as the water through which I had come.
          A hardly perceptible slope led me to the base of the building
          which I had seen from afar. On its long square front several
          characters were engraved like those used by the priests of
          ancient Persia. The entire building was made of rough black
          basalt; the doors, of cypress wood, opened to let me pass. A
          warm, moist wind arose suddenly and pushed me rapidly to the
          middle of the chamber at the same time closing the doors upon
          me… I was in darkness, but gradually my eyes grew accustomed
          to the meager light which reigned in this enclosure and I was
          able to discern the surrounding objects. The vaulting, the
          walls and the floor of the chamber were as black as ebony. Two
          mural painting arrested by attention; one represented a horse
          such as our poets describe as having caused the downfall of
          Troy. From its gaping flanks a human corpse protruded. The
          other image showed a man long dead. Vile insects bred by
          putrefaction swarmed over his face and devoured the substance
          which had given them birth. One of the arms of the dead man,
          stripped of its flesh, already showed the bones. A man,
          dressed I red, standing by the corpse, endeavoured to lift it.
          A star shone on his forehead; his legs were enclosed in black
          buskins. Above, between and below the picture were three black
          panels bearing silver characters. I read them and then
          occupied the time by making the rounds of the hall where I was
          to spend nine days. </p>
        <p>In a dark corner I found a pile of black earth which was fat
          and saturated with animal particles. I was about to take some
          of it when a thundering voice, like the sound of a trumpet,
          forbade me to do so, saying: ‘This earth has lain in this hall
          only eighty-seven years; when thirteen more years have
          elapsed, thou and the other children of God may use it’. The
          voice fell silent, but its last ringing sounds continued to
          vibrate a long time in that temple of silence and death. After
          remaining in it the time prescribed, I departed by the door
          opposite to the one through which I had entered. I again saw
          the light, but it was not so strong around the black hall as
          to tire my eyes habituated to darkness. </p>
        <p>I saw with surprise that in order to reach the other
          buildings I should have to cross a wider lake than the first
          one. For eighteen days I walked in the water. I recalled that
          when crossing the first lake its waters became darker and
          thicker as I advanced. The waters of this lake, on the
          contrary, became ever clearer the closer I approached the
          shore. My robe, which had in the palace become as black as the
          walls, seemed to me to be of a grayish hue; gradually it
          resumed its colors; however, it did not become entirely blue
          but was nearer to a beautiful green. </p>
        <p>After eighteen days I ascended the embankment by means of a
          white marble platform. The name of the hall is </p>

        <p>At some distance from the shore a sumptuous palace raised
          aloft its alabaster columns; its different parts were joined
          by porticos of flame color. The entire edifice was of a light
          and airy architecture. As I approached the portals, I saw that
          the front was decorated with the figure of a butterfly. The
          doors stood open… I entered. The entire palace consisted of a
          single hall… surrounded by a triple colonnade, each rank
          composed of twenty-seven alabaster columns. In the middle of
          the building stood the figure of a man issuing from a tomb;
          his hand, holding up a lance, struck the stone which
          previously confined him. His loins were girt about with a
          green garment; gold gleamed from its hem. On his breast was a
          square tablet bearing several letters. Above this figure hung
          a golden crown and the figure seemed to lift itself into the
          air in order to seize the crown. Above it was a yellow stone
          tablet bearing several emblems which I explained by means of
          the inscription I saw on the tomb and by the one I had seen on
          the breast of the man. </p>
        <p>I stayed in that hall which is called </p>

        <p>the time needful for contemplating all its aisles, and soon I
          left it with the intention of crossing a vast plain in order
          to reach a tower that I had perceived at quite some distance.

        <p>No sooner had I quited the steps of the palace when I saw
          fluttering in front of me a bird similar to </p>

        <p>this one, however, having two tings like a butterfly’s
          besides its own. A voice issuing from a cloud commanded me to
          seize and to affix it and I darted forth after it. It did not
          fly but used its wings in order to run with the greatest
          rapidity. I pursued it; it fled before me and made me cover
          the entire plain several times. I followed it without pause.
          Finally, after pursuing it for nine days, I forced it to enter
          the tower which I had seen in the distance as I was leaving </p>

        <p>The walls of this edifice were of iron. Thirty-six columns of
          the same metal supported it. The interior was of the same
          material, incrusted with shining steel. The foundations of the
          tower were so constructed as to be twice as deep in the earth
          as they were high above ground. The bird had barely entered
          this enclosure when an icy cold seemed to overcome it. In vain
          ti tried to move its number wings. It still fluttered, trying
          to flee, but so feebly that I reached it with the greatest
          ease. </p>
        <p>I seized the bird, and driving a steel nail </p>

        <p>through its wings, I affixed it to the floor of the tower
          with the aid of a hammer called </p>

        <p>Hardly had I finished when the bird acquired new strength. It
          did not move, however, but its eyes began to shine like topaz.
          I was gazing at it when my attention was attracted by a group
          in the center of the hall. It showed a handsome man in the
          prime of life. In his hand he held a staff about which two
          serpents were interlaced. The young man was striving to escape
          a larger and more powerful man who wore a girdle and a helmet
          of iron surmounted by waving red plumes. Near him a sword lay
          on a buckler covered with hieroglyphs. The armed man held in
          his hand a heavy chain with which he shackled the feet and
          body of the youth who tried in vain to flee from his terrible
          adversary. Two red tablets bore certain characters. </p>
        <p>I departed from the tower, and opening a door between two
          pillars I found myself in a vast hall. </p>

        <p>The hall into which I had just entered was perfectly round;
          it resembled the interior of a globe composed of hard and
          transparent matter, as crystal, so that the light entered from
          all sides. Its lower part rested upon a vast basin filled with
          red sand. A gentle and equable warmth reigned in this circular
          enclosure. The sages call this hall </p>

          <p><img src="lxxi-2.jpg" height="85" width="416"></p>
        </center>
        <p>With astonishment I gazed around this crystal globe when a
          new phenomenon excited my admiration. From the floor of the
          hall ascended a gentle vapor, moist and saffron yellow. It
          enveloped me, raised me gently and within thirty-six days bore
          me up to the upper part of the globe. Thereafter the vapor
          thinned; little by little I descended and finally found myself
          again on the floor. My robe had changed its colour. It had
          been green when I entered the hall, but now changed to a
          brilliant red. A contrary effect had taken place in the sand
          on which the globe rested. Gradually its red colour had been
          transformed into black. After finishing my ascent I remained
          three more days in that hall. </p>
        <p>After that time I left it in order to enter a large place
          surrounded by colonnades and guilded porticos. In the center
          of the place stood a bronze pedestal supporting a group
          representing a large strong man whose majestic head was
          covered with a crowned helmet. A blue garment protruded
          through the meshes of his golden armor. In one hand he held a
          white staff bearing certain characters, the other hand he
          extended towards a beautiful woman. His companion wore no
          garment, but a sun radiated from her breast. Her right hand
          held three globes joined by golden rings; a coronet of red
          flowers confined her beautiful hair. She sprang into the air
          and seemed to lift wit her the warrior who accompanied her;
          both were borne up by the clouds about the group. On the
          capitals of four white marble columns were set four bronze
          statues; they had wings and appeared to sound trumpets. </p>
        <p>I crossed the place, and mounting on a marble platform which
          was before me, I noticed with astonishment that I had
          re-entered the Hall of Thrones (the first in which I had found
          myself when entering the Palace of Wisdom). The triangular
          altar was still in the center of this hall but the bird, the
          altar and the torch were joined and formed a single body. Near
          them was a golden sun. The sword which I had brought from the
          hall of fire lay a few paces distant on the cushion of one of
          the thrones; I took up the sword and struck the sun, reducing
          it to dust. I then touched it and each molecule became a
          golden sun like the one I had broken. At that instant a loud
          and melodious voice exclaimed, ‘The work is perfect!’. Hearing
          this, the children of light hastened to join me, the doors of
          immortality were opened to me, and the cloud which covers the
          eyes of mortals was dissipated. I SAW and the spirits which
          preside over the elements knew me for their master. </p>
