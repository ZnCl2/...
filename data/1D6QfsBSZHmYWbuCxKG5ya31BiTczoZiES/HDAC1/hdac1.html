      </i><br>
      A new joint study from MIT and Harvard has identified an enzyme
      that could help reverse the effects of DNA damage associated with
      aging and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
      <br>
      The researchers, led by MIT's Li-Huei Tsai and Harvard's Stephen
      Haggarty, identified an enzyme called HDAC1 that can help repair
      8-oxoguanine lesions on DNA strands, which have been linked to
      age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.<br>
      <br>
      Test subjects with fewer of these lesions exhibit significantly
      improved cognitive performance, memory ability and basic spatial
      awareness.<br>
      Researchers identified an enzyme that can heal DNA lesions linked
      to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. Scans from mice with an
      abundance of HDAC1 (top row) had fewer lesions, shown as dark
      green spots, than mice with no HDAC1 (bottom row)<br>
      <br>
      'It seems that HDAC1 is really an anti-aging molecule,' Tsai told
      MIT News.<br>
      <br>
      'I think this is a very broadly applicable basic biology finding,
      because nearly all of the human neurodegenerative diseases only
      happen during aging. I would speculate that activating HDAC1 is
      beneficial in many conditions.'<br>
      <br>
      Tsai and Haggerty tested their theory on mice, by genetically
      engineering some to not produce HDAC1 and comparing them as they
      aged with a control group with normal levels of HDAC1.<br>
      <br>
      While there were no significant differences initially, over time
      the mice without the ability to produce HDAC1 developed DNA
      lesions at a faster rate than for the control and they showed
      declines in memory tests and spatial navigation.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;HDAC1 regulates the production of a separate enzyme, OGG1,
      which can repair these DNA lesions, but as HDAC1 production
      decreases with age, so does the brain's ability to heal
      itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are hopeful that a safe chemical treatment can be
      found to help stimulate the production for HDAC1 in humans to heal
      the accumulation of DNA lesions that build up with age<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are hopeful that a safe chemical treatment can be
      found to help stimulate the production for HDAC1 in humans to heal
      the accumulation of DNA lesions that build up with age<br>
      <br>
      In earlier research, Tsai and her team established that HDAC1
      production could be stimulated with the drug exifone, which had
      been commonly prescribed in the 1980s as a treatment for dementia.<br>
      <br>
      The drug had been discontinued on humans after it was shown to
      cause liver damage, but in tests on mice, Tsai showed it
      stimulated the production of HDAC1 and improved the cognitive
      ability and memory performance in mice.<br>
      <br>
      Tsai also found that the mice had a significant reduction in
      lesions after being given exifone.<br>
      <br>
      'This study really positions HDAC1 as a potential new drug target
      for age-related phenotypes, as well as
      neurodegeneration-associated pathology and phenotypes,' Tsai said.<br>
      <br>
      While the team isn't advocating for exifone to be prescribed to
      humans, the findings make them hopeful a similar but safer drug
      could be found to stimulate HDAC1 production as a treatment for
      cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.<br>

      <br>
      MIT neuroscientists have discovered that an enzyme called HDAC1 is
      critical for repairing age-related DNA damage to genes involved in
      memory and other cognitive functions. This enzyme is often
      diminished in both Alzheimer’s patients and normally aging adults.<br>
      <br>
      In a study of mice, the researchers showed that when HDAC1 is
      lost, a specific type of DNA damage builds up as the mice age.
      They also showed that they could reverse this damage and improve
      cognitive function with a drug that activates HDAC1.<br>
      <br>
      The study suggests that restoring HDAC1 could have positive
      benefits for both Alzheimer’s patients and people who suffer from
      age-related cognitive decline, the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      “It seems that HDAC1 is really an anti-aging molecule,” says
      Li-Huei Tsai, the director of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning
      and Memory and the senior author of the study. “I think this is a
      very broadly applicable basic biology finding, because nearly all
      of the human neurodegenerative diseases only happen during aging.
      I would speculate that activating HDAC1 is beneficial in many
      conditions.”<br>
      <br>
      Picower Institute research scientist Ping-Chieh Pao is the lead
      author of the study, which appears today in Nature Communications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DNA repair and aging</b><br>
      <br>
      There are several members of the HDAC family of enzymes, and their
      primary function is to modify histones — proteins around which DNA
      is spooled. These modifications control gene expression by
      blocking genes in certain stretches of DNA from being copied into
      RNA.<br>
      <br>
      In 2013, Tsai’s lab published two papers that linked HDAC1 to DNA
      repair in neurons. In the current paper, the researchers explored
      what happens when HDAC1-mediated repair fails to occur. To do
      that, they engineered mice in which they could knock out HDAC1
      specifically in neurons and another type of brain cells called
      astrocytes.<br>
      <br>
      For the first several months of the mice’s lives, there were no
      discernable differences in their DNA damage levels or behavior,
      compared to normal mice. However, as the mice aged, differences
      became more apparent. DNA damage began to accumulate in the
      HDAC1-deficient mice, and they also lost some of their ability to
      modulate synaptic plasticity — changes in the strength of the
      connections between neurons. The older mice lacking HCAC1 also
      showed impairments in tests of memory and spatial navigation.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found that HDAC1 loss led to a specific type of
      DNA damage called 8-oxo-guanine lesions, which are a signature of
      oxidative DNA damage. Studies of Alzheimer’s patients have also
      shown high levels of this type of DNA damage, which is often
      caused by accumulation of harmful metabolic byproducts. The
      brain’s ability to clear these byproducts often diminishes with
      age.<br>
      <br>
      An enzyme called OGG1 is responsible for repairing this type of
      oxidative DNA damage, and the researchers found that HDAC1 is
      needed to activate OGG1. When HDAC1 is missing, OGG1 fails to turn
      on and DNA damage goes unrepaired. Many of the genes that the
      researchers found to be most susceptible to this type of damage
      encode ion channels, which are critical for the function of
      synapses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Targeting neurodegeneration</b><br>
      <br>
      Several years ago, Tsai and Stephen Haggarty of Harvard Medical
      School, who is also an author of the new study, screened libraries
      of small molecules in search of potential drug compounds that
      activate or inhibit members of the HDAC family. In the new paper,
      Tsai and Pao used one of these drugs, called exifone, to see if
      they could reverse the age-related DNA damage they saw in mice
      lacking HDAC1.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers used exifone to treat two different mouse models
      of Alzheimer’s, as well as healthy older mice. In all cases, they
      found that the drug reduced the levels of oxidative DNA damage in
      the brain and improved the mice’s cognitive functions, including
      memory.<br>
      <br>
      Exifone was approved in the 1980s in Europe to treat dementia but
      was later taken off the market because it caused liver damage in
      some patients. Tsai says she is optimistic that other, safer
      HDAC1-activating drugs could be worth pursuing as potential
      treatments for both age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      “This study really positions HDAC1 as a potential new drug target
      for age-related phenotypes, as well as
      neurodegeneration-associated pathology and phenotypes,” she says.<br>
      <br>
      Tsai’s lab is now exploring whether DNA damage and HDAC1 also play
      a role in the formation of Tau tangles — misfolded proteins in the
      brain that are a signature of Alzheimer’s and other
      neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging, the
      National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and a
      Glenn Award for Research in Biological Mechanisms of Aging.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Changes in gene expression in the brain may underlie cognitive
      deficits inherent to normal aging and neurodegenerative disease.
      However, the mechanisms underlying pathological alterations in the
      brain transcriptome are incompletely understood. Epigenetic
      mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation have
      been shown to be important for memory processes in the adult
      brain. There is accumulating evidence that altered chromatin
      plasticity and histone acetylation are also involved in cognitive
      aging, neurodegeneration, and neuropsychiatric diseases.
      Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) exhibit neuroprotective
      and neuroregenerative properties in animal models of various brain
      diseases. As such, targeting of HDACs seems to be a promising
      therapeutic strategy. In this review, we discuss the specific
      roles of each HDAC protein and the possible function of distinct
      histone modifications. We hope that this knowledge will aid in the
      development of diagnostic tools and in designing more potent and
      specific treatment for neurological disorders targeting selective
      HDAC proteins.<br>

        Summary</b><br>
      Aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage are emerging as
      important pathological components in various neurodegenerative
      conditions. However, their underlying mechanisms are poorly
      understood. Here, we show that deregulation of histone deacetylase
      1 (HDAC1) activity by p25/Cdk5 induces aberrant cell-cycle
      activity and double-strand DNA breaks leading to neurotoxicity. In
      a transgenic model for neurodegeneration, p25/Cdk5 activity
      elicited cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that
      preceded neuronal death. Inhibition of HDAC1 activity by p25/Cdk5
      was identified as an underlying mechanism for these events, and
      HDAC1 gain of function provided potent protection against DNA
      damage and neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and an in vivo model
      for ischemia. Our findings outline a pathological signaling
      pathway illustrating the importance of maintaining HDAC1 activity
      in the adult neuron. This pathway constitutes a molecular link
      between aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage and is a
      potential target for therapeutics against diseases and conditions
      involving neuronal death.<br>

          The Potential of HDAC Inhibitors as Cognitive Enhancers</b><br>
        <b>Johannes Gräff and Li-Huei Tsai</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Histone acetylation is a prominent epigenetic modification of
      the central nervous system that is unequivocally associated with
      an increase in the rate of gene transcription. Because gene
      transcription, in turn, plays an important role in long-lasting
      forms of memory, histone acetylation generally favors long-term
      memory, whereas histone deacetylation impinges on it. Histone
      acetylation is also amenable to pharmacological
      interventions—predominantly by the use of histone deacetylase
      (HDAC) inhibitors—and has therefore spurred considerable interest
      as a putative target of cognitive enhancement. Because of the
      ubiquitous presence of histone acetylation, HDAC inhibitors have
      great potential not only to treat cognitive impairment resulting
      from neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders but also
      to serve as cognitive enhancers for the cognitively healthy. In
      this review, we summarize the state of the art of HDAC inhibitors
      as cognitive treatments or cognitive enhancers; describe a new
      model of their mode of action, epigenetic priming; and caution
      against their unsupervised usage, despite their overall great
      promise.<br>

          Interaction of FUS and HDAC1 regulates DNA damage response and

      <b>Abstract<br>
      </b>Defects in DNA repair have been extensively linked to
      neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly
      understood. We found that FUS, an RNA/DNA-binding protein that has
      been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is important for the DNA damage
      response (DDR). The function of FUS in DDR involved a direct
      interaction with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and the
      recruitment of FUS to double-stranded break sites was important
      for proper DDR signaling. Notably, FUS proteins carrying familial
      ALS mutations were defective in DDR and DNA repair and showed a
      diminished interaction with HDAC1. Moreover, we observed increased
      DNA damage in human ALS patients harboring FUS mutations. Our
      findings suggest that an impaired DDR and DNA repair may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases
      linked to FUS mutations.<br>

      pygmaea petroleum ether part, a corydalis pygmaea ethyl acetate
      part and a corydalis pygmaea aqueous extraction part in an
      arbitrary mass ratio. The preparation method comprises the
      following steps: grinding whole grass of corydalis pygmaea,
      refluxing and extracting with an ethanol solution having a volume
      percentage concentration of 65-95 percent, concentrating and
      drying the extract to obtain an extract; dispersing the extract
      with distilled water to obtain an extract dispersant, extracting
      the extract dispersant sequentially with petroleum ether, ethyl
      acetate and n-butyl alcohol, and volatizing solvent to obtain a
      corydalis pygmaea petroleum ether part and a corydalis pygmaea
      ethyl acetate part; and concentrating and drying the extracted
      extract dispersant to obtain a corydalis pygmaea water-phase
      extraction part. The corydalis pygmaea effective part can be
      applied to preparation of medicines for inhibiting HDAC1 enzyme,
      and can be used for preparing anti-tumor medicines.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The invention discloses a dracocephalum tanguticum maxim effective
      part as well as a preparation method and an application thereof,
      and belongs to the technical field of plant extracts. The
      dracocephalum tanguticum maxim effective part is selected from any
      one or any mixtures at any mass ratios of the follows: a
      dracocephalum tanguticum maxim ethyl acetate extract, a
      dracocephalum tanguticum maxim n-butanol extract and a
      dracocephalum tanguticum maxim aqueous extract. The dracocephalum
      tanguticum maxim ethyl acetate extract, the dracocephalum
      tanguticum maxim n-butanol extract and the dracocephalum
      tanguticum maxim aqueous extract are prepared by the following
      steps: crushing whole herb of dracocephalum tanguticum maxim,
      conducting reflux extraction with the addition of an ethanol
      solution which is 65-95% in mass percentage concentration, and
      concentrating and drying an obtained extracting solution, so that
      an extractum is obtained; dispersing the extractum with the
      addition of distilled water, so that extractum dispersion liquid
      is obtained; extracting the extractum dispersion liquid by taking
      petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol as solvents
      sequentially, and conducting volatilizing and removing the
      solvents, so as to obtain the dracocephalum tanguticum maxim ethyl
      acetate extract and the dracocephalum tanguticum maxim n-butanol
      extract; and concentrating and drying the extracted extractum
      dispersion liquid, so that the dracocephalum tanguticum maxim
      aqueous extract is obtained. The dracocephalum tanguticum maxim
      effective part disclosed by the invention is applicable to the
      aspect of preparing drugs for inhibiting HDAC1 enzyme; and the
      dracocephalum tanguticum maxim effective part can be used for
      preparing anti-tumors drugs.<br>
