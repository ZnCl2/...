          skin to treat burns</b><br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <b>Nadia Sussman</b><br>

      <br>
      FORTAZELA, Brazil — In this historic city by the sea in northeast
      Brazil, burn patients look as if they’ve emerged from the waves.
      They are covered in fish skin — specifically strips of sterilized
      tilapia.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors here are testing the skin of the popular fish as a bandage
      for second- and third-degree burns. The innovation arose from an
      unmet need. Animal skin has long been used in the treatment of
      burns in developed countries. But Brazil lacks the human skin, pig
      skin, and artificial alternatives that are widely available in the
      US.<br>
      <br>
      The three functional skin banks in Brazil can meet only 1 percent
      of the national demand, said Dr. Edmar Maciel, a plastic surgeon
      and burn specialist leading the clinical trials with tilapia skin.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, public health patients in Brazil are normally
      bandaged with gauze and silver sulfadiazine cream.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a burn cream because there’s silver in it, so it prevents
      the burns from being infected,” said Dr. Jeanne Lee, interim burn
      director at the the regional burn center at the University of
      California at San Diego. “But it doesn’t help in terms of
      debriding a burn or necessarily helping it heal.”<br>
      <br>
      The gauze-and-cream dressing must be changed every day, a painful
      process. In the burn unit at Fortaleza’s José Frota Institute,
      patients contort as their wounds are unwrapped and washed.<br>
      <br>
      Enter the humble tilapia, a fish that’s widely farmed in Brazil
      and whose skin, until now, was considered trash. Unlike the gauze
      bandages, the sterilized tilapia skin goes on and stays on.<br>
      <br>
      The first step in the research process was to analyze the fish
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      “We got a great surprise when we saw that the amount of collagen
      proteins, types 1 and 3, which are very important for scarring,
      exist in large quantities in tilapia skin, even more than in human
      skin and other skins,” Maciel said. “Another factor we discovered
      is that the amount of tension, of resistance in tilapia skin is
      much greater than in human skin. Also the amount of moisture.”<br>
      <br>
      In patients with superficial second-degree burns, the doctors
      apply the fish skin and leave it until the patient scars
      naturally. For deep second-degree burns, the tilapia bandages must
      be changed a few times over several weeks of treatment, but still
      far less often than the gauze with cream. The tilapia treatment
      also cuts down healing time by up to several days and reduces the
      use of pain medication, Maciel said.<br>
      <br>
      Antônio dos Santos, a fisherman, was offered the tilapia treatment
      as part of a clinical trial after he sustained burns to his entire
      right arm when a gas canister on his boat exploded. He accepted.<br>
      <br>
      “After they put on the tilapia skin, it really relieved the pain,”
      he said. “I thought it was really interesting that something like
      this could work.”<br>
      <br>
      The initial batches of tilapia skin were studied and prepared by a
      team of researchers at the Federal University of Ceará. Lab
      technicians used various sterilizing agents, then sent the skins
      for radiation in São Paulo to kill viruses, before packaging and
      refrigerating the skins. Once cleaned and treated, they can last
      for up to two years.<br>
      <br>
      In the US, animal-based skin substitutes require levels of
      scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration and animal rights
      groups that can drive up costs, Lee said. Given the substantial
      supply of donated human skin, tilapia skin is unlikely to arrive
      at American hospitals anytime soon.<br>
      <br>
      But it may be a boon in developing countries.<br>
      <br>
      “I’m willing to use anything that might actually help a patient,”
      Lee said. “It may be a good option depending on what country
      you’re talking about. But I also think the problem is that you
      need to find places that have the resources to actually process
      the skin and sterilize it, and make sure it doesn’t have
      diseases.”<br>
      <br>
      In Brazil, in addition to the clinical trials, researchers are
      currently conducting histological studies that compare the
      composition of human, tilapia, pig, and frog skins. They are also
      conducting studies on the comparative costs of tilapia skin and
      conventional burn treatments. If clinical trials show continued
      success, doctors hope a company will process the skins on an
      industrial scale and sell it to the public health system.<br>

        <b>TILAPIA SKIN PROCESSING METHOD AND USE THEREOF FOR COVERING
          SKIN INJURIES</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        </b></div>
      Inventor: EDMAR MACIEL , et al<br>
      <br>
      The present innovation relates to the use of Tilapia skin
      processed in various steps on the basis of glycerol in
      concentrations that vary from 50 to 99%, in types 5 and 7 clean
      room environments and in certain cases, when microbial count is
      high, with supplementary radio-sterilisation with gamma radiation.
      The skin can be used as an occlusive biological dressing for skin
      injuries, such as burn and acute or chronic wounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      1- Innovation refers to the use of Glycerol-based, multi-stage
      Tiiápia skin, in concentrations ranging from 50 to 99%, in Clean
      Room Classification Environment Types 5 and 7 and, in some cases,
      when The skin can be used in burns and acute or chronic wounds,
      which consists in its application on the surface of lesions due to
      II degree burns, Superficial or deep, in acute wounds, such as
      donor skin areas for autografting, or chronic, in their Unal
      stages of performing simple dressings, surgical dressings,
      surgical debridements under anesthesia and autograft of the skin,
      often present in these injuries .<br>
      <br>
      <b>STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE</b><br>
      <br>
      2- Currently, medicine in Brazil does not have any heterologous
      alternative skin cover alternative (from animal origin) as part of
      the treatment of burns and wounds. In developed countries,
      especially in the United States of America, Porcinandustrialized
      Skin has been used for this purpose and on a large scale for
      several decades. The importation of this product into Brazil has
      never been commercially viable, considering its high cost and the
      economic reality of the country.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REVISION</b><br>
      <br>
      3- The present invention describes the use of Tilapia skin in the
      superficial treatment of cutaneous lesions, such as burns, chronic
      crevices, among others, being obtained from psychoses, using
      culture systems (tanks-net), passing through a Sterilization
      process, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      4- After slaughter, tilapia skins (weighing between SOO and 1000
      grs) shall be removed with a turquoise (tool) and washed in
      running water for the removal of any trace of blood and other
      impurities and placed in physiological saline ( Sterile 0.9% aCI
      solution), previously cooled to 4Â ° C, for final cleaning. Next,
      the excesses of muscle, which still remain attached, will be
      removed and cut into pieces of 10.0 cm x 5.0 cm, washed with SF,
      following the following steps of sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      5- 1 Step - the skins are placed in a sterile container containing
      2% chlorhexidine gluconate (solution with surfactants), where they
      remain po 30 min.<br>
      <br>
      6- 2 Step - After the previous operation, the skins will be washed
      with sterile SF and removed to another container containing
      another 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, where they will
      remain for 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      7- 3 Step - the skins shall be rinsed in sterile saline and placed
      in a container containing 50% glycerol solution, 49% saline
      solution and 1% penicillin, streptomycin and fungisol solution and
      packaged for the (Jaguari ara-NPDIM), in an ice-containing
      isothermal box.<br>
      <br>
      8~ The next steps will be carried out in the UFC NPDM, in a
      sterile environment, with horizontal or vertical laminar flow.<br>
      <br>
      9- Before 24 hours the pelts should be removed from the previous
      solution, washed with sterile SF and placed in a sterile,
      hermetically sealed container containing 75% glycerol, 24% saline
      and 1% penicillin solution, Strepomyomycin and fungicide, wherein
      the pellets are massaged for 5 minutes in this solution and held
      for 3 hours in a water bath (centrifuge), with a stirrer at a
      constant speed of 15 revolutions per minute and a temperature of
      37 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      10- Step - the pelts will be removed, washed with sterile SF again
      and placed in another sterile and airtight container. Containing
      99% glycerol, 1% penicillin, streptomycin and fungisol solution,
      with foot massaging for 5 minutes In this solution and kept in a
      water bath in a centrifuge at 37 ° C and 15 revolutions per minute
      for a further 3 hours.<br>
      <br>
      11- At the end of the last stage of gellcerol, the pellets will be
      packaged in sterile double plastic envelopes and stored at 4 ° C
      for later use, with a shelf life of up to two years.<br>
      <br>
      12- Seven microbiological tests will be carried out for gram · *
      gram-and-fungal bacteria, starting on the skin in natura, i.e.,
      before the first stage and in the six stages described adma. When
      Bioburden levels, used for bacterial counting, ie Bioburden
      Microbiological Testing, or Microbial Test Strip, which is
      performed on pharmaceuticals and medical products that require
      control of microbial levels during processing and handling, are
      within the Acceptable limits, the skin will be unavailable for
      use.<br>
      <br>
      13- When skins are to be used they will be removed from the
      envelope and washed po three times in different solutions of
      sterile saline for five minutes each step. After this procedure,
      the skins will be trimmed to the size of the wound and applied as
      an occlusive dressing.<br>
      <br>
      14- If the bacterial count is above 10/3, a complementary
      sterilization step, described below, should be introduced: <br>
      <br>
      15- 7&nbsp; Step - complementary radio-sterilization, Gamma-Cobalt
      60, with dosages ranging from 15 to 50 Kilograys, depending on Bso
      burden levels (microbial count).<br>
      <br>
      16- The skin of the tilapia, when interacting with these lesions,
      promotes the acceleration of the healing and repair processes of
      the dermal matrix (by the action of the Type I Collagen in its
      histological structure), by adhering to the wound, avoiding the
      Retention of exudates and loss of fluids, promoting a barrier to
      bacterial invasion and providing pain relief.<br>
