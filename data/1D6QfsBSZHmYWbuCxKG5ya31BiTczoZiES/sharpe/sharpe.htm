            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      The British institution of dentures sitting in a glass of water
      beside the bed could be rendered obsolete by scientists who are
      confident that people will soon be able to replace lost teeth by
      growing new ones.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of false teeth, a small ball of cells capable of growing
      into a new tooth will be implanted where the missing one used to
      be.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure needs only a local anaesthetic and the new tooth
      should be fully formed within a few months of the cells being
      implanted.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Sharpe, a specialist in the field of regenerative dentistry
      at the Dental Institute of King's College, London, says the new
      procedure has distinct advantages over false teeth that require a
      metal post to be driven into the jaw before being capped with a
      porcelain or plastic tooth.<br>
      <br>
      "The surgery today can be extensive and you need to have good
      solid bone in the jaw and that is a major problem for some
      people," Professor Sharpe said.<br>
      <br>
      The method could be used on far more patients because the ball of
      cells that grows into a tooth also produces bone that anchors to
      the jaw.<br>
      <br>
      The choice of growing a new tooth is likely to appeal to patients.
      "Anyone who has lost teeth will tell you that, given the chance,
      they would rather have their own teeth than false ones," said Prof
      Sharpe. The average Briton over 50 has lost 12 teeth from a set of
      32.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure is fairly simple. Doctors take stem cells from the
      patient. These are unique in their ability to form any of the
      tissues that make up the body. By carefully nurturing the stem
      cells in a laboratory, scientists can nudge the cells down a path
      that will make them grow into a tooth. After a couple of weeks,
      the ball of cells, known as a bud, is ready to be implanted. Tests
      reveal what type of tooth - for example, a molar or an incisor -
      the bud will form.<br>
      <br>
      Using a local anaesthetic, the tooth bud is inserted through a
      small incision into the gum. Within months, the cells will have
      matured into a fully-formed tooth, fused to the jawbone. As the
      tooth grows, it releases chemicals that encourage nerves and blood
      vessels to link up with it.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have shown the technique to work in mice, where new teeth
      took weeks to grow. "There's no reason why it shouldn't work in
      humans, the principles are the same," said Prof Sharpe.<br>
      <br>
      His team has set up a company, Odontis, to exploit the technique,
      and has won £400,000 from the National Endowment for Science,
      Technology and the Arts and the Wellcome Trust.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the production of alveolar bone
      and to jaw augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Many people experience tooth loss and require dentures.
      Unfortunately, many patients experience great difficulty in
      retaining dentures in position because the loss of teeth is
      accompanied with the subsequent loss of the alveolar bone (the
      tooth supporting bony ridge). The lack of any ridge on which to
      locate the denture plates then creates problems in retaining the
      dentures. Current bone graft procedures involve surgical insertion
      of either bone substitutes or grafts from rib or hip. These are
      significant surgical procedures which are not appropriate to the
      vast majority of edentulous (usually elderly) patients.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides methods and compositions for
      facilitating denture retention which do not require significant
      surgery.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to jaw augmentation and in
      particular to jaw augmentation for the purposes of facilitating
      denture retention. It has been found that when a tooth primordium
      is inserted into a mammalian jaw and tooth formation follows, new
      alveolar bone around the new tooth forms. The present invention is
      based on the idea of stimulating new tooth formation via the
      implantation of tooth primordia at selected places in the jaw
      (e.g. at four points in the molar regions) to result in the
      formation of bony protuberances which could facilitate denture
      retention. The teeth may then be removed from the jaw of the
      patient to leave the new alveolar bone.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has the advantage that the bony
      ("volcano-like") protuberances formed around the tooth are far
      easier to produce and more suitable for anchorage of dentures than
      bone formed by current methods of surgical implantation which
      require invasive surgical shaping.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the present invention has the advantage that the
      formation of new alveolar bone is easier to achieve than tooth
      replacement as the management of shape, size, and orientation of
      the new tooth is not important.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A first aspect of the invention provides a method of jaw
      augmentation, the method comprising implanting a tooth primordium
      into a space in the oral cavity of the patient and allowing the
      tooth primordium to develop into a tooth.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the jaw augmentation is for the purpose of creating
      one or more bony protuberances which can facilitate denture
      retention. Alternatively, the jaw augmentation may be for the
      purpose of tooth replacement or for the treatment of periodontal
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the
      invention, there is provided a method of regenerating alveolar
      bone for facilitating denture retention, the method comprising: i)
      implanting a tooth primordium into a space in the oral cavity of
      the patient and allowing the tooth primordium to develop into a
      tooth; and ii) removing the tooth to thereby leave a bony
      protuberance in the patient's jaw to facilitate denture retention.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the method comprises the following further step: iii)
      creating a denture for the patient which denture is to be held in
      place at least partly by the bony protuberance.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the tooth primordium used in step i) of the invention
      is created by inducing stem cells from the patient (e.g. neural
      stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow cell stem cells or
      stem cells from the patients remaining teeth/teeth cells (which
      may for example be found in dental pulp and from exfoliated
      deciduous teeth) to undergo odontogenesis to form tooth progenitor
      cells and tooth primordia.<br>
      <br>
      A second aspect of the invention provides the use of stem cells in
      the manufacture of a medicament for jaw augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      A third aspect of the invention provides the use of a tooth
      primordium in the manufacture of a medicament for jaw
      augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      In the second and third aspects of the invention, it is preferred
      that the jaw augmentation is carried out for the purpose of
      creating bony protuberances which facilitate denture retention.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the tooth primordia used in the methods and uses of
      the present invention are produced from cells from the patient
      being treated. This avoids the problem of graft rejection. Thus,
      in a preferred embodiment the tooth primordia used are produced
      using stem cells from the patient undergoing treatment.<br>
      <br>
      A fourth aspect of the invention provides a method of making a
      denture which is to retained by the patient at least partly by one
      or more bony protuberances created by the method of the first
      aspect of the invention, the method comprising making a model
      (e.g. an impression) of at least part of a patient's jaw which
      patient has undergone jaw augmentation according to the method of
      the first aspect of the invention and using the model to create
      the denture.<br>
      <br>
      A fifth aspect of the invention provides a denture made by the
      process of the fourth aspect of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the patient is a human patient. Preferably, the
      patient is an adult (greater than 18 years of age) and more
      preferably the patient is middle-aged (e.g. greater than 45 years
      of age) or is an elderly patient (e.g. greater than 65 years of
      age).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tooth Primordia Production</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Tooth development requires the combination of cells from
      mesenchymal and epithelial lineages. Development of the mammalian
      tooth has been recognised as a model system for study of
      epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis. Teeth
      start to develop early in mammalian embryogenesis (11 days in
      mice, 6 weeks in humans), from a series of reciprocal interactions
      between two cell types: oral epithelial cells and neural
      crest-derived mesenchyme cells.<br>
      <br>
      Inductive signals for tooth development come from the epithelium
      whereupon the responding mesenchymal cells are programmed to
      become odontogenic (Lumsden, 1988).<br>
      <br>
      Odontogenic mesenchymal cells then provide instructive signals for
      further tooth development (Thesleff and Sharpe, 1997). The
      epithelial cells eventually give rise to ameloblasts which are
      responsible for enamel formation and mesenchyme cells form
      odontoblasts which produce dentine and cementoblasts.<br>
      <br>
      The identity of these different instructive signals has been
      revealed by gene expression studies and implantation experiments.
      FGF8, BMP4 and SHH are established as early instructive signals
      from the oral epithelium (Thesleff and Sharpe, 1997). BMP's, FGF's
      and activin are among the early signals from the mesenchyme
      (Thesleff and Sharpe, 1997; Ferguson et al., 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Prior art approaches to the production of tooth primordia have
      included in vitro tissue recombination. In this approach, two
      different tissue types are independently dissected from the animal
      embryo, and these tissues are recombined in the laboratory.
      Signals from one may then induce formation of tooth primordia in
      the other. This is a labour intensive process carried out by
      highly trained workers involving a great deal of surgical skill.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative approach, Young et al. has showed that cells
      dissociated from early tooth buds when cultured on a matrix and
      implanted into an adult animal can form teeth, indicating the
      presence of both epithelial and mesenchymal dental stem cells
      (Young et al., 2002).<br>
      <br>
      For human therapeutic purposes the major drawback is the potential
      problem of graft rejection, thus requiring either
      immunosuppression of host (recipient), or genetic manipulation of
      the graft cells to circumvent rejection, and the difficulty of
      obtaining the cells. Therefore the use of cells derived
      exclusively from each patient would avoid such rejection problems.<br>
      <br>
      Sharpe (WO 01/60981) showed that cultured embryonic stem cells can
      give rise to epithelial and mesenchyme lineages, enabling the
      production of teeth primordia from embryonic stem cells. However,
      the use of embryonic stem cells requires purification and
      expansion of a population of cells. This involves intricate and
      highly skilled separation and manipulation techniques. Another
      problem associated with the use of embryonic stem cells is the
      limited availability and ease with which the embryonic stem cells
      can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Adult (i.e. non-embryonic) bone marrow cells are known to contain
      populations of stem cells and pluripotential cells which give rise
      to (a) haematopoietic cells and (b) stromal (mesenchymal) cells.
      Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, however, do not give rise
      to non-haematopoietic tissues (Wagers et al). Mesenchymal stem
      cells give rise to homogeneous differentiated cell types of
      tissues including bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon,
      hematopoiesis-supporting stroma, and mesangial tissues, but are
      not known to be capable of forming organs of composite cell
      lineages and those that require specific reciprocal tissue
      interactions, such as teeth whose development requires
      contributions from more than one cell lineage.<br>
      <br>
      PCT/GB2004/000635 documents the surprising discovery that bone
      marrow cells may be employed to produce tooth primordia. The use
      of bone marrow cells obviates the need for purification and
      expansion of a population of cells. Since bone marrow cells may be
      obtained from any individual, the use of such cells in therapeutic
      tooth formation offers (a) avoidance of problems of graft
      rejection, and (b) wider accessibility of the pluripotent cell
      component compared with embryonic stem cells. In a preferred
      embodiment of the invention, bone marrow cells are used in the
      production of the tooth primordia.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the bone marrow cells have not undergone
      purification for a particular cell type. By "purification for a
      particular cell type" we refer to any process which increases the
      proportion of a particular type of bone marrow cell present by
      removal of one or more other cell types present in the unpurified
      cell population.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the unpurified bone marrow cells have not undergone
      expansion to increase the proportion of a particular cell type
      present. Alternatively, the unpurified bone marrow cells have
      undergone expansion to increase the proportion of a particular
      cell type present.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the bone marrow cells have undergone
      purification for a particular cell type, for example to increase
      the proportion of bone marrow stem cells present. Techniques for
      obtaining a purified cell population will be well known to those
      skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the purified bone marrow cells have undergone
      expansion (either before or after purification; preferably after
      purification). In this way increased numbers of a particular cell
      type present may be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Tooth progenitor cells may be produced by incubating bone marrow
      cells in the presence of oral epithelial inductive signals.
      Suitably, at least about 100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000
      or 15000 bone marrow cells are incubated in the presence of oral
      epithelial inductive signals.<br>
      <br>
      The bone marrow cells are preferably obtained from a single
      individual. Alternatively, the bone marrow cells may be obtained
      from a number of individuals and pooled.<br>
      <br>
      The bone marrow cells may be prepared for the
      induction/interaction in a number of ways. For example, they may
      be pelleted to form small aggregates. This may be accomplished by
      pelleting them onto filters. Such filters may comprise any
      suitable substrate, such as pregelatinized Millipore filters. For
      convenience, the filters may be supported by metal grids, for
      example as described in Ferguson et al. (1998). The bone marrow
      cells may be pelleted into small holes made in a gel or other
      suitable semi-solid support. The gel may be a collagen gel. The
      gel may be Collaborative Biomedical Products' Matrigel or a
      similar substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, epithelium may be overlaid onto the bone marrow cells
      to cover the hole which is then covered with a thin layer of gel
      and incubated.<br>
      <br>
      Gels used in this manner may themselves be supported by
      membrane(s) and/or metal grids.<br>
      <br>
      The bone marrow cells are contacted with oral epithelial inductive
      signals. Preferably, the bone marrow cells are contacted with any
      combination of one, two, three or all of the following: FGF8,
      BMP4, SHH and WNTS. As discussed below, the oral epithelial
      inductive signals may be provided by a variety of means some of
      which do not require the presence of embryonic oral epithelial
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of epithelial markers include Pitx2, p21, Wnt7b and
      others. These markers may be detected by any suitable means, such
      as western blotting, immunofluorescence, radioactive in situ
      hybridization or other suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      Genes known to be expressed in tooth germ epithelium include
      Bmp-4, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), CD44, FGF8, Pitx2 and Otlx-2 genes.<br>
      <br>
      In wild-type embryos, Bmp-4 is initially expressed in the dental
      epithelium, but expression shifts to the mesenchyme around the
      tooth buds from E13. 5 (Aberg et al., 1997). At E13. 5 mesenchymal
      Bmp-4 expression is found only in lower incisors, which are the
      most advanced developmentally at this stage, whereas expression
      persists in the epithelium of upper incisors and molars (Ferguson
      et al., 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Shh is expressed in the epithelial thickening of early tooth germs
      and is thought to be an important component of the signals that
      pass from the epithelium to the underlying mesenchyme at this
      early stage, inducing gene expression in the mesenchyme (Bitgood
      and McMahon, 1995; Thesleff and Sharpe, 1997). At later stages,
      Shh is down-regulated but transcripts reappear in the epithelial
      cells that constitute the enamel knot, a transient signalling
      centre that arises in the dental epithelium at the late bud stage
      of tooth development (Ferguson et al., 1998; Vaahtokari et al,
      1996).<br>
      <br>
      CD44 and Otlx-2 are expressed more widely in the oral epithelium
      than Shh (Ferguson et al., 1998; Mucchielli et al, 1997). CD44
      encodes the hyaluronan receptor and Otlx-2 is the murine homologue
      of the human gene which when mutated, causes the disease known as
      Rieger syndrome in which teeth are absent (Semina et al; 1996).<br>
      <br>
      Follistatin is an activin-binding protein that has been shown to
      inhibit the activity of activin (Michel et al., 1993; De Winter et
      al; 1996). The expression pattern of Follistatin may be examined
      by in situ hybridization analysis (Ferguson et al., 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Follistatin expression is found in tooth germ epithelial cells
      immediately adjacent to activin expressing cells from El 1. 5. At
      later stages, follistatin transcripts are restricted to the
      columnar-shaped cells that form the outermost layer of the
      epithelial bud, while the central core of epithelial cells are
      follistatin-negative (Ferguson et al., 1998). Follistatin is
      therefore expressed in the tooth epithelium adjacent to and in a
      complementary pattern to activin in the tooth mesenchyme.<br>
      <br>
      A tooth progenitor cell is one which expresses certain molecular
      markers characteristic of tooth progenitor cells. For example, a
      cell would be considered to be a tooth progenitor cell if it
      expressed one or more tooth mesenchymal cell markers. Examples of
      such markers include Barx1. Dlx2, Dlx5, Msx1, Pax9, Activin
      .beta.A, Lhx6, Lhx7 and others. These markers may be detected by
      any suitable means, such as western blotting, immunofluorescence,
      radioactive in situ hybridization or other suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      In wild type teeth at the bud stage Barx-1 gene expression is
      principally found in the molar region of the mandible and maxilla
      and is present in a broad field of neural crest derived
      mesenchymal cells rather than being restricted to dental
      mesenchyme (Ferguson et al., 1998: Tissier-Seta et al., 1995).<br>
      <br>
      Msx-1, Lef-1 and Bmp-4 are expressed in the dental mesenchyme
      (i.e. the condensing mesenchymal cells associated with
      invaginating incisor and molar epithelial tooth buds) in response
      to epithelial signaling (Ferguson et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al.,
      1991; Kratochwil et al., 1996; Vainio et al., 1993).<br>
      <br>
      Dlx-2 expression is principally found in mesenchymal cells
      immediately surrounding the epithelial bud, but is also present in
      the dental epithelium on the buccal side of the buds (Ferguson et
      al., 1998; Thomas et al., 1995; Qui et al., 1997).<br>
      <br>
      Pax-9, Lhx6 and Lhx7 are expressed in early tooth mesenchyme prior
      to bud formation and subsequently in condensing mesenchyme at the
      bud stage (Ferguson et al., 1998; Neubuiser et al., 1997).<br>
      <br>
      Gli-3 is expressed in the mesenchyme from E10. 5. At the bud and
      cap stage Gli-3 expression is slightly more localized than Par-9
      expression, and is concentrated in the dental papilla and dental
      follicle (Ferguson et al, 1998; Hardcastle and Sharpe, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Syndecan-1, a cell surface heparin sulphate proteoglycan is
      transiently expressed in the dental mesenchyme and is thought to
      regulate dental mesenchymal cell condensation beneath the
      invaginating dental epithelium (Ferguson et al., 1998; Thesleff et
      al., 1996).<br>
      <br>
      Tgf.beta.-1 is found in the dental mesenchyme and weakly in the
      epithelium of the incisors and only appears in the molars in the
      dental epithelium at the cap stage (Ferguson et al., 1998;
      Vaahtokari et al., 1991).<br>
      <br>
      Tgf.beta.-3 expression is widespread in the mesenchyme of the
      face, but its expression appears to be substantially absent from
      the condensing mesenchymal cells immediately adjacent to the
      epithelial buds of incisors and molars (Ferguson et al., 1998;
      Chai et al., 1994).<br>
      <br>
      Incubation with the oral epithelial inductive signals is for a
      time sufficient to produce the tooth progenitor cell. Preferably,
      this time is at least about 12 hours. Preferably, the time is
      between 12 and 82 hrs, preferably between 12 and 72 hours.
      Preferably, the time is between 12 and 24 hours, 12 and 36 hours
      or 12 and 48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed in WO 01/60981, the oral epithelial inductive signals
      may be provided in various ways including: (i) using embryonic
      oral epithelial cells, (ii) using cells which are not embryonic
      oral epithelial cells but which express oral epithelial inductive
      signals and which thereby emulate the signaling characteristics of
      embryonic oral epithelial cells; and (iii) using purified protein.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the bone marrow cells are incubated in the
      presence of one or more embryonic oral epithelial cells to produce
      the tooth progenitor cell. Preferably, the bone marrow cells are
      incubated in the presence of embryonic oral epithelium.<br>
      <br>
      As established in WO 01/60981, the role of embryonic oral
      epithelial cells in providing oral epithelial inductive signals
      may be replaced by using, inter alia, inductive odontogenic cells
      which emulate the signaling characteristics of embryonic oral
      epithelium. WO 01/60981 discloses that odontogenic epithelial
      cells may be produced from cultured cells which may be engineered
      to possess characteristics of embryonic oral epithelium, thereby
      allowing replacement of embryonic oral epithelium with engineered
      epithelium. Examples of cells which may replace the role of
      embryonic oral epithelial cells in tooth progenitor production are
      provided in WO 01/60981 and include immortalized cell lines (e.g.
      epithelial cells derived from immortalized lines of tooth
      epithelial cells) and ES cell-derived (i.e. cultured cell derived)
      epithelial cells.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in an alternative embodiment, the bone marrow cells
      may be incubated in the presence of one or more inductive
      odontogenic cells which emulate the signaling characteristics of
      embryonic oral epithelial cells to produce the tooth progenitor
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      The inductive odontogenic cells may be produced from non-oral
      epithelial cells (e.g. epithelial cells derived from immortalized
      lines of tooth epithelial cells). Preferably, the odontogenic
      cells are produced from an immortalized cell line or a stem cell
      (e.g. ES cell).<br>
      <br>
      The inductive odontogenic cells preferably express one, two,
      three, four or all of the following: FGF8, BMP4, SHH, Pitx2 and
      Islet1.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed in WO 01/60981, molecular markers may be analyzed to
      determine whether the signaling properties of early oral
      epithelium are well established. For instance, expression of FGF8,
      BMP4, SHH and Pitx2 (the earliest marker of oral epithelium) may
      be analyzed to determine which cells are likely to be able to
      replace oral epithelial cells. Methods for testing the odontogenic
      inducing capacity of cell lines are also disclosed in WO 01/60981.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed in WO 01/60981, if the epithelial cells do not
      properly induce odontogenesis the expression of inductive
      signaling molecules (FGF8, BMP4, SHH etc.) may be assayed in
      collagen explant cultures and any missing signals are replaced
      either by purified proteins on beads or by electroporation of gene
      expression constructs.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of secreted signals necessary to induce
      odontogenesis in bone marrow cells may alternatively be provided
      using purified protein such as by using the bead delivery system
      as described in WO 01/60981.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in another embodiment the bone marrow cells may be
      incubated in the presence of protein-containing beads or
      protein-coated beads to provide oral epithelial inductive signals
      to produce the tooth progenitor cell. Persons skilled in the art
      will readily be able to devise suitable concentrations of the
      proteins.<br>
      <br>
      Once a tooth progenitor cell has been generated, odontogenic
      inducing capacity resides in the tooth progenitor cell and naive
      epithelial cells respond to signals from the tooth progenitor cell
      and allows tooth primordia and tooth development. If the growth
      medium used in the cultures does not contain the factors required
      for the production of an odontogenic epithelium, the culture media
      may be supplemented with the necessary factors.<br>
      <br>
      The term "tooth primordia" is well known in the art and refers to
      structures that can develop into fully-formed teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Incubation of the tooth progenitor cell in the presence of one or
      more epithelial cells is for a time sufficient to produce a tooth
      primordium. Preferably, this time is at least about 12 hours.
      Preferably, the tooth progenitor cell is incubated in the presence
      of oral epithelium.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the one or more epithelial cells are oral epithelial
      cells; embryonic epithelial cells; oral, embryonic epithelial
      cells; or are epithelial cells derived from stem cells (embryonic
      stem (ES) cells or adult stem cells) or an immortalized cell line.<br>

      Whilst the techniques described in WO2001GB00651 (WO01/60981),
      PCT/GB2004/000635 (both of which are incorporated herein by
      reference) and Ohazama et al. (2004) J Dent Res. 2004
      July;83(7):518-22 are preferred for the generation of the tooth
      primordia used in the present invention, the present invention is
      not restricted to any particular method of generating the tooth
      primorida. Therefore, methods other than those described in
      WO2001GB00651 (WO01/60981) and PCT/GB2004/000635 may be used in
      the present invention.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tooth Primordia Implantation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The tooth primordia can then be used to generate a tooth in the
      jaw of the patient by implanting the tooth primordium into a space
      in the oral cavity and allowing the tooth primordium to develop
      into a tooth.<br>
      <br>
      Implantation may be achieved by making a small incision in the
      soft tissues of the maxilla or mandible and placing the explant in
      the incision and fixing with surgical glue (e.g. Vetbond, 3M).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tooth and Alveolar Bone
        Development</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Where the tooth is created for the purposes of tooth replacement,
      it is desirable that the tooth that develops in situ is of the
      correct shape and size. A number of the genes that determine tooth
      shape are known, and by manipulation of these genes it is possible
      to change tooth shape (Tucker et al., 1998; Ferguson et al., 1998;
      Thomas et al., 1997; Ferguson et al., 2000). Similarly, it is
      shown experimentally that modulation of signaling event; leads to
      alteration of tooth size. For example, inhibition of Wnt signaling
      leads to the development of smaller teeth (Sarkar and Sharpe
      2000). These observation could be advantageously employed in the
      methods of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Where jaw augmentation is for the purposes of facilitating denture
      retention, the tooth primordium once implanted is allowed to
      develop into a tooth and the tooth is then subsequently removed to
      leave a bony protruberance which may then be used to grip the
      patient's denture in place. Where the tooth is to be removed, the
      management of shape, size, and orientation of the new tooth is
      obviously not of particular importance.<br>
      <br>
      Sufficient alveolar bone formation will generally occur after
      about 90 days. Accordingly, it is preferred that the tooth
      extraction occurs at least 80 or 90 days after implantation of the
      tooth primordium and more preferably at least after 100, 110, 120,
      130, 140, 150, 160 or 170 days after implantation.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, new tooth formation is stimulated at more than one
      place in the jaw; preferably new tooth formation is stimulated at
      least at one place on each side of the jaw. Preferably, tooth
      formation is stimulated at least two, three, four, five or six
      sites in the jaw (either in the maxilla (upper jaw) or in the
      mandible (lower jaw) or both).<br>
      <br>
      New tooth formation may be stimulated in the upper and/or lower
      jaw depending on the needs of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, tooth formation is stimulated in the molar region.
      Accordingly, in one preferred embodiment tooth formation is
      stimulated at at least one, two, three, four, five or six sites in
      the molar region of the jaw.<br>
      <br>
      Where more than one tooth primordium is implanted, the tooth
      primordia may be implanted at the same time or may be implanted on
      separate occasions during successive treatments by the medical
      practitioner overseeing the treatment. In one embodiment, one or
      more tooth primordia are inserted into one side of the jaw in one
      treatment and then during a successive treatment one or more tooth
      primordia are inserted into the other side of the jaw.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tooth Removal</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Where the tooth primordium has been implanted for the purpose of
      denture retention, the new tooth itself would be superfluous and
      is removed. Preferably, the new tooth is removed at or around the
      time of eruption.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Culture of Non-Dental Cells</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Feeder-independent mouse embryonic stem cells (E14.2) were
      cultured in D-MEM with 10.sup.3 U/ml of leukaemia inhibitory
      factor, buffalo rat liver cell-conditional medium, 200 mM
      L-Glutamine, non-essential amino acid, 2-mercaptoethanol. Medium
      was changed every day and ES cells were passaged every 2-3 days.
      Duplicate flasks of the cells were used to generate a mouse gene
      knock-out that has subsequently resulted in two lines of mice with
      full germline transmission.<br>
      <br>
      Neural stem cells were isolated from E14 embryo spinal cords at
      the level of the upper limb to the lower cervical region. The cord
      itself was carefully dissected free from any other tissue and
      membrane to reveal nothing but naked spinal cord. The cord was
      then dissociated into single cells using trypsin and flame-narrow
      pipettes and plated at 200,000 per T-75 on 10 .varies.g/ml
      poly-omithine and 10 .varies.g/ml laminin in serum-free medium
      (DMEM/F12) containing N2 neural supplement and 20 ng/ml FGF-2.
      Cells were cultured for 7 days before harvesting (Minger et al.,
      1996). These tested 99% positive for the neural stem cell marker
      nestin expression and their ability to differentiate
      into-different neuronal cell types was assayed in vitro and all
      three major neuronal cell types, neurons, oligodendrocytes and
      astrocytes were formed (see supplementary material).<br>
      <br>
      Bone marrow cells were collected from tibiae and femora of 6-9
      weeks old female wild-type mice (CD-1). Five mice were killed by
      cervical dislocation, and tibiae and femurs were aseptically
      removed and dissected free of adherent tissue. Both ends of the
      bone were cut, and the bone cavity was flushed out with culture
      medium slowly injected at the end of the bone using a sterile
      21-gauge needle. Bone marrow stromal cells were subsequently
      suspended in &lt;-minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 20%
      heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL) and 100 .mu.M
      L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma) and were maintained for 10
      days in a 75-cm.sub.2 tissue flask. The medium was changed after 3
      days and then subsequently every 2 days.<br>
      <br>
      C3H10T1/2 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
      Eagle's medium (D-MEM) with 10% FBS. All solutions contained
      penicillin and streptomycin at 20 IU/ml.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tissue Recombinations</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In order to detect any possible contamination of embryonic oral
      epithelium with ectomesenchymal cells, we used transgenic mice
      expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP mice) as the source of
      the epithelium in the recombinations (Hadjantonakis et al., 1998;
      Zambrowicz et al., 1997). Following in situ hybridisation,
      expression of GFP showed that non-dental cells in the
      recombinations were not contaminated with any ectomesenchyme
      cells. In situ hybridization for GFP expression on sections of
      teeth formed in renal capsules showed no expression in any
      mesenchyme-derived cells whereas sections from teeth produced from
      GFP mice showed expression in all mesenchyme-derived cells.<br>
      <br>
      Mandible primordia of embryos (E10) from GFP mice were dissected
      in D-MEM with glutamax-1. The epithelium was isolated following
      incubation in a solution of Dispase (Gibco BRL) made up in
      calcium- and magnesium-free PBS at 2 U/ml for 10-15 min at
      37.degree. C. After incubation the tissues were washed in D-MEM
      with 10% FBS, and the epithelium was mechanically separated using
      fine tungsten needles.<br>
      <br>
      The cultured cell populations consisting of 5-6.times.10.sub.6
      cells were harvested by brief exposure to EDTA-Trypsin (2 g/l EDTA
      and 5 g/l Trypsin). After several washings, the cells were
      centrifuged to form a pellet which was then placed on transparent
      Nucleopore membrane filters (0.1 .m pore diameter; Coster)
      supported by a metal grid following the Trowell technique (1959)
      as modified by Saxen (1966). Three or four pieces of epithelium
      were then placed over the cell pellet and the recombinant explants
      incubated for 1-3 days at 37.degree. C.<br>
      <br>
      After the period of culture, the explants were fixed and processed
      for in situ hybridization or were transplanted under renal
      capsules. The explants were cultured in host kidneys for 10 days
      to allow full development of teeth. The resulting tissues were
      then fixed and decalcified using 0.5M EDTA (pH 7.6).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In situ Hybridization</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      For in situ hybridization, explants were embedded and serially
      sectioned at 7 .mu.m. Sections were split over 5-10 slides.
      Radioactive in situ hybridization using .sup.35S-UTP radiolabeled
      riboprobes was carried out according to previous reports (Angerer
      and Angerer, 1966; Tucker et al., 1998). The mouse Pax9 cDNA clone
      was a gift from Rudi Balling.<br>
      <br>
      All experiments involving animals were carried out according to
      Home Office guidelines covered by Project and Personnel licences
      to PTS.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Three different sources of non-dental cells were assayed for their
      odontogenic responses to embryonic oral epithelium in these
      explant recombinations. Embryonic stem (ES) cells, were used as a
      pure pluripotent stem cell population that would thus be expected
      to be able to form dental cells given the appropriate signals.
      Neural stem cells were used as a pure multipotential stem cell
      population that is not known to be able to form dental cells. In
      order to assess the potential of an adult heterogeneous cell
      population to form teeth, bone marrow-derived (BMD) cells were
      used. The ES cells were derived from the same passage of cells
      successfully used to generate germline chimeras. The neural stem
      cells were derived from a population that tested 99% positive for
      nestin expression. The BMD cells were a mixed population shown to
      consist of fibroblasts, osteoblast and adipocyte progenitors and
      up to 0.01% stem cells (Pereira et al., 1998; Pittenger et al.,
      1999). Cells were aggregated into a solid mass, overlaid with E10
      oral epithelium, cultured in vitro for 3 days and analysed for
      expression of molecular markers of tooth development. Embryonic
      stem cells, embryonic neural stem cells and adult BMD cells all
      responded in an identical way by the induction of Msx1, Lhx7 and
      Pax9 expression in a total of five recombinations per cell type
      (FIG. 1, 2A-H). Although each of these genes is expressed in cells
      other than dental mesenchyme, the combination of expression of
      these three genes is unique to odontogenic mesenchyme cells
      (MacKenzie et al., 1992; Grigoriou et al., 1998; Peters et al.,
      1998). Recombinations were also carried out with cultured
      non-dental cell populations that are known not to have any
      multipotential stem cell-like properties, such as NIH3T3 and
      murine mesenchymal cells (C3H10T1/2) and in these cases no
      expression of any of the marker genes was observed, while
      expression of non-odontogenic genes was found (FIG. 2I-L).<br>
      <br>
      Failure of tooth initiation in these control cultures showed that
      there was no contamination of the oral epithelium with
      ectomesenchyme cells. This was also confirmed by using genetically
      distinct oral epithelium from green fluorescent protein
      (GFP)-mice, where no expression was detected in non-dental
      mesenchyme cells in recombinations (FIG. 2E). The odontogenic
      response of the cultured non-dental "mesenchyme" cell populations
      thus appears likely to be a stem cell property but one that is not
      linked to tissue origin or developmental age.<br>
      <br>
      In order to determine if a mouse embryonic tooth primordium could
      develop into a tooth when transplanted into the adult mouth, we
      surgically implanted E14.5 molar tooth rudiments into the soft
      tissue of the diastema of the maxilla of adult mice. The mouse
      dentition comprises one incisor separated from three molars by a
      toothless region (diastema) in each quadrant of the mouth. The
      transplanted explants were left for 26 days before fixation and
      decalcification for histology. FIG. 3A-D shows the normal
      histology of maxillary incisors (A) and molars (B-D). FIG. 3E is a
      section between incisor (A) and molars (B-D) in the diastema
      showing a clearly identifiable ectopic tooth formed at the site of
      the transplantation. The ectopic tooth was of a similar size to
      the first molar and was histologically normal with dentine and
      enamel. The tooth was connected to ectopic bone by an organised
      soft connective tissue (FIG. 3F).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The data presented herein show that the odontogenic process can be
      initiated in non-dental cells of different origins, including
      purified stem cell populations and a mixed population of adult
      cells. Bone and soft tissues can be formed from non-dental cell
      populations consisting entirely of purified stem cells or from a
      heterogeneous population such as BMD cells. BMD cells have
      recently been shown to be a convenient, non-pure source of stem
      cells that can form neurons following bone marrow transplantation
      in adult mice (Weimann et al., 2003). The ability of this
      heterogeneous adult cell population to form bone and teeth in
      tissue engineered rudiments is significant since it implies that a
      pure population of stem cells is not necessary and this may thus
      have important implications for the further development of these
      procedures in humans. The embryonic oral epithelium is a simple,
      two cell thick ectoderm and it is conceivable that this could be
      replaced with epithelial cells from another source. If this
      epithelium can be engineered to express the appropriate signals to
      initiate odontogenesis, a complete tooth primordium could be
      produced entirely from cultured cells. The identification of stem
      cells in dental pulp and from exfoliated deciduous teeth also
      raises the possibility of using a patient's own tooth cells to
      generate new tooth primordial (Gronthos et al., 2000; Miura et
      al., 2003). The ability to tissue engineer an organ rudiment such
      as a tooth primordium constitutes a major component of a
      regenerative medicine procedure (Chai and Slavkin 2003). However
      such organ primordia must be capable of developing into the
      complete organ in situ, in the appropriate site in the adult body.
      The renal capsule and anterior chamber of the eye are two adult
      sites that have been routinely used to support ectopic organ and
      tissue development because they are immune-compromised and can
      provide an adequate blood supply to the transplanted tissue. We
      show here that transfer of embryonic tooth primordia into the
      adult jaw resulted in complete tooth development, showing that an
      embryonic primordium can develop in its adult environment and can
      result in the regeneration of alveolar bone.<br>
