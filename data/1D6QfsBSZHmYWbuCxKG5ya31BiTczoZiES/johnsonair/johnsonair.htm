      A new air purification unit requires little energy in removing
      toxic gasses, dust and bacteria, much the way air is cleansed in
      the atmosphere. The new invention is out of the test lab and now
      cleaning industrial emissions.<br>

      <i>Making neighbours happy: The photochemical accelerator removes
        foul smells from the recycling of oil and waste water at the
        Jysk Miljørens plant in the harbour area of Aarhus,
        Denmark.&nbsp; </i>(Photo: Matthew Johnson)<br>
      <br>
      Metal sections have been mounted on the roof of the company Jysk
      Miljørens in Aarhus, Danmark which literally are making the owners
      breathe easier.<br>
      <br>
      Until now the company’s neighbours have been protesting the big
      stink it made. The firm recycles oil from the water in ballast
      tanks of ships and the process noticeably fouled the air, despite
      a high chimney. Complaints led to threats of closing the plant
      down.<br>
      <br>
      But the stench is now history. The metal crates contain the first
      commercial unit for a new type of air purifier developed by the
      chemist Matthew Johnson at the University of Copenhagen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Several advantages</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Variations of the purifier can be put to use cleaning emissions
      and recycling polluted air indoors in factories as well as homes.<br>
      <br>
      The purifier has several advantages. A major one is that it uses
      little energy. By recycling indoor air it also saves energy that
      would be lost in warming up outdoor air in winter.<br>
      <br>
      Certain factories can avoid building tall chimneys to disperse
      polluted discharges high above the heads of immediate neighbours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Death zone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The new technology was first presented to the public in the autumn
      of 2010. Johnson has spent the last two years on the perilous path
      from the laboratory to the market and industrial use.<br>
      <br>
      In getting there, the researcher had to pass what he calls the
      “death zone”.&nbsp; This is the zone between labs and markets,
      where so many great ideas perish before becoming viable products.<br>
      <br>
      “We crossed the death zone with a prototype. I bought a shipping
      container with a little funding from the industrial development
      firm Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster,” says Johnson.<br>
      <br>
      <b>As in the atmosphere</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>This diagram shows how air is sucked in and disinfected with
      bacteria-killing ozone and ultraviolet radiation, before water
      vapour and/or ammoniac is condensed into droplets, which pick up
      dust and chemicals. Then the tiny droplets forming an aerosol is
      given an electrical charge and thus is attracted to a field with
      an opposite charge, before the remaining ozone is cleaned out in a
      catalyst. <br>
      <br>
      And what did Matthew Johnson place in the container? A unit that
      mimics the air cleaning processes which naturally occurs high in
      the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      In the atmosphere, gasses are heated by the sun and they float to
      higher air strata. At lofty altitudes they react with ozone and
      create tiny particles that wash away with precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      Much of that, plus a little more, is what goes on in what Johnson
      calls an atmospheric photochemical accelerator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At one end dirty air is sucked in. It can contain toxic gasses,
      dust, smoke, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, i.e. every
      health hazard that needs to be removed from the air before it can
      be safely breathed.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone is first added to the foul air. Ozone kills microorganisms
      like bacteria and viruses and reacts with certain offensive
      smelling organic compounds. Ozone purifiers have been on the
      market doing this job for some time.<br>
      <br>
      But ozone is a poisonous gas. It’s removed in the photochemical
      accelerator before the air is released from this chamber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Efficient killer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After ozone has killed pathogens and removed bad smells, the
      suspended residue is collected as specks of dust and water vapour
      is added to form an aerosol suspension. This aerosol of compound
      particles and vapour condenses into tiny droplets.<br>
      <br>
      It’s the same process as when clouds form in the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Then the air is irradiated with ultraviolet rays. These UV rays
      have shorter wavelengths than the solar rays that tan or burn our
      skin outdoors.<br>
      <br>
      Matthew Johnson has developed a new, energy-saving air
      purification unit that removes bacteria and viruses, dust and
      toxic gasses from the air, similar to the way the Earth’s
      atmosphere cleans itself, using sunlight, ozone and rain. <br>
      <br>
      These kill bacteria too. Any microorganisms that survived the
      ozone shower encounter a deadly challenge here.<br>
      <br>
      However, the UV rays escalate the attack with another function.
      They react with ozone and water to form bactericidal molecules,
      hydroxyls. <br>
      <br>
      Anything that survives ozone and strong ultraviolet light will
      call it quits when it comes in contact with these hydroxyls. <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="luftrenseanlegg.jpg"

      </div>
      <b>Cloud chamber</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After this initial microbiological death trap the dirty air
      continues to another large chamber. It is given time to circulate
      here while more and more toxic gasses react with ozone and
      hydroxyls and attach to aerosol droplets of ammoniac and water.<br>
      <br>
      This is much the same as what occurs in the atmosphere when water
      vapour collects into raindrops around tiny particles and thus
      cleans the air.<br>
      <br>
      But raindrops fall to the ground carrying pollutants back down to
      us with them.&nbsp; The photochemical accelerator has to do better
      than that.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Given a charge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The dirty fog continues past a powerful electrode and the droplets
      and particles are given a charge. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This electrical charge is fateful. Soon afterwards the polluted
      droplets are drawn into metal plates with an opposite charge. It’s
      an electrostatic filter. The impurities are condensed here and
      removed.<br>
      <br>
      An electrostatic filter has a large advantage on ordinary filters,
      such as charcoal filters. It lets air pass through much more
      freely. It doesn’t require powerful fans to press air through and
      thus saves more energy.<br>
      <br>
      The first commercial model of the air purifier is now working at
      Jysk Miljørens in Aarhus. <br>
      <br>
      The air is now cleansed and nearly ready to be released at the
      opposite end. But first it passes through a catalyst which starts
      chemical reactions that remove any residual poisonous ozone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>It worked</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Testing this principle in a lab is one thing. Getting it to work
      in the chaotic real world is another.<br>
      <br>
      Matthew Johnson took the container with his purification system to
      a firm that was struggling to meet stringent emissions standards.<br>
      <br>
      The company demanded anonymity and the tests were done in secret,
      according to Johnson.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson also wanted to be sure the purifier worked before
      broadcasting news of the tests.<br>
      <br>
      “We cut a hole in their factory chimney and led the polluted air
      through the container. I could demonstrate to them that all the
      pollution had been removed from the airflow,” says Johnson.<br>
      <br>
      <b>First sale</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The experiment was a success. The photochemical accelerator was on
      its way out of the death zone. A group of investors led by the
      Danish firm Infuser had faith in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      In June 2012 they signed a contract with the University of
      Copenhagen and in July the first unit was sold to Jysk
      Miljøindustri.<br>
      <br>
      “In November the first commercial unit was mounted on the
      recirculation plant in Aarhus and we plan to rebuild the container
      for new demonstrations of the purifier,” says Matthew Johnson.<br>

      A method and device for cleaning air. The air to be cleaned is
      directed as a continuous flow in succession through a) a first
      zone wherein the air is treated with ozone and possibly also
      water, ammonia or other aerosol growth promoters; b) a second zone
      wherein the air is subjected to ultraviolet light; c) a third zone
      wherein the air is maintained for a sufficient time to allow
      aerosol growth; d) a fourth zone where particles in the air are
      given an electrical charge; e) a fifth zone wherein the air is
      passed through an electrostatic filter; and f) a sixth zone
      wherein the air flows over a catalyst to break down residual
      ozone.; The air in confined spaces including indoor rooms, public
      vehicles with limited access to fresh air is subjected to a low
      energy consuming universal broad-spectrum removal of the various
      types of indoor air pollution including toxic gases, organic
      compounds, microorganisms and liquid and solid particles being
      hazardous to health and detrimental to quality of life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method and device for
      cleaning pollution from air wherein the air to be cleaned is
      subjected to a sequence of physical and chemical treatments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Indoor air pollution is produced by many sources including
      furniture and building materials, industrial activity, cooking and
      human metabolism. If nothing is done this pollution is detrimental
      to health and the quality of life. The main method for improving
      indoor air quality is dilution: fresh air is brought in from the
      outside. This is expensive because in a cold climate the air must
      be heated and in a warm climate it must be cooled and
      dehumidified.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Presently there is not a device available for cleaning
      large volumes of indoor air cheaply and efficiently. Mechanical
      filtration involves limited conductance and a pressure drop,
      necessitating large fans involving large energy consumption. In
      addition the filter must be changed and can itself become a source
      of bacteria. Electrostatic filtration does not cause a large
      pressure drop, but only removes pre-existing particles; it does
      not act on gas-phase pollution. Ozonolysis is used to remove
      odours but the chemical products of ozonolysis are often more
      hazardous than the original compounds, in addition there are
      important components of indoor air pollution that do not react
      with ozone. UV light is used to sterilize air in hospitals but
      this method removes only a very few specific types of pollution
      from the airstream.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 6,589,486 (Spanton) discloses an air
      purifying apparatus and method suitable for use in a standard
      forced air building Heating, Ventilating and/or Air Conditioning
      system (HVAC) of a building. The air is treated with ultraviolet
      (UV) radiation and ozone. The UV is germicidal and kills
      microorganisms, including both bacteria and viruses. The ozone
      cleans air and removes odours from air. Ozone in combination with
      UV radiation destroys microorganisms which are not killed by the
      UV radiation. Spanton does not disclose how to remove toxic
      gaseous contaminants and particles such as smoke and dust from the
      air. Thus Spanton does not suggest to control the process in order
      to optimize aerosol formation inter alia by ensuring a sufficient
      time to aerosol growth and/or by addition of aerosol formation
      accelerators such as water and ammonia.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] US Patent Application 2004/0120845 (Potember et al.)
      discloses a method and apparatus for neutralizing airborne
      pathogens in ventilated air, and in heating or air conditioning
      systems. The system has a flow-through reaction chamber that
      contains a UV light source that emits short intense flashes of
      broad-spectrum UV light, a source of water vapour or spray, and an
      ozone generator. After the treatment with UV and ozone the air
      passes through a porous matrix and a solid support coated with an
      ozone removal catalyst. The passage through such matrix requires a
      sufficient pressure requiring substantial fan energy consumption.
      Furthermore Potember at al. do not disclose how to remove
      pollution from the air steam using the aerosol particle growth
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,242 (Morrow et al.) discloses an air
      purifier having a perforated plate between UV lamps and a porous
      air filter. Biological material is trapped by the filter and
      killed by the low dose of UV radiation which passes through the
      perforations in the plate. Filtered air passing through the plate
      is subjected to a high dose of UV radiation which sterilizes
      remaining biological material in the air. An electrostatic filter
      at the outlet may trap viruses which have been positively charged
      either by the action of the UV lamps or by positively charging the
      plate in order to strip electrons from the viruses. The UV lamps
      may be mercury lamps which are allowed to emit at both their ozone
      forming wavelength as well as the ozone breakdown wavelength. In
      such instance, a light filter surrounds the lamps which pass light
      only at the ozone breakdown wavelength. Air subjected to the
      unfiltered light is consequently exposed to ozone, which is a
      known biocide. The filtered light is in a zone which is filled
      with water mist such that hydroxyl radicals result. Air passing
      through this zone is scrubbed by the hydroxyl radicals. Morrow et
      al do not disclose how to treat the air with ozone before
      treatment with UV radiation. Morrow does not disclose removal of
      pollution via formation of aerosols. They do not control the
      dosage of ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Electrostatic air purifiers are used to remove particles
      produced by welding. They are also marketed to clean indoor air,
      for example in offices and homes. These systems remove
      pre-existing particles (for example smoke), but do not remove
      toxic gases and other polluting compounds which are not in the
      form of particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Ozone is currently used to remove smells in many fields.
      Examples are kitchen exhaust, livestock barns and wastewater
      treatment plants. However the products of ozonolysis are typically
      more irritating and toxic than the original compounds so this is
      not a satisfactory solution as the air must be diluted
      substantially before it is safe to breathe.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] UV light is used in air circulation systems of some
      hospitals to sterilize air. However, this application is not able
      to remove many types of pollution including most gas phase
      chemicals and particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The object of the present invention is to meet the demand
      of a universal or "broad-spectrum" removal of air pollution in an
      efficient and simple way with minimum energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for
      cleaning air wherein the air to be cleaned is directed as a
      continuous flow in succession through<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) a first zone wherein the air is treated with ozone;<br>
      <br>
      b) a second zone wherein the air is subjected to ultraviolet
      light;<br>
      <br>
      c) a third zone wherein the air is maintained for a sufficient
      time to allow aerosol growth;<br>
      <br>
      d) a fourth zone wherein particles in the air are provided with an
      electrical charge<br>
      <br>
      e) a fifth zone wherein the air is passed through an electrostatic
      filter; and<br>
      <br>
      f) a sixth zone wherein the air flows over a catalyst to break
      down residual ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] By "sufficient time to allow aerosol growth" as used
      herein, is meant a time in which a significant fraction of the
      actual pollution to be removed such as at least 60, 70 or 80% by
      weight, preferably 90% by weight, most preferably 99% by weight,
      of pollution which is able itself or whose reaction products are
      able to be removed by aerosol formation are removed from the
      airstream. In addition, pollution may be removed by concomitant
      photochemical processes, including ozonolysis, photolysis and
      radical reactions. The time required for aerosol formation may be
      dependent on the actual type and amount of pollution to be removed
      and can be estimated by the person skilled in the art based on
      relevant analyses. The required time may be ensured by proper
      design of the dimensions of the third zone (c) and/or the
      temperature in the third zone (c) and/or the airflow velocity in
      the third zone (c).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention also relates to an air cleaning
      device including a channel with an air inlet for air to be cleaned
      and an air outlet for cleaned air and means for leading air
      through the channel from the inlet to the outlet wherein the
      channel has following zones in succession:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) a first zone having a source of ozone;<br>
      <br>
      b) a second zone having a source of ultraviolet light;<br>
      <br>
      c) a third zone having a dimension which allows aerosol growth;<br>
      <br>
      d) a fourth zone having an electrical discharge generator;<br>
      <br>
      e) a fifth zone having one or more electrostatic filters; and<br>
      <br>
      f) a sixth zone having a catalyst for removal of residual ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention provides a desirable "broad-spectrum"
      removal of the various types of indoor air pollution including
      irritating and/or toxic gases, organic compounds, microorganisms
      and liquid and solid particles being hazardous to health and
      detrimental to quality of life. Thus, the combined treatments not
      only kill microorganisms but also subject toxic and hazardous
      compounds to chemical reactions followed by agglomeration or
      capture of the resulting compounds together with small particles
      including dust and smoke in an aerosol growth zone resulting in
      aerosol particles sufficiently large to be removed from the air in
      an electrostatic filter after the aerosol particles have been
      electrically charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] An advantage by the present inventive method is that the
      pressure drop through the device is relatively small whereby the
      energy consumption for the necessary air flow is low.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A further advantage is that the air can be cleaned
      sufficiently for reuse in larger and smaller rooms without or with
      a minimum of fresh air supply. Accordingly, it is possible to
      reduce the need for fresh air supply, and thereby reduce the
      energy required to heat or cool and dehumidify said fresh air.
      This makes the present invention suitable for use in rooms where
      access to fresh air is difficult or impossible.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In an embodiment of the inventive method the amount of
      ozone delivered into the first zone (a) is regulated through a
      feed-back system based on measurements by an ozone sensor situated
      in the third zone (c) and/or an ozone sensor situated in the fifth
      zone (e) and/or an ozone sensor situated in the sixth zone (f)
      which ozone sensor(s) ensure that no residual ozone escapes into
      the environment from the sixth zone (f).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Thus in one embodiment of the inventive method the amount
      of ozone delivered into the first zone (a) is regulated through a
      feed-back system based on measurements by an ozone sensor situated
      after the sixth zone (f) ensuring that no residual ozone escapes
      into the environment from the sixth zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] To ensure a suitable amount of ozone in the first, second
      and third zones the amount of ozone delivered into the first zone
      (a) may be regulated through a feed-back system based on
      measurements by an ozone sensor situated in the third zone (c).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a further embodiment the amount of ozone delivered into
      the first zone (a) may be regulated through a feed-back system
      based on combined measurements by ozone sensors after the sixth
      zone (f) and/or between the fifth (e) and the sixth (f) zone
      and/or in the third zone (c).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The electrical charge provided to the particles in the
      fourth zone (d) may be provided by a corona discharge or exposure
      to ionizing radiation from a radioactive source. The corona
      discharge is a simple, cheap and effective method for providing
      electrical charge to the particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Thus, in a preferred embodiment the electrical charge in
      the fourth zone (d) is provided by a corona discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] As explained above an important feature of the inventive
      method is the formation and growth of an aerosol. In case the air
      to be treated already contains sufficient moisture or other
      aerosol growth promoters further addition of such promoters may be
      unnecessary. However, depending on the air to be treated it is
      often preferred to add one or more aerosol growth promoters such
      as water and/or ammonia in the first zone (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Accordingly, the air cleaning device according to the
      invention preferably includes an injection system for the
      injection of ammonia and/or water vapour in the first zone (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] A preferred catalyst for removal of residual ozone is
      manganese dioxide or cerium oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The extent of applicability of the invention appears from
      the following detailed description. It should, however, be
      understood that the detailed description and the specific examples
      are merely included to illustrate the preferred embodiments and
      that various alterations and modifications within the scope of
      protection will be obvious to persons skilled in the art on the
      basis of the detailed description.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] The invention is explained in detail below with reference
      to the drawing, in which<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0028] FIG. 1 is a schematic view of the inventive air cleaning
        device.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] The present invention relates to a method and device for
      removing pollution from air within a building ventilation system,
      air in a room or air in connection with a local source of
      pollution. In the following description, numerous specific details
      are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the
      present invention. It will, however, be apparent to a person
      skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced
      without these specific details.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] One application of the present invention is to clean air in
      buildings, but a person skilled in the art would know that the
      method may equally well be used in other installations, such as
      without limitation, a small unit to clean air in a room or office,
      a train, an airplane or any other confined space with no or
      limited access to clean/fresh air. This small unit may or may not
      be portable.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] To assure that all contaminated air enters and passes
      through the air cleaning system, the chamber air inlet and outlet
      may be adapted to fit the existing ducts using methods known in
      the art so that no air is allowed to bypass the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In one embodiment, the chamber air inlet/outlet is adapted
      to fit an existing HVAC air circulation system of, for example, a
      building.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 1 shows schematically an embodiment of the air
      cleaning device according to the invention arranged as a channel 1
      with an inlet 2 for the air to be cleaned and an outlet 3 for the
      cleaned air. The airflow is provided with per se known means such
      as a fan (not shown). The inner side of the channel 1 comprises a
      first zone (a), a second zone (b) a third zone (c), a fourth zone
      (d), a fifth zone (e) and a sixth zone (f) placed successively in
      the airflow direction from left to right in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A source of ozone 4 feeds ozone to the first zone (a) for
      ozone treatment of the air. Furthermore, the first zone (a) is
      optionally provided with one or more sources 5 of aerosol growth
      accelerators feeding water, ammonia and/or other aerosol growth
      accelerators into the first zone (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The next zone, the second zone (b), has a source of
      ultraviolet light for example UV lamps 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] After the treatment first with ozone and then with UV
      radiation the air is maintained for sufficient time ensuring the
      desired chemical reactions including aerosol formation and growth
      in a third zone for aerosol growth (c). In the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 1 the necessary time is obtained by a broadening of the
      channel 1 giving a slower air velocity through the third zone (c).
      In an alternative embodiment the third zone (c) could be elongated
      using the same channel diameter throughout the zones (a)-(f).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The fourth zone (d) contains a source of electrical charge
      such as corona wires 7. By this means the solid and liquid
      particles in the aerosol as well as larger molecules will be
      electrically charged and caught in the fifth zone (e) containing
      an electrostatic filter element 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] After the fifth zone (e) possible excess of ozone is
      removed from the air in the sixth zone (f) containing an ozone
      removal catalyst 9 where after the cleaned air leaves the channel
      1 through the outlet 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] To control the ozone treatment and ensure that the air
      leaving through the outlet 3 is substantially free of ozone, i.e.
      below the acceptable threshold limiting value, one or more ozone
      sensors are provided in the channel 1. Thus a first ozone sensor
      10 may be placed near the end of the third zone (c), a second
      ozone sensor 11 may be placed between the fifth and sixth zones
      (e) and (f) and/or a third ozone sensor 12 after the sixth zone
      (f) at the outlet 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The amount of ozone provided by the ozone source 4 may be
      regulated through a feed-back system based on measurements by one
      or more of the sensors 10, 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The channel 1 can also be provided with one or more further
      sensors (not shown) for the measurement of other relevant
      conditions such as temperature, relative humidity and
      concentration of relevant contaminants. Together with the ozone
      measurements such measurements may be usable for regulation,
      control and monitoring purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) First Zone: Treatment with Ozone<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In principle any source of ozone may be used in the
      treatment with ozone in the first zone provided the ozone can be
      delivered or generated in the desired amounts and in a safe way.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In a preferred embodiment the ozone source is an ozone
      generator as for example a corona discharge generator. While ozone
      can be generated using UV light, this is too inefficient and
      expensive at the present time. However, should the technology
      advance for generating ozone using UV or other methods, it may be
      incorporated into the present invention. Electric corona discharge
      generators produce large quantities of ozone in a short time. The
      passage of a high voltage, alternating electric current through an
      air stream containing oxygen breaks down molecular oxygen to
      atomic oxygen. These oxygen atoms may react to form ozone.
      Commercial ozone generators are available in various shapes and
      sizes with various capacities for generating ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In another preferred embodiment the ozone source is an
      ozone generator from O3 Technology which is based on a technology
      wherein oxygen or air is passed through parallel plates, and a
      charge is maintained by an AC voltage. The amount of ozone that
      enters the system is controlled by controlling the gas flow from
      this generator. This unit will produce the majority of the ozone
      in the system/reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Ozone oxidizes aromatic- and unsaturated-hydrocarbons.
      However many kinds of compounds/chemicals, such as saturated
      hydrocarbons and material trapped in the liquid or solid phases of
      aerosols, do not react with ozone. Other indoor air pollutants
      that do not react with ozone include carbon monoxide and
      formaldehyde. Pollen and cigarette smoke react with ozone, but are
      not removed by ozonolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The ozone acts as a biocide killing biological material,
      such as bacteria, moulds and the like in the air. Ozone is a
      naturally occurring substance which cleans air and removes odours
      from air.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The photochemical oxidation by O3, OH and other species in
      the reaction region will mainly result in additional oxygen
      containing functional groups (e.g. alcohols, carbonyls, acids,
      etc.) on organic pollution molecules. Each functional group will
      reduce the vapour pressure of the organic molecule increasing its
      propensity for forming aerosols.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The first zone may in addition to an ozone source also,
      optionally, contain an injection system, i.e. a water source, for
      the introduction of water vapour (which also includes humid air),
      or small water droplets and the step of introducing ozone to the
      zone is performed by forming either a mixture of water vapour
      and/or water droplets and ozone before introducing the mixture
      into the zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] A further, optional, addition may comprise an injection
      system for the introduction of ammonia, i.e. an ammonia source.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Addition of water or ammonia promotes aerosol formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The dimensions of the first zone should be designed to
      ensure the necessary treatment time t1 in the zone defined as the
      time from the point where the air contacts the ozone to the point
      immediately before it is subjected to UV. The necessary time t1
      depends on various factors including the type of contamination,
      the ozone source and the temperature. Based on the required flow
      rates in an HVAC system and the dimensions, t1 should typically be
      less than 15 seconds, preferably less than 10 seconds, such as
      less than 8 seconds. Typically t1 should be above 1 second,
      preferably above 5 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] b) Second Zone: Irradiation with Ultraviolet Light<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The ultraviolet light source used in the second zone may be
      any conventional source providing UV-C light. Such UV-C light is
      per se a biocide because it denatures DNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Broad-spectrum ultraviolet light with a wavelength between
      100 and 330 nm causes ozone and water to react forming highly
      reactive ozone-based free radical intermediates, such as hydroxyl
      radicals, that in turn react with and neutralize airborne
      pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] UV-C light initially breaks down the ozone, exiting from
      the first zone, into oxygen (O2) and an electronically excited
      oxygen atom (O*) also termed an oxygen radical.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In the presence of water this excited oxygen radical may
      react with water (moisture) in the air and form hydroxyl radicals:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O*+H2O-&gt;2.OH<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Furthermore, the excited oxygen radical may react with a
      hydrocarbon or with an oxygen molecule to reform ozone:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O3+h[nu]-&gt;O2+O*<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O*+H2O-&gt;2.OH<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O*+RH-&gt;OH+.R<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O*+M-&gt;O+M<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O+O2+M-&gt;O3+M<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where<br>
      h[nu] is photon with a wavelength below 330 nm,<br>
      .OH is a hydroxyl radical,<br>
      RH is a hydrocarbon and<br>
      M is a collision partner, usually N2 or O2.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Hydrocarbon radicals (.R) may react by addition or
      fragmentation to obtain aldehydes, ketones, acids, alcohols or
      other functionalised hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Thus in the second zone, some of the ozone will be broken
      down into oxygen gas and hydroxyl radicals. It will also be
      recognised by those skilled in the art that hydroxyl radicals can
      also form peroxides, which themselves can act as biocides.
      Therefore, these peroxides, in addition to the hydroxyl radicals,
      assist in killing any living biological material which may enter
      the zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Hydrocarbons may react with hydroxyl radicals:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CH4+.OH-&gt;.CH3+H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      .CH3+O2+M-&gt;.CH3O2+M<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      .CH3O2+NO-&gt;.CH3O+NO2<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      .CH3O+O2-&gt;CH2O+.HO2<br>
      <br>
      [0060] NO is present in the background air. Any kind of
      hydrocarbon will make an oxy radical like the methoxy radical
      above, and this radical can donate an H to O2 to form a stable
      aldehyde/ketone and .HO2. Another source of H2O2 will be:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      .HO2+.HO2-&gt;H2O2+O2<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Ozone in combination with UV radiation, which may form
      hydroxyl radicals and/or peroxides, destroys microorganisms which
      are not killed by the UV radiation as such.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The free radicals formed by the interaction of ozone with
      water in the presence of UV light, act as oxidants on cell walls
      even before they penetrate inside the microorganisms where they
      oxidize essential components such as enzymes and proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Ozone does not itself react significantly with either water
      or oxygen in the absence of UV irradiation. Water and air merely
      provide the medium in which ozone diffuses to react with organic
      molecules such as those on the outside of the cell wall of
      pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moulds or pollen. UV
      irradiation causes ozone to react with water and to decompose into
      various highly reactive free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The dimensions of the second zone should be designed to
      ensure the necessary treatment time t2 in this zone defined as the
      time from the point where the air it is subjected to UV to the
      point where it leaves the UV radiation. The required time t2
      depends on various factors including the type of contamination,
      the treatment in the first zone, the UV radiation source and the
      temperature. Typically t2 should be less than five minutes,
      preferably less than 10 seconds, such as less than 8 seconds.
      Typically t2 should be longer than 50 ms, preferably above 0.1
      second, such as above 5 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] t2 should be relatively long time as carbon monoxide reacts
      rather slowly with OH, in order to remove it a treatment time of
      up to five minutes may be needed.<br>
      <br>
      c) Third Zone: Aerosol Growth<br>
      <br>
      [0066] An important feature of the inventive method is that an
      aerosol growth zone is provided after the second zone of UV
      treatment. The purpose of this zone is to allow particles to grow,
      removing pollution from the gas phase. One problem by prior art
      air purification is that smells of cooking oil and diesel or
      heating oil cannot be removed, even by ozone. Due to the use and
      formation of .OH, other radicals derived from ozone or other
      sources, and aerosols these pollutants can be removed by the
      inventive method.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The aerosol growth chamber may involve increasing the cross
      sectional area of the flow duct in order to decrease the flow
      rate, allowing time for the aerosols to grow.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Accordingly, the dimensions of the third zone should be
      designed to ensure the necessary retention time t3 in this zone
      defined as the time from the point where the air leaves the second
      zone of UV radiation to the point immediately before it enters
      into the electrostatic filter in the fourth zone. The necessary
      time t3 depends on various factors including the type of
      contamination, the treatments in the first and second zones, and
      the temperature. Typically t3 should be less than five minutes,
      preferably less than 10 seconds, such as less than 8 seconds.
      Typically t3 should be longer than 50 ms, preferably above 0.1
      second, such as above 5 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      d) Fourth Zone: Electrical Charge<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In the fourth zone the air leaving the second zone is
      subjected to a source providing the molecules, particles and
      droplets with an electrical charge enabling removal thereof with
      an electrostatic filter in the following zone. In a preferred
      embodiment the source of electrical charge is a corona discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A small, negligible, amount of ozone is produced by the
      corona discharge wires. However, this is a by-product and it
      contributes only a minor amount of the total ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The corona discharge in the fourth zone gives an electrical
      charge to particles in the airstream allowing them to be removed
      by the electrostatic filter in the fifth zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] It is possible that charging the particles will improve
      aerosol particle trapping because the agglomeration of oppositely
      charged particles will increase particle size, and the presence of
      charge will improve the thermodynamics of particle growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Heavier combined particles may precipitate (fall) out of
      the air when two smaller particles agglomerate.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The dimensions of the fourth zone should be designed to
      ensure the necessary treatment time t4 in this zone defined as the
      time from the point where the air it is subjected to an electrical
      charge to the point immediately before it enters into the
      electrostatic filter. The necessary time t4 depends on various
      factors including the type of contamination, the treatments in the
      first and second zones, the source of the electrical charge and
      the temperature. This time need not be long. The requirement is
      that the aerosols are charged before the electrostatic filter in
      the fifth zone, and this is a fast process. In most cases t4
      should be between 0.01 and 2 seconds, preferably 0.05-1.0 seconds,
      such as 0.1-0.8 second.<br>
      <br>
      e) Fifth Zone: Passage Through Electrostatic Filter<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Any electrostatic precipitator can be used in the present
      invention. An electrostatic precipitator is a particulate
      collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such
      as air) using the force of an induced electrostatic charge.
      Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration
      devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the zone,
      and can efficiently remove fine particulate matter such as smoke
      or dust from the air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Smaller particles, which are not heavy enough to
      precipitate, are forced out through electrostatic filtration. The
      electrostatic filtration comprises charged metal plates, with
      alternating positive and negative charges, where positive
      aerosol-particles will accelerate into the negative plates and
      negative aerosol-particles will accelerate into the positive
      plates.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The addition of moisture, ammonia and/or other agents to
      the incoming air improves the efficiency of trapping pollution and
      pollution oxidation products through the mechanism of aerosol
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The dimensions of the fifth zone should be designed to
      ensure the necessary treatment time t5 in this zone defined as the
      time from the point where the air enters into the electrostatic
      filter to the point immediately before it contacts the catalyst
      for removal of residual ozone. The necessary time t5 depends on
      various factors including the type of contamination, the
      treatments and reactions in the first, second, third and fourth
      zones, the type of electrostatic filter and the temperature.
      Generally this time need not be long.<br>
      <br>
      f) Sixth Zone: Removal of Residual Ozone<br>
      <br>
      [0079] A catalyst for removal of residual ozone is essential for
      the present invention, since prolonged exposure to elevated
      concentrations of ozone may irritate the respiratory system and
      harm the lungs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
      classifies average 8-hour exposures of 85 to 105 parts per billion
      as unhealthy for sensitive groups. Concentrations higher than this
      increase the risks.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] To ensure that no harmful residual ozone will contaminate
      the air that exits the sixth zone, one or more ozone removal
      catalysts known in the art may be placed in that zone. Ozone
      removal catalysts that can be used in various embodiments include,
      manganese dioxide, all-aluminium catalyst, a carbon-supported
      metal oxide, copper chloride-coated carbon fibres, carbon-iron
      aerosol particles, and metal catalysts. CARULITE(R) (an inorganic
      oxide) made by Carus Chemical Company is another ozone removal
      catalyst. The catalyst may be solid-supported, and any solid
      support may be used, especially glass or silica which substances
      can catalyze ozone decomposition. The catalyst could also comprise
      manganese dioxide containing paint.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The catalyst for removal of residual ozone will have a
      large surface area for contacting the air containing the residual
      ozone. The sixth zone should also have a minimum pressure drop. To
      this end the catalyst material may be applied in the shape of a
      honeycomb (hexagonal shape).<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The unstable and highly reactive free radical intermediates
      obtained from ozone, e.g. hydroxyl radicals, form stable products
      including water and carbon dioxide that are not associated with
      health risks when present in air at small concentrations. The
      decomposition of ozone into stable oxygen is accelerated by
      surfaces that act as substrates and/or reaction-sites for the
      decomposition process.<br>
      <br>
      Feed-Back System/Ozone Sensors:<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The device will be equipped with ozone sensors for safety
      and efficient control. For example an ozone sensor in the aerosol
      growth chamber (third zone) would help to control ozone dosage in
      response to changing pollution levels, and a sensor at the exit of
      the device will ensure the overall safe operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Examples of the chemical and/or physical reactions believed
      to occur during the inventive method include:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] A. Unsaturated (including aromatic) hydrocarbons, for
      example benzene and isoprene, react directly with ozone in the
      first zone (a) where ozone is added, or with ozone found later in
      the system for example in the aerosol growth chamber of third zone
      (c). In principle, the reaction with ozone could take place
      anywhere where ozone is present that is from the first zone (a)
      where ozone is added until it is removed by the catalyst in the
      sixth zone (f).<br>
      B. Saturated hydrocarbons including small species such as methane
      or propane and larger molecules such as diesel or cooking oil, and
      some other species including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde will
      react with the hydroxyl radical .OH or other ozone-based radicals
      formed when O3 is photolysed by the UV lamps in the presence of
      water vapour.<br>
      C. The products of the reactions of type A and B will typically
      condense onto aerosol particles, either pre-existing particles or
      newly nucleated particles. (Sometimes however the products will
      include volatile species as CO2 that are less polluting than the
      precursors). All particles will be removed from the airstream by
      the electrostatic filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The present invention can be applicable in a variety of
      places such as, but not limited to:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 1) cleaning air in buildings or rooms, for example offices,
      kitchens and apartments, to improve air quality and reduce cost of
      bringing in fresh air;<br>
      2) cleaning air in airplanes or other vehicles having confined
      spaces with no or limited access to fresh/clean air which would
      reduce disease transmission, reduce amount of fresh air brought in
      from outside;<br>
      3) provide clean air for people with allergies to chemicals or
      particles;<br>
      4) providing clean sterile air in hospitals; and<br>
      5) at point sources of air pollution, to remove for example oil
      used as part of a manufacturing process or fuel oil/diesel fumes.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In the foregoing description, the invention has been
      described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will,
      however be evident that various modifications and changes may be
      made to the invention without departing from the broader scope of
      the present invention. The present application will be described
      in further detail, by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0087] In a building with a total volume of free space of 60.000
      m&lt;3 &gt;and provided with a standard Heating, Ventilating
      and/or Air Conditioning system (HVAC) the air cleaning device as
      described in FIG. 1 is installed in the HVAC system. The air flow
      through of the device is 7200 m&lt;3&gt;/h giving a flow velocity
      of 5 m/s in the first and second zones ensuring the required
      treatment times in the first, second, fourth and fifth zones.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The ozone source in the first zone provides 200 g/h ozone
      giving an ozone concentration of 14 ppm inside the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The outlet air, in comparison to the inlet air, shows
      significantly reduced concentrations of several classes of
      pollution including particles, scents including perfumes,
      hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide and
      formaldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0090] The air cleaning system described in FIG. 1 is installed in
      an office, apartment, hospital room, kitchen or other smaller room
      with a volume of roughly 100 cubic meters. A freestanding enclosed
      air cleaning unit as described in FIG. 1 including a fan is placed
      in the room. It has a flow rate of 2 m/s and cross section of 0.02
      square meters giving a flow rate of 0.04 cubic meters per second,
      meaning that on average air will circulate through the device
      every 40 minutes. The device can be used to eliminate air
      pollution from the room, including volatile chemicals, smoke,
      odours and allergens.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0091] The air cleaning system described in FIG. 1 is used to
      treat air from a local source of pollution, for example oil
      vapours given off by the cutting tool of a lathe or mill, in
      association with use of diesel or heating oil in a building, or
      when solvents are used for painting or gluing. The air from the
      process is drawn through the device by a fan and the pollution is
      prevented from entering the rest of the room or building.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The above description of the invention reveals that it is
      obvious that it can be varied in many ways. Such variations are
      not to be considered a deviation from the scope of the invention,
      and all such modifications which are obvious to persons skilled in
      the art are also to be considered comprised by the scope of the
      succeeding claims.<br>
