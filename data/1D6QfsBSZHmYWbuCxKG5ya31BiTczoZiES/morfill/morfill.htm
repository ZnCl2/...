            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      MRSA (methicillin-resistant Straphylococcus Aureus) and other
      drug-resistant bacteria could face annihilation as low-temperature
      plasma prototype devices have been developed to offer safe, quick,
      easy and unfailing bactericidal cocktails.<br>
      <br>
      Two prototype devices have been developed: one for efficient
      disinfection of healthy skin (e.g. hands and feet) in hospitals
      and public spaces where bacteria can pose a lethal threat; and
      another to shoot bacteria-killing agents into infested chronic
      wounds and enable a quicker healing process.<br>
      <br>
      Two papers published today, Thursday 26 November, as part of a
      selection of papers on Plasma Medicine in New Journal of Physics
      (co-owned by the Institute of Physics and German Physical
      Society), demonstrate how far the design of equipment to harness
      the bacteria-killing power of low-temperature plasma has come.<br>
      <br>
      Plasma, oft called the fourth state of matter after solid, liquid
      and gas, is defined by its ionized state. In space, stars are made
      up of high-energy plasma and, on Earth, it is researchers in
      high-energy plasma that are making significant strides towards
      limitless energy from nuclear fusion. The high energy of plasma
      stems from some atoms or molecules in a gas being stripped of
      their electrons, resulting in a mix of ionized and neutral
      species.<br>
      <br>
      Also on Earth, scientists have been working on low-temperature and
      atmospheric-pressure plasma and have found applications in a range
      of industries, from plastic bag production to the manufacturing of
      streetlamps and semiconductor circuits.<br>
      <br>
      In a low-temperature plasma, unlike its high-temperature
      counterparts, the temperature of ions and neutral particles stays
      low. The ‘recipe’ for producing such plasmas is simple: the
      fraction of atoms (molecules) that are ionized – and therefore are
      hot – is so low that collisions with cold neutral atoms
      (molecules) quickly reduce their temperature again. The analogy of
      adding a drop of hot water to a bucket of cold water gives a sense
      of how low-temperature plasma physicists are able to create
      plasmas without dramatically increasing the temperature of the
      overall molecules.<br>
      <br>
      In medicine, low-temperature plasma is already used for the
      sterilization of surgical instruments as plasma works at the
      atomic level and is able to reach all surfaces, even the interior
      of hollow needle ends. Its ability to disinfect is due to the
      generation of biologically active bactericidal agents, such as
      free radicals and UV light, which can be delivered to specific
      locations. It is research into how and why these biologically
      active agents are generated that has led to the construction of
      medically invaluable devices.<br>
      <br>
      One research group from the Max Planck Institute for
      Extraterrestrial Physics has built and trialed a device which is
      capable of disinfecting human skin safely and quickly (within
      seconds), annihilating drug-resistant kinds of bacteria that
      currently cause approximately 37 000 deaths from hospital induced
      infections every year in EU countries.<br>
      <br>
      On the current disinfection challenge that medical staff face, and
      that their device will overcome, the researchers write, “The
      surgeons’ disinfection procedure – hand rubbing (3 minutes) or
      hand scrubbing (5 minutes) – has to be repeated many times a day,
      with a number of negative side-effects arising from the mechanical
      irritation, chemical and, possibly, allergic stress for the skin.
      For the hospital staff, the issue of hand disinfection is equally
      daunting. Over a typical working day, some 60 to 100 disinfections
      (in principle) are necessary – each requiring 3 minutes – i.e. a
      total of 3 to 5 hours!”<br>
      <br>
      The new plasma devices under development cut this down
      dramatically – to around ten minutes a day. In addition, only
      electricity is needed, no fluids or containers.<br>
      <br>
      Another device, an ‘argon plasma torch’, was developed by this
      group, together with ADTEC Plasma Technology Ltd in Japan,
      specifically for disinfecting chronic non-healing wounds. One
      advantage of the ‘argon plasma torch’ comes from regulating
      densities of biologically-active agents which are designed to
      ensure that the plasma is deadly for bacteria but harmless for
      human cells.<br>
      <br>
      Cell biological studies, conducted together with partners from the
      Institute of Pathology, Technical University of Munich, are
      reported and interpreted in terms of chemical reactions which work
      differently in bacterial and human cells – deadly to the bacteria
      and supporting cell regeneration in human cells.<br>
      <br>
      After successful trials that show how plasma can be manipulated to
      very beneficial ends, these researchers write, “One can treat
      plasmas like a medical cocktail, which contains new and
      established agents that can be applied at the molecular level to
      cells in prescribed intensities and overall doses.”<br>
      <br>
      This work represents a first step in the direction of ‘plasma
      pharmacology’, a step along a path that will require considerable
      research efforts to harness the full potential of this new field
      of ‘plasma medicine’.<br>
      <br>
      Both research papers describe the mechanics of their trials, the
      safety concerns they endeavour to overcome, the remarkable
      bactericidal effect they have successfully achieved, and the
      positive cell regeneration effects that can be stimulated using
      plasmas.<br>

      <br>
      Researchers have demonstrated a prototype device that can rid
      hands, feet, or even underarms of bacteria, including the hospital
      superbug MRSA.<br>
      <br>
      The device works by creating something called a plasma, which
      produces a cocktail of chemicals in air that kill bacteria but are
      harmless to skin.<br>
      <br>
      A related approach could see the use of plasmas to speed the
      healing of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      Writing in the New Journal of Physics, the authors say plasmas
      could help solve gum disease or even body odour.<br>
      <br>
      Plasmas are known as the fourth state of matter, after solid,
      liquid, and gas. They are a soup of atoms that have had their
      electrons stripped off by, for example, a high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Plasmas are common elsewhere in the cosmos, where high-energy
      processes produce them, and they are even posited as a potential
      source of fusion energy. Their properties have recently been
      harvested for use in plasma televisions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deadly cocktail</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      But the new research focuses on so-called cold atmospheric
      plasmas.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than turning a whole group of atoms into plasma, a more
      delicate approach strips the electrons off just a few, sending
      them flying.<br>
      <br>
      Collisions with nearby, unchanged atoms slows down the electrons
      and charged atoms or ions they leave behind.<br>
      <br>
      It has been known for some time that the resulting plasma is
      harmful to bacteria, viruses, and fungi – the approach is already
      used to disinfect surgical tools.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s actually similar to what our own immune system does,” said
      Gregor Morfill, of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial
      Physics, who led the research.<br>
      <br>
      “The plasma produces a series of over 200 chemical reactions that
      involve the oxygen and nitrogen in air plus water vapour – there
      is a whole concotion of chemical species that can be lethal to
      bacteria,” he told BBC News. …<br>
      <br>
      “To produce plasmas efficiently at low cost so you can really mass
      produce these things for hospitals, that’s the big breakthrough of
      the last year,” Professor Morfill said.<br>
      <br>
      The team says that an exposure to the plasma of only about 12
      seconds reduces the incidence of bacteria, viruses, and fungi on
      hands by a factor of a million – a number that stands in sharp
      contrast to the several minutes hospital staff can take to wash
      using traditional soap and water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">More applications</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Professor Morfill said that the approach can be used to kill the

      <br>
      Two related studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
      low-temperature plasma for killing drug-resistant bacteria on
      human skin – one of the biggest challenges facing modern medicine.
      In one study, researchers in Germany describe a device that can
      disinfect hands in seconds, while in the other they reveal how
      low-temperature plasmas can safely disinfect open wounds.<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial infection is a serious problem in hospitals. Studies
      show that the infamous superbug methicillin-resistant
      Straphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) alone infects 100,000 people every
      year in the US and results in about 18,000 deaths.<br>
      <br>
      The best way to tackle the problem is disinfectant, but this can
      be laborious. Every day hospital staff must disinfect their hands
      on dozens of occasions, each taking up to several minutes. Keeping
      open wounds free from bacteria can be even harder.<br>
      Cool plasmas<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, scientists have begun to investigate how plasmas
      – gases of ions and free electrons – can help. A fully ionized
      plasma can have a temperature in the region of 100,000°, which is
      far too hot for human tissue, but the temperature can be reduced
      if the degree of ionization is much lower, at say one part in a
      billion.<br>
      <br>
      Gregor Morfill and colleagues at the Max-Planck Institute for
      Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching have shown how
      low-temperature plasmas can be used to clean hands conveniently in
      seconds. Their device contains a slab of dielectric material
      sandwiched between a solid electrode and a sheet of wire mesh.
      When they put a large voltage of 18 kV across the solid electrode
      and mesh, the resultant strong electric field generates numerous
      nano- and microsecond discharges that partially ionize the air.
      This ionization leaves ultraviolet radiation and a cocktail of
      chemical products – including ozone, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen
      peroxide and free radicals – which together kill bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      "It will even sterilize your socks, although you should probably
      wash them too" Gregor Morfill, Max-Planck Institute for
      Extraterrestrial Physics <br>
      <br>
      Morfill told physicsworld.com that hospital staff could use the
      device routinely to clean hands and, if so desired, feet. "It will
      even sterilize your socks, although you should probably wash them
      too," he adds.<br>
      <br>
      With other colleagues at the Max-Planck Institute, Morfill has
      examined the best way to use low-temperature plasma for cleaning
      open wounds. In some ways this is more difficult because ideally
      the plasma would not only kill bacteria but also prevent further
      growth of bacteria without having any negative side-effects on the
      living human cells.<br>
      Chemicals and plasma<br>
      <br>
      The researchers performed a series of tests in which they
      subjected E. coli bacteria to both the chemical and UV products of
      plasma and, by shielding the bacteria with a quartz disc, just the
      UV products. They found that the UV radiation tended to kill
      bacteria in the short term, whereas the chemical products cause a
      lasting "after irradiation" inhibition of bacterial growth. With
      this knowledge, the researchers could determine the right
      composition and dosage of plasmas for future devices.<br>
      <br>
      One of the group members, Tetyana Nosenko, said that the next step
      is to optimize the plasma composition for different types of
      wound, such as diabetic ulcers or those containing blood.<br>
      <br>
      The research is described in two papers in the New Journal of
      Physics.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003]The use of non-equilibrium plasmas for the in vivo
      sterilization of wounds has been discussed in Stoffels, E.;
      Stoffels, W.: "The healing touch of a micro-plasma", published on
      http://www.phys.tue.nl. However, the in vivo sterilization of
      wounds requires low temperatures of the plasma and a low
      electromagnetic irradiation, so that the conventional plasma
      sources are not suitable for the in vivo sterilization of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]Further, U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,885 discloses a plasma spray
      apparatus for spraying powdery or gaseous material onto a
      substrate surface, e.g. for coating the substrate. However, due to
      the high temperature of the plasma output, this plasma spray
      apparatus is not suitable for the in vivo sterilisation of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]A so-called plasma needle is disclosed in Stoffels, E. et
      al.: "Plasma needle: a non-destructive atmospheric plasma source
      for fine surface treatment of (bio)materials", Plasma Source Sci.
      Technol. 11 (2002) 383-388. This plasma needle comprises a single
      electrode being disposed within a grounded metal cylinder with 1
      cm inner diameter. However, the aforementioned plasma needle is
      not suitable for a large-area sterilisation of wounds since the
      outlet of the metal cylinder is very small.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]Moreover, US 2004/0138527 A1 discloses a tubular suction
      tool for accessing an anatomic surface or anatomic space and
      particularly the pericardium to access pericardial space and the
      epicardial surface of the heart to implant cardiac leads in a
      minimally invasive manner are disclosed. Therefore, this reference
      is not pertinent to the present application.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007]It is therefore an aspect of an exemplary embodiment the
      invention to improve the afore-mentioned plasma source.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]As an example, an embodiment provides a plasma source, which
      is suitable for the large-area in vivo sterilization of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]According to an illustrative example, a plasma source is
      provided comprising an ionization chamber having an inlet for
      introducing a gas into the ionization chamber and further having
      an outlet for dispensing the ionized gas onto an object, e.g. a
      wound of a patient. Further, the plasma source comprises several
      ionization electrodes being disposed within the ionization chamber
      for ionizing the gas. In the plasma source there is a specified
      distance between adjacent ionization electrodes and also a
      specified distance between each ionization electrode and the inner
      wall of the ionization chamber. Further, the plasma source is
      characterized by a specified ratio of the electrode-electrode
      distance on the one hand and the electrode-wall distance on the
      other end, wherein the ratio is in a range between 1.8 and 2.2. In
      one embodiment, the ratio of the electrode-electrode distance on
      the one hand and the electrode-wall distance on the other hand is
      substantially 2, i.e. the electrode-electrode distance is two
      times bigger than the electrode-wall distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]This ratio advantageously results in both an easy discharge
      trigger and a steady operation of all ionization electrodes.
      Therefore, the plasma source provides a large plasma output with a
      low energy input, so that the plasma source is well suitable for
      in vivo applications, e.g. sterilization of wounds, treatment of
      bacteriological, fungicidal and viral skin disorders, since it
      combines a comparatively low temperature of the plasma with a low
      electromagnetic irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]It should be noted that the afore-mentioned values for the
      ratio between the electrode-electrode distance on the one hand and
      the electrode-wall distance on the other end may refer to the end
      o the ionization electrodes, where the plasma is actually
      generated. For example, the inner diameter of the ionization
      chamber might vary along the ionization electrodes, so that the
      aforementioned ratio accordingly varies even in case of a constant
      electrode-electrode distance. In such a case, a ratio is defined
      between the electrode-electrode distance and the electrode-wall
      distance at the end of the ionization electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]However, it is possible that the ratio between the
      electrode-electrode distance and the electrode-wall distance is
      within the specified range (e.g. 1.8-2.2) over the entire length
      of the ionization electrodes and not only at the end of the
      ionization electrodes.<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">

      ionization electrodes in the ionization chamber of the plasma
      source of FIGS. 1 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]FIG. 8 is a schematic view of an exemplary plasma source of
      FIGS. 1 to 4 connected to a gas source, a coolant pump and a D.C.
      voltage source.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]FIG. 9 is a side view of a medical device using the plasma
      source of FIGS. 1 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the plasma
      source comprises six ionization electrodes. Experiments using
      argon for the generation of the plasma have shown that the
      conversion efficiency (plasma output per electrode) increases with
      the number of ionization electrodes approximately linearly up to a
      number of six ionization electrodes. Then, the efficiency flattens
      out and eventually decreases. Therefore, a plasma torch with six
      ionization electrodes is the optimum for argon gas. However, the
      invention is not restricted to plasma sources having six
      electrodes. For example, it is also possible to provide 3, 4, 5,
      7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 ionization electrodes within the ionization
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]Further, the ionization electrodes may be rod-shaped and
      arranged parallel to each other forming an equilateral polygon in
      cross-section. In such an embodiment the distance between adjacent
      ionization electrodes, i.e. the electrode-electrode distance, is
      uniform within the electrode arrangement. However, the invention
      is not restricted to electrode arrangements having a uniform
      electrode-electrode distance. Instead, the electrode-electrode
      distance might vary within the electrode arrangement from
      electrode to electrode. Further, the distance between the
      ionization electrodes and the inner wall of the ionization chamber
      may be uniform within the entire electrode arrangement. However,
      the invention is not restricted to such embodiments having a
      uniform electrode-wall distance. Instead, the electrode-wall
      distance might vary within the electrode arrangement from
      electrode to electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]Further, the ionization electrodes may have an at least
      partially serrated surface, which can be realized by using screws
      having an external thread as the ionization electrodes. In this
      manner, an easy discharge trigger and a steady operation of the
      ionization electrodes is facilitated.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]The ionization electrodes may be made from aluminium. An
      advantage of aluminium is that it does not develop a polymerized
      coating, which might "flake off". Further, ionization electrodes
      consisting of aluminium have a better plasma efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]However, it is also possible to use ionization electrodes
      made from stainless steel. An advantage of lionization electrodes
      consisting of stainless steel is that they are particularly
      suitable for sterilisation purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]The ionization electrodes may ionize the gas within the
      ionization chamber by emitting microwaves. Therefore, the plasma
      source may comprises an electrical terminal for externally
      connecting the ionization electrodes to a micro wave generator.
      However, the invention is not restricted to plasma sources in
      which the plasma is generated by microwaves. Instead, it is
      possible to use radio frequency (R.F.) or even direct current for
      ionizing the gas within the ionization chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]However, if the plasma is generated by microwaves, the
      length of the ionization electrodes may be matched to the
      wavelength of the microwaves. For example, the length l of the
      ionization electrodes might correspond to the wavelength .lamda.
      of the microwaves. Alternatively, the length l of the ionization
      electrodes might correspond to half the wavelength .lamda./2.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]In an exemplary embodiment of the plasma source the walls of
      the ionization chamber are made from an electrically conductive
      material, e.g. aluminium, so that the walls of the ionization
      chamber are shielding the microwaves emitted by the ionization
      electrodes. In this manner, the electromagnetic radiation leaving
      the ionization chamber is reduced, which allows in vivo plasma
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]Further, the outlet of the ionization chamber may be covered
      by a mesh to avoid an unwanted accidental contact with the
      ionization electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]Further, the mesh covering the outlet of the ionization
      chamber may be made from an electrically conductive material, e.g.
      stainless steel, so that the mesh is shielding microwaves emitted
      by the ionization electrodes. In this manner, the electromagnetic
      radiation leaving the ionization chamber through the outlet of the
      ionization chamber is further reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]Finally, a positive direct-current voltage can be applied to
      the mesh to enhance plasma output and efficiency. In this manner,
      the electrons of the plasma within the ionization chamber are
      accelerated towards the mesh, so that the positively charged ions
      are following the electrons towards the outlet of the ionization
      in order to maintain an electrically neutral plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]Further, the mesh covering the outlet of the ionization
      chamber may have a mesh size of less than 5 mm or even less than 4
      mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0034]In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention,
      the plasma source comprises a protective cap, which is detachably
      attached to the outlet of the ionization chamber for preventing an
      over heating of the object. Therefore, the protective cap
      comprises at least one spacer projecting axially from the
      protective cap to ensure a safety distance between the outlet of
      the ionization chamber and the surface of the object, e.g. a
      wound.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]In operation, the plasma source provides a flow of plasma
      having a comparatively low temperature, which may be below
      100.degree. C., 75.degree. C. or even 50.degree. C., measured on
      the surface of the object.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]It should further be mentioned that the operating pressure
      within the ionization chamber is substantially equal to the
      ambient pressure outside the ionization chamber, so that the
      plasma source does not need any pressure control within the
      ionization chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0037]In an exemplary embodiment the outlet of the ionization
      chamber has a cross-section of at least 10 cm.sup.2, which allows
      an application of the plasma to a comparatively large surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]Further, the plasma source may be operated with a gas flow
      rate in the range of 1-10 l/min. However, the invention is not
      restricted to plasma sources operating with a gas flow rate within
      the aforementioned range.<br>
      <br>
      [0039]In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the plasma
      source further comprises a cooling means for convectively cooling
      the ionization chamber. The cooling means comprises at least one
      hollow cooling channel being disposed in the wall of the
      ionization chamber. During operation of the plasma source, a
      cooling agent, e.g. ambient air, can be pumped through the hollow
      cooling channels. In this manner, the temperature of the plasma is
      further reduced allowing in vivo plasma applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0040]Further, it has to be mentioned that the plasma source may
      use argon to generate the plasma. However, the invention is not
      restricted to plasma sources using argon. For example, a mixture
      of argon and a few percent of nitrogen or oxygen might be used to
      generate the plasma, so that radicals are generated from the
      nitrogen/oxygen molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0041]In an exemplary embodiment the plasma source further
      comprises a handle on the outside of the ionization chamber for
      manually positioning the plasma source relative to the object,
      e.g. above a wound.<br>
      <br>
      [0042]Finally, exemplary embodiments may include a medical device
      for the plasma treatment of a patient comprising the
      aforementioned novel plasma source. In such a medical device, the
      plasma torch may be mounted to a moveable arm allowing a
      user-defined positioning of the plasma source above the patient,
      wherein the moveable arm supports the plasma source, so that the
      plasma source need not be manually held by a therapist. The
      moveable arm preferably comprises several degrees of freedom of
      motion<br>
      <br>
      [0043]The embodiments and its particular features and advantages
      will become more apparent from the following detailed description
      considered with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      [0044]FIGS. 1 to 4 and FIG. 8 show an exemplary embodiment of a
      plasma source 1, which is suitable for the in vivo sterilization
      of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0045]The plasma source 1 comprises an ionization chamber 2 having
      an inlet 3 for introducing an argon gas into the ionization
      chamber 2, where the argon gas is ionized by six ionization
      electrodes 4 (see FIGS. 2, 7 and 8). The ionization electrodes 4
      are rod-shaped and arranged parallel to each other forming an
      equilateral polygon in cross-section (see FIG. 7). The ionization
      electrodes 4 are connected via a HF connector 5, a coaxial cable 6
      and an auto tuner 7 with a conventional microwave generator 8.
      During operation, the microwave generator 8 generates microwaves
      having a specified wavelength .lamda., wherein the length of the
      ionization electrodes 4 is matched to the wavelength .lamda. of
      the microwaves in such a way that the length of the ionization
      electrodes 4 corresponds to the wavelength .lamda.. However, in
      other embodiments it is possible that the length of the ionization
      electrodes 4 corresponds to half the wavelength .lamda. of the
      microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      [0046]Further, it should be noted that there is a uniform
      electrode-electrode distance d.sub.EE between adjacent ionization
      electrodes 4 and also a uniform distance d.sub.EW between the
      ionization electrodes 4 and the inner wall of the ionization
      chamber 2. Accordingly, the ionization electrodes 4 are arranged
      in such a way that the ratio between the electrode-electrode
      distance d.sub.EE on the one hand and the electrode-wall-distance
      d.sub.EW is substantially 2, which results in an easy discharge
      trigger and a steady operation of all the ionization electrodes 4.
      Therefore, the plasma generation is extremely efficient, which
      results in a large plasma output for a low energy input, so that
      in vivo plasma applications are possible with low temperatures of
      the generated plasma and low electromagnetic irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0047]In this embodiment, the rod-shaped ionization electrodes 4
      each consist of a screw having an external thread. Therefore, the
      surface of the ionization electrodes 4 is serrated, which enhances
      the plasma generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0048]Further, it should be noted that the ionization electrodes 4
      are made from aluminium. An advantage of aluminium is that it does
      not develop a polymerized coating, which might "flake-off".<br>
      <br>
      [0049]Further, the ionization chamber 2 comprises an outlet 9 (see
      FIG. 2) at the bottom end face of the ionization chamber 2. The
      outlet 9 is covered by a mesh 10 made from an electrically
      conductive material. The mesh 10 serves three purposes. Firstly,
      the mesh 10 prevents an unwanted, accidental contact with the
      ionization electrodes 4 within the ionization chamber 2. Secondly,
      the mesh 10 is shielding the microwaves generated within the
      ionization chamber 2, so that the electromagnetic irradiation
      outside the ionization chamber 2 is reduced. Finally, the mesh 10
      can be electrically contacted with a direct-current voltage source
      11 (see FIG. 8) to enhance plasma output and efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0050]It should further be noted that the plasma source 1
      comprises a protective cap 12, which is detachably attached to the
      bottom of the ionization chamber 2. The protective cap 12
      comprises a central opening below the outlet 9 of the ionization
      chamber 2, so that the dispensing of the plasma through the outlet
      9 is not interfered by the protective cap 12. The protective cap
      12 comprises several spacers 13 projecting axially from the
      protective cap 12 to ensure a safety distance between the bottom
      surface of the ionization chamber 2 and the outlet 9 on the one
      hand and the object, e.g. a wound, on the other hand.<br>
      <br>
      [0051]Further, a handle 14 is attached to the peripheral surface
      of the cylindrical ionization chamber 2. The handle 14 allows a
      manual positioning of the plasma source 1 above a wound, which
      will be described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0052]In this embodiment, the plasma source 1 further comprises
      several cooling channels 15 (see FIGS. 5, 6 and 8) extending
      coaxially and parallel to each other within the wall of the
      ionization chamber 2. At the bottom of the plasma source 1, the
      cooling channels 15 meet in several suction holes 16, which are
      evenly distributed along the circumferential surface of the
      ionization chamber 2. At the top of the ionization chamber 2, the
      cooling channels 15 meet in a common outlet 17, which is connected
      to a coolant pump 18 (see FIG. 8). The coolant pump 18 sucks
      ambient air through the suction holes 16 into the cooling channels
      15 thereby effectively cooling the walls of the ionization chamber
      2 and also the plasma generated within the ionization chamber 2.
      Therefore, the cooling further reduces the temperature of the
      generated plasma allowing in vivo plasma applications, e.g.
      sterilization of wounds, treatment of bacteriological, fungicidal
      and viral skin disorders.<br>
      <br>
      [0053]It should further be noted that the inlet 3 of the
      ionization chamber 2 is connected to a gas source 19 (see FIGS. 8,
      9) providing an argon gas flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0054]Finally, FIG. 9 shows a side view of an exemplary medical
      device for the plasma treatment of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0055]The medical device comprises a carriage 20 supported on
      rollers 21. The carriage 20 houses the auto tuner 7, the microwave
      generator 8 and the gas source 19 mentioned above. Further, the
      carriage 20 houses an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 22, a
      transformer 23, a personal computer (PC) 24 and a mass flow
      controller 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0056]At the top of the carriage 20 there is a rotatable column 26
      supporting a moveable and pivotable arm 27 having several degrees
      of freedom of motion. The plasma source 1 is mounted at the and of
      the arm 27 so that the plasma source 1 can be easily positioned
      above a wound by gripping the handle 14 of the plasma source 1. In
      the desired position the therapist can release the handle 14 of
      the plasma source 1, so that the arm 27 will bear the weight of
      the plasma source 1 during the plasma application, which may take
      a couple of minutes.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001]The present invention relates to methods for the operation
      of a plasma device, as for example for the plasma-based material
      deposition or surface processing, and in particular to methods for
      the manipulation of particles in a plasma device. The present
      invention also relates to plasma devices which are configured for
      the implementation of such methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]It is generally known that there can be particles in a gas
      in which a plasma condition is generated by means of an electric
      discharge. The particles are, for example, specifically introduced
      into the plasma from the outside or are generated in the said
      plasma by means of a pre-determined process sequence (refer to,
      e.g. "Dusty Plasmas: Physics, Chemistry and Technological Impact
      in Plasma Processing" (ed. A. Bouchoule), J. Wiley &amp; Sons,
      1999). In this case, particularly an examination or manipulation
      of the particles in the plasma can be desirable. During the
      examination of the particles, for example, an interaction of
      particles (e.g. during the generation of so-called plasma
      crystals) or the development or the growth of the particles are to
      be characterised. The manipulation of particles can comprise, for
      example, a particle processing in the plasma (surface removal or
      surface separation) or the deposition of the particles on
      substrates, as is the case during the controlled deposition of
      polymorphic layers (Cabarrocas et al. J. of Non-Crystalline Solids
      227-230 (1998) 871-875). In the deposition of polymorphic layers,
      the separation or the deposition of particles in a certain
      particle size distribution can be of interest. However, a
      practical method for the setting of a particle size distribution
      has not been available up to the present time.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]Alternatively, the particles in the plasma or on a substrate
      can represent an undesirable contamination. As an example, during
      the manufacture of solar cells, wafers or components for the flat
      screen technology by plasma deposition, the quality and the
      failure rate of the products can be substantially determined by
      the capability to keep away the disturbing particles from the
      substrates to be coated. Particles can cause local discharges on
      the substrate and, subsequently, holes in the layer through which
      the image quality, for example, of a flat screen is diminished.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]One cause of the substrate contamination is that, after a
      coating operation when the plasma is switched off in a plasma
      reactor, the particles formed in the plasma with typical
      dimensions in the nm range to the um range carry an electric net
      charge (typically a negative charge), whereas the substrate
      surface has an opposing charge. This leads to a previously
      unavoidable particle movement to the substrate surface, even if
      the plasma coating is performed on vertically aligned substrates
      (Ivlev et al. "Decharging of Complex Plasmas: First Kinetic
      Observations" in "Phys. Rev. Lett.", Volume 90, Page 5). The
      problems mentioned here occur particularly with the plasma
      deposition on large substrates with typical diameters in the dm
      range to the m range.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]With the applications for the examination or manipulation of
      particles in the plasma as well as with the particle
      contamination, there is generally an interest in exerting
      influence on the location, distribution and/or movement of the
      particles in a pre-determined manner. It is proposed in WO
      99/52125, in a plasma reactor with additional electrodes or with
      the use of a so-called adaptive electrode with a plurality of
      partial electrodes, to set or to change the electric field
      statically or with low frequency in such a way that the particles
      assume a certain spatial distribution over the substrate in the
      plasma reactor. However, this technique can be disadvantageous in
      that the defined objectives of examining or manipulating particles
      in the plasma can only be solved to a limited extent and that the
      deposition on the substrate reproduces the structure of the
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]The objective of the invention is to present an improved
      method for the operation of a plasma device with which the
      disadvantages of the conventional technologies for examining or
      manipulating particles in the plasma are overcome and that in
      particular a reliable and specific movement of particles in the
      plasma is made possible. The method according to the invention
      should have in particular an extended application range and open
      the way to new options for influencing the particles in the
      plasma. It is also the objective of the invention to present an
      improved plasma device with which the disadvantages of the
      conventional plasma reactors are overcome and which is suitable
      for influencing particles in the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]This objective is solved by a method and a plasma device
      with the features of claims 1 and 19. Advantageous embodiments and
      applications of the invention result from the dependent claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]With reference to the method, the invention is based on the
      general technical teaching of generating electric travelling waves
      in a plasma device through which waves forces are exerted on
      particles in the plasma, so that the particles are moved in a
      directed manner to at least one pre-determined collection area in
      the plasma device. The electric travelling waves advantageously
      cause a particle transport with a net flow of particles towards
      the collection area. As opposed to conventional techniques where
      merely a positioning or redistribution of particles without a net
      flow was envisaged, the travelling waves enable a continual
      particle movement during and/or after the formation of the plasma.
      With this, particles which are continually and subsequently formed
      in the plasma during a plasma deposition, for example, can be
      removed advantageously and constantly from a plasma area,
      particularly from the vicinity of a substrate that is to be
      coated. In the result, contaminations can be avoided and layers
      with a considerably improved homogeneity can be generated. The
      above-mentioned quality losses and equipment failures of the
      resulting products can be reduced and/or the plasma conditions for
      a manufacturing process can be optimised.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]The electric travelling waves can advantageously run through
      the entire plasma area without restriction, so that the particle
      transport reliably takes place over extended substrates also, as
      coated for example in the semiconductor or solar cell technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]The plasma device generally comprises a device with an
      evacuation-capable inner zone, in particular with a plasma
      chamber, which is filled with an operating gas for generating
      plasma and where electric fields can be applied for the ignition
      of a plasma discharge. An electric travelling wave is generated by
      an electric field distribution (travelling field) moving in the
      time sequence, preferably periodically repeated in a certain
      direction. According to the invention, a travelling wave can be
      generated with a pre-determined direction or several travelling
      waves with pre-determined directions, for example two travelling
      waves running oppositely relative to one another. By means of the
      interaction with the field of the travelling wave the particles
      perform a directed movement, meaning, they are shifted in a
      direction parallel to the running direction of the travelling
      wave. The term "directed movement" can include movements at least
      of parts of a particle quantity in several directions in each case
      when several travelling waves with various running directions are
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the
      electric travelling waves are generated with a plurality of strip
      electrodes which are arranged next to one another in the plasma
      device and are loaded with one or several alternating voltages
      (collection alternating voltage). The use of strip electrodes has
      the advantage of a high degree of flexibility with the generation
      of the travelling waves. The parameters of the electric travelling
      waves, particularly the wave form as well as the frequency and
      amplitudes, can be adapted with a minor work effort to the
      characteristics of the particles which are to be transported or
      deposited (separated), such as for example to their size or
      dielectric characteristics. Furthermore, the strip electrodes can
      be arranged without any problems in an existing plasma device
      without having any detrimental effect on its function, such as for
      example the coating of a substrate. In an advantageous manner,
      travelling waves can be generated with the strip electrodes which
      waves are uniform along the longitudinal course of the strip
      electrodes and the running direction of which is determined by the
      arrangement direction of the strip electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]Further advantages for the generation of travelling waves
      can result if all strip electrodes are loaded with a common
      collection alternating voltage, this however with a pre-determined
      delay or phase shift in each case. The loading of the strip
      electrodes with specific phase shifts in each case means that
      strip electrodes, which are arranged in sequence and adjacent to
      one another in accordance with the desired movement direction of
      the particles to the collection area, are charged with the
      collection alternating voltage with a time lag so that the
      continuing travelling wave is generated in the desired direction
      of movement of the particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]The method according to the invention has advantageously a
      high degree of variability with the selection of the collection
      alternating voltage or its adaptation to the conditions of the
      individual practical application. According to a first variant,
      the collection alternating voltage can be established with a
      symmetrical voltage characteristic. The time-dependency of the
      collection alternating voltage is characterised in this case by
      two edges mirror-symmetrical to one another within one period.
      This embodiment of the invention enables in an advantageous manner
      that available alternating voltage sources can be used for the
      provision of the collection alternating voltage. The migration
      velocity of the amplitude maxima of the collection alternating
      voltage is selected preferably in dependence of the size and the
      material of the particles in such a way that the transported
      particles are entrained with the front edges of the travelling
      waves. Voltage sources are particularly preferred in this case
      which provide for sinus-shaped or pulse-shaped voltage
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]According to an alternative variant, the collection
      alternating voltage has an asymmetrical voltage characteristic.
      This means that, within one period, the rising and falling edges
      have various slopes. With this embodiment of the invention, the
      travelling wave has advantageously the form of a ramp profile that
      moves over the strip electrodes and, under whose effect, the
      particles are transported to the collection area. Preferably the
      front edge has the lesser slope, so that there is relatively a lot
      of time for an effective force exertion on the particles, whereas
      the rear-side edge has a steeper drop. During the passage through
      the rear-side edge there is hardly any backward movement due to
      the particle inertia with larger particles. As a result, only
      larger particles are selectively transported in the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]Advantageously, the collection alternating voltage within a
      period can have a trapezoidal form. This means that there is in
      each case a direct voltage section between the rising and falling
      edges. This embodiment of the invention has the advantage that the
      steepness of the edges is freely selectable without having to
      change the period (or frequency) of the collection alternating
      voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]The asymmetrical form of the travelling wave has the
      particular advantage that, with the setting of the wave form and
      in particular with the setting of the slope and/or the duration of
      the edges, a size selection of the transported particles according
      to the invention can take place. The larger the particles, the
      slower the requirement for the edge of the collection alternating
      voltage to change so that an effective particle transport is
      obtained. This enables that the wave form, at least by means of
      one of the measures which comprise an increase of the frequency of
      the collection alternating voltage, an increase of the slope and a
      shortening of the edges of the collection alternating voltage,
      only such particles are subjected to the transport according to
      the invention whose size does not exceed a pre-determined maximum
      size.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]Due to the already-mentioned correlation between the
      frequency and/or the form of the travelling waves and the size of
      the transportable particles according to the invention, the
      collection alternating voltage with one embodiment of the
      invention, where the plasma is generated in the plasma device by
      means of a high-frequent operating alternating voltage, is
      provided preferably with a frequency which is less than the
      frequency of the operating alternating voltage. Particularly
      preferred is a frequency of the collection alternating voltage in
      the range of 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz, particularly from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz
      where, however, the particle transport according to the invention
      can be adjustably set at higher frequencies also (e.g., 100 Hz or
      higher).<br>
      <br>
      [0018]If, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention,
      the strip electrodes are loaded with the collection alternating
      voltage as well as with an operating voltage of the plasma device
      for the purpose of forming the plasma, there can be further
      advantages for the practical operation of the plasma device.
      Firstly, and as a result of the superimposition of the collection
      alternating voltage and the operating voltage, the particles are
      subjected to the electric travelling waves at that particular
      location where they primarily originate. Secondly, the structure
      of the plasma device is simplified because no separate electrode
      is required for the generation of the plasma. With this embodiment
      of the invention, all strip electrodes are impacted with the
      operating voltage of the plasma device which is superimposed with
      the collection alternating voltage. Depending on the operating
      mode of the plasma device, the operating voltage can be a direct
      voltage or a high-frequency voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]Alternatively, at least one separate power electrode can be
      provided in the plasma device in addition to the strip electrodes,
      which power electrode is charged with the operating voltage of the
      plasma device for the purpose of plasma formation. This embodiment
      of the invention has the advantage that, by the strip electrodes,
      only two functions are taken over, particularly the travelling
      wave generation and a homogenisation of the electric field (see
      below), whereas the power electrode is provided for the operation
      of the plasma process.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]With the superimposition of the collection alternating
      voltage and the operating voltage of the plasma device, the
      electric travelling waves can be advantageously and continually
      generated during the generation of the plasma. Alternatively, a
      separate provision of the collection alternating voltage
      (superimposed with a direct voltage) is possible, with which the
      particle transport takes place only during pre-determined
      collecting times before or after the generation of the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]According to a further preferred embodiment of the
      invention, the collection alternating voltage is superimposed with
      a higher frequent modulation voltage. This superimposition
      advantageously enables a timing-averaged homogenisation of the
      plasma. Under the effect of the modulation voltage, ions in the
      plasma are moved while the substantially larger particles remain
      unaffected. The ions can be distributed more evenly in this way, a
      fact that is advantageous in particular with the plasma-based
      material separation on substrates. The parameters of the, e.g.,
      sinus-shaped modulation voltage are selected in dependence of the
      geometrical properties of the electrode strips (particularly the
      strip width) and the wave form of the travelling wave as well as
      in dependence of the concentration and energy of the ions in the
      plasma. The amplitude of the modulation voltage is preferably
      selected in such a way that, in the course of a half period of the
      modulation voltage, ions can be transported over a length
      corresponding to half the step width between the electrode strips.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]The frequency of the modulation voltage is selected in
      dependence of the practical operating conditions of the plasma
      device. If the strip electrodes according to the above-mentioned
      embodiment of the invention are impacted with the collection
      alternating voltage as well as with the operating voltage, the
      frequency of the modulation voltage is selected preferably in the
      kHz-range, particularly in the range from 0.1 kHz to 100 kHz. With
      the modified embodiment with separate strip and power electrodes,
      however, the frequency of the modulation voltage is selected in
      the kHz range to the MHz range, particularly in the range between
      10 kHz to 1 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]It can be advantageous for a reliable collection of the
      transported particles in the collection area if, according to a
      further modification of the invention, the at least one collection
      area has a hollow cathode in each case. The hollow cathode as such
      is known (refer to: Y. Kurimoto et al. in "Film Solid Film", Vl.
      457, 2004, Page 285-291, and WO 01/01467). Their use has the
      advantage that the particles in the collection area are retained
      under the effect of electric fields. The particles can be
      collected and used again.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]Alternatively or additionally, the collection area can be
      formed by an accumulation zone in which the particles are
      accumulated in the suspended condition in the plasma. The
      formation of an accumulation zone in the plasma chamber can be
      advantageous for the examination of particle clouds or for the
      deposition of large particle quantities on substrates.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]According to a further variant of the invention the electric
      travelling waves can be generated with various directions,
      particularly with directions opposing one another, so that the
      particles perform aligned movements to at least two pre-determined
      collection areas. A material-specific or size-specific collection
      of the particles can advantageously and subsequently take place in
      various collection areas. The movements in the various directions
      can be realised simultaneously or time-separated, for example in
      successive order.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]A further significant advantage of the invention lies in the
      variability during the configuration of the movement direction of
      the particles. The travelling waves can move linearly in a
      pre-specified direction which runs essentially vertical to the
      expansion of planar-arranged strip electrodes. Alternatively, a
      circular movement can be induced with strip electrodes which are
      arranged in a circular shape on the outer periphery of a plasma
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]The above-mentioned object is solved related to the device
      by the general technical teaching of equipping a plasma device,
      which is provided for the formation of a plasma, with at least one
      electrode for generating electric travelling waves for the
      directed transport of particles in the plasma device and at least
      one collection area for accommodating the particles. The
      combination, according to the invention, of at least one electrode
      for the generation of travelling waves (in the following:
      travelling wave electrode) and at least one collection area
      enables advantageously the specific removal of particles from the
      plasma and particularly from a layer-shaped zone above a substrate
      in the plasma device.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]The travelling wave electrode preferably comprises a
      plurality of strip electrodes, each of which is connected to a
      voltage source for generating the collection alternating voltage.
      The strip electrodes are arranged preferably in one plane, so that
      the travelling wave electrode can be advantageously arranged
      immediately adjacent to a substrate on its opposing side relative
      to the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]The strip electrodes of the travelling wave electrode
      preferably form a line lattice. They all have the same size and
      form, for example a straight form or a curved line form, and a
      constant step width (constant mutual distances from
      centre-to-centre of adjacent strip electrodes). The use of
      straight electrode strips has advantages for the homogeneity of
      the travelling waves for the particle transport.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]Generally, each of the strip electrodes can be integrally
      formed. Alternatively, the formation of an electrode strip is
      possible by means of a series of electrode segments joined
      electrically to one another, for example square-type electrode
      segments as known from conventional adaptive electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]According to a preferred embodiment of the plasma device
      according to the invention the travelling wave electrode has a
      plate-shaped electrode carrier, wherein the strip electrodes are
      arranged on at least one surface of the electrode carrier. The
      provision of the electrode carrier has the advantage that a
      compact structural component is created with a defined arrangement
      of the strip electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]It can be advantageous particularly for applications related
      to plasma-based material deposition if strip electrodes are
      arranged on both surfaces of the electrode carrier. This enables a
      coating arrangement with two vertically arranged substrates,
      between which the travelling wave electrode is located for
      transporting away the particles over both electrode surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
      strip electrodes comprise wire electrodes which are insulated from
      one another and inserted into the electrode carrier or arranged on
      its surface. Wire electrodes have the advantage that they can be
      arranged with a particularly narrow spacing distance. This has a
      positive effect on the setting of an essentially smooth and
      stepless wave form of the travelling waves. Furthermore, wire
      electrodes have advantages with reference to the freedom of the
      configuration of the electrode arrangement. Alternatively, the
      electrode strips are formed in a layer-type manner on the surface
      of the electrode carrier. The layer-type configuration is
      advantageous because of the reduced capacitive coupling in this
      case between adjacent electrode strips.<br>
      <br>
      [0034]For the purpose of realisation of the above-mentioned
      circular shaped movement of the particles, the travelling wave
      electrode has a ring-shaped electrode carrier on whose surface the
      strip electrodes are arranged. The ring-shaped strip electrode
      advantageously enables a further use of the particle transport,
      according to the invention, by means of travelling waves, a
      particle acceleration taking place in the plasma, e.g. by means of
      an increase of the migration velocity of travelling waves in one
      or several adjacently arranged rings of strip electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]According to a further variant of the invention, the
      travelling wave electrode comprises strip electrode groups each
      with a plurality of strip electrodes. The strip electrodes
      belonging to a strip electrode group are electrically connected to
      one another. The strip electrodes are arranged in such a way that
      each one of the strip electrodes in successive order belongs to
      another strip electrode group. With the arrangement of the strip
      electrodes, a periodic pattern is provided wherein the periods
      respectively contain in the same order strip electrodes of each
      strip electrode group. The compilation of strip electrodes to
      groups advantageously enables that all strip electrodes belonging
      to a strip electrode group are impacted with the same phase
      position of the collection alternating voltage. By means of the
      above-mentioned periods, particularly the extension of a period of
      the electric travelling waves is defined.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]If the travelling wave electrode is equipped with a heating
      device according to a further modification of the invention, this
      can have advantages for the manufacture of polymorphic layers,
      e.g., for Si-based solar cells and/or for the protection of the
      strip electrodes against deposition. The smaller particles can be
      transported away from the plasma according to the invention,
      whereas the larger particles are deposited on the substrate. These
      larger particles can be excitated to a further crystallographic
      growth by heating the substrate with the heating device, or can be
      subjected to a curing process.<br>
      <br>
      [0037]Further details and advantages are described as follows with
      reference to the attached drawings. The drawings show the

      arrangement of strip electrodes with the embodiment according to
      FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0045]Details of the method according to the invention are
      explained as follows with reference to the plasma device 100 as
      shown in FIG. 1. Known details of the plasma device and its
      operation, particularly the operating conditions for the
      generation of plasma, are not described here.<br>
      <br>
      [0046]FIG. 1 shows schematically the plasma device 100 with a
      travelling wave electrode 10, a collection area 20, a counter
      electrode 30, a substrate 40 and a control apparatus 50. The
      mentioned components 10 to 40 are arranged in a plasma chamber 101
      which can be evacuated (illustrated with dashed lines). In the
      plasma chamber 101 a plasma condition can be ignited in an
      operating gas. Particles can form in the plasma, or particles can
      be fed from the outside into the plasma. The particles have sizes
      in the range, for example, between 10 nm to 20 .mu.m.<br>
      <br>
      [0047]The travelling wave electrode 10 comprises a plurality of
      electrode strips 11 which are arranged on a plate-shaped electrode
      carrier 12 and are each connected with the control apparatus 50 by
      way of an electrode connection 14. In FIG. 1, the strip electrodes
      11 are entered in the drawing for illustration purposes and are
      not to scale. In order to obtain best possible stageless
      travelling waves and a best possible small capacitive coupling
      between adjacent strip electrodes, these are arranged with a small
      thickness and a narrow spacing clearance as best as possible in
      each case. The straight strip electrodes 11 shown in
      cross-sectional arrangement and extending vertically to the
      drawing plane have, for example, a width of 4 mm and a vertical
      centre-centre-clearance of 10 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0048]The electrode connections 14 are connected, for example, at
      the periphery of the electrode carrier 12 to the individual
      electrode strips 11. Across the electrode strips 11 there is an
      electrically insulating protective layer 13, e.g. consisting of
      SiO.sub.2 (glass), over which the substrate 40 is located. The
      substrate 40 can lie immediately on the protective layer 13 or (as
      shown) can be arranged with spacers having a clearance spacing
      from the electrode carrier 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0049]The collection area 20 comprises a hollow cathode 21
      extending parallel to the periphery of the substrate 40, which
      cathode is also connected to the control apparatus 50. The hollow
      cathode 21 has, for example, the design type as described in WO
      01/01467.<br>
      <br>
      [0050]The travelling wave electrode 10 in the embodiment according
      to FIG. 1 simultaneously serves as a power electrode which acts
      together with the counter electrode 30 for the purpose of
      formation of the plasma in the plasma device 100. The counter
      electrode 30 can be arranged in the plasma chamber 101 as a
      ring-shaped, disk-shaped or rod-shaped electrode, or alternatively
      formed by the wall of the plasma chamber 101. The substrate 40 is
      selected in dependence on the application of the plasma device 100
      and consists of, for example, a semiconductor wafer or glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0051]In the control apparatus 50 a voltage source is provided for
      the establishment of the collection alternating voltage with a
      pre-determined voltage characteristic which is loaded on the strip
      electrodes 11 with defined phase shifts. The voltage source also
      serves to provide the operating voltage for generating the plasma
      in the plasma chamber 101. For example, all strip electrodes are
      impacted together with a high-frequent operating voltage with the
      use of suitable frequency filters.<br>
      <br>
      [0052]In FIG. 1, a ramp-shaped voltage characteristic 1 at two
      different times is shown schematically as an example. As the
      collection alternating voltage at the strip electrodes 11 is
      provided in successive order with an increasing delay or phase
      shift, there is the resulting image of a ramp-shaped field
      distribution that moves in the time sequence in waveform towards
      the collection area 20 (see upper arrow). There results a field
      gradient extending parallel to the surface of the electrode
      carrier. Particles which, for example, are formed and grown above
      the substrate 40 as a result of nucleus formation in the plasma
      undergo a force action by the travelling wave towards the
      periphery of the substrate 40 where they are taken up or
      "suctioned up" with the hollow cathode 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0053]FIG. 2 illustrates different variants of symmetrical or
      asymmetrical voltage characteristics of the collection alternating
      voltage. In each case the amplitudes of the alternating voltage
      portions are shown, with which the strip electrodes 11 are
      charged. FIG. 2a shows a sinus-shaped sequence of the collection
      alternating voltage which results in a travelling wave with even
      rising and falling edges. The other sequences in the FIGS. 2b-2e
      show asymmetrical shapes with a slowly rising front edge 1A, if
      required with a direct voltage zone 1B and a rapidly falling rear
      edge 1C. The edges 1A, 1C in FIG. 2b have, for example, a time
      ratio of 10:1. This can be varied by the insertion of the direct
      voltage zones 1B at constant period of the collection alternating
      voltage (FIGS. 2c, d). FIG. 2e illustrates that the voltage
      characteristic 1 does not have to be compellingly composed from
      linear curved pieces, but rather can have also any other time
      dependency factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0054]The amplitude, frequency, curve form (particularly the
      steepness of the edges) and phase of the collection alternating
      voltage and, with this, particularly the propagation velocity of
      the travelling wave are pre-determined with the voltage source in
      the control apparatus 50. At least one of these variables is
      selectable with the voltage source. For example, by the selection
      of the steepness of the falling edge 1C, the particle size can be
      defined above which there is essentially no particle transport.
      The concrete quantitative variables are selected by those skilled
      in the art, particularly in dependence on the particle material,
      the particle sizes and the field strengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0055]FIG. 3 illustrates different variants of a travelling wave
      electrode 10 with the strip electrodes 11 in or on the electrode
      carrier 12, in each case as an example with further features of
      the invention. According to FIG. 3a, wire electrodes are embedded
      in the surface of the electrode carrier 12. FIG. 3a also
      illustrates the combination of the travelling wave electrode 10,
      according to the invention, with a heating device 60 which is
      thermally connected with the electrode carrier 12 and is, for
      example, arranged on its underneath side. FIG. 3b shows a variant
      with strip electrodes 11 in the form of straight electrode bands
      (cross-sectional illustration). In the left part of FIG. 3b the
      effect of a high-frequent modulation voltage is shown which is
      superimposed on the collection alternating voltage. During the
      course of the travelling wave and subject to the effect of the
      modulation voltage, ions in the plasma are distributed over an
      area which extends over two adjacent strip electrodes. The coating
      of a substrate 40 is homogenised in this way. According to FIG. 3c
      the strip electrodes 11 are formed in each case by insulated wires
      or wires embedded in a non-conductive material such as a resin,
      for example, where said wires are arranged on the surface of the
      electrode carrier 12. The coating of the strip electrodes 11,
      shown as an example in FIG. 3c, can also be advantageous for the
      protection of the strip electrodes against undesirable deposition.
      Furthermore, FIG. 3c illustrates as an example the arrangement of
      two collection areas 20, 20A on different sides of the electrode
      carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0056]FIG. 3d shows a structural arrangement with a substrate 40
      to be coated, similar to FIG. 3b, where in this case, however, a
      separate power electrode 31 is provided in addition to the
      travelling wave electrode 10, which power electrode is loaded with
      the operating voltage for the formation of the plasma condition in
      the plasma device. For this purpose, the strip electrodes 11 and
      the power electrode 31 have separate connecting lines (not shown)
      for connection to the control apparatus 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0057]FIG. 4 illustrates schematically the formation of electrode
      strip groups 15 where successively arranged electrode strips 11
      are periodically connected with one another. In the illustrated
      example, the 1st, 16th, 32nd etc. electrode strips 11 are
      electrically connected with one another and are loaded with the
      same phase position of the collection alternating voltage, while
      the following 2nd, 17th and 33rd strip electrode, in each case,
      are loaded with a common phase which is, however, delayed relative
      to the first phase position. Accordingly, and with the control
      apparatus 50, the voltage characteristic of the desired collection
      alternating voltage must only be established with 15 different
      phase positions in order to generate the travelling wave moving
      over the entire substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0058]FIGS. 5a and 5b show the application of the invention with
      the plasma-based material deposition on the substrate 40.
      According to FIG. 5a the travelling wave electrode 10 is located
      on the side of the vertically aligned substrate 40 facing away
      from the plasma 2. The travelling waves are generated parallel to
      the substrate surface, running vertically downwards, to the lower
      periphery of the substrate. FIG. 5 shows the two-sided usage of
      the travelling wave electrode 10 which is arranged here between
      two substrates 41, 42 and which is significant for practical
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0059]FIG. 6 illustrates the combination, according to the
      invention, of the travelling wave electrode 10 and the collection
      area 20 in a schematic perspective view with further details. The
      strip electrodes 11 are embedded in the electrode carrier 12. The
      electric connection is effected by way of the electrode
      connections 14 at the periphery of the electrode carrier 12. The
      hollow cathode 21 of the collection area 20 extends over the
      entire length of the strip electrodes 11 at the periphery of the
      electrode carrier 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0060]A further modified embodiment of the invention, in which
      circular shaped particle movements are generated, is schematically
      illustrated in the FIGS. 7 and 8. According to FIG. 7, in the
      plasma device 100 with the plasma chamber 101 which can be
      evacuated, a power electrode 31 is provided and shown
      schematically in top view, on whose peripheral rim the travelling
      wave electrode 10 extends with a plurality of electrode strips 11
      on a ring-shaped electrode carrier 16. The power electrode 31
      contains a cut-out 32, at which the collection area 20 is formed.
      FIG. 8 shows a corresponding structural configuration in
      cross-sectioned perspective view. Each of the strip electrodes 11
      is connected to the control apparatus 50 which contains the
      voltage source for generating the collection alternating voltage
      and the modulation voltage. For reasons of clarity, not all
      electrode connections 14 of the individual strip electrodes 11 are
      shown in FIG. 7 and not all strip electrodes in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0061]With the embodiment shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, circularly
      running travelling waves are generated with which the particles 3
      in the plasma are moved over the power electrode 31 on circular
      paths. The movement is effected up to section 32 where, for
      example, the particles are suctioned out of the plasma chamber
      with a hollow cathode (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0062]FIG. 7 also schematically shows an accumulation zone 22
      which comprises a zone area in the plasma chamber, in which and by
      means of a corresponding activation of the adjacent electrodes or
      as a result of the non-existence of electrodes, conditions are
      present in such a way that the particles 3 accumulate in this zone
      area.<br>
      <br>
      [0063]The particle transport takes place with a higher degree of
      effectiveness at the radial outer rim of the power electrode 31.
      For this reason, the circular movement of the particles is
      superimposed with a radial and outwardly directed diffusion
      movement of particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0064]A significant advantage of the embodiment of the invention
      as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 lies in the fact that, with the
      ring-shaped electrode carrier 16, existing plasma reactors can be
      backfitted in an uncomplicated manner. In order to protect the
      strip electrodes 11 against deposition during the operation of the
      plasma device, a heating device can be provided for heating the
      strip electrodes 11 and/or a coating of the strip electrodes 11,
      e.g. with glass, can be provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0065]A further advantage of the illustrated embodiment lies in
      the option of generating a continual particle flow with a constant
      or with a variable speed in the plasma device in order to examine
      the interactions between the particles which form the so-called
      fluid or crystalline conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0066]The features of the invention as disclosed in this
      description, in the claims and in the drawings can be of
      significance both individually as well as in combination for the
      realisation of the invention in its various embodiments. <br>
