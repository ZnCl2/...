        </big></div>
      <br>
      And it’ll cost less than $1 per dose.<br>
      <br>
      Lab tests have highlighted the potential of a new drug to treat
      malaria in affected patients, prevent it from spreading, and ward
      off future infections with a single dose. Developed by chemists at
      Dundee University in Scotland and the not-for-profit group
      Medicines for Malaria Venture, the drug acts against each of the
      life stages of the malaria parasite, making it a promising option
      for those already infected and as a vaccination. <br>
      <br>
      "There are other compounds being developed for malaria, but
      relatively few of [these] have reached the stage we’re at," lead
      researcher Ian Gilbert said in a press release. "What’s most
      exciting is the number of potential attributes, such as the
      ability to give it in a single dose which will mean that medics
      can make sure a patient completes the treatment."<br>

      <br>
      Named DDD107498, the drug has been in development since 2009, and
      was made using one of almost 4,700 compounds tested for
      effectiveness against malaria at the Drug Discovery Unit (DDU)
      facilities in the UK.<br>
      <br>
      In tests with mice and other lab animals, the researchers report
      that the drug identified and attacked the protein involved in the
      production of various vital enzymes and proteins in the malaria
      parasite’s cells throughout all stages of its lifecycle, which
      prevented the spread and development of the disease. The parasite
      was successfully cleared from both the blood and livers of the
      affected animals.<br>
      <br>
      “The compound we have discovered works in a different way to all
      other antimalarial medicines on the market or in clinical
      development, which mean that it has great potential to work
      against current drug-resistant parasites," one of the team, Kevin
      Read, said in the release. "It targets part of the machinery that
      makes proteins within the parasite that causes malaria."<br>
      <br>
      The results have been published in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      According to Steve Connor at The Guardian, the first phase of
      clinical trials will begin in the coming months, and if the drug
      makes it to the market, will likely be sold for less than $1 a
      dose, "which is considered the maximum price that the poorest
      affected countries can afford”, he says.<br>
      <br>
      As David Reddit, CEO of Medicines for Malaria Venture, pointed out
      to BBC News, malaria threatens half the world’s population - the
      half that can least afford treatment and vaccination against it,
      so a cheap, one-off medication could be the most promising option
      in development. "DDD107498 is an exciting compound since it holds
      the promise to not only treat but also protect these vulnerable
      populations," he said.<br>

        Discovery of a novel antimalarial compound published in Nature<br>
        <br>
        by Roddy Isles <br>
        <br>
        Potential new anti-malarial drug developed at Drug Discovery
        Unit<br>
      </b><br>
      Professor Ian Gilbert and Dr Kevin Read explain how a new compound
      developed at the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee
      has the potential to treat malaria sufferers with just a single
      dose and also prevent the spread and transmission of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      The details of the discovery, properties and mechanism of action
      of a novel antimalarial compound, DDD107498, have been published
      in the journal Nature. DDD107498 has the potential to treat
      malaria patients in a single dose, including those with malaria
      parasites resistant to current medications, and help reduce the
      transmission of the parasite.<br>
      <br>
      The compound was identified through a collaboration between the
      University of Dundee’s Drug Discovery Unit (DDU) and Medicines for
      Malaria Venture (MMV).<br>
      <br>
      “The publication describes the discovery and profiling of this
      exciting new compound,” said Professor Ian Gilbert, Head of
      Chemistry at the Drug Discovery Unit, who led the team that
      discovered the compound. “It reveals that DDD107498 has the
      potential to treat malaria with a single dose, prevent the spread
      of malaria from infected people, and protect a person from
      developing the disease in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      “There is still some way to go before the compound can be given to
      patients. However we are very excited by the progress that we have
      made.”<br>
      <br>
      “Malaria continues to threaten almost half of the world’s
      population – the half that can least afford it,” said Dr David
      Reddy, MMV’s CEO. “DDD107498 is an exciting compound since it
      holds the promise to not only treat but also protect these
      vulnerable populations. The collaboration to identify and progress
      the compound, led by the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of
      Dundee, drew on MMV’s network of scientists from Melbourne to San
      Diego. The publication of the research is an important step and a
      clear testament to the power of partnership.” <br>
      <br>
      Dr Kevin Read, joint leader of the project, also based at the Drug
      Discovery Unit at Dundee, said, “New drugs are urgently needed to
      treat malaria, as resistance to the current gold-standard
      antimalarial drug is now considered a real threat. The compound we
      have discovered works in a different way to all other antimalarial
      medicines on the market or in clinical development, which means
      that it has great potential to work against current drug-resistant
      parasites. It targets part of the machinery that makes proteins
      within the parasite that causes malaria.”<br>
      <br>
      “The need for new antimalarial drugs is more urgent than ever
      before, with emerging strains of the parasite now showing
      resistance against the best available drugs,” said Dr Michael Chew
      from the Wellcome Trust, which provides funding for the Dundee DDU
      and MMV. “These strains are already present at the Myanmar-Indian
      border and it’s a race against time to stop resistance spreading
      to the most vulnerable populations in Africa. The discovery of
      this new antimalarial agent, which has shown remarkable potency
      against multiple stages of the malaria lifecycle, is an exciting
      prospect in the hunt for viable new treatments.”<br>
      <br>
      “Our partnership with MMV was critical to the progress of this
      compound,” added Professor Ian Gilbert. “Dr Paul Willis at MMV and
      Sir Simon Campbell, a mentor from MMV’s Expert Scientific Advisory
      Committee, gave invaluable input to the project. We have
      extensively profiled the compound, investigating its properties to
      understand how it works; this could not have been done without
      MMV’s scientific input and support of its network of partners
      around the world. <br>

      </b><b>Field of the Invention </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a new class of
      quinoline-4-carboxamide compounds, to their use in medicine, to
      compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation
      and to intermediates used in such processes. In particular the
      present invention provides quinoline-4-carboxamide for use in the
      treatment of malaria. Background<br>
      <br>
      In the undeveloped world, over 350 million people are at risk from
      neglected tropical diseases such as malaria, African sleeping
      sickness, Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis. Existing therapies to
      treat such neglected tropical diseases are increasingly
      ineffective due to the development of resistance by the parasites
      that underpin these conditions to drugs used both in disease
      prevention and treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Worldwide, an estimated 200 to 300 million malarial infections
      occur each year. Approximately 1 million people die each year from
      malaria and the disease is one of the world's biggest killers.
      Malaria is caused by an infection of the red blood cells with a
      tiny organism or parasite called protozoa. Five species of the
      protozoa Plasmodium are known to cause infection in humans:
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf); Plasmodium vivax (Pv); Plasmodium
      ovale; Plasmodium malariae; and Plasmodium knowlesi. The injection
      of protozoa of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium
      ovale, or Plasmodium malariae into the blood stream, is effected
      by a single source, the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito.
      Thus there is a need for agents which are effective against
      Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale,
      Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi infections. The most
      life-threatening form of malaria is attributable to blood cells
      infected with the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, and can cause
      kidney or liver failure, coma and death. About 2% of people
      infected with falciparum malaria die and with an estimated one
      child dying every 45 seconds from falciparum malarial infections
      the need for an effective treatment could not be higher. Thus
      there is a need for agents which are: effective against Plasmodium
      falciparum infections; effective against Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax infections; effective against Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium
      ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi infections. Plasmodium species
      require two hosts, human and mosquito for completion of its life-
      cycle. In humans the infection is initiated by the inoculation of
      sporozoites in the saliva of an infected mosquito. Once inside the
      body the sporozoites migrate to the liver and there infect
      hepatocytes where they differentiate, via the exoerythrocytic
      intracellular stage, into the merozoite stage which infects red
      blood cells to initiate cyclical replication in the asexual blood
      stage. The life-cycle is completed by the differentiation of a
      number of merozoites in the red blood cells into sexual stage
      gametocytes which are ingested by the mosquito, where they develop
      through a series of stages in the mid gut to produce sporozoites
      which migrate to the salivary gland.<br>
      <br>
      Many countries have been experiencing resurgence in malaria cases
      caused by Plasmodium falciparum due to the spread of parasites
      which are increasingly resistant to both chloroquine, the drug
      most widely used for prevention and treatment as well as newer,
      alternative treatments such as artesunate. See, Wellems et al, JID
      2001 ;184 (15 September) and Noedl et al, N Engl J Med 2008;
      359:2619-2620 (11 December). The development of new anti-malarial
      treatments is of great importance particularly given the rapid
      spread of parasite resistance even within newer artemisinin-based
      therapies.<br>
      <br>
      In the battle against the continued spread of both malarial
      infection and the parasite resistance to malaria compounds having
      the potential to both combat the infection and also impact upon
      the parasite growth cycle, particularly against gametocyte
      development and thereby impacting upon subsequent transmission
      potential, would be highly desirable.<br>
      <br>
      A further strand in assisting effective treatment of malarial
      infections is the need for therapies which can be dosed
      efficiently in difficult conditions. As such, single-dose, oral,
      rectal or parenteral therapies, particularly sustained or modified
      release therapies would be of value.<br>
      <br>
      Thus there is a need for new and effective anti-malarial agents.
      In particular there is a need for new anti-malarial agents which:
      are effective against drug-resistant parasites; are effective
      against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections such as
      for example Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum
      infections; which are active against gametocytes; have
      transmission-blocking potential; which are active against liver
      stage; which can be used for single-dose treatment; and/or which
      can be used for prophylactic treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a novel class of class of
      quinolone-4-carboxamide compounds Plasmodium falciparum 3D7
      inhibitors having potential as anti-malarial agents. The novel
      class of quinolone-4-carboxamide compounds according to the
      present invention have potential for the treatment of Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium
      malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi infections. In particular the
      novel class of class of quinolone-4-carboxamide compounds
      according to the present invention have potential for the
      treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infections; Plasmodium
      falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections; Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and
      Plasmodium knowlesi infections. Desirable properties of compounds
      of formula (I) according to the present invention include: potency
      against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7; low toxicity in MRC-5 or HepG2
      cells ; both desirable Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) 3D7 potency and
      low toxicity in MRC-5 or HepG2 ; desirable Plasmodium falciparum
      and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) activity against clinical isolates;
      desirable transmission blocking activity; gametocyte inhibitory
      potential; activity against dormant liver stage forms; good
      biopharmaceutical properties such as physical stability; good
      solubility profiles; appropriate metabolic stability; desirable
      ADME properties (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion).<br>
