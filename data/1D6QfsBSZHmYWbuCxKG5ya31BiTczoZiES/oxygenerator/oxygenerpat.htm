      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Exothermic reacting chemical oxygen generators are heat insulated
      with a hydrate to protect the user. The hydrate, when heated by
      the generator releases water which is vaporized and allowed to
      escape to a zone which will not be grasped by the user or is
      absorbed in a surrounding inert insulation layer where it can
      condense and revaporize as the heat wave passes through the
      surrounding inert insulation. The generator is preferably in the
      form of a disposable canister such as a tin can containing an
      oxygen generating chlorate candle and means for igniting the
      candle. A mask or cannula carrying cap is snapped on the can and
      has mechanism for piercing the can and activating the ignition
      means to flow oxygen to the mask or cannula.<b><br>
        <br>
        1. Field of the Invention<br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to the art of protecting the users of
      exothermic reacting chemical oxygen generators from heat released
      by the generators and specifically deals with a disposable tin can
      type chlorate candle oxygen generator with a snap-on cap having
      mechanism for activating the candle and delivering the oxygen to a
      cap carried face mask where the body of the can is insulated with
      a hydrate salt layer sandwiched between refractory fiber
      insulation layers so that the can can be handled without
      discomfort from heat released during the oxygen generating
      decomposition of the chlorate candle.<br>
      <br>
      In my prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,702,305 and 3,725,156 there are
      disclosed and claimed chemical formulations and ignition cone
      compositions adapted for oxygen generator cells disclosed and
      claimed in the Churchill and Thompson U.S. Pat. No. 3,736,104.
      These compositions and generator cells can be used with the
      present invention to avoid heretofore required oxygen dispensing
      and cell carrying cases described and claimed in the Churchill,
      Thompson, and McBride U.S. Pat. No. 3,733,008.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      The Jackson and Bovard U.S. Pat. No. 2,558,756 seeks to insulate
      an oxygen generating composition in a canister with an envelope of
      potassium perchlorate between the composition and canister which
      is alleged to decompose endothermically with evolution of oxygen
      under the heat of reaction of the composition in the canister. The
      patentees contend that such an envelope of potassium perchlorate
      plus glass wool surrounding the envelope in the canister will hold
      the external temperature of the canister to a maximum of about 200
      DEG C. (392 DEG F.). Such high temperatures do not permit the
      canister to be grasped by the user and, therefore, Jackson and
      Bovard were forced to mount the canister in an envelope providing
      an air space around the canister and formed of a relatively
      non-heat-conducting material such as a laminated fabric resin
      equipped with perforations for radiating heat. Since potassium
      perchlorate has a low heat conductivity and a very low heat of
      decomposition into the chloride and oxygen, it would appear that
      these characteristics of the perchlorate are the reason for the
      insulating action and not, as stated in the patent, by an
      endothermic decomposition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THIS INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This invention now provides chemical oxygen generator canisters
      housing a combustible material which upon ignition undergoes
      exothermic reaction to evolve oxygen which are insulated so
      efficiently that they may be grasped without discomfort even when
      the composition reaches its highest temperature in generating the
      oxygen. The canisters of this invention are insulated with a
      hydrate salt that releases its water when heated by temperatures
      developed during the exothermic decomposition of the oxygen
      generating material in the canister. The released water is
      vaporized thereby converting sensible heat into heat of
      vaporization and the vapor is allowed to escape to a zone of the
      canister which is not grasped by the user or is condensed in a
      surrounding insulating layer and then reevaporated as the heat
      wave passes through this outer insulating layer. Useful hydrate
      salts are inexpensive and are preferably sandwiched between
      aluminum foil backed layers of inert refractory fibers. Surface
      temperatures of about 160 DEG F. can be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred hydrate salts contain a large percentage of hydrated
      water and break down at a reasonably low temperatures, for
      example, less than 200 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      Epsom salt (MgSO4 . 7H2 O), trisodium phosphate (Na3 PO4 . 12H2
      O), and glauber's salt (Na2 SO4 . 10H2 O) are preferred insulating
      hydrate salts but the following hydrate salts are also useful.<br>

      <br>
      Oxygen generator canisters of the type disclosed and claimed in
      the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 3,736,104 housing the sodium
      chlorate-sodium oxide composition of my aforesaid U.S. Pat. No.
      3,702,305 and when ignited with ignition cone material of my
      aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 3,725,156 and sized to produce an average
      of about 5.5 liters per minute of medically pure oxygen for 15
      minutes reach surface temperatures of around 460 DEG F. which, of
      course, is far too hot to handle with bare hands. Insulation of
      these canisters with bulky one-half inch thick blankets of
      refractory fibrous materials of the best known efficiency only
      reduce the outer surface temperature of these canisters to 310 DEG
      F. which is still too hot to handle with bare hands. By placing a
      layer of a hydrate salt such as Epsom salt within the insulation
      according to this invention, the maximum outer surface temperature
      of the canisters was reduced to 160 DEG F. which can be
      comfortably handled. It is pointed out that the apparent surface
      temperature of an object to a person touching it depends on the
      thermal conductivity of the surface and, therefore, a metal
      surface of 130 DEG F. will feel warmer than an insulated surface
      of 160 DEG F. Therefore, while 160 DEG F. would normally sound
      high for handling with bare hands, the canisters of this invention
      can be comfortably grasped especially where the outer surface is
      composed of an insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism of heat absorption according to this invention is
      apparently the decomposition of the hydrate as indicated by the
      following formula:<br>
      <br>
      Epsom salt MgSO4 . 7H2 O .fwdarw. MgSO4 + 7H2 O (g) .DELTA. Hr =
      98.6 K Cal/mole<br>
      which can absorb 400 cal/(gm of MgSO4 . 7H2 O).<br>
      Tri sodium phosphate<br>
      100 DEG C.<br>
      Na3 PO4 . 12H2 O<br>
      .fwdarw. Na3 PO4 + 12H2 O(g)<br>
      .DELTA. Hr = 155.4 K Cal/mole<br>
      which can absorb 408.8 cal/ (gm of Na3 PO4 . 12H2 O)<br>
      Glauber's salt<br>
      100 DEG C.<br>
      Na2 SO4 . 10H2 O<br>
      .fwdarw. Na2 SO4 + 10H2 O (g)<br>
      .DELTA. Hr = 124.58 K Cal/mole<br>
      which can absorb 386.7 cal/ (gm Na2 SO4 . 10H2 O).<br>
      <br>
      The heat is actually used to break down the hydrate and vaporize
      the water of hydration so the heat is not really absorbed but is
      converted from sensible heat to the heat of vaporization for the
      water. Where the hydrate salt is sandwiched between two layers of
      aluminum foil backed refractory fibrous material blankets, water
      can sometimes be observed escaping from the top of the inner
      aluminum foil barrier. If the foil is omitted the hydrate breaks
      down and vapor escapes radially and axially through the
      insulation, the process appearing to be one of hydrate break-down
      with condensation of moisture in the outer layer of insulation. As
      the "heat wave" penetrates the insulation, the water is
      reevaporated until it escapes from the outermost surface of the
      insulation. The canister can be handled comfortably but the
      insulation may become damp.<br>
      <br>
      Glauber's salt has the disadvantage of being efflorescent so
      canisters equipped with this insulation material should be sealed
      in a moisture-proof envelope before use.<br>
      <br>
      It is then an object of this invention to provide a heat insulator
      including a layer of a hydrate salt.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide oxygen generator
      canisters of a combustion material which, when ignited, undergoes
      exothermic reaction with evolution of oxygen, which canisters are
      heat insulated by a layer of a salt which releases water at
      temperatures generated by the composition and convert sensible
      heat into heat of vaporization so that the canisters can be
      grasped by bare hands without discomfort.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide an oxygen generator
      canister with an envelope of insulating material including a layer
      of hydrate salt sandwiched between aluminum foil-backed refractory
      fiber material.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the invention is to provide a chlorate
      candle oxygen generator in the form of a disposable tin can with
      one end thereof having an oxygen dispensing orifice with a
      puncturable seal and a surrounding bead receiving a snap-on cap
      with mechanism for piercing the seal and activating the chlorate
      candle to dispense oxygen through a tube to a face mask carried by
      the cap and with the side wall of the can covered by a multi-layer
      envelope of insulating material including an inner layer of a
      hydrate salt enabling the can to be comfortably grasped even when
      the tin can reaches its highest temperature during oxygen
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the invention is to provide a disposable
      oxygen generator insulated canister with a snap-on activating and
      dispensing cap.<br>
      <br>
      A specific object of this invention is to eliminate heretofore
      required carriers and envelopes for oxygen generators which
      release heat and to so insulate the generator that it can be
      comfortably grasped with bare hands during oxygen generation.<br>
      <br>
      Other and further objects of this invention will be apparent to
      those skilled in this art from the following detailed description

      </b><b> A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the oxygen generator 10 includes a tin
      plated steel can 11, hereinafter referred to as a tin can,
      providing a casing for a compacted sodium chlorate candle 12
      having the composition of my aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,305
      which is covered with an ignition cone composition 13 disclosed
      and claimed in my aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 3,725,156. A glass vial
      14 filled with water 15 rests on or is embedded in the ignition
      cone 13. If desired, a first fire composition 16 ca1n surround the
      vial 14 and have the following formula:<br>
      <br>
      NaClO3 18% by weight<br>
      NalO3 38% by weight<br>
      Na2 O 44% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      The tin can 11 has the conventional cylindrical side wall 17 with
      flat bottom and top end walls 18 and 19 connected and sealed to
      the side wall by beads 20 and 21, respectively. The bottom wall 18
      is imperforate but the top wall 19 has a central circular orifice
      22 closed by a puncturable metal foil seal 23 secured either to
      the top or bottom face of the end wall 19.<br>
      <br>
      The cylindrical wall 17 of the tin can 11 is covered to a level 24
      just below the bead 21 by insulation 25 and the bottom wall 18 is
      covered by insulation 26. The top wall or end 19 and the bead 21
      remain uncovered.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with this invention the insulation 25 includes a
      layer of a hydrate salt 27 sandwiched between aluminum foil-backed
      refractory fiber blankets 28 and 29 with a cardboard, plastics
      material or metal sleeve 30 surrounding the outer blanket 29. If
      the aluminum foil around the hydrate layer is omitted as shown in
      FIG. 2-A, the outer sleeve 30 should be porous to allow water
      vapor to escape through the periphery in a radial direction as
      well as through the ends in an axial direction. As shown, the
      blanket 28 has a relatively thick layer 28a composed of refractory
      fibrous material surrounding the cylindrical side wall 17 of the
      tin can and backed by a backing layer of thin aluminum foil 28b.
      The blanket 29 has a relatively thick outer layer 29a of
      refractory fibrous material on a backing 29b of the aluminum foil.
      The outer fibrous layer 29a is covered by the sleeve 30. Thus, the
      hydrate salt 27 is sandwiched between the aluminum foil backings
      28b and 29b of the refractory fibrous blankets 28 and 29.<br>
      <br>
      The blankets 28 and 29 are preferably composed of a product sold
      under the trademark "Fiberfrax" by the Carborundum Company of
      Niagara Falls, New York where the fibers have approximately the
      following chemical analysis in percent by weight:<br>
      <br>
      Al2 O3 50.9 percent<br>
      SiO2 46.8 percent<br>
      B2 O3 1.2 percent<br>
      Na2 O 0.8 percent<br>
      Trace Inorganics 0.3-0.5 percent.<br>
      <br>
      Other suitable insulating blankets include "Foamglas" (sold by
      Pittsburgh Corning Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.) and "Ceramic Foam"
      (sold by Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich.). These materials have
      an advantage of being non-porous and can be used without the
      aluminum foil.<br>
      <br>
      The aluminum foil backing is about 0.002 inches thick and the
      thickness of each blanket is about one-quarter inch.<br>
      <br>
      The layer of hydrate salt 27 may vary in thickness to provide the
      desired insulating effect. When one quarter inch Fiberfrax
      blankets are used, the layer 27 need only be about one quarter of
      an inch but it should be understood that the thickness of the
      blankets and the hydrate salt layer can be varied to suit use
      conditions of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      The bottom blanket 26 covering the bottom end wall of the tin can
      may be as thick as desired and also covers the ends of the
      insulation layers 27-29. Since the blanket 26 is porous, it will
      be noted that the bottom end of the insultion layer 27 is vented
      through the porous blanket to the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      It will also be noted that the top end of the insulation layer 27
      is vented to the atmosphere and as will be more fully hereinafter
      explained, the cap which is snapped on the top of the can to
      activate the chlorate candle 12 and dispense oxygen to a face mask
      will not block the open top venting of this layer.<br>
      <br>
      The following calculations illustrate the superiority of the
      insulation of this invention as compared with ordinary insulation.
      For illustrative purposes high temperature reacting chlorate
      candles containing iron fibers, barium peroxide and glass fibers
      in a tin plated steel can were used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE I -- BARE CANISTER, NO INSULATION</b><br>
      <br>
      Canister details:<br>
      tin plated steel<br>
      emissivity = 0.60 (tin oxide)<br>
      diameter = 2 inches<br>
      length = 4.5 inches<br>
      <br>
      Candle details:<br>
      Average flow rate -- 4 LPM<br>
      Duration of flow = 15 minutes<br>
      Fe = 2.3% BaO2 = 4%, Glass Fibers = 6%, sodium chlorate balance<br>
      Length = 3.1, heat output = 154.1 BTU<br>
      <br>
      Calculation of surface temperature:<br>
      Neglecting heat storage within the canister and unsteady state
      conditions, the surface temperature can be calculated from the
      expression:<br>
      q = (hc + hr) Ao .DELTA.t (4)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      q = Rate of heat transfer, BTU/hr.<br>
      (hc + hr) = combined heat transfer coefficient for natural
      correction plus radiation, BTU/(sq. ft.) (hr.) ( DEGF.)<br>
      ao = the surface area, sq. ft.<br>
      .DELTA.t = the difference in temperature between the canister and
      its surroundings, DEGF.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of calculation:<br>
      hc = 0.27 (.DELTA.t /Do)@0.25 (5)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      Do is the diameter, ft.<br>
      hr = 4 .epsilon. .sigma. Tavg (6)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      .epsilon. is the emissivity;<br>
      .sigma. is the stefan-Boltzmann constant,<br>
      Btu/ (sq. ft.) (hr) (@o R)@4 ; and<br>
      Tavg is the average of the canister temperature and that of its
      surroundings, DEGR.<br>
      <br>
      With the appropriate substitutions, equation (4) becomes:<br>
      (154.1/0.25) = (hc + hr) (0.24) (t - 75) (7)<br>
      <br>
      The canister surface temperature from this equation is 659 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE II -- INSULATED CANISTER</b><br>
      <br>
      The canister details, dimensions, heat output, etc. are the same
      as in Example I, with a thickness of 1/2 inch of mineral wool
      insulation surrounding the tin can<br>
      <br>
      k = 0.024 BTU/ (ft.) (hr.) ( DEGF.) over the canister and
      .epsilon. = 1 at its outer surface, equation (4) becomes<br>
      (154.1/0.25) = (hc + hr) (0.46) (t - 75) (8)<br>
      <br>
      and the outer surface temperature of the insulation is 411 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      There is another disadvantage to a simply insulated canister; when
      the canister temperature is increased the reaction rate is
      accelerated. Heat flow through the insulation on the canister is
      given by: ##EQU1## where Am = the mean area of insulation, sq.
      ft., .DELTA.t is the temperature change across the insulation,
      DEGF., x is the thickness of insulation, ft., and k is the thermal
      conductivity of the insulation BTU/ (ft.) (hr.) ( DEGF). Solution
      of this equation for the canister wall temperature gives a value
      in excess of 3,000 DEG F. Hence the reaction rate must be
      increased. In practice the insulation would probably melt and the
      tin plate ignite.<br>
      <br>
      E<b>XAMPLE III -- INSULATION PLUS HEAT ABSORBENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In this case the canister is covered by a layer of mineral wool
      0.05 in thickness, or the equivalent amount of some other material
      with the same value of (k/x). This is followed by a layer of Na3
      PO4 . 12H2 O approximately 0.2 in. thick, depending on its bulk
      density. The trisodium phosphate is sandwiched between two layers
      of aluminum foil. A final layer of mineral wool 1/4 inch thick
      covers the outer surface.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrate decomposes at 100 DEG C. (212 DEG F.). To calculate
      the outer surface temperature it is necessary to equate the heat
      flow through the outer thickness of insulation to that transferred
      to the surroundings, as: ##EQU2## or ##EQU3##<br>
      <br>
      The solution to this equation is 118.5 DEG F. which is low enough
      for comfortable handling. The amount of heat absorbing chemical
      required in this geometry is 91.9 gm., while the canister surface
      temperature will be 627 DEG F. Note that the canister surface
      temperature is near enough to the uninsulated case (659 DEG F.)
      that the reaction rate is not likely to be effected.<br>
      <br>
      In this example, the vapor from the hydrate was vented outside the
      insulation, so that the thermal properties of the insulation were
      not changed.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it will be seen that the insulation 25 of this invention
      actually dissipates heat from the generator cell 12 and does not
      so isolate the candle 12 against heat radiation as to increase its
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen generator canister 10 is activated and dispenses oxygen
      to a mask or cannula by means of a snap-on cap 35 shown in FIGS. 2
      to 5. This cap 35 includes a plastic cylindrical body member 36
      housing activating mechanism and an outlet tube and a removably
      cylindrical cover portion 37 housing a face mask and connecting
      tube. The body member 36 has a cylindrical side wall with an open
      cylindrical top and a plurality, such as three, flexible fingers
      38 extending inwardly from the bottom thereof to snap under the
      head or rim 21 of the top wall 19 of the tin can 17 and rest on
      top of the insulation 25. It will be noted from FIG. 5 that these
      fingers 38 are spaced circumferentially to provide open spaces
      therebetween venting the tops of the insulation layers to the
      interior of the body.<br>
      <br>
      The open top of the cylindrical body 36 has a plastics spider 39
      with three legs 39a secured therein by screws 40 and projecting
      thereabove. This spider 39 has a central aperture 41 with a
      counterbore 42 slidably mounting a circular plastics button 43. A
      cylindrical insulating ceramics or plastics (phenolic resin)
      member 44 recessed at its top at 45 and at its bottom at 46
      underlies the portion of the spider 39 surrounding the counterbore
      42 and a metal plate 47 is mounted under this member 44 and spaced
      therefrom by spacer sleeves 48. Pins or bolts 49 bottomed on the
      plate 47, extending through the sleeves 48 and body member 44 and
      threaded at 50 into the bottom face of the spider 39, assemble the
      plate 47 and member 44 to the spider.<br>
      <br>
      The plate 47 mounts a central inverted cup 51 with an outturned
      lip 51a below the plate receiving a silicone rubber sealing ring
      52 therearound. This ring 52 is tightly pressed against the end
      wall 19 around the orifice 22 when the cap is snapped on the bead
      or ring 21. A metal tube 53 is secured in the side wall of the cup
      51 and extends between the plate 47 and member 44 to an insulated
      rubber tube 54 which extends alongside the member 44 into the
      cover 37.<br>
      <br>
      The button 43 carries a depending pin 55 extending through the
      member 44 and cup 51 to an enlarged pointed head 56. A coil spring
      57 in the recess 45 of the member 44 surrounds the pin 55 and
      urges the button 43 against the shoulder 58 between the aperture
      41 and the counterbore 42 of the spider 39. In this position, the
      head 56 depending from the button 43 is bottomed on the top wall
      of the cup 51 so that its pointed end 56a will be about flush with
      the outturned lip 51a of the cup.<br>
      <br>
      When the cap 35 is snapped onto the top of the can 11 with the
      fingers 38 underlying the bead 21 thereof, the seal ring 52
      provides a sealed connection joining the orifice 22 with the
      interior of the cup 51. Then, when the button 43 is depressed to
      advance the head 56 through the orifice, the pointed end of the
      head will pierce the orifice seal 23 and fracture the vial 14 to
      release water to the ignition cone material, thereby activating
      the chlorate candle 12 and generating oxygen which will flow
      through the orifice and cup 51 into the tube 53.<br>
      <br>
      The cover or lid 37 has a mouth portion 59 sized to surround and
      engage the fingers 39a projecting from the cylindrical body member
      36 to be bottomed on the top end of the cylindrical wall 36. This
      cover member or lid houses a flexible rubber face mask 60 which is
      anchored at one end 61 to the interior of the cover beyond the
      mouth portion 59. As shown in FIG. 2, this face mask 60 is folded
      into the cover 37 when it is assembled on the cap 35 and the
      insulated tube 54 is also folded into the cap. However, when the
      cover or lid 37 is removed to a use position as shown in FIG. 3,
      the face mask 60 is pulled out of the cover 37 so that the tube 54
      will feed oxygen from the activated generator to the face mask.<br>
      <br>
      The face mask 60 is a flexible rubber tube which flares outwardly
      to a very thin end lip portion 62 which can be easily depressed to
      fit the contours of the face around the mouth and nose of a user.
      Vent holes 63 are provided around the face mask to relieve excess
      oxygen and to accommodate exhaling of the user.<br>
      <br>
      The tube 54 may only be insulated at 64 in the area of the metal
      tube 53 and the insulation can be any desired flexible material.
      The tube slips over the metal tube 53 at one end and over a nipple
      65 projecting from a side wall of the face mask 60.<br>
      <br>
      From the above descriptions it will be understood that disposable
      oxygen generating canisters 10 of this invention are quickly and
      easily made available for use by a cap 35 which is easily and
      quickly mounted on unused canisters and removed from used
      canisters. The cap is not appreciably heated in use and can be
      successively used without discomfort. The fingers 38 of the cap
      are merely snapped over the bead 21 and the cap bottomed on top of
      the insulation. Then the cover or lid 37 is removed from the cap,
      the face mask pulled out of the lid, and the button 43 depressed
      to pierce the canister seal and fracture the water containing vial
      in the canister for releasing water to activate the ignition
      material and thereby start the candle to "burn" for releasing
      oxygen which will flow through the sealed cup 51 and tubes 53 and
      54 to the face mask. Vapor released from the hydrate layer 27
      between the foil layers 28b and 296 is vented through the cap body
      36 and bottom insulation pad 26 so that a user may grasp the
      sleeve 30 without coming into contact with the hot vapor. The cap
      35 acts as a chimney to direct the released water vapor away from
      the sleeve 30. If the foil layers 28b and 29b are omitted as shown
      in FIG. 2-A and the outer peripheral surface or circumference of
      the assembly is porous, the vapor freely escapes in a radial as
      well as in an axial direction, and while the surface may become
      damp it can be comfortably grasped throughout the burning of the
      oxygen generating candle.<br>
      <br>
      It will also be understood that the heat generated by the
      "burning" of the candle 12 in the tin can 11 is insulated by the
      heat dissipating insulation of this invention which by converting
      sensible heat into heat of vaporization does not raise the
      temperature in the can and keeps the exterior of the cell at a
      depressed temperature which is low enough so that the cell can be
      grasped with bare hands without discomfort.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Oxygen-generating apparatus for scuba diving</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Oxygen generation by means of electrolysis is used for underwater
      swimming. The apparatus includes a back-pack containing an oxygen
      generator, a battery, a storage tank and a purifier, plus
      breathing equipment, including hoses and mask. The generator
      comprises a cylindrical housing in which an electrolytic cell is
      rotatably mounted in such a manner that its center of gravity
      always maintains the electrode of the electrolytic cell in a
      vertical attitude irrespective of the pitch or diving position of
      the swimmer in the water.<b><br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Scuba diving, as it is generally practiced today, utilizes one or
      more tanks of compressed oxygen which are strapped to the back of
      the swimmer. These systems require heavy, bulky equipment which
      make mobility difficult both in and out of the water. This
      invention eliminates the use of large storage tanks and uses an
      electrolytic oxygen generator.<br>
      <br>
      The principles of electrolysis for oxygen generation have long
      been known. Electrolysis involves the splitting of compounds, such
      as water, into ionic-charged components of hydrogen and hydroxyl
      parts. These ions carrying, respectively. positive and negative
      charges, are known as cations and anions. The cations and anions
      are induced to migrate in an electrolytic cell under the influence
      of an electric potential impressed between an anode and a cathode
      so that the negative ions (the anions) are attracted to the anode
      and the positive ions (the cations) are attracted to the cathode.
      In order to provide a high concentration of ions of a low
      electrical resistance the electrolyte comprises a solution of
      water and sulfuric acid. In lieu of sulfuric acid, other
      electrolytes, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, are
      also used.<br>
      <br>
      Prior efforts have been made in the past to generate oxygen by
      electroylsis for underwater swimming. For example, U.S. Pat. No.
      3,504,669 to Albert uses a vest-type apparatus in which electrodes
      are spaced. But this system does not take into account the effect
      of body attitude, i.e., it makes no provision for supplying oxygen
      to the mask when the swimmer is diving.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other patents showing the use of electrolysis for generating
        oxygen are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,119,759, 3,616,436,
        3,565,068, 3,674,022, 2,984,607, 3,216,919 and 3,725,236.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention provides an electrolytic system of oxygen
      generation which is useful in scuba diving applications and which
      is capable of supplying oxygen irrespective of body pitch position
      when diving. The apparatus is sufficiently lightweight and compact
      so that it can be mounted on a swimmer's back and carried in a
      conventional manner. Means are also provided for momentarily
      blocking the breathing apparatus when the swimmer rolls.<br>
      <br>
      As in conventional electrolytic systems, the apparatus uses spaced
      electrodes consisting of an anode and a cathode connected to the
      appropriate terminals of a battery and immersed in an electrolytic
      solution of sulfuric acid. In accordance with the invention, the
      electrolyte is contained in a rotatable cell mounted within a
      fixed cylinder. Connections to the cell are made through slip
      connections so that the cell is free to rotate on its pitch axis
      within the cylinder under the effect of gravity and thereby
      maintain a vertical orientation for efficient and continuous
      operation. Automatically operated valves are provided for
      temporarily blocking the oxygen hoses when the swimmer rolls in
      the water.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The general arrangement of the apparatus is shown in FIG. 1 in
      which the breathing apparatus is depicted strapped to the back of
      a swimmer. The apparatus includes a harness 10 worn as a shirt
      over the swimmer's shoulders and fastened fore and aft by means of
      a strap 12 laced through slots 14. The breathing apparatus is
      secured to the harness by conventional support members, including
      a support 16 and tank straps 18.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the breathing apparatus includes a face
      mask 20 to which oxygen is supplied through a flexible hose 22 and
      a demand supply valve 24. The apparatus includes an oxygen storage
      tank 26 from which the oxygen is supplied to the swimmer as he
      inhales, and a conventional rebreather or purifier 28 which
      purifies the unconsumed exhaled oxygen. The partially consumed
      exhaled oxygen is supplied to the purifier 28 through flexible
      hose 30 and 32 and one-way valve 34. Oxygen from the purifier 28
      is returned to the storage tank 26 through flexible hose 38 and 40
      and a one-way valve 42. A meter 44 displays the pressure of the
      oxygen in the storage tank 26.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen generator, as illustrated in FIG. 2, comprises an
      electrolytic tank 46 rotatably mounted on its pitch axis in a
      cylindrical housing 48. As used in this application the pitch axis
      is defined as the horizontal axis of the tank when the swimmer is
      standing in a vertical upright position. A roll axis is an
      imaginary horizontal axis perpendicular to the pitch axis.<br>
      <br>
      The tank 46 contains two electrodes, an anode 50 connected via
      insulated wiring 51 to the positive side of a battery 52, and a
      cathode 54 connected to the negative side via insulated wiring 59
      and a switch 60. The battery 52 and switch 60 are housed in a
      waterproof insulating casing 61.<br>
      <br>
      With a sulfuric acid electrolyte in the tank, and with the switch
      60 closed, oxygen is formed at the anode 50 and passes through
      hoses 62 and 63 and a one-way valve 65 to the storage tank 26. In
      addition, hydrogen is formed at the cathode 54 and is pumped into
      the environment via hoses 64 and 66 by means of a motor-operated
      pump 68 energized from the battery 52.<br>
      <br>
      The details of the electrolytic generator are shown in FIGS. 3 and
      4. The tank 46 is formed of a rigid noncorrosive material and, as
      seen in FIG. 4, has a cross-section which comprises a portion of a
      cylinder just slightly smaller in diameter than the diameter of
      the cylindrical housing 48. The tank 46 has integral projecting
      shafts 70 and 72 which are rotatably supported within annular
      slots formed in projections 74 and 76. Plastic sleeve bearings 78
      and 80, and 82 and 84, provide a bearing support and seals for the
      shafts 70 and 72, respectively. The hose 62 is clamped to the
      projection 76 by a spring clamp 86 while hose 64 is clamped to the
      projection 74 by a spring clamp 88.<br>
      <br>
      Gas conduits 90 and 92 are formed on the interior of the cells 46
      to provide passageways for the hydrogen and oxygen gases,
      respectively. The conduits 90 and 92 are essentially extensions of
      hollow shafts 70 and 72 formed on the inner side walls 94 and 96
      of the cell. The conduit 90 has a caged ball float valve 97 while
      the conduit 92 has a caged ball float valve 95. The valves 95 and
      97 serve to close the respective conduits whenever the cell is
      rotated on its roll axis. As shown in the drawings, the valve 95
      will float up to a closed position to close the conduit 92 when
      the cell rotates clockwise by an amount which would otherwise be
      sufficient to admit fluid to the hose 62. The valve 97 similarly
      protects the hose 64 when the cell rotates counterclockwise.<br>
      <br>
      An anode 50 is mounted from within the conduit 92, while a cathode
      54 is mounted from within the conduit 90. An electrical connection
      to the anode 50 is made through the wall 96 to a conducting ring
      102 secured thereon. A similar connection is made from the cathode
      54 to a conducting ring 104. Brushes 106 and 108 supported from
      the side walls 110 and 112 of the housing 48 are positioned
      against the rings 102 and 104, respectively. The brushes 106 and
      108 are connected to the positive and negative sides,
      respectively, of the battery through leads 51 and 59.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the electrolytic cell 46 is initially filled with an
      electrolytic solution of fresh water and sulfuric acid. Sufficient
      electrolyte is used to cover the electrodes 50 and 54 but not so
      much that the liquid can enter the hoses 62 and 64. When the axis
      of the cell is horizontal, as noted before, the valves 95 and 97
      prevent the electrolyte from entering the hoses 62 and 64 when the
      swimmer rolls.<br>
      <br>
      When the switch 60 is closed a positive potential is applied to
      the anode 50 and a negative potential is applied to the cathode
      54. In addition, the motor for the hydrogen pump 68 is energized.
      Hydrogen ions are attracted to the cathode 54 where a hydrogen gas
      is formed. The hydrogen gas rises through the conduit 90 to the
      level of shaft 70 from where it is then pumped out of the system
      by means of the pump 68. Similarly, hydroxyl ions are attracted to
      the anode 50 where oxygen gas is formed, rising through the
      conduit 92 to the surface of the electrolyte and then through the
      shaft 72 and hose 62 to the storage tank 26.<br>
      <br>
      The center of gravity of the rotatable cell 46 is such that the
      electrodes 50 and 54 within the cell are maintained in a vertical
      orientation as the swimmer's body attitude rotates on the
      horizontal axis of the cell 46, thereby giving the swimmer freedom
      to dive and ascend without the electrolyte entering the hoses 62
      and 64. When the axis of the cell 46 is not horizontal, as when
      the swimmer rolls when his body is in a horizontal position, the
      float valves 95 and 97 close the conduits. This is not a serious
      problem since there will generally be some reserve oxygen in the
      tank 26, and since the swimmer will simply take care not to
      maintain his body in such a roll position for an extended period
      of time. Normally, a swimmer would be in such a position only
      momentarily.<br>
      <br>
      The illustrated embodiment is intended to be exemplary of the
      invention and many variations of within the scope thereof. For
      example, the cell 46 may be a full cylinder provided its center of
      gravity is below its axis of rotation. This may be accomplished by
      means of weights at the appropriate location on the cell.
      Furthermore, bearing and sleeve arrangements different from the
      simple arrangement shown may be substituted and indeed may be
      preferred. In addition, depending on system requirements, the pump
      68 may not be needed, and if additional pressurization of the
      storage tank 26 is desired an oxygen pump may be used in the line
      38 or 40.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b>A chemical oxygen generator which is operable by movement of a
      starter member or thrust member comprises an outer closed
      container having an end wall on the interior of which an ignition
      actuation liquid container is mounted. The ignition actuation
      liquid container is made of a foil material and it is mounted over
      an ignition mixture container having an ignition mixture which
      when mixed with the liquid ignites so as to ignite a spark plug
      for the oxygen generator material.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates in general to chemical oxygen generators and
      in particular to a new and useful oxygen generator with an oxygen
      spark plug disposed in a container and arranged in series for
      activation with a starter and with a closed element containing a
      liquid, which can be destroyed from the outside, and with an
      ignition mixture activated by the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical oxygen generators contain oxygen in combined form. Known
      are respirators which use chlorate spark plugs, generally called
      oxygen spark plugs, and respirators which use KO2 cartridges.<br>
      <br>
      After the start by means of a starter, the oxygen spark plug
      supplies oxygen continuously. The KO2 cartridge requires carbon
      dioxide and moisture from the exhaling air for the reaction by
      which the oxygen is released.<br>
      <br>
      Since this reaction can naturally only start after a few breaths,
      an oxygen spark plug takes over the oxygen supply in an apparatus
      with a KO2 cartridge, until the KO2 cartridge is activated.<br>
      <br>
      A known chemical oxygen generator has in a container an ignition
      mixture activated by water, etc. and an oxygen spark plug
      activated by the ignition mixture. Above the ignition mixture
      under the cover of the container is arranged a water-filled glass
      ampoule in the cavity of a pot-shaped dish. The dish has a
      deformable convex bottom in the manner of a spring diaphragm. The
      cover of the container is provided with a center with an opening
      which is tightly sealed with a foil. For starting the oxygen
      generator by activating the oxygen plug, a thrust bolt is pressed
      down, which is arranged on the cover of the container and which is
      operated from the outside. It penetrates the foil and then presses
      on the convex bottom of the dish. The dish jumps out of its normal
      position into a concave position and destroys the glass ampoule.
      The issuing water activates the ignition mixture and thus starts
      the oxygen generator. A disadvantage of this starter is the
      sensitive glass ampoule. It must be arranged shock-proof in the
      container between the oxygen spark plug and the thrust bolt and
      must be kept in close contact with the ignition mixture. This
      requires a special arrangement in an additional part, which is not
      simple, due to the design of its bottom as a spring diaphragm.
      (DOS No. 26 20 300).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention provides a chemical oxygen generator with a starter
      which operates in response to the reaction of an activating liquid
      with an ignition mixture, and which includes a liquid container
      which is simple in design and which works reliably and is arranged
      shock-proof mounting.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention there is provided a chemical
      oxygen generator which includes an outer housing which has a top
      wall which is welded on its interior to a liquid capsule. The
      liquid capsule is made of a foil material and it contains a liquid
      which acts as an igniter or reactor for an ignition material. The
      ignition material is contained in a container mounted directly
      below the foil container and sealed with the foil container by the
      welding of the flanges of the foil container directly to the
      container for the ignition material. The container for the
      ignition material also contains an opening directly under the
      liquid in the capsule and it contains a removable foil member
      sealing this opening which can be removed by depressing the
      capsule downwardly into the ignition material container. This
      causes the reaction liquid to mix with the ignition mixture
      material and produce ignition thereof and the subsequent ignition
      of a spark plug which is mounted directly below the ignition
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the solution result clearly from the use of the
      liquid capsule of foil material. It is thus shock-proof, which
      ensures that the liquid will not escape, even after shock
      stresses, so that the ignition mixture can not be accidentally
      activated. The manufacture of the simple starter is moreover
      economical and reliable.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention there is provided a chemical
      oxygen generator which is operable by movement of a starter member
      which comprises an outer closed container having an end wall, an
      ignition actuation liquid container made of foil material mounted
      in said container adjacent the end wall, and an ignition mixture
      container mounted in said container adjacent the actuation liquid
      container and having an end wall facing the actuation liquid
      container with an opening covered by a rupturable foil which when
      removed permits the actuation liquid to enter into the ignition
      mixture of the ignition mixture container.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the invention is to provide a chemical oxygen
      generator which is simple in design, rugged in construction and
      economical to manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      The various features of novelty which characterize the invention
      are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and
      forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of
      the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects
      attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying
      drawings and descriptive matter in which a preferred embodiment of
      the invention is illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><br>
      <br>
      The only FIGURE of the drawing is an exploded transverse sectional
      view of a chemical oxygen generator and actuator therefor
      constructed in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Referring to the drawings in particular the invention embodied
      therein comprises a chemical oxygen generator generally designated
      1 which includes an exterior container wall 3 having an end or top
      portion such as a cover 4. In accordance with the invention a
      liquid capsule 6 is secured by a welded seam 10 to the cover 4
      directly below an opening 9 thereof. The bottom edge of the liquid
      capsule 6 contains an annular flange 6a which is closed by a top
      wall 13 of an ignition material container generally designated 7.
      The capsule is sealed at its flange 6a to the top wall 13 by an
      annular weld 12. The top wall 13 contains an opening 14 which is
      closed by a foil material 15 which when removed will permit
      actuation liquid 19 in the capsule 6 to flow into ignition
      material or a mixture 20 contained in the ignition material
      container 7.<br>
      <br>
      Oxygen generator 1 comprises an oxygen spark plug 2 in a container
      3. Between cover 4 and oxygen spark plug 2 is arranged a starter
      5. The starter 5 comprises a liquid capsule 6, made of a metal
      foil material and mounted above an ignition mixture container 7
      made of any plate material. Ignition mixture container 7 provides
      the necessary support for the oxygen spark plug 2. Liquid capsule
      6 is arranged with its end wall or bottom 8 underneath hole 9 in
      cover 4. Liquid capsule 6 is held there by a welded seam 10. The
      interior of the container 3 is sealed gas-tight to the outside.
      Liquid capsule 6 is joined, liquid- and gas-tight with its
      turned-over edge 11 by a welded seam 12 with an end wall 13 of the
      ignition mixture container 7. A connecting opening 14 formed in
      end wall 13 as a connection between liquid capsule 6 and ignition
      mixture container 7 is sealed liquid-tight by means of foil 15.
      Filter mats 16 fill the empty space between cover 4 and oxygen
      spark plug 2. They serve as shock absorbers and insulators.<br>
      <br>
      A starter member in the form of thrust bolt 17 is arranged in a
      known manner (not shown) above the cover 4. After release by
      pressure from the top, point 18 pierces the bottom 8 of liquid
      capsule 6 and foil 15, thus opening the way for an actuator liquid
      19 to control an ignition mixture 20 in the container 7. On the
      further path of the thrust bolt 17 the bolt end 21 pushes liquid
      capsule 6 in front of it, after welded seam 10 has broken off, and
      pushes liquid 19 fully into ignition mixture 20. With the end of
      the downward movement of thrust bolt 17 gasket 22 seals a hole 9
      in the cover 4 from the outside.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen released after the activation of spark plug oxygen 2
      issues through a specially provided opening (not shown) in
      container 3 and is fed to a respirator for supplying oxygen to
      breathing air. Hole 9 can also be used for this purpose in a
      special design.<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b>A starting device for a breathing apparatus employing
      chemically-fixed oxygen which incorporates a brick of oxygen
      generating material superposed by a resilient diaphragm giving
      support to an ampule with an ignition liquid. The ampule is broken
      by an ignition means located on the diaphragm under a gas-tight
      cap in an opening whereof there is provided a resilient bushing
      containing a removable detent arranged to interact with a retainer
      of the ignition means so as to keep same in a position ready for
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The invention relates to constituent components of self-contained
      breathing apparatus employing chemically-fixed oxygen which are
      used to protect the respiratory system of man. It may be used to
      advantage in breathing apparatus of the type worn in collieries
      during accidents when the atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing,
      as may be the case due to fire and gas outbursts. Oxygen-breathing
      apparatus providing short-time protection to the respiratory
      system of man in hazardous surroundings at chemical plants and in
      other industries is another field of application of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      There is known a starting device for a chemical oxygen generator
      (cf. Application No. 2,818,250 of Dragwerk AG, Fed. Rep. of
      Germany; U.K. Patent Specification No. 2,019,729 and U.S. Pat. No.
      4,246,229) including a casing with a chemical oxygen generating
      material therein, an ampule containing an ignition liquid wherein
      the ampule is cradled adjacent the oxygen generating material, and
      an ignition means having a spring-loaded thrust bolt held fast in
      an opening within the casing by a locking pin. A sealing ring at
      the external end of the thrust bolt tightly fits adjacent the
      casing, sealing off the interior thereof when the locking pin is
      withdrawn. The sealing ring thereby prevents oxygen leaks.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of the known design is the possibility of the
      tilting of the thrust bolt due to fragments of the ampule or an
      obstacle between the sealing ring and casing (e.g. coarse
      particles of dust, chip, burrs, etc.) which impairs the sealing
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Also known is a starting device for a self-contained breathing
      apparatus (cf. USSR Inventor's Certificate No. 338,227, Int. Cl.
      A62B 21/00) incorporating a brick of an oxygen generating
      material, an ampule containing an ignition liquid cradled in a
      socket of a resilient diaphgram, and an ignition means in the form
      of a spring-loaded lever with an ignition pin held ready for
      operation by a detent.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this design is its poor reliability resulting
      from leaks of oxygen through the diaphragm, which can be damaged
      by the ignition pin in starting the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      It is the object of the invention to provide a starting device
      ensuring reliable functioning of a self-contained breathing
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the invention is that the starting device for a
      self-contained breathing apparatus employing chemically-fixed
      oxygen incorporates a brick of oxygen generating material with an
      overlying glass ampule having an ignition liquid for rendering the
      brick operable on contact therewith. The ampule is cradled in a
      socket of a resilient diaphragm attached to the brick so that the
      socket bore faces the brick, above which is located an ignition
      means for breaking the ampule. The ignition means includes a
      spring-loaded lever with an ignition pin held ready for operation
      by a retainer, and is provided with a rigid, gas-tight cap
      overlying the diaphragm and having an opening stoppered by a blind
      resilient bushing containing a detent. The detent is arranged to
      interact with the cap and retainer through the wall of the bushing
      so as to keep the lever in a position ready for operation and is
      provided with a means of withdrawing from the bushing.<br>
      <br>
      The starting device designed on the above lines improves the
      reliability of self-contained breathing apparatus, because any
      oxygen leakage is prevented even if the diaphragm is damaged in
      starting the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      It is expedient that the detent is made of a magnetically hard
      steel capable of magnetization and the cap is in a diamagnetic
      material. This plan simplifies the construction of the starting
      device, for the detent is held fast to the cap by the force of
      magnetic attraction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      A preferred embodiment of the invention will be now described by
      way of an example with reference to the accompanying drawings in
      which:<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 1 is a sectional elevation of the starting device of a
        self-contained breathing apparatus according to the invention
        and employing chemically-fixed oxygen;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> FIG. 2 are sections taken on lines II--II and III--III of
        FIG. 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The starting device for a self-contained breathing apparatus
      employing chemically-fixed oxygen incorporates a cap 1 (FIG. 1), a
      resilient diaphragm 2 with an ampule 3 containing an ignition
      liquid and cradled in a socket of the diaphragm, a brick 4 of
      oxygen generating material and an ignition means 5. The brick 4,
      the cap 1, the diaphragm 2 and the ignition means 5 are
      accommodated in a recess of the regenerative canister (not shown)
      of the breathing apparatus. The ignition means 5 comprises a lever
      7 pivotable about a pin 6 due to the action of a torsional spring
      8. An ignition pin 9 with a hook 10 is attached to the end of the
      lever 7. The hook 10 engages a bend of a retainer 11 which, in its
      turn, holds the lever 7 in a position ready for operation. The pin
      6 and the retainer 11 are fitted to a bracket 12a connected to
      base plate 12, which is held fast to a flange of the regenerative
      canister together with the cap 1 and the diaphragm 2. The opposite
      bend of the retainer 11 engages a detent 13 (FIG. 2) fitting into
      a blind resilient bushing 14 which is accommodated in an opening
      of the cap 1, thus preventing the retainer 11 from rotating. In an
      embodiment of the invention, the detent 13 is attached to the cap
      1 by bendable tabs 15 and is linked with the removable cover (not
      shown) of the container, in which the breathing apparatus is
      contained by a flexible member, e.g., a cord 16. In another
      embodiment of the invention, the detent is made of a magnetically
      hard steel capable of magnetization or of an alloy with magnetic
      properties. If the cap is made of a diamagnetic material (steel),
      the tabs 15 are redundant, for the detent 13 will be held fast by
      the force of magnetic attraction.<br>
      <br>
      The disclosed starting device operates as follows. As soon as the
      cover of the container is removed preparatory to wearing the
      apparatus, the cord 16 connected to the cover withdraws the detent
      13 from the bore of the resilient bushing 14 against the action of
      the tabs 15 or the force of magnetic attraction. Once the detent
      13 is removed, the end of the retainer 11 turns clockwise due to
      the action of the spring 8 (FIG. 1), setting aside the resilient
      bushing 14, by an amount causing the hook 10 to disengage the bend
      of the retainer 11. The lever 7 acted upon by the coiled spring 8
      pivots about the pin 6 and strikes the ampule 3 with the ignition
      pin 9. A crust formed on the surface of the brick 4 is destroyed
      by the dropping fragments of the ampule 3, facilitating the
      contact between the ignition liquid and the material of the brick
      4. The brick starts to decompose, liberating oxygen in an amount
      sufficient to meet the user's requirements during the initial
      period of operation of the breathing apparatus. The moisture and
      heat formed due to the decomposition of the brick 4, in addition
      to the liberation of oxygen, promote reactions in the regenerative
      canister of the breathing apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The disclosed starting device for a breathing apparatus employing
      chemically-fixed oxygen according to the invention ensures
      reliable operation of the apparatus, keeping same always sealed
      and preventing oxygen leakage. It also eliminates the possibility
      of inhaling toxic gases by the user.<br>

      </b>A chemical oxygen generator includes a candle in which oxygen
      is present and which is chemically combined and which is ignited
      by starting means to initiate the generation of the oxygen. This
      takes several seconds before a substantial quantity of oxygen is
      provided. Because a user of this oxygen must be supplied with the
      oxygen for respiration immediately, the invention includes a
      generator which has a pressure space, preferably above, below and
      around the oxygen candle which is located in the space and which
      is filled with compressed oxygen. The generator includes a member
      which is actuated upon release of the starting means for the
      oxygen to permit outward flow of the oxygen in the pressure space
      which is supplied until the oxygen being released from the candle
      is produced by the ignition of the candle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This invention relates in general to respirating devices and in
      particular to a new and useful device for generating oxygen for
      use in such respirating devices.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical oxygen generators are used in respirators to make
      available an oxygen supply. In chemical oxygen generators the
      oxygen is present in a chemically combined form, for example in a
      chlorate candle or a KO2 cartridge, and when needed is released in
      the course of a chemical reaction. A starting device sets the
      oxygen release in motion by manual triggering. It always takes
      several seconds before oxygen release takes place in the full
      amount required. This presents a difficulty for their use in
      respirators. The user cannot be supplied at once with the
      necessary respirable gas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the empty space of the cartridge
      vessel is additionally filled with compressed oxygen during the
      stand-by time. The quantity is sufficient to supply the user with
      respirable gas during the first seconds after start of the oxygen
      generator until there is full O2 by the chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Filling the empty space with compressed oxygen offers moreover an
      additional safety against access of moisture, which would be
      harmful for the chemical substances.<br>
      <br>
      A known oxygen generator cell unit, which is lodged in a
      dispenser, has an expendable vessel, e.g. of tinplate, with a
      cylindrical sidewall, a closed bottom wall, and an upper end wall
      with a central opening. The opening is sealed by a foil that can
      be pushed through. An oxygen candle of compressed sodium or
      potassium chlorate, to which is admixed a sodium or potassium
      oxide, is retained in the vessel by means of elastic fiber mats in
      such a way that its flat sides are spaced from the vessel wall so
      that flow paths remain for the formed oxygen. At its head end the
      oxygen candle has an ignition cone, which is centered with the
      opening in the upper end wall of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      The dispenser in which the cell unit is lodged contains a
      concentrically surrounding cylindrical sidewall and perforated
      bottom and top walls. The top wall has a movable pressure bolt and
      a casing around the latter with an oxygen outlet pipe leading out.<br>
      <br>
      To activate the oxygen generator cell unit, a bolt is pushed
      through a foil seal in the upper end wall of the vessel, and a
      glass bulb above an ignition cone is shattered. The ignition cone
      is activated, and by it the combustion of the oxygen candle is
      then initiated. The oxygen then released flows through the flow
      paths between the vessel and the oxygen candle and through the
      casing into the oxygen outlet pipe.<br>
      <br>
      A disadvantage is that the evolved oxygen is not available at the
      moment the chemical reaction is triggered. It always takes several
      (up to 10) seconds before the oxygen generator reaches its full
      nominal delivery, and this is true also of the other known
      ignition by means of a primer, percussion cap or electrical
      incandescent wire. This known oxygen generator cell unit,
      therefore, is not suitable for cases where the oxygen is needed
      immediately, as for example for emergency supply in airplanes or
      in self-rescuers carried on the body. (German AS No. 26 20 300).<br>
      <br>
      Another known oxygen emergency supply device has an oxygen
      reservoir consisting of individual pressure bottles. Connected to
      it are oxygen candles in tubular vessels. Normally, the oxygen
      reservoir is connected to the system on board as a main supply
      means. Upon failure of the board system, the oxygen candles are
      ignited and supply is assured thence via the oxygen reservoir
      utilizing the filling thereof with compressed oxygen. On jumping
      from the airplane with this emergency supply device, it is
      entirely separated from the board system. For this case it
      possesses two additional solid oxygen cartridges, so as to have a
      relatively large supply available. The total supply then comprises
      of the reservoir with the compressed oxygen, filled up from the
      board system, and the additional oxygen from the oxygen candles
      then to be ignited. A disadvantage is the complicated construction
      consisting of the storage bottles individually connected with one
      another and the solid oxygen cartridges (German PS No. 19 53 754).<br>
      <br>
      Another chemical oxygen generator contains a tightly closed
      pressure vessel, a conventional oxygen cartridge, or an oxygen
      candle in a vessel. It is equipped with the usual ignition means.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen cartridge is supported concentrically in the pressure
      vessel by ceramic fiber mats. The empty space between the pressure
      vessel and the cartridge container is filled with compressed
      oxygen before being made ready. As ignition is triggered, a valve
      opens toward the outlet, so that the oxygen can flow to the
      consumer. When the pressure of the oxygen evolving from the oxygen
      candle in the cartridge exceeds the decreasing pressure in the
      empty space, it opens a membrane, so that the oxygen can then flow
      off via the empty space and the outlet. This oxygen generator is
      compact but short. For cases where a smaller volume widthwise but
      a possible greater length is required this is disadvantageous.
      (German No. P 30 45 111).<br>
      <br>
      The invention provides a device to supply the user of the
      respirator in which a chemical oxygen generator is employed, from
      the start of use, that is immediately after actuation of the
      starting means, with a respirable gas, hence with sufficient O2
      content, in adequate quantity. The chemical oxygen generator, as a
      device to be carried on the body should not be cumbersome and be
      as small as possible in its external dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, a chemical oxygen generator
      comprises a pressure vessel which has an outlet which is connected
      to an interior pressure space in which is positioned an oxygen
      generating candle. The device includes a starter for the oxygen
      candle which is set off by a releasable member of a trigger
      mechanism. In accordance with the invention a membrance is located
      in the path of movement of the starter and this normally seals the
      pressure space in the container from the outlet. The membrane is
      ruptured at the time the oxygen candle is ignited so that the
      oxygen in the pressure space flows out of the outlet as soon as
      the starter means is put in motion.<br>
      <br>
      By a simple construction with smallest external dimension of the
      chemical oxygen generator and the additional previous filling of
      the empty spaces in the pressure vessel, the supply of the user
      with oxygen until the chemical oxygen delivery starts is assured.
      In addition, the user is satisfactorily supplied by the oxygen
      additionally already present previously during the first seconds
      until the chemical oxygen production sets in.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a
      chemical generator which includes an oxygen supply which is
      liberated at the same time that an oxygen generating candle is
      ignited.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the invention is to provide a chemical oxygen
      generator which is simple in design, rugged in construction and
      economical to manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      The various features of novelty which characterize the invention
      are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and
      forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of
      the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects
      attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying

      chemical oxygen generator constructed in accordance with the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Referring to the drawing in particular, the invention embodied
      therein comprises a chemical oxygen generator generally designated
      1 which comprises a pressure vessel having an outlet 13 which is
      communicatable with an interior pressure space which in the
      embodiment illustrated comprises a lower space 5, an upper space 6
      and an intermediate space 7 around an oxygen generating candle 2.
      The oxygen candle 2 is ignitable by a starter 3 which is set off
      by a trigger mechanism 4. The space 7 also contains support
      elements which are cross-hatched and located around the candle 2.
      In accordance with a feature of the invention, the pressure space
      is filled with a compressed oxygen and the starter mechanism
      trigger ruptures a membrane 12 which comprises a removable or
      rupturable member which blocks the communication of the pressure
      space to the outlet 13.<br>
      <br>
      In a pressure vessel 1 is lodged an oxygen candle 2. It comprises
      the usual starting means 3, actuated by a trigger 4. A lower empty
      space 5 and an upper empty space 6 in the pressure vessel 1 are
      filled with compressed oxygen in the readiness state together with
      the free space 7 around the oxygen candle 2. Thus, the spaces 5, 6
      and 7 are in common open flow communication with each other and
      with the oxygen candle 2 and such spaces are filled in a ready
      state with the stored oxygen under pressure prior to starting the
      operation of the oxygen candle 2. The empty spaces 5 and 6 are
      connected together via the free space 7 through vertically spaced
      perforated disks 8 and 8' mounted with the vessel and supporting
      the oxygen candle 2. Trigger 4 comprises a striker 11 actuated by
      a compression spring 9 and held in an inoperative position by a
      release pin 10. After the release pin 10 has been pulled, the
      striker 11, cutting open a membrane 12, strikes against the
      starting means 3 and causes it to ignite. The compressed oxygen
      contained in the spaces of the pressure vessel 1 and the oxygen
      being released later from the oxygen candle 2 then flow through an
      outlet 13 to the consumer.<br>
      <br>
      A lower button or bottom wall 14 provides a closure of the lower
      empty space 5 and carries a pressure gauge 15.<br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b>An oxygen generator is provided in the form of a housing
      having isolated first and second chambers. Oxygen-generating
      material is placed in the first chamber and a catalyst for
      activating the oxygen-generating material is placed in the second
      chamber. A heat-absorbing hydrated salt is also provided so as to
      be present during the reaction to absorb the excessive heat
      released upon the exothermic chemical decomposition of the
      oxygen-generating material. The salt has an endothermic
      dehydration reaction temperature below 50 DEG C. A membrane is
      operationally connected to the reaction chamber to allow the
      generated oxygen to be expelled from the reaction chamber while
      retaining the material contents therein.<br>
      <b><br>
        BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to the exothermic generation of oxygen and
      more particularly to a portable self-contained oxygen generator
      apparatus and method of generating oxygen well suited for medical
      and industrial usage.<br>
      <br>
      Emergency medical oxygen is used extensively to meet the
      requirements of critically ill or injured persons. Small emergency
      medical oxygen supplies are common in ambulance, fire, police, and
      medical emergency operations. Generally, emergency medical oxygen
      supplies are in the form of small tanks containing oxygen at high
      pressure. These tanks are relatively expensive since they must be
      equipped with a precision gas regulator and valves to control the
      flow and pressure of the oxygen during use. Maintaining sufficient
      numbers of these tanks is sometimes prohibitive because of their
      cost. In many cases, the requirements of an actual emergency will
      overwhelm the available number of oxygen supplies, such as during
      a fire with a large number of smoke-inhalation victims. Moreover,
      these devices exhibit significant weight so as to be inconvenient
      to store and handle, and must be refilled after use.<br>
      <br>
      Notably, emergency medical oxygen supplied from such tanks is
      often of inferior quality. Such oxygen is commonly too dry and can
      be too cold when the tank has been stored in a cold place. In
      hospital respirators, expensive systems are utilized to warm and
      moisturize the oxygen before providing it to the patient. However,
      such a conditioning of the oxygen is difficult, if not impossible,
      to achieve during the use of emergency oxygen supplies due to the
      size and weight of the equipment required to provide such
      conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      Portable sources of oxygen are also utilized in athletics and
      industry. For example, athletic teams in such sports as football
      often provide on-site oxygen supplies for use by the players.
      Joggers, athletes, and people performing rigorous exercise also
      have the need for portable sources of oxygen. The need is also
      present in a wide variety of other diverse applications such as on
      trains, planes, and boats to counter motion sickness.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of storage tanks render them unacceptable for
      many applications and, heretofore, portable oxygen generators have
      also been unacceptable in many respects. In oxygen generators,
      oxygen-rich chemicals are decomposed in an exothermic chemical
      reaction to evolve oxygen. Excess heat produced by the chemical
      reaction is undesirable and may render the oxygen generator
      hazardous to operate and may render the oxygen produced
      unacceptable for medical use. For example, hydrogen peroxide is a
      common oxygen-rich chemical material. Without some means for
      removing excess heat, the heat generated by the decomposition of
      hydrogen peroxide is sufficient to generally discourage the use of
      a solution of hydrogen peroxide having a concentration greater
      than 10 percent. A solution of hydrogen peroxide greater than 10
      percent, when decomposed, would generate an amount of heat
      sufficient to seriously overheat the oxygen generator. In
      addition, the vapor pressure of the hydrogen peroxide would be
      substantial at these elevated temperatures and would represent a
      significant toxicological problem. Excessive heating would also
      result in autocatalytic decomposition of the peroxide and can
      bring about a dangerous runaway reaction. The excessive
      temperature would also eventually boil the aqueous solution in the
      generator and excessively heat the product oxygen which would be
      uncomfortable or dangerously hot to consume in medical
      applications and would generate large amounts of steam thereby
      begetting additional problems. Prior means for removing excess
      heat, such as a heat exchanger, are not desirable in a portable
      oxygen generator because of size restrictions and severe cost
      constraints. Such means for controlling excessive heating would be
      so costly as to greatly restrict the economic utility of such
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the heat generated by the exothermic reaction has
      substantially restricted the use of such oxygen generators for
      medical and industrial applications where convenient portability
      is required.<br>
      <br>
      The portable oxygen generator apparatus and method of the present
      invention overcome these and other problems found in prior
      portable oxygen supplies by providing an oxygen generator
      comprising a housing having isolated first and second chambers. A
      predetermined amount of oxygen-generating material is provided in
      the first chamber of the unit and a predetermined amount of
      catalyst for activating the oxygen-generating material is provided
      in the second chamber. A heat-absorbing chemical material is also
      provided so as to be present during the reaction to absorb the
      excessive heat released upon the exothermic chemical decomposition
      of the oxygen-generating material. An admixing apparatus is
      selectively actuable for selectively admixing the
      oxygen-generating material into operative contact with the
      catalyst in the presence of the heat-absorbing material in one of
      the chambers, being the reaction chamber. A membrane is
      operationally connected to the reaction chamber to allow the
      generated oxygen to be expelled from the reaction chamber while
      retaining the material contents therein.<br>
      <br>
      The method of producing oxygen in accordance with the present
      invention includes the steps of providing an oxygen-generating
      material, a catalyst, and a heat-absorbing material, bringing the
      catalyst and the oxygen-generating material into operative contact
      to promote the exothermic generation of oxygen gas in the presence
      of the chemical heat-absorbing material, whereby the temperature
      of the reaction is controlled without adversely influencing the
      production of oxygen. The generated oxygen is isolated from and
      allowed to pass from the site of the exothermic reaction for
      subsequent use. The chemical heat-absorbing material is present in
      an amount sufficient to be effective in absorbing a portion of the
      excessive heat generated by the exothermic decomposition of the
      oxygen-generating material.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      light-weight, self-contained, high-capacity oxygen generator with
      an extended shelf life which provides, upon actuation, a steady
      regulated flow of warm, conditioned oxygen for medical use.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the invention to provide an oxygen
      generator which is comprised of chemicals that are easy and safe
      to store and use.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the invention is to provide a method for
      generating oxygen from decomposable oxygen-rich materials which
      controls excessive generated heat in an economical space-efficient
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide an oxygen
      generator which is economical to manufacture, economical and
      simple to use, and safely disposable after use.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects will be in part obvious and in part pointed out more
      in detail hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> FIG. 1 is a partially diagrammatical sectional view of the
        oxygen generator apparatus of the present invention, and</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> FIG. 2 is a view similiar to FIG. 1 of an alternative
        embodiment of the oxygen generator apparatus of the present
        invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like parts are
      correspondingly numbered, FIG. 1 shows the oxygen generator
      apparatus of the present invention. The generator is comprised of
      a housing 12 forming an interior cylinder 14 which is separated
      into an upper chamber 16 and a lower chamber 18 by a slidably
      mounted plunger or diaphragm element 20. The housing 12 exhibits
      holdable configuration being approximately the size of two
      12-ounce soft-drink cans arranged end to end and can be fabricated
      of injection molded polypropylene or other suitable material. A
      tube 22 fluidly connects the lower chamber 18 to the upper chamber
      16 and is provided with a normally closed control valve 24 to
      permit regulation of the flow through the tube 22.<br>
      <br>
      At the upper end of the housing 12, a hydrophobic membrane 26
      operationally interconnects the upper chamber 16 to a delivery
      tube 28. As will be explained in detail subsequently, the oxygen
      gas will pass from the upper chamber 16 through the membrane 26 to
      the delivery tube 28 for conduction to an apparatus for
      application, e.g., a mask (not shown). A releasable cap 30 is
      detachably secured to the housing 12 to protect the delivery tube
      28 from dirt and contamination when not in use.<br>
      <br>
      A second hydrophobic membrane 32 is mounted within the lower end
      of the housing 12 to operationally interconnect the lower chamber
      18 with the atmosphere. Similar to the membrane 26, the
      hydrophobic membrane 32 functions to easily pass gas but retain
      liquids and will allow any excess oxygen formed during storage of
      the oxygen generator to be vented to the atmosphere without loss
      of liquid. A support substrate 33 with drainage ports 35 is
      mounted adjacent the membrane 32.<br>
      <br>
      The plunger 20 is slidably mounted within a lubricated seal or
      flange 34 in the cylinder 14 so that the plunger 20 is slidable
      along the length of the cylinder 14. A compression spring 36 is
      mounted within the upper chamber 16 between the membrane 26 and
      the plunger 20 to urge the plunger 20 in a downward direction
      toward the lower chamber 18. Consequently, the plunger 20 is
      biased downwardly toward the lower chamber 18 to apply a pressure
      upon any liquid within the lower chamber 18. The pressure applied
      by the plunger 20 on the liquid within the lower chamber 18 will
      force the liquid up through the tube 22 and into the upper chamber
      16 upon actuation of the control valve 24. Thus, an actuable
      subassembly is provided for selectively admixing or conducting the
      liquid within the lower chamber 18 to the upper chamber 16. Other
      alternative methods can be utilized for selectively admixing or
      conducting the liquid from the lower chamber 18 to the upper
      chamber 16 including the use of vacuum techniques to pressurize
      the liquid in chamber 18.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrophobic membrane 26 operationally interconnects the
      delivery tube 28 and the upper chamber 16 and functions to allow
      passage of the oxygen gas from the upper chamber 16 to the
      delivery tube 28 while restraining liquids within the upper
      chamber 16. The membrane 26 also functions to purify the evolved
      oxygen by filtering out contaminating bacteria, particulate matter
      and free aerosolized water. Importantly, the membrane 26 prevents
      any water aerosols carrying hydrogen peroxide from passing from
      the generator to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      The design of the membranes is based upon regulating the size of
      the pores within the fabric of the membrane and the use of a
      hydrophobic filter medium that tends to reject fluids but easily
      passes gaseous components. The pores must be small enough to
      prevent the passage of liquid even at the highest pressure
      differential expected but must be large enough to allow the
      desired gas flow to occur within the range of allowed differential
      pressures across the membrane. Thus, there must be a balance
      between the size of the pores required to retain liquid and the
      size and number of pores required to obtained the desired flow of
      oxygen therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure required to pass a fluid through a pore by capillary
      force is:<br>
      P=2S(cos.theta.)/r<br>
      <br>
      where S is the surface tension of the fluid, .theta. is the fluid
      and membrane contact angle, and r is the radius of the pore. A
      wettable membrane having pores with a diameter of 16 micrometers
      would be sufficient to retain pure water under a pressure of 0.1
      atmosphere. Modifying the membrane to provide a contact angle of
      70 degrees would allow the membrane to contain pores having a
      diameter of 50 micrometers. For adequate safety, pores of less
      than 10 micrometers in diameter on a nonwettable membrane are
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      Gas flow, Q, through the pores of the membrane, of radius r, and
      at a differential pressure of P, is described by:<br>
      Q=r@4 P/8vL<br>
      <br>
      which describes the flow of gas through a single pore when the
      length of the pore is L, and where the viscosity of the gas is v.
      The number of pores in a given membrane is:<br>
      N=F (Rm@2 /r@2)<br>
      <br>
      where F is the fraction of open space and Rm is the radius of a
      round membrane section.<br>
      <br>
      Total gas flow through a given membrane disc of radius Rm, or area
      Rm, is:<br>
      QN=r@2 PFRm@2 /8vL<br>
      <br>
      Based upon this equation and testing, it has been found that
      membranes having pores that are 2-10 micrometers in diameter and
      having a total surface area of at least 20 cm@2 can easily pass 20
      liters of gas/minute. In the illustrated embodiment, the membranes
      26, 32 are glass fiber membranes either unsupported or supported
      on a coarse cellulose-fiber substrate, impregnated with silicon
      and/or tetrafluoroethylene resins to impart hydrophobicity, and
      having a pore size of approximately 5 micrometers.<br>
      <br>
      To load the oxygen generator for eventual actuation, the lower
      chamber 18 is filled with a solution of an oxygen-generating
      solution which may also contain some of the heat-absorbing
      material. The upper chamber 16, in turn, is filled with a solution
      of the heat-absorbing material at an appropriate concentration
      together with a nucleating agent and a solid catalyst that
      promotes the rapid decomposition and release of oxygen by the
      material in the lower chamber when it is brought into contact with
      the catalyst. The catalyst can be supported on the walls of the
      chamber 16 or on a porous support medium (not shown) or can be
      added as a solid powder or liquid. Additional chemicals may be
      added to enhance or control the performace of the heat-absorbing
      material, to reduce foaming, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In this deactivated or storage mode, the drive spring 36 is
      compressed or loaded and the reactants are separated by the
      movable plunger 20 which also maintains the lower chamber 18 under
      pressure due to the biasing force of the spring 36. The valve 24
      is normally closed to prevent communication between the upper and
      lower chambers. In this mode, the oxygen generator can be stored
      and is ready for use upon actuation of the control valve 24. With
      stabilizers, a storage life of at least five years can be
      expected.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the control valve 24 is opened to actuate the oxygen
      generator to produce oxygen gas. Upon opening the valve 24, the
      solution in the lower chamber 18 is caused to flow up the tube 22
      due to the pressure applied by the spring 36 through the plunger
      20. The solution flows into operative contact with the catalyst
      contained in the upper chamber 16 and the reaction commences. The
      control valve 24 can be adjusted to provide a selectable steady
      flow rate into the upper chamber 16 or to provide an intermittent
      burst.<br>
      <br>
      When the heat generated by the oxygen-producing reaction within
      the upper chamber 16 causes the temperature of this chamber to
      rise above a predetermined critical value, for example,
      approximately 30 DEG C., the heat will start to be absorbed by the
      heat-absorbing material, due to the endothermic nature of that
      material, to maintain the upper chamber at an acceptable operating
      temperature. Further buffering of the temperature is provided by
      the heat capacity of the chemicals and the liquid as well as
      through the dissipation of heat by convection and conduction
      through the walls of the housing.<br>
      <br>
      The evolved oxygen gas passes through the hydrophobic membrane 26
      to the delivery tube 28 for distribution to the user. The
      hydrophobic membrane 26 functions to allow passage of the oxygen
      gas therethrough but restrains the passage of liquid. In this
      manner, the oxygen gas is purified for use for medical purposes.<br>
      <br>
      As the oxygen gas is evolved, the oxygen-generating solution
      continues to be moved from the lower chamber 18 to the upper
      chamber 16 by the displacement of the plunger 20. The control
      valve 24 is adjustable to allow the user to vary the rate of
      oxygen gas evolution over a wide range. In the illustrated
      configuration, the oxygen generator can produce a total of about
      55 liters of oxygen. The medical use of oxygen usually specifies a
      flow rate of 2-6 liters of oxygen per minute and, under normal
      conditions, the oxygen generator of the illustrated embodiment is
      sufficient for 10-25 minutes. Since the chemical components are
      aseptic, the generated oxygen is sterile in addition to being
      filtered or purified by the hydrophobic membrane. Accordingly, the
      oxygen generator is of relatively high capacity for its compact,
      lightweight size (i.e., 3 lbs.) and produces warm, sterile, and
      pure oxygen for medical applications. Upon exhaustion of the
      chemical reactants, the container and residue components are
      safely disposable.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, an alternative embodiment of the oxygen
      generator apparatus of this invention is shown wherein like
      numerals are used to designate the same or like parts. In this
      embodiment, the housing 12 forms an internal cavity 38 having an
      upper end portion 40 and a lower end portion 42. The lower end
      portion or lower chamber 42 contains a dry powder mixture of a
      decomposable oxygen-generating chemical and a heat-absorbing
      material. A rupturable pouch 44 is mounted in the upper end
      portion 40 of cavity 38. The pouch 44 contains a liquid 46 having
      a catalyst to promote the decomposition of the oxygen-generating
      material in the lower end portion 42. The oxygen-generating
      material is thus separated from the catalyst solution by the
      rupturable pouch 44.<br>
      <br>
      A striker element 48 is slidably mounted within a guide sleeve 50
      extending through the upper end 52 of the housing 12. The striker
      element 48 has a pointed end 54 adjacent the pouch 44 and a handle
      portion 56 extending above the upper end 52 of the housing 12. The
      depression of the handle end 56 will thus slidably displace the
      striker element 48 downwardly to cause the pointed end 54 to
      rupture the pouch 44. To prevent an unintended depression of
      handle 56, a safety ring 58 locks the striker 48 in a withdrawn
      position. The safety ring 58 is removed by a simple pulling action
      to allow subsequent actuation of the striker element 48.<br>
      <br>
      The upper end 52 of the housing 12 contains an outlet orifice 60
      in communication with the cavity 38. A filter plug assembly 62 is
      mounted within orifice 60 and comprises a packed bed of stainless
      steel mesh 64 coated with silicon oil to provide a foam breaker.
      An alternative respiratory therapy filter or hydrophobic membrane
      (not shown) is mounted adjacent the foam breaker within the plug
      assembly 62 and functions in substantially the same manner as
      discussed hereinbefore in connection with membrane 26. An
      acceptable respiratory therapy filter is manufactured by Pall
      Corporation of Glen Cove, Long Island, N.Y. A delivery tube 66 is
      located at the top of the filter plug 62 and is covered by a
      removable cap 68. During storage of the oxygen generator, the cap
      68 maintains the delivery tube 66 in a clean condition.<br>
      <br>
      To actuate the oxygen generator, the cap 68 is removed from
      delivery tube 66 and the safety ring 58 is removed from the
      striker element 48. The handle 56 of the striker element 48 is
      depressed to rupture the pouch 44. Upon rupture, the catalytic
      solution contained in the pouch 44 is intermixed with the
      oxygen-generating material in the presence of the chemical
      heat-absorbing material. As previously described with respect to
      the embodiment of FIG. 1, the catalyst promotes an exothermic
      decomposition of the oxygen-generating material to evolve oxygen
      gas and as the reaction temperature reaches a predetermined value,
      the chemical heat-absorbing material endothermically absorbs the
      excess heat to maintain a stable and acceptable operating
      temperature. The evolved oxygen gas passes through the hydrophobic
      membrane and outward to the delivery tube 66 while the foam
      breaker 64 prevents the passage of any foam caused by the chemical
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Other acceptable containers for the catalytic solution may be
      utilized as well as alternative means for selectively rupturing
      the container. For example, the pouch 44 can be pressurized as
      well as the interior of housing 12. When the housing 12 is opened
      to the atmosphere, the pressure is released so that the pouch
      expands and bursts to cause the catalytic solution to intermix
      with the oxygen-generating material.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned hereinbefore, the method of the present invention
      provides for the generation of oxygen only at the time it is
      needed through the utilization of an oxygen-generating composition
      which, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, will provide a
      controlled release of oxygen gas. The composition not only
      produces the oxygen gas but, at the same time, controls the heat
      generated by the oxygen-releasing reaction and obviates the hazard
      associated with excessive heat generation within the container. In
      accordance with this system, the oxygen is produced by the
      exothermic decomposition of the chemical oxygen-rich composition
      while the excessive heat produced thereby is absorbed by an
      appropriate heat-absorbing material present within the vicinity of
      the reaction site.<br>
      <br>
      As can be appreciated, a number of different oxygen-rich or
      oxygen-generating materials may be utilized as the source of the
      desired oxygen gas. Many of these materials such as the peroxides
      and chlorates are well known and this invention should not be
      unduly restricted to a specific type of material. However, it is
      generally preferred that the oxygen-generating material be capable
      of producing the highest possible amount of free oxygen relative
      to the weight and volume of the initial oxygen-producing material.
      Accordingly, it is generally preferred that the percent, by
      weight, of free oxygen released by the material should be greater
      than five percent and preferrably should be greater than ten
      percent, keeping in mind the necessity to balance the
      oxygen-generating capability of the material against the handling
      and storage characteristics thereof. For example, although
      alkaline superoxides and peroxides or strong solutions of hydrogen
      peroxide may be used in accordance with the present invention,
      such materials are highly caustic and frequently require great
      care due to their toxic and hazardous nature. Other materials
      which may be employed, such as barium peroxide or potassium
      permanganate are far more expensive and although they may be
      employed, their costs tends to be prohibitive. Still others, such
      as sodium persulfate, contain a low level of oxygen gas-generating
      potential and therefore are less desirable in a system of the type
      described in this invention. When seeking a balance of the various
      factors involved, it has been found that the preferred material
      should be relatively safe and stable during handling. Materials of
      this type include peroxide hydrated salts, such as potassium
      percarbonate, which has been used in laundry bleach formulations
      and contains about 13 percent free oxygen. This material also
      advantageously provides release of the oxygen in a controlled
      manner over a brief period of time. Such materials are
      particularly beneficial when the oxygen supply is to be used for
      medical purposes. However, where industrial application is
      envisioned, other materials may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned, the utilization of materials such as peroxides
      results in the production of excessive amounts of heat and it is
      necessary during the reaction to control the temperature level at
      the reaction site to avoid autocatalytic acceleration of the
      reaction rate. This is achieved in accordance with the present
      invention by stabilizing the exothermic reaction through intimate
      admixture therewith of a heat-absorbing material that prevents the
      reaction temperature from exceeding an established limit. This is
      achieved without seriously reducing the oxygen-generating
      capability of the system. In this manner, the production of the
      oxygen gas and the absorption of the excess heat generated thereby
      is carried out substantially simultaneously. Accordingly, a proper
      balancing of the appropriate mixture of oxygen-generating and
      heat-absorbing materials can result in the reliable maintenance of
      a constant temperature throughout the course of the oxygen gas
      producing reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As will be appreciated, several materials will exhibit the
      necessary endothermic characteristics whereby heat will be
      absorbed by the material without interfering with the generation
      of oxygen. For systems of the type described herein it has been
      found that salts which undergo reversible dehydration are
      particularly useful. These highly hydrated salts will absorb the
      excess heat generated by the oxygen-producing reaction. Other
      materials that may be used are those which undergo endothermic
      phase transitions or chemical transformations as the result of
      heat absorption. For example, certain salts having significant
      heats of solution could be used. While the choice of the
      appropriate heat-absorbing component depends upon the desired
      temperature and the quantity of energy absorbed per unit of
      chemical utilized, the temperature at which the heat-absorbing
      component is most effective is an important consideration.
      Accordingly, it is generally preferred that the material exhibit
      an endothermic reaction at a temperature below 50 DEG C. Where the
      gas is to be utilized for medical purposes the temperature of the
      gas at the point of use should not substantially exceed 30 DEG C.
      to insure full comfort by the user.<br>
      <br>
      In the system of the present invention, the preferred
      energy-absorbing materials are hydrated salts which exhibit a
      dehydration temperature of about 30 DEG-50 DEG C. Materials of
      this type include alkaline sulfates, thiosulphates and
      biphosphates. However, the preferred material for use as the
      heat-absorbing compound in the present invention combines both a
      high endothermic heat of reaction with a low dehydration
      temperature. These conditions are met by sodium sulfate
      decahydrate and sodium biphosphate.<br>
      <br>
      It is a feature of the present invention that both the oxygen
      producing material and the energy-absorbing material may take the
      form of either a solid or may be stored as an aqueous solution.
      Additionally, as mentioned, the energy-absorbing material may be
      admixed with the oxygen-producing material prior to the reaction
      or the materials may be partially separated and only brought into
      intimate engagement at the time of reaction. Thus, the composition
      of the present invention provides a high degree of flexibility
      with respect to the design of the oxygen-generating structure and
      the manner of its operation. As can be appreciated, where the
      energy-absorbing material is initially admixed with the
      oxygen-generating compound of the system, it is preferred that the
      energy-absorbing material also be present at the reaction site if
      this site is remote from the storage location for the
      oxygen-generating material. Also it is preferred that the amount
      of energy-absorbing material be greatest at the reaction site in
      order to insure appropriate energy absorption at the time of
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The specific amounts of energy-absorbing compounds employed may
      vary with the specific oxygen-generating material employed.
      Generally, the ratio of energy absorber to oxygen generator will
      fall within the range of 1:2 to 2:1 with the preferred composition
      having equal amounts of the two materials. Where a portion of the
      energy-absorbing material initially is placed within the
      compartment containing the catalyst, the mix of absorber and
      oxygen generator falls within the lower portion of the foregoing
      ratio range.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, it may be noted that when a solution of the
      oxygen generator is utilized as the source of the oxygen gas, the
      energy-absorbing material, such as the sodium sulfate decahydrate,
      should be present at a concentration of about 500 grams per liter
      while at the reaction site, the energy-absorbing material should
      exhibit a concentration which is approximately twice that
      concentration prior to admixture at the reaction site.
      Additionally, small amounts of nucleating agents such as borax may
      also be included within the solution located within the reaction
      chamber. Typically, amounts on the order of 0.1 percent by weight
      are employed.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it can be seen that a lightweight, self-contained,
      high-capacity generator with an extended shelf life is disclosed
      which provides a steady regulated flow of warm, moist, sterile
      oxygen for a variety of medical and industrial applications. The
      oxygen generator is composed of chemical components that are
      nontoxic and safe for storage, use, and disposal. Importantly, the
      oxygen generator is economical to manufacture and simple to use.
      As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, various
      modifications and adaptations of the structure and method
      described above will become readily apparent without departure
      from the spirit and scope of the invention, the scope of which is
      defined in the appended claims.<b><br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      A chemical oxygen generator with a chemical mass, which is
      accommodated inside a container, generates oxygen by a chemical
      reaction, and is held in the container by a gas-permeable fibrous
      material. The fibrous material is arranged around the chemical
      mass. The fibrous material is designed as a chemical sorption
      filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention pertains to a chemical oxygen generator with
      a chemical mass, which is accommodated inside a container,
      generates oxygen by a chemical reaction and is held in the
      container by a, gas-permeable fibrous material arranged around it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Oxygen generators based on chlorate are, in general, pressed
      objects containing a chemical releasing oxygen, e.g., potassium
      chlorate, wherein certain additives are added to the fuel to
      maintain the chemical reaction or to remove harmful components.
      For example, iron and manganese are added to maintain the oxygen
      production, whereas, e.g., barium peroxide is used to remove
      chlorine. Such an oxygen generator has become known from DE-OS 20
      26 663. In the prior-art oxygen generator, the heat generated
      during the reaction is kept away from the sheet-metal housing of
      the generator by an insulating jacket, which consists of a fibrous
      material. The dusts generated during the reaction of the chemical
      mass, e.g., salt dusts, are also retained by the fibrous material.<br>
      <br>
      Harmful components, which must be captured, can still be formed
      during the conversion of the chemicals into oxygen despite the
      additives. An additional chemical filter, through which the oxygen
      generated flows along with its impurities, is used for this
      purpose. The impurities are bound in this filter by chemisorption
      (catalytic decomposition) or by physical adsorption. The dusts
      (particles) are retained by chemical separation in a physical
      filter (particle filter) located at a short distance before the
      outlet. The installation of an additional filter for removing the
      impurities appreciably increases the weight of the oxygen
      generator. Oxygen generators with minimal weight are needed
      especially in aviation because of economic requirements. An
      additional chemical filter in these oxygen generators also
      increases the cost in connection with a subsequent disposal,
      because the substances contained in the filter usually must be
      treated as special waste.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The primary object of the present invention is to improve an
      oxygen generator such that the harmful gases generated during the
      chemical reaction can be removed in a simple manner.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, a chemical oxygen generator is
      provided with a chemical mass. The chemical mass is accommodated
      inside a container and generates oxygen by a chemical reaction.
      The chemical mass is held in the container by a, gas-permeable
      fibrous material arranged around it. The fibrous material
      comprises a sorption filter.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the present invention is essentially that the
      impurities formed during the chemical reaction are removed by the
      fibrous material designed as a sorption filter and are thus
      removed directly at the site at which they are generated.<br>
      <br>
      The sorption filter advantageously consists of the fibrous
      material impregnated with a sorbent. The suitable substances for
      the impregnation are chemicals of a basic character, e.g.,
      hydroxides and carbonates. Sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide
      have proved to be particularly effective for removing chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      These substances may be applied in the form of an aqueous solution
      or suspension containing a few weight percent by briefly immersing
      the fibrous material into the solution or the suspension or by
      spraying the fibrous material with the solution or the suspension
      and subsequently freeing the parts of water in a desiccator.<br>
      <br>
      The weight of substance applied to the fibrous material is about 1
      g to 3 g, depending on the type of the generator. This is in the
      range of variation of the overall weight of the generator during
      its manufacture. In contrast, a prior-art chemical filter has a
      weight between 20 g and 50 g, depending on the design of the
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      One exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in the
      drawing and will be explained in greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      The various features of novelty which characterize the invention
      are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and
      forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of
      the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects
      attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying

      the invention is illustrated.<br>

      </b><b> DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to the drawings in particular, the oxygen generator 1
      shown in FIG. 1 contains in a container 2 a reactive chemical 3,
      which is surrounded by a fibrous layer 4 that is permeable to gas.
      An igniting device 6 is arranged on the top front side 5 of the
      container 2 in the known manner in order to start the chemical
      reaction. The oxygen generated escapes via an outlet opening 9
      located on the lower top side 8 of the container 2. The igniting
      device 6 is designed as a percussion fuse in the known manner. The
      fibrous layer 4 consists of a pot-shaped ceramic fiber molding 10
      and a ceramic fiber disk 11 lying on the open front side of the
      ceramic fiber molding 10. The molding 10 and the disk 11 are
      impregnated with sodium hydroxide by briefly immersing the molding
      10 and the disk 11 into an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide
      and subsequently drying them.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen generated by the chemical 3 first enters the molding 10
      and from there it flows to the outlet opening 9 via the disk 11.
      The dusts and particles generated during the chemical reaction of
      the chemical 3 are first filtered out in the molding 10. The
      chlorine formed during the decomposition of the chemical 3 is
      bound by the sodium hydroxide impregnation during the flow through
      the molding 10 as well as through the disk 11.<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of the impregnation according to the present
      invention will be illustrated by the following FIGS. 2a, 2b.<br>
      <br>
      Curve A in FIG. 2a shows the oxygen production as a function of
      the reaction time of the oxygen generator 1. FIG. 2b shows the
      chlorine production belonging to curve A, specifically as a curve
      B for a device according to the state of the art without
      impregnated fibrous layer and as a curve C with the impregnation
      of the fibrous material according to the present invention. The
      chlorine concentration is under a value of 0.2 ppm of chlorine in
      the case of curve C.<br>

      pipe with an air filter suspending in the air accumulator, and a
      mouthpiece connected to the air outlet pipe for the user to

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a handy oxygen generator which
      can be conveniently carried by the user and operated to release
      oxygen for breathing during an emergency case.<br>
      <br>
      According to statistics, a high percentage of victims in fire
      accidents died from breathing in an excessive amount of carbon
      dioxide. Therefore, many of fire victims can survive if they have
      a personal respirator means.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is one object of the present invention to provide an oxygen
      generator which releases oxygen for breathing through a chemical
      reaction. It is another object of the present invention to provide
      an oxygen generator which is handy and convenient for personal use
      in an emergent case. According to the preferred embodiment of the
      present invention, the handy oxygen generator comprises a casing
      defining a reaction chamber, an air accumulator and an air passage
      between the reaction chamber and the air accumulator, a hand pump
      for pumping air into the reaction chamber to increase its inside
      pressure, a chemical module mounted in the reaction chamber and
      containing two separated chemicals, plunger means mounted on the
      reaction chamber for operation by hand to break the chemical
      module, enabling the two chemicals to induce a chemical reaction
      and to release oxygen into the air accumulator during the chemical
      reaction, an air outlet pipe with air filter means suspending in
      the air accumulator, and a mouthpiece connected to the air outlet
      pipe for the user to breathes in oxygen from the air accumulator.<br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, an oxygen generator in accordance with the
      present invention comprises a casing 10 defining a first vertical
      chamber 11, a second vertical chamber 12, and a transverse chamber
      14 communicating between the first vertical chamber 11 and the
      second vertical chamber 12. A reaction chamber 20 and an air
      accumulator 30 are respectively mounted in the first vertical
      chamber 11 and the second vertical chamber 12. The reaction
      chamber 20 holds a certain amount (for example about 500 to 100
      milliliters.) of water 90. A tube 13 is mounted in the transverse
      chamber 14 and connected between the reaction chamber 20 and the
      air accumulator 30. The reaction chamber 20 has an externally
      threaded mouth 23 disposed outside the casing 10 and covered with
      a screw cap 24. A barrel 50 is suspended inside the reaction
      chamber 20, having a top mounting flange 51 retained between the
      topmost edge of the mouth 23 of the reaction chamber 20 and the
      screw cap 24. The bottom side of the barrel 50 is an open side
      sealed with an aluminum foil 52. A gasket 103 is mounted within
      the screw cap 24 and retained between the top mounting flange 51
      of the barrel 50 and the topmost edge of the mouth 23 of the
      reaction chamber 20. A press device is provided comprised of a
      plunger 44 inserted through a hole (not shown) at the center of
      the screw cap 24, a handle 43 connected to the top end of the
      plunger 44 and disposed outside the screw cap 24, and a stopper 45
      connected to the bottom end of the plunger 44 and disposed inside
      the barrel 50. A water-permeable chemical container 40 is mounted
      inside the barrel 50 and containing a peroxide 60, having a
      concave top side 42 stopped below the stopper 45 and a bottom
      cutting edge 46. A partition wall 80 is provided inside the barrel
      50 and spaced above the aluminum foil 52 below the bottom cutting
      edge 46 of the water-permeable chemical container 40. A catalyzer
      70 is mounted in between the partition wall 80 and the aluminum
      foil 52 of the barrel 50. The ratio between the peroxide 60 and
      the catalyzer 70 is 0.5% to 10% by weight: 90% to 99.5% by weight.
      A guide tube 25 is mounted in the reaction chamber 20, having a
      bottom end coupled with a porous member 21 and a top end coupled
      with a connector 25 disposed outside the casing 10.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4 and FIG. 1 again, a filter device 31 is
      mounted in the air accumulator 30, having an output tube 32
      coupled with a connector 33 disposed outside the casing 10; a
      mouthpiece 100 is connected to the connector 33 to receive oxygen
      from the air accumulator 30; a hand pump 101 is connected to the
      connector 25 by a connecting tube 102. The filter device 31
      comprises active carbon or active aluminum for removing solid
      matter from air passing through.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the present invention is outlined hereinafter
      with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. When in an emergency case, the
      handle 43 is pressed down to force the stopper 45 downwardly
      against the concave top side 42 of the chemical container 40,
      causing the chemical container 40 to be moved downwards. When the
      chemical container 40 is moved downwards, the bottom cutting edge
      46 of the chemical container 40 is forced to cut through the
      partition wall 80, causing the peroxide 60 to mix with the
      catalyzer 70. When the handle 43 is continuously pressed down, the
      bottom cutting edge 46 is forced to cut through the aluminum foil
      52, thereby causing the mixture of the catalyzer 70 and the
      peroxide 60 to fall to water 90 in the reaction chamber 20. When
      the mixture of the catalyzer 70 and the peroxide 60 falls to water
      90 in the reaction chamber 20, a reaction is induced to release
      oxygen. Released oxygen immediately passes through the tube 13 to
      the air accumulator 40, thus the user can breathes oxygen through
      the mouthpiece 100 via the filter device 31. The amount of oxygen
      thus obtained is sufficient for the user to breathes for about 15
      to 50 minutes (normally set for about 30 minutes). The barrel 50,
      the chemical container 40 and the catalyzer 70 are made in a pack
      convenient for a replacement. The hand pump 101 is adapted to pump
      air into the reaction chamber 20 to increase its inside pressure,
      so that released oxygen can be forced out of the reaction chamber
      20 into the air accumulator 30. Further, when the hand pump 101 is
      detached from the connector 25, outside air can be directly drawn
      into water 90 in the reaction chamber 20 through the porous member
      21 and then forced by the inside pressure of the reaction chamber
      25 into the oxygen accumulator 30 for breathing.<b><br>

      </b>An oxygen generating apparatus according to the present
      invention includes a reaction vessel and a cartridge. The

      and includes a cartridge plate and a plurality of reagent tubes

      include at least one short tube and a plurality of standard tubes,
      each have an upper end coupled to the cartridge plate and a lower
      end which has an opening or port. When the cartridge is inserted

      extends substantially to a floor of the reaction vessel, while the
      at least one short tube extends to a point remote from the floor
      of the reaction vessel. The cartridge may include an activation
      plate which causes the release of the reagents into the reaction
      vessel by pulling up a retaining sleeve when the cartridge is
      inserted into the reaction vessel. The apparatus may also include
      a filter which helps retain the reagents in the reaction vessel
      during the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an oxygen generating unit, and in
      particular a portably oxygen generating unit that employs a
      chemical reaction in a solvent such as water to produce oxygen.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b><br>
      <br>
      Portable oxygen generating systems have been used to provide
      oxygen in a variety of circumstances, including medical
      emergencies, athletic events, and high altitude activities.
      Portable oxygen may be used to supplement normal breathing in
      these circumstances, or to provide life-saving oxygen in cases of
      injury. Because portable oxygen systems are often the only means
      available to generate an adequate supply of oxygen, it is
      important for such devices to provide a high flow rate of
      breathable oxygen over an extended period of time. To this end,
      for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that
      in order for an oxygen generating apparatus to be sold without a
      prescription, it must provide an average of at least six liters of
      oxygen per minute for fifteen minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Known oxygen generating systems often require a user to mix a
      number of chemicals in a vessel and then add water after the
      chemicals are mixed. These systems typically cannot produce the
      FDA-required flow of oxygen because of human error in mixing the
      reagents or because the reagents react too quickly or too slowly.
      Likewise, other known systems that provide the reagents in a
      cartridge format often produce too little oxygen over too short a
      period of time, because the reagents are not provided in a manner
      that effectively regulates the reaction. In addition, the
      exothermic reaction which produces the oxygen also tends to
      overheat reaction vessels and provide oxygen at uncomfortable
      temperatures, further decreasing the effectiveness of known oxygen
      generating units.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An oxygen generating apparatus according to the present invention
      includes a reaction vessel and a cartridge. The cartridge is
      constructed for insertion into the reaction vessel, and includes a
      cartridge plate and a plurality of reagent tubes holding
      oxygen-producing reagents. The reagent tubes, which include at
      least one short tube and a plurality of standard tubes, each have
      an upper end coupled to the cartridge plate and a lower end which
      has an opening or port. When the cartridge is inserted into the
      reaction vessel, each of the plurality of standard tubes extends
      substantially to a floor of the reaction vessel, while the at
      least one short tube extends to a point remote from the floor of
      the reaction vessel .<br>

        to the present invention.</b><b><br>

      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, an oxygen generating apparatus
      according to the present invention generally includes a reaction
      vessel 30 and a cartridge 10. Cartridge 10 holds the oxygen
      producing reagents, which are preferably contained in a plurality
      of standard tubes 13 and at least one short tube 15. The
      illustrated apparatus is designed so that the reagents are
      released into vessel 30 when cartridge 10 is inserted into vessel
      30. The reagents react in a solvent, typically water, to produce
      oxygen. The oxygen may then escape to a patient through a tube and
      mask (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      Vessel 30 is illustrated in FIG. 2. Vessel 30 may be of any
      suitable shape and size, but preferably is substantially
      cylindrical in shape, for example with a length of approximately
      17.5 inches and a diameter of approximately six inches. Preferably
      vessel 30 is formed of a plastic such as high density
      polyethylene, but any suitable material may be used. The
      illustrated vessel 30 includes a vessel wall 31 and a floor 33 and
      has an open end opposite floor 33. In a preferred embodiment,
      vessel wall 31 is double-walled to provide insulation between the
      user and the contents of the reaction vessel, which may become
      uncomfortably hot during reaction. While floor 33 is not shown as
      double-walled in FIG. 2, it may be double-walled as well. Thus
      where appropriate or not specified, the term "double-walled" as
      applied to vessel 30 as a whole should be read to include
      embodiments in which the whole of vessel 30 is double walled, as
      well as embodiments in which only a portion of vessel 30 (e.g.,
      wall 31) is double-walled.<br>
      <br>
      An oxygen generating apparatus according to the present invention
      may also include a cap 35. Cap 35 may be constructed to cover the
      open end of vessel 30 after cartridge 10 has been inserted. For
      this purpose, cap 35 and wall 31 may include a retention formation
      such as cooperating threads or locking lugs (not shown).
      Alternatively, cap 35 may engage vessel 30 in a snap-fit
      arrangement. Preferably cap 35 includes a tubing connector 37,
      which is in fluid communication with the interior of vessel 30. In
      this manner, a tube and mask may be connected to tubing connector
      37, and oxygen produced by the reaction can then escape vessel 30
      to a user. While cap 35 is illustrated as a separate element, it
      may be constructed integrally with cartridge 10, as described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Cartridge 10 is generally constructed to hold and release the
      oxygen producing reagents which will generate oxygen for the user.
      Cartridge 10 preferably includes a cartridge plate 11, attached to
      which are a plurality of reagent tubes 13, 15. In the illustrated
      embodiment, cartridge plate 11 is formed as a generally circular
      disk that engages the open end of reaction vessel 30. In this
      embodiment, cartridge plate 11 may include, for example, apertures
      (not shown) which allow oxygen produced in reaction vessel 30 to
      escape to the user. Cartridge plate 11 may be formed integrally
      with cap 35, if desired, or may be constructed as a separate
      element, as shown in the Figures.<br>
      <br>
      Reagent tubes 13, 15 are connected at an upper end to cartridge
      plate 11. Reagent tubes 13, 15 contain the reagents which will
      produce oxygen when mixed in a solvent, for example water. Reagent
      tubes 13, 15 are constructed to release the reagents in a timed
      manner that both allows the reaction to start up quickly and
      maintains a constantly high level of oxygen production over an
      extended period of time. In particular, reagent tubes 13, 15
      include a plurality of standard tubes 13 and at least one short
      tube 15, each preferably having an inner diameter of approximately
      1.25 inches to 1.75 inches. Each of reagent tubes 13, 15 also
      includes an opening 17, 19 at its lower end.<br>
      <br>
      Standard tubes 13 preferably are sized so that, when cartridge 11
      is inserted into reaction vessel 30, each of the standard tubes 13
      extends substantially to floor 33 of reaction vessel 30. The
      reagents inside standard tubes 13 will thus flow out openings 17
      in a controlled manner over an extended period of time, because
      reagents flowing out of an opening 17 will tend to pile around
      that opening 17, partially blocking or restricting flow of the
      remaining reagents until the released reagents are used.
      Preferably, openings 17 are provided as side ports as shown in the
      Figures, as testing has demonstrated that this configuration
      provides an optimum flow rate of reagents. In particular, each
      opening 17 optimally includes three apertures, each approximately
      0.5 inches high and extending approximately 115 DEG around the
      circumference of tube 13, the apertures being separated from one
      another by small bridges. While the illustrated embodiment is
      preferred, each opening 17 may be provided in any suitable shape
      and at any suitable location near the lower end of standard tube
      13.<br>
      <br>
      At least one short tube 15 is provided along with standard tubes
      13, preferably a single short tube 15. Unlike standard tubes 13,
      short tube 15 preferably does not extend substantially to floor 33
      of reaction vessel 30, but rather to a point remote from floor 33.
      In addition, short tube 15 may have a downward-facing opening 19,
      if desired. This arrangement allows all of the reagents within
      short tube 15 to exit the tube within a relatively short period of
      time following the insertion of cartridge 10 into reaction vessel
      30. The oxygen-producing reaction can therefore start immediately,
      quickly reaching a rate of oxygen generation equal to or greater
      than six liters per minute. Thus the provision of short tube 15
      allows a quick start-up for the reaction, while standard tubes 13
      help maintain a high oxygen production rate over an extended
      period of time.<br>
      <br>
      While any standard reagents may be employed in conjunction with an
      oxygen generating apparatus according to the present invention,
      the reagent composition itself may assist in regulating the
      reaction, providing both quick initiation and extended, controlled
      oxygen production. Preferably the reagents used include sodium
      percarbonate and manganese dioxide, which when reacted in water
      produce oxygen. The tubes may contain a total of approximately
      1,450 grams of sodium percarbonate and approximately 12 grams of
      manganese dioxide, which acts as a catalyst. In addition, to
      provide an effective reaction rate, the manganese dioxide is
      preferably a mixture of a first powder having a first maximum
      grain size and a second powder having a second maximum grain size.
      In particular, the first powder may have a relatively small
      maximum grain size, for example approximately 0.1 to 10 microns,
      while the second powder may have a relatively larger maximum grain
      size, for example approximately 100 to 250 microns.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the placement of the reagents within reagent tubes
      13, 15 may control and regulate the reaction. For example,
      standard tubes 13 may contain a total of approximately 1,250 grams
      of sodium percarbonate equally divided between the three tubes 13.
      Short tube 15 may contain approximately 200 grams of sodium
      percarbonate and all of the manganese dioxide. The manganese
      dioxide may further be provided at the lower end of short tube 15,
      so that it enters the reaction vessel 30 almost immediately after
      cartridge 10 is inserted. In this manner, all of the manganese
      dioxide may be present from the initial stages of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, cartridge 10 preferably releases the reagents
      automatically when cartridge 10 is inserted into vessel 30. In the
      exemplary embodiment, this is achieved using an activation plate
      25 and a sleeve 21, which work in conjunction with a stop 39 of
      reaction vessel 30. Sleeve 21 is preferably made of plastic. If
      provided, sleeve 21 may be connected to activation plate 25 and
      should cover openings 17, 19. Activation plate 25 may be initially
      located in a position remote from cartridge plate 11, as
      illustrated in FIG. 1, and is preferably slidable along reagent
      tubes 13, 15 towards cartridge plate 11. Stop 39 may be located on
      reaction vessel 30, preferably near the open end of reaction
      vessel 30. Stop 39 may include any type of obstruction, for
      example an internal flange, internal shoulder, or other abutment.<br>
      <br>
      When cartridge 10 is inserted into reaction vessel 30, activation
      plate 25 contacts stop 39. Stop 39 prevents activation plate 25
      from traveling downward into reaction vessel 30. Thus as cartridge
      10 is inserted into reaction vessel 30, activation plate 25 moves
      towards cartridge plate 11 (in a relative manner). This movement
      pulls sheath 21 upwards along reagent tubes 13, 15, exposing
      openings 17, 19 and releasing the reagents.<br>
      <br>
      An apparatus according to the present invention may also include a
      filter 23, which helps contain the reagents within reaction vessel
      30. As the reaction progresses, the reagents and end products
      often form bubbles and foam which tend to expand through tubing
      connector 37 and into the attached tubing towards the user. This
      migration of the reagents can be dangerous to the user if the
      reagents are ingested. It can also convey heat from the reaction
      vessel into the tubing, increasing the temperature of the
      delivered oxygen to uncomfortable and unsafe levels. To prevent
      this migration, filter 23 may be included to break up any bubbles
      or foam which might enter the tubing. By breaking up the bubbles
      or foam, filter 23 helps to retain the reagents and end products
      in reaction vessel 30, minimizing the migration of those compounds
      into the tubing. Filter 23 may be of any suitable materials and
      configuration, but preferably is formed from polyethylene,
      polybutylene, or nylon. Filter 23 may also be formed with any
      suitable pore size sufficient to break the surface tension of the
      bubbles or foam, or to otherwise retain the reagents within vessel
      30 while letting oxygen escape. In addition, filter 23 is
      preferably coupled to activation plate 25, so that after insertion
      filter 23 is located near the upper, open end of reaction vessel
      30.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the present invention has been described
      with respect to several exemplary embodiments. It can be
      understood, however, that there are many other variations of the
      above-described embodiments which will be apparent to those
      skilled in the art, even where elements have not explicitly been
      designated as exemplary. For example, activation plate 25 may be
      shaped not as a plate or disk, but may instead be a simple
      abutment that cooperates with stop 39 to pull sleeve 21 upwards.
      As another example, sleeve 21 may comprise a plurality of smaller
      sleeves, each of which covers a corresponding reagent tube 13, 15
      and each of which is connected to activation plate 25. It is
      understood that these and other modifications are within the
      teaching of the present invention, which is to be limited only by
      the claims appended hereto.<br>

      chamber composed of a body (1) and of a cover (2), in which
      chamber the candle is housed, means of igniting the candle, means
      of percussing the igniter and means of filtering the oxygen
      generated, characterized in that the igniting means consist of a
      compressed mixture of titanium and boron and in that the filtering
      means consist of a mixture of lime or soda lime and of molecular
      sieve and are distributed, on the one hand, packed in around the
      candle and, on the other hand, in a cartridge having a
      generated-oxygen outlet cap. Application to the generation of
      oxygen in the medical or paramedical field, the aeronautics field
      and the military field.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a self-contained device for
      chemically generating high-pressure breathing oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The technical sector of the invention is that of the instantaneous
      supply of breathing oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The intended fields are the medical or paramedical field, the
      aeronautics field and the military field.<br>
      <br>
      The main known processes used for generating oxygen corresponding
      to industrial or medical standards are distillation after air
      liquefaction, electrolysis of water, and chemical processes.<br>
      <br>
      Although the first two processes are widely used in industry, in
      particular for distillation, the equipment employed is heavy,
      bulky and complex. Furthermore, in the case of distillation, it
      does not allow the desired gas to be obtained instantaneously,
      given that an air-cooling phase is necessary for the liquefaction.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical processes, by contrasts, get around the problem of
      complex apparatuses and are particularly suitable for extreme
      situations such as remote or isolated sites, natural disasters,
      and emergency, crisis or conflict situations.<br>
      <br>
      One of the various known processes for chemically generating
      oxygen which may be cited is the process consisting in using solid
      agglomerates which release oxygen by thermochemical decomposition.<br>
      <br>
      The basic material used in these agglomerates, known as chemical
      candles, is an oxygen-containing salt capable of liberating oxygen
      by heating.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, alkali-metal chlorates are used, these being mixed with
      a catalyst of the metal-oxide type which lowers the decomposition
      temperature and with a combustible substance whose oxidation
      releases the heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the
      oxido-reduction reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the devices for chemically generating oxygen have
      two major drawbacks:<br>
      they do not allow oxygen to be generated at high pressure, e.g.
      for filling bottles or tanks, since there is a risk of the
      thermochemical reaction of the solid agglomerates used
      degenerating, which may thus result in an explosion;<br>
      upon initiating the reaction, a considerable amount of carbon
      monoxide and dioxide is generated, which prevents the generated
      gas being used in the medical field where conformity to the
      pharmacopoeia is mandatory.<br>
      <br>
      These drawbacks have been remedied by using a carbon-free fuel of
      high reactivity, and avoiding the risk of explosion, namely
      magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      French Patent No. 1,403,612 describes an apparatus for generating
      breathing oxygen which comprises an active substance based on an
      alkali-metal chlorate mixed with a catalyst consisting of
      manganese dioxide and with magnesium as the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      However, such an active substance does not have a high yield for
      its volume since the relative density of the agglomerate remains
      close to that of the alkali-metal chlorate, in this case sodium
      chlorate, i.e. about 1.6.<br>
      <br>
      French Patent 2,620,435 discloses agglomerates containing the same
      ingredients but having a relative density greater than 1.8. These
      solid agglomerates are obtained by compression above 10@8 Pa (1000
      bar) of a mixture based on sodium chlorate (NaClO3), sodium
      dichromate (NaCr2 O3), manganese dioxide (MnO2), magnesium (Mg)
      and water (H2 O). The presence of water is necessary as it acts as
      a cohesion agent and ensures that the mixture is very safe to use
      by making it inert. Despite the high pressures applied when
      manufacturing the agglomerates, the risks of these mixtures
      suddenly decomposing and exploding are thus avoided.<br>
      <br>
      The candle confined in a pressurized container must be ignited by
      means suitable for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      French Patent 2,523,867 describes a chemical oxygen generator in
      which the pressurized container in which the candle is housed,
      held between two perforated discs, forms an empty space all around
      the candle in which the oxygen, on passing through a membrane
      which is perforated when the igniting means are triggered, can
      escape via an outlet orifice. However, the configuration of this
      apparatus does not allow the pressure to rise to a high value and,
      in addition, the system can be used only once since it is not
      possible to replace the candle.<br>
      <br>
      One object of the present invention is to generate oxygen at high
      pressure, i.e. greater than or equal to 100 bar, for filling
      bottles or tanks, directly in the field by means of a lightweight
      and compact device which is simple to use.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide so-called medical
      oxygen, i.e. oxygen whose characteristics and purity comply with
      the European Pharmacopoeia, i.e. an oxygen content of 99.5%, a
      maximum carbon monoxide content of 5 ppm and a maximum carbon
      dioxide content of 300 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this, the subject of the invention is a self-contained
      device for generating high-pressure breathing oxygen, of the type
      comprising an oxygen-generating candle, a gastight confinement
      chamber composed of a body and of a cover, in which chamber the
      candle is housed, means of igniting the candle, means of
      percussing the igniter and means of filtering the oxygen
      generated, characterized in that the igniting means consist of a
      compressed mixture of titanium and boron and in that the filtering
      means consist of a mixture of lime or soda lime and of molecular
      sieve and are distributed, on the one hand, packed in around the
      candle and, on the other hand, in a cartridge having a
      generated-oxygen outlet cap.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the percussion means comprise a first part integral
      with the gastight confinement chamber and a second part which is
      independent of the first part and actuated by an external
      actuator.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the first part of the percussion
      means consist of a movable needle and a seal, the internal face of
      the needle taking the pressure of the oxygen generated, and the
      second part consists of a hammer translationally guided and
      propelled by springs, the hammer being actuated by a manual arming
      lever.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical candle is a solid agglomerate composed of sodium
      chlorate, sodium dichromate, manganese dioxide, magnesium and
      demineralized water.<br>
      <br>
      The solid agglomerate has a relative density of at least 2.4.<br>
      <br>
      According to a preferred embodiment, the filtering means
      furthermore comprise a mixture of various oxides, known by the
      trade name "hopcalite", and of hygroscopic salts.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the hopcalite is in direct contact with the candle and
      is placed as a mixture with lime in granules around the candle and
      on the rear face inside the filter cartridge.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the molecular sieve is placed at the end of the
      candle, as far away from the high-temperature regions as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the body and the cover of the chamber are made of a
      single material which has undergone a self-lubricating and
      wear-resistance surface treatment.<br>
      <br>
      This single material may be titanium or a special steel.<br>
      <br>
      According to an alternative embodiment, the filtering means
      include an additional filter lying outside the chamber and
      comprising lime or soda lime, a molecular sieve, hopcalite and
      activated carbon.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the filtering means in the cartridge
      comprise a fine-particle filter.<br>
      <br>
      This filter consists, for example, of mineral wool.<br>
      <br>
      According to a variant, the oxygen generator includes a discharge
      valve allowing the air contained in the chamber to be removed when
      the candle ignites.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen generator of the invention makes it possible to
      generate oxygen for medical use.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention is applicable to the
      high-pressure filling of oxygen bottles or of tanks.<br>
      <br>
      The candle is a solid agglomerate obtained by compressing a
      mixture containing, per 100 parts by mass of sodium chlorate, 5 to
      7 parts by mass of manganese dioxide, 2 to 3 parts by mass of
      magnesium, approximately 0.3 parts by mass of sodium dichromate
      and demineralized water in an amount such that it represents
      together with the water optionally contained in the chlorate,
      approximately 1% of the mass of the dry chlorate.<br>
      <br>
      The generation of oxygen results from the thermo-decomposition of
      the sodium chlorate mixed with the manganese dioxide, which acts
      as an oxidizing agent; this oxido-reduction reaction generates a
      large amount of heat, enabling the molecular bond between the
      oxygen atoms and the rest of the sodium molecule to be broken. The
      choice of reducing agent, in this case magnesium, is fundamental
      as it makes it possible to confine the candle under very high
      temperature and pressure conditions without the reaction
      degenerating.<br>
      <br>
      Upon starting the operation of the candle, oxygen is liberated and
      the reaction, being inextinguishable and confined, the pressure
      rises.<br>
      <br>
      A source of oxygen adjustable to the desired pressure is therefore
      available.<br>
      <br>
      The candle consists of blocks which are very highly compressed
      until blocks having a relative density of 2.4 and higher are
      obtained. This characteristic is very important as it allows the
      rate of combustion to be controlled and ensures complete safety
      under the conditions of use. Furthermore, the ratio between the
      volume of the candle and the volume of oxygen generated is thereby
      increased, this being paramount in some applications, such as
      applications in submarines or aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The candle is placed in a casing made of a material suitable for
      the high temperature and pressure conditions and for the highly
      oxidizing environment. This casing may have any shape,
      parallelepipedal, cylindrical or other shape, and its dimensions
      may be varied depending on the requirements. This is because the
      volume of the casing of the candle is directly related to the
      volume of oxygen desired and to the application in question, for
      example high-pressure generation, atmosphere regeneration,
      oxygenotherapy or industrial requirement.<br>
      <br>
      The weight of the chemical part will vary from a few tens of grams
      to more than ten kilograms, depending on the volume of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Ignition of the candle is particularly delicate when it is desired
      to generate medical oxygen; this is because the initiation must be
      reliable and of high performance, without excessive generation of
      carbon monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      The igniting part is composed of an igniter holder provided with
      its pyrotechnic igniter of the anvil type and with a compressed
      body of titanium and boron housed in a pellet for igniting the
      highly magnesium-enriched chlorate composition.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the type of application, the igniting part is the same
      with an igniter holder which can take any type of fitting, such as
      a striker-holder fitting, a male conical fitting or a female
      conical fitting. This standard ensures optimum effectiveness of
      the ignition by permanently controlling the spark chamber and the
      sealing of the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The objective of the filtering part is to purify the oxygen
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      It comprises an adsorption filter and a particle filter.<br>
      <br>
      The adsorption filter comprises lime, molecular sieve and,
      optionally, a mixture of various oxides known by the brand name of
      hopcalite.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the fine particles are filtered by a layer of mineral
      wool in the candle.<br>
      <br>
      Among the filtering materials used, lime allows carbon dioxide to
      be absorbed; the molecular sieve fixes the residual water and
      traces of chlorine; the hopcalite removes carbon monoxide by
      catalyzing its conversion into carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of the filtering materials is very important.<br>
      <br>
      The hopcalite requires high temperatures in order to operate; it
      is therefore placed as close as possible to the candle blocks, as
      a mixture with lime in granules around the blocks and on the rear
      face.<br>
      <br>
      The molecular sieve must be as far away from the high-temperature
      regions as possible; it is placed entirely at the end of the
      candle.<br>
      <br>
      A complementary filter, comprising the same components of lime or
      soda lime, hopcalite and molecular sieve, but also activated
      carbon, may be added in order to improve further the purity of the
      oxygen generated.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of the combinations of filtering products which may be
      used will vary depending on the application envisaged. This is
      because, hopcalite is an expensive catalyst and the price of lime
      may vary by a factor of two depending on its source.<br>
      <br>
      A distinction should be made between breathable oxygen and medical
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      In order to obtain breathable oxygen, it is suitable to use a lime
      of average quality and a molecular sieve, which gives a carbon
      dioxide content of about 100 ppm, a carbon monoxide content of
      between 2 and 6 ppm and a few traces of water.<br>
      <br>
      In order to obtain medical oxygen, use is made of a more reactive
      lime and of hopcalite arranged as a mixture and as a pad, which
      results in a minimum contamination of 2 ppm of carbon monoxide,
      less than 50 ppm of carbon dioxide and less than 60 ppm of water.<br>
      <br>
      The purity of the oxygen generated also arises from the method of
      manufacturing the generator, where any source of accidental
      contamination is eliminated since the constituents other than the
      chemical and pyrotechnical constituents are mounted in a
      decontaminated environment.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, in the case of medical-grade oxygen, the air
      contained in the generator when the candle is ignited is removed
      by any suitable means, such as a discharge valve, or by a manual
      purge lasting 30 seconds; during this time, the oxygen generated
      cleans the lines and reduces the carbon monoxide peak due to
      starting the candle.<br>
      <br>
      The confinement chamber is in the form of a mechanical component
      made of a material capable of withstanding the stresses, these
      being of a mechanical origin, such as the pressure, thermal
      origin, due to the exothermicity of the reaction, and of chemical
      origin, due to the oxidizing environment.<br>
      <br>
      The body and the lid of the generator are made of titanium or
      special steel.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the mechanical connection between the body and
      the lid is provided by a bayonet device, the body and the lid each
      having five tenons around the circumference. A screw-closure
      system may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      The geometry of the chamber has been optimized by
      three-dimensional volume and thermoelastic analysis using the
      finite-element method.<br>
      <br>
      The outer wall of the body is corrugated so as to increase its
      mechanical resistance to pressure and to improve the cooling of
      the reaction chamber by natural convection, because of the
      increase in the area of contact with the ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      The appended drawings, show preferred illustrative embodiments of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the principle of the device
        according to the invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> FIG. 2 is a semi-sectional view of a reaction chamber for
        a chemical candle.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> FIG. 3 is a sectional view of a chemical candle.</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a device according to the invention, comprising:<br>
      a reaction chamber 1,<br>
      an igniting device 7,<br>
      a candle 3, and<br>
      a system of apparatuses and accessories which are necessary for
      operating and for using the device.<br>
      <br>
      After the candle 3 has been ignited, by means of the igniting
      device 7, oxygen leaves the reaction chamber 1 and undergoes, in
      the filter 16, a first filtration with respect to suspended solid
      particles conveyed by the gas: microparticles of solid components
      of which the candle is composed, such as thermal insulation
      components and packing products. Next, the gas passes through a
      condensing filter 17 which condenses the water-vapour residues
      produced during the chemical reaction; the water thus condensed is
      purged at every production cycle by means of the valve 18. The
      valve 15 and the rupture-disc-type device 27 ensure that the
      operation of the reaction chamber is completely safe.<br>
      <br>
      At this stage in the purification, the gas has a purity which
      complies with the European Pharmacopoeia.<br>
      <br>
      A third filtration, using the filter 19, makes it possible to
      reduce the carbon monoxide and dioxide content, to lower the dew
      point and to remove possible traces of unpleasant smells from the
      gas produced.<br>
      <br>
      The purity of the gas depends at this point essentially on the
      dimensions of the filter 19; the rated values obtained are 99.9%
      of oxygen, less than 2 ppm of carbon monoxide and less than 30 ppm
      of carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      After leaving the filter 19, two options of using the oxygen may
      be envisaged:<br>
      a manifold 20 for high-pressure filling of oxygen bottles 22 of
      water capacity adapted to the volume generated during the chemical
      reaction. These bottles may be connected to the manifold by a
      system of quick-release couplings, thus facilitating the filling
      operations in the field. The pressure gauge 21 is used to indicate
      the pressure within the manifold 20 for the bottles 22; the safety
      valve 15 together with that on the reaction chamber provides
      redundancy in terms of high-pressure safety;<br>
      a high-pressure tank 23 of capacity adapted to the volume of
      oxygen generated and acting as a gas storage unit. The valves 24
      allow the tank to be isolated. Next, the oxygen is expanded
      through the expander 25 in order to be able to be used directly in
      a first-aid ventilator connected to the outlet 26 and operating at
      3.5 bar in the case of an emergency medical unit; the valve 15 has
      the same function as that described above.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows an illustrative embodiment of a reaction chamber
      designed and manufactured for an internal service pressure of 150
      bar. This chamber was subjected to a proof pressure of 225 bar, in
      accordance with the regulations on gas-pressure apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      The confinement chamber is in the form of a cylindrical tube 1,
      called the body, and of a cover or lid 2.<br>
      <br>
      The component 3, placed inside, represents the candle with its
      pyrotechnic igniter holder 4.<br>
      <br>
      The closure system is sealed between the body 1 and the cover or
      lid 2 by a special dynamic seal 5 which can resist the constraints
      with regard to pressure, temperature, nature of the gas and
      possible ignition due to the high pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A cover support arm allows the movements for opening and closing
      the cover or lid 2 with respect to the body 1.<br>
      <br>
      The opening movement is carried out by:<br>
      a rotation of the cover 2 about the main axis of symmetry of the
      reaction chamber, by means of the handles 6,<br>
      a translation of the cover along a guide integral with the support
      arm,<br>
      a simultaneous rotation of the cover 2 and of the support arm
      about an axis lying perpendicular to the main axis of symmetry of
      the reaction chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In respect of the opening movement, a mechanism allows indexing in
      the fully open position of the support arm and of the cover 2.<br>
      <br>
      In respect of the closing movement, a mechanism likewise allows
      strict indexing in the locked position of the cover 2 with respect
      to the body 1.<br>
      <br>
      The components 7 to 14 are the components making up the
      candle-igniting device.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanical percussion system illustrated in FIG. 2 does not
      exclude other processes allowing the candle to be ignited by an
      electrical, piezoelectric, thermal or chemical system.<br>
      <br>
      The arming lever 14 makes it possible, by rotation about its
      operating axis, to compress the spring 12. The hammer 11 then
      undergoes a rearward movement by translation of the guides 13 in
      the casing. The movement is interrupted as soon as the lever is no
      longer in contact with the hammer. The latter, propelled by the
      spring 12, strikes the component 10 integral with the needle 9
      sliding in the component 8, the needle in turn violently striking
      the igniter holder 4 of the candle.<br>
      <br>
      The igniting device is sealed by means of a system of seals
      capable of withstanding the aforementioned constraints.<br>
      <br>
      The needle 9 is initialized automatically as soon as the pressure
      rises in the reaction chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The device is then ready for a new ignition of the candle.<br>
      <br>
      Since the oxygen emission is confined within the chamber, the
      pressure can rise up to the set pressure of the safety valve, the
      pressure of the valve being equal to the maximum operating
      pressure increased by 10%. In the event of an anomaly, a second
      safety device, of the rupture-disc type, ensures that the
      apparatus operates completely safely, the pressure for rupturing
      the disc being equal to the maximum service pressure increased by
      20%.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows an illustrative embodiment of a chemical candle.<br>
      <br>
      The candle comprises a casing 29, made of special steel, which is
      provided with an upper gastight cup 30 made of the same material
      and containing the active mass 28 of the candle composed of
      several stacked and self-centered blocks.<br>
      <br>
      The filter cartridge 33 is composed of two meshes 34, of an
      adsorption filter based on soda lime and hopcalite 39 and
      molecular sieve 40, and of a particle filter 41 made of mineral
      wool; the assembly is closed by an outlet cap 31.<br>
      <br>
      The candle is fitted with an igniter holder 4 provided with an
      igniter 37 and an adapting fitting 38.<br>

      The copper cup 32 limits the oxycutting effects due to the
      ignition of the compressed igniting body 36 and of the igniting
      pellet 35.<br>
      <br>
      The non-limiting examples below illustrate the description.<br>

      The device according to the invention has the following
      advantages:<br>
      simple device, which can be operated by someone not experienced in
      running sophisticated equipment;<br>
      excellent reliability and very little maintenance of the device,
      since it has few components, most of these being static, capable
      of withstanding all types of constraints encountered on the field;<br>
      low volume and low mass, facilitating transportation,
      transportation by air or even parachuting;<br>
      instantaneous oxygen production as soon as the ignition is
      triggered, making it possible to meet the requirements of a
      medical emergency unit;<br>
      the oxygen generated is warm and slightly wet, allowing the use in
      oxygenotherapy without subsequent humidification;<br>
      supply of a gas which complies with the European and medical
      standards; and<br>
      the possibility of high-pressure filling of bottles and tanks.<br>
