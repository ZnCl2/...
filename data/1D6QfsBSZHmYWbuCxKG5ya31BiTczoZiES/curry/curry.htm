      </b><b><br>
      </b>COLUMBIA, Mo. — University of Missouri engineer Randy Curry
      and his team have developed a method of creating and controlling
      plasma that could revolutionize American energy generation and
      storage. Besides liquid, gas and solid, matter has a fourth state,
      known as plasma. Fire and lightning are familiar forms of plasma.
      Life on Earth depends on the energy emitted by plasma produced
      during fusion reactions within the sun. However, Curry warns that
      without federal funding of basic research, America will lose the
      race to develop new plasma energy technologies. The basic research
      program was originally funded by the Office of Naval Research, but
      continued research has been funded by MU.<br>
      <br>
      Curry’s device launches a ring of plasma as far as two feet. The
      plasma doesn’t emit radiation, and it is completely safe for
      humans to be in the same room with it, although the plasma reaches
      a temperature hotter than the surface of the sun. The secret to
      Curry’s success was developing a way to make the plasma form its
      own self-magnetic field, which holds it together while it travels
      through the air.<br>
      <br>
      “Launching plasma in open air is the ‘Holy Grail’ in the field of
      physics,” said Curry, professor of electrical and computer
      engineering in the University of Missouri’s College of
      Engineering. “Creating plasma in a vacuum tube surrounded by
      powerful electromagnets is no big deal; dozens of labs can do
      that. Our innovation allows the plasma to hold itself together
      while it travels through regular air without any need for
      containment.”<br>
      <br>
      The plasma device at MU could be enlarged to handle much larger
      amounts of energy, according to Curry. With sufficient funding,
      they could develop a system within three to five years that would
      also be considerably smaller. He noted that they used old
      technologies to build the current prototype of the
      plasma-generating machine. Using newer, miniaturized parts, he
      suggests they could shrink the device to the size of a bread box.<br>
      <br>
      “We have a world-class team at MU’s Center for Physical &amp;
      Power Electronics, but that team will evaporate without funding,”
      Curry said. “Department of Defense funding for basic research led
      to our plasma innovation. The sequester’s funding cuts threaten
      America’s ability to compete in the future of energy technology.
      Not only will research not be advanced, a new generation of
      Americans won’t be trained to take the reins of American
      engineering leadership.”<br>
      <br>
      Curry is the Logan Distinguished Professor of Electrical &amp;
      Computer Engineering and Director of the Center for Physical &amp;
      Power Electronics.<br>

      Application No. 61/498,281 , entitled "Systems and Methods to

      <b>FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention was made with government support under grant
      number N00014-08-1 -0266 by Office of Naval Research (Agency). The
      government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      generating self-sustaining air plasmas at atmospheric pressures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] An air plasma is an electrically conductive state of matter
      composed of ions, electrons, radicals, and other neutral species
      formed at atmospheric pressure that exist in an independent state.
      Air plasmas may be used in a variety of applications, such as
      nonlethal weapons, fusion, plasma processing, propulsion,
      disinfection applications, and Shockwave mitigation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] However, current plasma sources have been unable to
      generate an air plasma with an electron density sufficient to
      protect against the consequences of the overpressure caused by a
      Shockwave at atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, current plasma
      sources have been unable to generate self-containing or
      self-confining air plasmas that have lengthy lifetimes without the
      use of expensive and unwieldy support equipment or large magnets.
      Therefore, there remains a need for a versatile, scalable, and
      repeatable method and apparatus to generate air plasmas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus
      for generating self-confined and self-stabilized air plasmas at
      atmospheric pressures. In particular, the method and apparatus
      generate toroidal air plasmas (TAPs) at atmospheric pressure
      having an electron density sufficient for a number of
      applications. The method and apparatus may be configured to
      generate TAPs at a high repetition rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The method includes generating a self-contained air plasma
      at an atmospheric pressure. The air plasma is generated in a first
      ignition region and restricted in radial expansion. The method
      also includes applying a high voltage pulse to the air plasma in a
      secondary ignition region to heat and accelerate the air plasma
      away from the second ignition region. Heating the air plasma
      causes the air plasma to expand and become self-contained.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The apparatus for generating a self-contained air plasma at
      an atmospheric pressure includes a primary ignition region that
      includes a first shielding material defining a first cavity, that
      may be elongated or another configuration, to contain a plasma
      source. The apparatus also includes an ignition device to generate
      the air plasma from the plasma source and a secondary ignition
      region that includes a second shielding material defining a second
      region, that may be elongated or another configuration, wherein
      the second cavity is in fluid communication with the first cavity
      to receive the air plasma. In one embodiment, the second region is
      defined, at least in part, by a wire mesh that allows a current to
      be discharged through the air therein and form a plasma discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The apparatus includes a high voltage circuit that includes
      at least one capacitor and is in communication with a voltage
      source in order to apply a high voltage pulse to the air plasma.
      The high voltage pulse heats and accelerates the air plasma away
      from the apparatus to form the self-contained air plasma at the
      atmospheric pressure. In various other embodiments, the plasma
      source is at least one member of a group consisting of an
      exploding wire, an explosive, a puffed gas plasma, a hollow
      cathode plasma, a hypervelocity plasma source, a railgun, a
      microwave-driven plasma source, or other compact plasma source
      that can be directed into the second region. The plasma source may
      also be provided by a one or more laser-induced plasma channels.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another embodiment, a method for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes applying
      a first high voltage pulse across a wire to explode the wire and
      generate the air plasma in a first ignition region located between
      an anode and a cathode. The method also includes restricting
      radial expansion of the air plasma, such that the air plasma
      travels parallel to a longitudinal axis of the wire to a second
      ignition region between the cathode and an accelerator electrode.
      A second high voltage pulse is applied across the cathode and the
      accelerator electrode to heat the air plasma, wherein heating the
      air plasma causes the air plasma to expand, accelerate, and form a
      toroidal structure. The method also includes discharging the
      self-contained toroidal air plasma from the second ignition region
      at the atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The method further includes providing rigid electrically
      insulating materials between the anode and the cathode, as well as
      between the cathode and the accelerator electrode. The insulating
      materials define cavities, which may be elongated. The elongated
      cavity between the anode and the cathode receives the wire and
      restricts the radial expansion of the air plasma. The cavity
      between the cathode and the accelerator electrode allows the air
      plasma to expand. Both cavities may have generally cylindrical or
      spiral configurations. The cavities may have equal or different
      diameters and may be configured to increase or decrease the
      diameter of the toroidal plasma. In addition, the cavities may be
      configured to increase or decrease the velocity of the toroidal
      plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another embodiment, a method for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes
      generating the air plasma in a first ignition region, directing a
      velocity of expansion of the air plasma out of the first region,
      and imparting energy to the air plasma in a secondary ignition
      region, wherein the imparted energy causes the air plasma to
      expand, accelerate out of the second ignition region, and become
      self-contained. Alternately, the method may include restricting
      radial expansion of the air plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In various embodiments, the wire has a gauge in the range
      between 00 AWG and 80 AWG. In other embodiments, the first high
      voltage pulse is between 10kV and 50kV and has a duration between
      0.1 s and 200 ms, while the second high voltage pulse is between
      100V and 300V or up to many thousands of volts and has a duration
      between 1 ns and 1000 ms.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another embodiment, an apparatus for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes a first
      shielding material positioned between an anode and a
      semi-permeable cathode in a primary ignition region. The first
      shielding material has a first longitudinal cavity to contain a
      conductive wire extended between and in communication with the
      anode and the cathode. The apparatus also includes a primary high
      voltage circuit with at least one voltage source and at least one
      capacitor. The primary high voltage circuit is in communication
      with the anode and the cathode to apply a first high voltage pulse
      across the wire causing it to explode and generate the air plasma.
      The first longitudinal cavity restricting radial expansion of the
      air plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The apparatus also includes a secondary ignition region
      defined by a second shielding material positioned between the
      cathode and a semi-permeable electrode. The second shielding
      material has a second longitudinal cavity extending between the
      cathode and the electrode wherein the second longitudinal cavity
      is in fluid communication with the first longitudinal cavity to
      receive the air plasma. The apparatus also includes a secondary
      high voltage circuit with at least one other capacitor that is in
      communication the voltage source. The secondary high voltage
      circuit further communicates with the cathode and the electrode to
      apply a second high voltage pulse across the gap between the
      cathode and the electrode, wherein the second high voltage pulse
      further heats and accelerates the air plasma as it traverses the
      electrode to form the self-contained air plasma at the atmospheric
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In various embodiments, the self-contained air plasma may
      be formed by a laser induced plasma and subsequently heated by a
      laser, a microwave pulse, or any means for imparting energy. The
      plasma formed in air is self-confined by electrostatic or
      electromagnetic fields and interactions. As such, the air plasma
      inherently has a long lifetime. The self-confined air plasma may
      have a lifetime on the order of milliseconds to multiple seconds
      or even minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The density of the plasma may be increased by using a
      pressurization system that may increase the pressure in the
      apparatus to a range between 1 ATM- 2000 ATM or higher. In
      addition, the air within and/or around the apparatus may be
      modified to optimize the size and electron density of the
      generated air plasmas. For example, the air within and/or around
      the apparatus may include one or more gas mixtures or gases seeded
      with nanoparticles or various chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In various embodiments, the self-contained air plasmas have
      an electron density of at least 10&lt;10&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; and may
      be as high as 10&lt;19&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt;. In addition, the geometry
      of the apparatus leads the air plasma to form a toroidal
      structure. DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] The present invention relates to the generation of high-
      density air plasmas at atmospheric pressure that are sustainable
      for a sufficient duration and have an electron density sufficient
      to be used in a variety of applications. As used herein, an air
      plasma at atmospheric pressure refers to an air plasma having
      pressures substantially equal to the surrounding atmosphere. In
      addition, air plasmas at atmospheric pressure do not require
      specialized high- pressure or low-pressure vessels. In one aspect,
      the geometry of the air plasma generating apparatus gives rise to
      the shape and the self-containing nature of the air plasma. Once
      formed, the air plasmas are self-containing and do not require
      additional support equipment. For example, the air plasma
      generator may be configured to generate a toroidal air plasma
      (TAP). A TAP is an air plasma having a substantially toroidal
      shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] For example, the generated air plasmas may be used for
      shock wave mitigation, used as fusion sources for Tritium-Tritium
      or Deuterium- Tritium reactions or any other advanced fusion
      cycle, or plasma capacitors. In addition, the generated air
      plasmas may be used in nonlethal applications, including but not
      limited to electroshock weapons, such as a Taser. The air plasmas
      may also be used for a number of industrial applications,
      including but not limited to: plasma surface modification
      including semiconductor processing, polymer modification, directed
      energy applications, microwave generation, energy storage and
      generation, UV generation for semiconductor manufacturing, plasma
      chaff, surface disinfection, and microwave channeling at a
      distance. The air plasmas may also be used as an ignition source
      for turbines, combustion engines, and rocket engines. The
      generated plasmas may also be used in other applications, for
      example, the generated air plasmas may be precursors to ball
      lightning.<br>

      <b>The Air Plasma Generator Apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] An embodiment of an air plasma generation apparatus 100
      that generates a toroidal air plasma (TAP) is shown in FIGS. 1 -3.
      The apparatus 100 includes an TAP generator 102 that is in
      electrical communication with a primary high-voltage circuit 104
      and a secondary circuit 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The TAP generator 102 is capable of generating a TAP
      discharge, generally indicated as 130, that has a finite duration.
      According to one embodiment, the TAP generator 102 uses an
      exploding wire 108 to form the TAP discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As shown, the exploding wire 108 may be formed of a single
      strand of wire positioned within the TAP generator 102.
      Alternately, the exploding wire 108 may consist of a single stand
      of wire that is woven or looped back and forth within the TAP
      generator 102, such that multiple lengths of the wire may be
      exploded simultaneously. In various other embodiments, the
      exploding wire 108 may consist of multiple stands of distinct or
      looped wires.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] By way of example and not limitation, the exploding wire
      106 may be a 40-gauge copper wire; however, any suitable wire that
      heats and vaporizes in air may be used. In other examples, the
      exploding wire 108 may be any gauge of wire ranging from 00 AWG to
      80 AWG. In addition, the exploding wire 108 may be a solid wire, a
      plated wire, a wire that is doped with other materials, or a
      wire-clad in another material. The exploding wire 108 is suspended
      between an anode 1 10 and a cathode 1 12. To ignite the exploding
      wire 108, a high voltage current is applied across the anode 1 10
      and a cathode 1 12 and through the wire 108. In various
      embodiments, the high voltage current superheats at least a
      portion of the exploding wire 108, thereby causing it to expand
      explosively.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12 define a primary
      ignition region 1 14 in which the exploding wire 108 is ignited.
      The primary ignition region 1 14 also includes a non-conductive
      primary shielding material 1 16 that fills a portion of the space
      between the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. The primary shielding
      material 1 16 has a thickness equal to the spacing between the
      anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. In one example, the primary
      shielding material 1 16 may have a thickness between 5 cm and 20
      cm; however, other thickness and spacing distances may be used. In
      one embodiment, the primary shielding material 1 16 defines an
      primary elongated cavity 1 18 that receives the exploding wire
      108. The diameter of the elongated cavity is larger than the
      diameter of the exploding wire, such that the exploding wire 108
      does not contact the primary shielding material 1 16, thereby
      allowing the exploding wire 1 14 to ignite in air at atmospheric
      pressure. The primary elongated cavity 1 18 restricts the radial
      expansion of air, as indicated by 120, within the elongated cavity
      following the explosion from the exploding wire 108. Restriction
      the radial expansion 120 of the air, along with the momentum from
      the explosion directs the velocity of expanding air out of the
      primary ignition region 1 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The composition of the exploding wire 108 may also
      contribute to the formation of the air plasma. By way of example
      and not limitation, the explosion of the wire 108 generates
      Shockwaves of electrons, ions, plasmas, UV waves and/or metal
      particles, as well as a number of other conditions, which may
      augment the formation of the TAP discharge 130. The exploding wire
      108 also generates a pressure pulse that imparts momentum to the
      gas molecules in a secondary ignition region 122 of the TAP
      generator 102. Similarly, the exploding wire 108 imparts energy
      and momentum to the TAP discharge 130 within the secondary
      ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment, the primary elongated cavity 1 18 is
      generally cylindrical. In another embodiment, the primary
      elongated cavity 1 18 has a spiral configuration. Similarly, other
      configurations of the primary elongated cavity 1 18 may be used;
      however, in all embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 from the
      exploding wire 108 is substantially restricted to axial
      acceleration along the axis of the central axis of the elongated
      cavity in order to generate boundary conditions that help form and
      shape the TAP discharge 130 in the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The secondary ignition region 122 is defined, in part, by
      the cathode 1 12 and an accelerator electrode 124. In one
      embodiment, the cathode 1 12 and the accelerator electrode 124 are
      a semi-permeable materials, such as but not limited to a mesh or
      screen, such that the TAP discharge 130 may traverse the cathode
      and the accelerator electrode. By way of example and not
      limitation, the accelerator electrode 124 may be composed of
      stainless steel or any other semi-permeable conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The secondary ignition region 122 includes a secondary
      shielding material 126. The secondary shielding material 126 is
      non-conductive and may have the same composition as the primary
      shielding material 1 16. Alternately, the secondary shielding
      material 126 may have a different<br>
      composition than the primary shielding material 1 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In one embodiment, secondary shielding material 126 has a
      thickness equal to the spacing between the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator electrode 124. In one example, the secondary shielding
      material 126 has a thickness ranging between approximately 2 mm
      and 2 cm depending upon the distance between the cathode 1 12 and
      the accelerator electrode 124; however other thickness and spacing
      distances may be used. The secondary shielding material 126 also
      defines a secondary cavity 128 that is axially aligned with the
      primary elongated cavity 1 18 of the primary shielding material 1
      16.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one embodiment, the diameter of the secondary cavity 128
      is greater than the diameter of the primary elongated cavity 1 18
      to allow the TAP discharge 130 to expand as it travels through or,
      alternately, is formed in and by the secondary ignition region
      122. In another embodiment, the diameter of the secondary cavity
      128 may be equal to or less than the diameter of the primary
      elongated cavity 1 18. Similarly, the length of the secondary
      cavity may be greater than, equal to, or less than the length of
      the first elongated cavity. In various other embodiments, the
      secondary ignition region 122 has multiple cavities that,
      optionally, may be aligned in parallel to one another and the
      primary elongated cavity 1 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] While a single primary ignition region 1 14 and a single
      secondary ignition region 122 are shown in FIGS. 1 -3, in other
      embodiments multiple ignition regions may be used to further
      amplify the effects of the TAP discharge 130. For example,
      multiple plasma sources may be ignited in multiple primary
      ignition regions and/or multiple secondary ignition regions may be
      used to amplify, accelerate, augment, and/or shape the TAP
      discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In various embodiments, the diameters of the primary and
      secondary cavities can be formed or otherwise configured to
      increase or decrease the diameter of the air plasma and to
      increase or decrease the velocity of the air plasma. The geometry
      of the self-contained air plasmas may also be enhanced through
      optimization of the air plasma generation apparatus 100 and the
      surrounding environment. For example, the TAP generator may be
      configured to generate stable plasmoids or spheres of plasma
      similar to ball lightning.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The TAP generator 102 is electrically connected to a
      primary high voltage circuit 106 that is configured to deliver a
      high-voltage pulse to the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. The TAP
      generator 102 is also electrically connected to a secondary
      circuit 106 configured to discharge energy through the plasma in
      the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The primary high voltage circuit 106 includes one or more
      capacitor banks, one or more high voltage power sources, and one
      or more high- voltage switches, and suitable pulse generating
      circuitry to deliver a high-voltage pulse across the anode 1 10
      and the cathode 1 12. In one embodiment, the primary high voltage
      circuit 106 includes a capacitor bank energized to between
      approximately 2 kV and approximately 100 kV to deliver a high
      voltage pulse having a duration between about 10 ns and 200 ms
      pulse through the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12 to the exploding
      wire 108. In this embodiment, the anode 1 10 is solid or a
      semi-permeable conductor while the cathode 1 12 is semipermeable
      conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As shown in FIG. 4, a particular embodiment of the primary
      high voltage circuit 106 is an RLC circuit 400 that includes a
      number of resistors 402A-C, one or more inductors 404, and one or
      more capacitors or capacitor banks 406. The primary high voltage
      circuit 106 also includes as a power source 408, a three-plate
      pressurized air gap switch 410, a lead 412 connected to the anode
      1 10, another lead 414 connected to the cathode 1 12, and
      additional protection and safety circuitry, including but not
      limited to switches and diodes, generally indicated as 416. [0044]
      In one embodiment, the power source 408 is a direct current (DC)
      power source that supplies approximately 30kV to the primary high
      voltage circuit 106. The capacitor bank 406 has a capacitance of
      approximately 1 1 F to store and release approximately 4.4 kJ
      generate a 6 kA, 46 s current pulse (full- <br>
      width half maximum) through the wire 108, causing the wire to
      explode. The inductor 404 is typically an 1 1 .77 [mu][Eta]
      air-core inductor. The inductor 404 and a 5.5 [Omega]
      aqueous-electrolyte shaping resistor 402A are used to shape the
      current pulse.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The circuit inductance and resistance are both variable
      parameters that affect the amount of current and energy delivered
      to and deposited into the wire 108. To determine the effects of
      circuit inductance on the current pulse delivered to the wire 108,
      the air core inductor 404, was replaced in various embodiments
      with other inductors having inductance values of 0.6 [mu][Eta] and
      27.5 [mu][Eta]. Similarly, in other embodiments, the
      aqueous-electrolyte resistor was replaced with resistors having
      resistances of approximately 20 [Omega] to approximately 300
      [iota][tau][iota][Omega]. Non aqueous-electrolyte resistors may
      also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] When varying the inductance of the primary high-voltage
      circuit 104, a shaping resistor 402A with a resistance of
      approximately 5.2 [Omega] was used. Likewise, the inductor 404 had
      a resistance of approximately 1 1 .77 [mu][Eta] when the
      resistance of resistor 402A was varied.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The current pulse generated by the primary high-voltage
      circuit 104 with a typical 1 1 .77 [mu][Eta] inductor 404 and a
      typical 5.2 [Omega] shaping resistor 402A delivers approximately 6
      kA with a pulse width of approximately 46.08 [mu][epsilon]. It was
      observed that the peak and width of the current pulse varied with
      changes in inductance. For example, when the inductor 404 had an
      inductance of approximately 27.5 [mu][Eta] the current pulse
      delivered to the wire 104 had a peak current of approximately 5.48
      kA and a pulse width of approximately 53.55 [mu][epsilon]. While
      the current pulse generated when the inductor 404 had an
      inductance of 0.6 [mu][Eta] results in higher current
      (approximately 6.88kA) delivered in a smaller pulse width
      (approximately 35.9 s). As expected in view of traditional circuit
      theory, it was observed that the current pulse decreases in
      amplitude yet spreads in pulse width as the inductance increases.
      Further, it was observed that varying the inductance of the
      primary high-voltage circuit 104 did not result in a significant
      change in the height or duration of the TAP discharge 130.
      Similarly, no significant effect was observed in the distance
      traveled data by the TAP discharge 130. As such, the inductance of
      the primary high-voltage circuit 104 may be varied according to
      the desired application of the air plasma generation apparatus 100
      without diminishing the generated TAPs.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Conversely, it was determined that varying the resistance
      in the primary high-voltage circuit 104, did however, affect the
      generated TAPs. For example, the current pulse from a typical
      configuration of the primary high- voltage circuit, where the
      resistance of the shaping resistor 402A is<br>
      approximately 5.2 [Omega], is approximately 6 kA with a pulse
      width of approximately 46.08 s. The current pulse, when the
      resistor 402A has a resistance of approximately 20 [Omega],
      however, reaches a peak of only about 2.02 kA with a pulse width
      of approximately 130.85 s.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Further, by removing the typical aqueous-electrolyte
      resistor 402A from the circuit and directly connecting the
      inductor 404 to the anode 1 10, through lead 412, resulted in a
      stray resistance of approximately 300 [iota][tau][iota][Omega]. In
      this configuration, the primary high-voltage circuit 104 is
      underdamped, rather than the typical overdamped configuration. As
      such, the resultant current oscillates about four times in
      approximately 288 s while reaching a peak of approximately 23.6
      kA.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Changing the resistance of the resistor 402A yields
      appreciable differences in the size and the duration of the TAP
      discharge 130. For example, when the resistor 402A has a
      resistance of approximately 20 [Omega] the TAP discharge 130 has a
      shorter duration and smaller diameter when compared to a shaping
      resistance of approximately 5.2 [Omega]. Further, when the
      resistor 402A is removed or otherwise reduced to yield a
      resistance of approximately 300 [eta][tau][iota][Omega], the TAP
      discharge 130 is approximately twice as large in diameter and has
      a longer duration when compared to TAP discharges with a 5.2
      [Omega] resistor. In additionally, the TAP discharge 130 generated
      with a 300 [iota][tau][iota][Omega] resistor for the shaping
      resistor 402A travels approximately twice as far as the TAP
      discharges generated using a 20 [Omega] resistor or a 5.2 [Omega]
      resistor for the shaping resistor. In this configuration,
      additional energy has been deposited into the TAP discharge 130
      formed by the exploding wire 108. This results in an increase in
      the volume and duration of the TAP discharge 130 and may be
      caused, at least in part by the reduction in dampening of the
      primary high-voltage circuit 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Preferably, the secondary circuit 106 includes a capacitor
      bank charged to a voltage suitable for heating the TAP discharge
      130. For example, when the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is
      charged to between 100V and 300V, the TAP discharge 130 entering
      the secondary ignition region 122 completes a circuit between the
      cathode 1 12 and the accelerator electrode 124. The energy
      imparted by the secondary high voltage circuit 106 enhances the
      duration and velocity of the TAP discharge 130. In one embodiment,
      the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is connected to the same
      high voltage power source as the primary high voltage circuit 106.
      In another embodiment, the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is
      powered by another high voltage source. In yet another embodiment,
      the primary high voltage circuit 106 and the secondary high
      voltage circuit 106 may be incorporated into a single high voltage
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] By way of example and not limitation, the secondary circuit
      106 may include a secondary 8.8 mF electrolytic capacitor bank 132
      that is charged to approximately 250 V to heat the plasma in the
      secondary ignition region 122. The post-explosion heating has been
      shown to enhance both the size and duration of the TAP discharge
      130.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The additional heating provided by the secondary circuit
      106 also plays a role in forming the toroidal shape of the TAP
      discharge 130. For example, the elongated cavity 128 defined by
      the secondary shielding material 126 allows for the plasma
      generated by the explosion of the wire 104 to expand. During
      expansion, when the area between the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator anode 124 is filled with plasma, the secondary
      capacitor bank 132 discharges stored energy through the plasma. In
      one embodiment, a 400 A current drawn by the plasma from the
      secondary capacitor bank 132 has a pulse width of approximately 4
      ms. After the discharge from the secondary capacitor bank 132, the
      bulk of the TAP discharge 130 detaches from a portion 134 of the
      discharge that remains in the secondary ignition region 122 and
      exits from the TAP generator 102, as shown in FIG. 5. After the
      bulk of the TAP discharge 130 has separated from the remaining
      portion, the capacitor bank 132 may continue to discharge and
      energize the remaining plasma in the TAP generator 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A cross sectional view of the evolution of the toroidal
      structure 500 of the TAP discharge 130 is shown in FIG. 5. For
      approximately the first millisecond after ignition, the discharge
      130 is still expanding from the secondary ignition region 122 and
      has a very homogeneous profile.<br>
      Approximately 1 .5 ms after ignition, the toroidal shape begins to
      form. These two images illustrate the toroidal shape of the
      discharge at 6 ms and 7 ms after ignition. FIG. 5 also shows the
      remaining discharge 134 within the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In one embodiment, the TAP discharge 130 can last up to 15
      ms while travelling approximately 30 cm from the TAP generator
      102. In other embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 may have a
      lifetime in the range of milliseconds to multiple seconds and
      multiple minutes. The toroidal structure 400 of the TAP discharge
      103 may expand to approximately 12 cm in diameter. In other
      embodiments, the toroidal structure 400 may expand to other
      diameters including those less than or greater than 12 cm. The
      electron density of the TAP is preferably at least
      10&lt;10&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; and may be as high as
      10&lt;19&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt;. In various embodiments, the electron
      density is determined to be approximately
      10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; based upon the measured
      current passing through the plasma while it is in the secondary
      ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The density of the plasma may be increased by using a
      pressurization system (not shown) that may increase the pressure
      in the apparatus to a range between 1 ATM- 2000 ATM or higher. In
      addition, the air within and/or around the apparatus may be
      modified to optimize the size and electron density of the
      generated air plasmas. For example, the air within and/or around
      the apparatus may include one or more gas mixtures or gases seeded
      with nanoparticles or various chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In various embodiments, the radial expansion 120 of the
      shock wave and heat generated by the explosion of the wire 108 is
      confined within the primary and secondary cavities 1 18 and 128,
      respectively. The discharge from the exploding wire 108 is thus
      dissipated, predominantly, through axial expansion along the axis
      of the primary elongated cavity 1 18 and the secondary cavity 128.
      This imparts hydrodynamic effects upon the TAP discharge 130 and
      therefore, the geometry of the TAP generator 102 lends itself to
      the self-containing characteristics of the TAP discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The combined effects of the initial axial expansion from
      the exploding wire 108 and the secondary excitation in the
      secondary ignition region 122 result in the formation of the
      toroidal structure 400. In various other embodiments, the
      secondary ignition region 122 may have any geometry that can
      transfer energy into the TAP discharge 130. In these embodiments,
      the temperature and subsequent absorption and emission of light by
      the TAP discharge 130 can be tailored to specific requirements
      based upon the geometry of the secondary ignition region 122. The
      duration and amount of energy delivered to the plasma in the
      secondary ignition region 122 can be optimized to generate
      characteristics of the TAP discharge 130 that are required for the
      desired application. For example, by increasing the energy
      imparted to the TAP discharge in the secondary ignition region
      122, the lifetime of the TAP discharge may be extended from
      milliseconds to minutes thereby allowing the long-range projection
      of the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Although the TAP generator 102 has been described using the
      exploding wire 108 as the initial plasma source, other plasma
      sources may be used. By way of example and not limitation, other
      plasma sources include explosives, puffed gas plasmas, hollow
      cathode plasmas, microwave driven sources, high power laser
      arrays, railguns, hypervelocity plasma accelerators, and any other
      plasma source that has a high repetition rate to generate ionized
      particles. In these embodiments, the plasma source is activated by
      a suitable activation device corresponding to the plasma course.
      For example, an activation device for an explosive is a detonator,
      while an activation device for a microwave driven source is a
      microwave generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In another example, one or more lasers is used to form or
      further heat the TAP discharge 130. For example, a laser may be
      used to form a laser-induced air plasma in the primary ignition
      region 1 14. Alternately, a laser may be used to heat a plasma
      discharge within the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In various embodiments, the air plasma generation apparatus
      100 is configured for single or multi-shot operation. As such, the
      air plasma generation apparatus 100 may generate a single or
      multiple self- contained air plasmas at a high rate of repetition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Toroidal Air Plasma</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] The TAP discharge 130 has a very homogenous profile
      immediately after the ignition of the exploding wire 108 as it
      expands from the first primary elongated cavity 1 18. In one
      embodiment, the TAP discharge 130 begins to take on the toroidal
      structure 400 approximately 1 .5 ms after ignition. The toroidal
      structure 400 of the TAP discharge 200 is shown at approximately 6
      ms and approximately 7 ms after ignition in FIGS. 5A and 5B,
      respectively. FIGS. 6A and 6B also show the secondary ignition 600
      of the TAP discharge 130 within the secondary ignition region 122.
      When the TAP discharge 130 exits the TAP generator 102, the
      discharge has a circulating current or field reversal that
      generates a self-magnetic field as well as a rotating plasma
      region on the minor radius of the toroid structure 400. The
      self-magnetic field confines the TAP discharge 130 and
      significantly increases the lifetime of the TAP discharge to
      effectively produce a self-sustaining TAP discharge by reducing
      interactions that may recombine molecules of the air plasma with
      atmospheric gas molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In various embodiments, the TAP discharge can be sustained
      for approximately 2-30 ms and may travel approximately 10-40 cm
      away from the TAP generator 102 at up to 200 m/s. The toroidal
      shape 500 may expand up to approximately 12 cm in diameter. The
      electron density of the TAP discharge 130 is approximately
      10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; as determined by the
      measured current passing through the TAP discharge 130 during the
      secondary heating of the discharge in the secondary ignition
      region 122. In various other embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 is
      scalable to higher energies, densities and can be used for a
      number of advanced applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] For example, 1 kilojoule to 1 gigajoule or higher of energy
      may be imparted to the TAP discharge 130 in the secondary ignition
      region 122. Increasing the energy will increase the lifetime of
      the TAP discharge 130 from an order of milliseconds to minutes
      allowing for the long-range projection of the TAP discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a
      method 700 for generating a TAP discharge 130. At step 702, a
      first high voltage pulse is applied across the anode 1 10, the
      cathode 1 12, and the exploding wire 108 in the primary ignition
      region 1 14. The first high voltage causes the wire to explode
      thereby producing the TAP discharge 130. At step 704, the radial
      expansion of the AP discharge is restricted such that the TAP
      discharge travels along the longitudinal axis of the wire to a
      second ignition region defined by the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator electrode 124. [0066] In the second ignition region
      122, a second high voltage pulse is applied across the cathode 1
      12 and the accelerator electrode 124 to further heat and expand
      the TAP discharge 130, at step 706. Within the secondary ignition
      region 122, the TAP discharge becomes self-sustaining and takes on
      the toroid structure 200. At step 708, the self-contained TAP
      discharge is discharged from the second ignition region 122,
      wherein it may be used to mitigate the effects of a shock wave or
      another propagating wave.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example Method for Generating a Toroidal Air Plasma</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0067] By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary method
      for generating a TAP discharge, such as the discharge 130 is
      provided. The primary high voltage circuit 104 of the air plasma
      generation apparatus 100 included an 1 1 F capacitor bank
      energized to approximately 30kV to deliver a 4 kA pulse for a
      duration of approximately 200 s pulse through two strands of 40
      AWG silver-plated copper wire 108 within the TAP generator 102.
      The anode 1 10 connected to the wire 108 was a copper screen while
      the cathode 1 12 was a stainless steel screen. The primary
      shielding material 1 16 was a polycarbonate material having a
      thickness of approximately 10 cm and the elongated cavity 1 18 had
      a diameter of approximately 1 .25 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The secondary circuit 106 used an 8.8 mF electrolytic
      capacitor bank 132 charged to 250V to heat the TAP discharge 130.
      The secondary primary shielding material 126 was plastic
      approximately 7 mm thick and defined another elongated cavity 128
      with a diameter of approximately 3 cm. The secondary circuit 106
      discharged approximately 400A into the TAP discharge 130 over
      approximately 4 ms. The TAP discharge 130 exiting the TAP
      generator 102 has an electron density of approximately
      10&lt;16&gt;-10&lt;17&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; as determined by the
      measured current that passed through the discharge during the
      secondary heating. [0069] It will be appreciated that the device
      and method of the present invention are capable of being
      incorporated in the form of a variety of embodiments, only a few
      of which have been illustrated and described above. The invention

      Abstract -- This disclosure relates to methods and systems to
      reduce high voltage breakdown jitters in liquid dielectric
      switches. In particular, dielectric liquids have been produced
      that contain a suspension of nanoparticles and a surfactant to
      reduce the breakdown jitter. In one embodiment, the suspended
      nanoparticles are Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) nanoparticles.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention generally relates to a dielectric fluid that
      can be used to reduce the voltage breakdown jitter in high voltage
      switches and spark gaps. The invention further relates to methods
      of reducing the voltage breakdown jitter in high voltage switches
      and spark gaps, various methods of preparing the dielectric fluid,
      and high voltage switches incorporating the dielectric fluid.
      Generally, the dielectric fluid is pressurized, filtered and may
      include a nanoparticle suspension.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The design and characterization of dielectrics is critical
      for optimum high-voltage switch performance. Previous attempts to
      optimize switch performance, such as the tuning of the oil
      pressure and flow rates for oil dielectrics, have dramatically
      reduced the rep-rate self-break jitter by eliminating breakdown
      byproducts.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] During self-break operation, however, switches using oil
      dielectrics may still demonstrate erratic breakdown patterns. Some
      switches have shown percentages of standard deviation from the
      mean breakdown as high as 20%. This is problematic for electrical
      loads that require uniform pulse repetition. Therefore, there
      remains a need to further reduce the voltage breakdown jitter in
      high voltage switches and spark gaps.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for
      reducing the voltage breakdown jitter in high voltage switches and
      other applications. In one embodiment, a method for preparing a
      dielectric fluid to reduce voltage breakdown jitter in a high
      voltage spark gap includes providing a dielectric fluid, sparging
      the dielectric fluid with dry nitrogen, and adding a plurality of
      nanoparticles to the dielectric fluid. The method further includes
      adding a surfactant to the dielectric fluid, sonicating the
      dielectric fluid, filtering the dielectric fluid, and pressurizing
      the dielectric fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In various embodiments, the dielectric fluid is a
      polyolefin having a chemical formula of C6H32, such as
      1-Hexadecane or a hydrocarbon-based coolant fluid, such as
      NYCODIEL. The method may further include sparging the dielectric
      fluid with dry nitrogen to reduce the water content of a
      dielectric oil to less than approximately 20 ppm or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment, the plurality of nanoparticles have a
      dielectric constant ranging from 20-6000 and may be composed of
      Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) nanoparticles. The nanoparticles
      range in diameter from about 50 nm to about 250 nm and may be
      added to obtain a concentration in the dielectric fluid ranging
      between 0.1% and 10% by weight. In various embodiments, the ratio
      of the dielectric constant of the plurality of nanoparticles to
      the dielectric constant of the dielectric fluid is at least 3:1,
      10:1, 2000:1, or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another embodiment, the surfactant is added to obtain a
      concentration in the dielectric fluid ranging between 0.1% and 10%
      by weight. In one embodiment of the method, the dielectric fluid
      is pressurized to between about 10 psig and 2,500 psig. In another
      embodiment, the dielectric fluid is pressurized to approximately
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In another embodiment, a method for reducing voltage
      breakdown jitter in a high voltage switch includes providing two
      or more electrodes separated by a gap and providing a pressurized
      dielectric suspension between the electrodes. The dielectric
      suspension includes a dielectric fluid, a surfactant to reduce a
      breakdown voltage of the dielectric fluid and remove carbon from
      at least one of the two or more electrodes, and a plurality of
      nanoparticles to enhance the formation of streamers thereby
      reducing an electrode gap.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The method also includes applying a voltage across the two
      or more electrodes to form an electric field between the two or
      more electrodes. The reduction of the breakdown voltage and the
      formation of streamers enhance the electric field between the two
      or more electrodes to reduce the voltage breakdown jitter in the
      gap. In one embodiment, the voltage breakdown jitter is decreased
      by 10% or greater. In another embodiment, the voltage breakdown
      jitter is decreased by a factor of 2 or greater. For example, the
      jitter may be decreased by a factor ranging between 2 and 3. In
      yet another embodiment, the voltage breakdown jitter is decreased
      by a factor of 10 or greater. In other embodiments, the gap is
      between 5 [mu]m and 2000 [mu]m, while the applied voltage ranges
      from about 2 kV to about 10 MV.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In one embodiment, a dielectric to reduce jitter in a high
      voltage spark gap between an anode and a cathode includes a
      pressurized hydrocarbon-based fluid having a first dielectric
      constant and a plurality of nanoparticles having a second
      dielectric constant, where the ratio of the second dielectric
      constant to the first dielectric constant is approximately 3 to 1.
      The dielectric also includes a surfactant to suspend the plurality
      the nanoparticles in the fluid, to reduce the voltage breakdown of
      the fluid, and to remove carbon particles from the surface of an
      electrode. The high voltage spark gap may be a component of a high
      voltage switch. In one embodiment, the high voltage switch is
      selected from a group consisting of a laser-triggered switch, an
      electrically triggered trigatron, or an electric substation
      switch. In various embodiments, the shape of the plurality of
      nanoparticles may be tailored to induce specific breakdown
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another embodiment, an electric switch system includes
      at least two electrodes separated by a gap and a dielectric liquid
      including a surfactant and a suspension of nanoparticles. The
      switch system may also include a high-pressure pump and a filter
      system. The liquid may be continuously pumped through the gap.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] The present disclosure relates to a dielectric fluid that
      reduces the voltage breakdown jitter in high voltage switches and
      spark gaps. In various embodiments, the dielectric fluid can be
      used in flowing or pressurized nonflowing spark gaps. In one
      aspect, the pressurized fluid reduces the size of the vapor bubble
      resulting from the arc in the liquid. An isostatic pressure is
      applied reducing the size of the vapor bubble. The isostatic
      pressure also increases the voltage breakdown jitter of the
      switch. The pressure inherently reduces microbubbles that result
      from the formation of electrons emitted from the cathode surface.
      Typically, the emitted electrons result from high electrical field
      levels at the surface of the cathode that are caused by electrode
      pitting and the electrode gap spacing.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In a high pressure spark gap, a minimum of 2 electrodes are
      utilized for the switch. By way of example, and not limitation,
      exemplary high voltage switches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      7,312,412 and 7,390,984 to Cravey et al., both of which are hereby
      incorporated by reference in their entireties. In various
      embodiments, the switch operates at voltages ranging from
      approximately 2 kV to approximately 10 MV, with subsequent
      currents that range from about 100 A to about 5 MA.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Various testing to identify one or more embodiments of the
      invention were conducted and presented in "Electrostatic Field
      Simulation Study of Nanoparticles Suspended in Synthetic
      Insulating Oil," IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Vol. 38
      Issue 10, pp. 2514-2519, herein incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. The dielectric fluid has applications to laser-triggered
      and electrically-triggered trigatron designs, and other triggered
      spark gaps that utilize a fluid. Spark gaps that utilize fluids of
      this type may one day be used in the electrical industry to
      replace SF6, a gas that is believed to destroy ozone. Other
      potential applications include use within various components of
      electric substations, directed energy systems, or pulsed power
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] A dielectric fluid 100, according to one embodiment, is
      shown in FIG. 1 as flowing through a gap 102 between a set of
      electrodes 104 and 106, (e.g. an anode and a cathode) for an
      exemplary switch 108. In one embodiment, the dielectric fluid 100
      is an oil. Preferably, the dielectric fluid 100 is a polyolefin
      having a chemical formula of C6H32 or a hydrocarbon-based coolant
      fluid. In one embodiment, the dielectric fluid 100 is
      1-Hexadecene. In another embodiment, the dielectric fluid 100 is
      NYCODIEL, a coolant fluid produced by Nyco. In various other
      embodiments, the dielectric fluid 100 is any dielectric liquid,
      including a poly-alpha-olefin (PAO), which is suitable for use in
      a spark gap. By way of example and not limitation, the dielectric
      fluid 100 may be a silicone-based oil or water. In other examples,
      the dielectric fluid 100 may include one or more oils.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nanoparticles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] In one embodiment, the dielectric fluid 100 includes a
      number of particles, such as a nanoparticle 300, as shown in FIGS.
      3 and 4, that act as field enhancements. The nanoparticle 300
      presents an artificial geometry that allows the electric field to
      be enhanced in the fluid. The nanoparticle 300 also enhances the
      formation of streamers in the dielectric fluid 100. The streamers
      in turn, effectively close the electrode gap 102 to form an arc,
      when a voltage is applied to the electrodes 104 and 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The nanoparticle 300 may be composed of any material having
      a high dielectric constant, including but not limited to ceramics.
      Preferably, the nanoparticle 300 is a Barium-Strontium-Titanate
      (BST) nanoparticle. In various embodiments, the nanoparticle 300
      has a dielectric constant that ranges from 20 to 6000. The
      dielectric constant of an exemplary BST nanoparticle is
      approximately 2000. In another embodiment, the nanoparticle 300
      has a dielectric constant that is at least 3 times greater than
      the dielectric constant of the dielectric fluid 100. In a
      preferred embodiment, the nanoparticle 300 has a dielectric
      constant that is at least 10 times greater than the dielectric
      constant of the dielectric fluid 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one embodiment, the nanoparticles 300 within the
      dielectric fluid 100 have uniform composition and dielectric
      constants. In another embodiment, the dielectric fluid 100 may
      include a distribution of nanoparticles 300 having mixed
      compositions and/or dielectric constants. In various embodiments,
      the nanoparticles 300 are added to the dielectric fluid 100 to
      achieve a final concentration that ranges from approximately 0.1%
      weight by volume (w/v) to 10% w/v or higher.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The size of the nanoparticle 300 can be selected to provide
      for the optimum field enhancement to reduce the voltage breakdown
      jitter. Preferably, the nanoparticles 300 range in diameter from
      50 nm to about 250 nm. The nanoparticles 300 may, however,
      agglomerate to form clusters that may be several microns in
      diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In one embodiment, the nanoparticles 300 are polar
      molecules that will form dipoles 200 in an electric field 202, as
      the charges separate with a magnitude proportional to the electric
      field. As shown in FIG. 2, dipoles 200 will align within the
      dielectric liquid 100. The dipoles 200 will exhibit a polarization
      charge at its extreme edges. If the net charge on a nanoparticle
      300 is zero, as under direct current conditions, then the electric
      field 202 will not cause it to drift. The polarization magnitude
      of the surface charge on the nanoparticle 300 under the influence
      of an electric field is proportional to its dielectric constant.
      This relationship is defined by the equation: D=[element of]E,
      where D is the electric displacement field and [element of] is the
      dielectric constant ([element of]0[element of]r). D is in units of
      C/m&lt;2 &gt;and defines the electric flux density associated with
      the nanoparticle 300. The dielectric constant of a BST
      nanoparticle 300 is around 2000.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] FIG. 3 depicts a three-dimensional model of an electrode
      system according to one embodiment, while FIG. 4 depicts a
      two-dimensional cross-sectional view of the three-dimensional
      model. The dielectric fluid 100 was modeled as a three-dimensional
      homogeneous background of material with a constant relative
      permittivity into which a random distribution of fixed-diameter
      particles could be introduced. The particles have a different
      relative permittivity than the background. Conditions such as
      particle size, particle density, and distance of a single particle
      from the electrodes were investigated numerically. The simulation
      suggests that nanoparticle density is a critical parameter, with
      increased concentrations corresponding to increased average
      electric field within the simulated dielectric sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The results of the electric field models, shown in FIGS.
      3-4 indicate that the nanoparticles 300 introduce a field
      enhancement effect on the cathode 106 surface and within the bulk
      of the dielectric fluid 100. In one example, the high dielectric
      constant associated with a nanoparticle 300 of BST is
      approximately 2000, and therefore excludes electric fields 202 and
      concentrates them within the dielectric fluid 100 having a
      dielectric constant of approximately 2. This produces an electric
      field enhancement at the BST-fluid interface of approximately
      1000. A BST nanoparticle 300 near the cathode 106 surface will
      increase the local electric field 202 in the fluid 100 and
      increase the probability of electron emission from the cathode.
      The particle-generated electric fields 202 in the bulk of the
      fluid 100 may help guide the breakdown streamer across the gap
      102.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, the particle shape and/or particle
      morphology may determine the breakdown characteristics of the
      system. For example, the particles interact with one or more
      electrode surface field enhancements that are present at the
      electrode surface. Repeated discharges may cause pitting and other
      deformations (other field enhancements) on the surface of the
      electrodes 104 and 106. The deformations increase the probability
      that a subsequent breakdown will initiate on or near the field
      enhancement site. Typically, field enhancements on the electrode
      surface are either hemispherical or conical. Various simulations
      conducted to study the interactions between the nanoparticles 300
      and various field enhancements indicate that an increasing
      particle concentration increases the chance that a particle is
      located near the electrode surface, contributing to an average
      field increase across the surface of the electrode. This effect
      allows electrons to be emitted at lower switch voltages.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The results from the simulations also indicate that the
      interactions between the electrode field enhancements and the high
      dielectric nanoparticles 300 may contribute to a reduction in
      jitter. For example, jitter values as low as about 7% have been
      recorded with nanoparticle suspension and optimized gap-spacing.
      In one embodiment, the nanoparticles 300 polarize in the applied
      electric field and disrupt any electric fields at the peaks of the
      field enhancements while increasing the electric fields at the
      non-enhanced portions of the electrode surface. Overall, the
      nanoparticles 300 may function to combine to "smooth" the fields
      on the electrode surface, thereby reducing jitter in the system.
      As such, the particular shape and/or morphology of the
      nanoparticles 300 may be tailored to induce specific breakdown
      characteristics of the system. For example, the nanoparticles 300
      may be spherical, cubic, or irregularly shaped, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The amount of nanoparticles within the dielectric fluid 100
      as well as the nanoparticle size, shape, and/or morphology help
      determine the reduction in the electric field hold-off value in
      the fluid switching media. Measured values indicate that the
      electric field hold-off of the fluid can be reduced by over 50% if
      required. The surfactant also can be used to reduce the voltage
      breakdown. All of these factors allow the electrode spacing to be
      increased thereby reducing the effect of the electrode pitting and
      inherently reducing the jitter of the voltage across the
      electrodes.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Surfactant</b><br>
      <br>
      [0036] In order to suspend the nanoparticles 300 in the dielectric
      fluid 100, a surfactant is added to the fluid. In a preferred
      embodiment, the surfactant is a polar additive. By way of example
      and not limitation, the surfactant may be oleic acid,
      alkylbenzene-sulfonic acid, phosphate ester, or other surfactants
      that are suitable for use in a spark gap. In various embodiments,
      the surfactant is added to the dielectric fluid 100 to achieve an
      initial concentration that ranges from approximately 0.1% w/v up
      to about 10% w/v.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The polarization of the surfactant thereby aids to further
      reduce the voltage breakdown within the gap 102. In both flowing
      and non-flowing embodiments of the dielectric fluid 100, the
      polarization of the surfactant can be used to "tune" or
      selectively modify the voltage hold-off of the gap 102 without
      changing the length of the gap. Moreover, in embodiments where the
      dielectric fluid flows through the gap 102, the surfactant aids in
      the removal of carbon particles from surfaces of the electrodes
      104 and 106, thus further reducing the voltage breakdown jitter.
      The surfactant also mitigates the agglomeration of the
      nanoparticles 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one aspect, the surfactant additive, in some instances,
      may produce a significant decrease in breakdown jitter. For
      example, simulations have shown that a dielectric fluid, such as
      PAO, without additives will decrease jitter to some extent;
      however, one or more additives may be added to decrease the
      voltage breakdown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electric Switch System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] An electric switch system 500 according to one embodiment
      is shown in FIG. 5. The electric switch system 500 includes a
      high-pressure heating system 502, a filtration system 504, and a
      switch 506.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The high pressure system includes a pump 508 and a
      hydraulic translator 510 to pressurize and pump the dielectric
      fluid 100 within the switch 506. In one embodiment, the pump 508
      is a hand pump. In other embodiments, the pump 508 may be an
      electrically-powered pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The filtration system 504 includes at least one valve 512,
      a pump 514, and at least one filter 516. In one embodiment, the
      valve 512 is an isolation valve that can isolate portions of the
      filtration system 504 from the high-pressure system 502 and the
      switch 506.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The pump 514 can be used to pump the dielectric fluid 100
      through the switch 506 and through the filter 516. In various
      embodiments, the pump 514 may pump the dielectric fluid 100 to be
      filtered before, during and/or after triggering of the switch 506.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The filter 516 filters the dielectric fluid 100. The filter
      516 removes large undesirable nanoparticle agglomerates. In
      various embodiments, the filter 516 has pore diameters ranging
      from as large as 5 [mu]m to as little as 200 nm. In another
      embodiment, a series of filters may be used to filter the
      dielectric fluid 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The switch 506 is high-voltage switch having spaced
      electrodes, similar to the electrodes 104 and 106. In one aspect,
      the switch 506 also includes a trigger mechanism for operating the
      switch. The trigger may be a trigatron, a laser pulse, a microwave
      pulse, or a series injection. By way of example and not
      limitation, the switch 506 may be a high-voltage system capable of
      generating a 250-kV voltage pulse across electrodes 104-106 and
      through the dielectric liquid 100 with a rise-time of 1.6 [mu]s.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6, the switch 506
      includes a Marx-generator circuit 600 that rings a peaking
      capacitor 602 through a linear inductor 604. The voltage developed
      on the peaking capacitor 602 is simultaneously applied to the
      electrodes 104 and 106 of the switch 506. The values shown in FIG.
      6 for the various components of the switch 506 are provided for
      illustration only and do not limit the configuration of the
      switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] By way of example and not limitation, the electrodes may be
      planar 1-inch diameter stainless steel electrodes that may have
      smooth or rough surfaces. In one embodiment, the electrode gap 102
      is externally adjustable. In a preferred embodiment, the gap 102
      ranges from 5 [mu]m to 50,000 [mu]m. In various other embodiments,
      other gap 102 distances may be used. Typically, the gap 102 is set
      such that the voltage breaks down at 20-100% of the attainable
      charge voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The switch 506 is configured to apply a voltage across the
      electrodes 104 and 106 that rises at the rate of approximately 150
      kV/[mu]s. In one embodiment, the switch 506 is further configured
      for self-breakdown operation. Further, in operation, the switch
      506 is suited for pressures up to and including 2,500 psig or
      greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In various embodiments, the dielectric fluid 100 may be
      circulated through and/or within high voltage switches or spark
      gaps. By way of example and not limitation, the dielectric fluid
      may be pumped through or otherwise agitated in the gap 102 between
      the electrodes 104 and 106, thereby causing continuous motion in
      the fluid in the gap. The fluid 100 may be circulated by a fluid
      pump or a vibrating device in communication with the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 7 is a graph depicting the effect of a single
      particle's distance from the cathode on the average cathode
      electric field strength according to one embodiment. If the
      nanoparticles 300 are in close proximity to each other or an
      electrode, the polarization charge can create the nonlinear
      electric fields shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 7 provides the results of an
      exemplary simulation showing the change in the average electric
      field strength corresponding to a position for a nanoparticle.
      During the simulation, the nanoparticle was modeled as a 100 nm
      nanoparticle and the electrodes are modeled as flat electrodes
      having a 16 [mu]m diameter and 8 [mu]m gap of separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Electromagnetic theory suggests that the high dielectric
      constant of the nanoparticles is a result of their ability to
      polarize into dipoles in an applied field. This allows a
      nanoparticle near or on the surface of the cathode to increase the
      local electric field and act as a field enhancement to draw
      electrons out of the cathode and into collision with the neutral
      chains of oil molecules eventually resulting in a breakdown event.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The simulations also suggest that the polarized
      nanoparticles 300 may change the electric fields within the bulk
      of the dielectric fluid 100 to act as a path for an ionized
      streamer to propagate through. The local nonlinear electric fields
      generated by the polarized nanoparticles 300 may guide the
      elongating ionized streamer from the cathode electrode 106 to the
      anode electrode 104 thereby producing more predictable breakdown
      events.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Various experimental tests, conducted without filtering the
      dielectric fluid 100, have shown a marked decrease in the average
      breakdown electric field with increasing concentrations of
      nanoparticles 300. It is thought that this may be due to the large
      extraction fields generated by the nanoparticles on the surface of
      the cathode and in the bulk of the oil. FIG. 8 is a graph
      depicting the average breakdown electric field in a dielectric
      liquid with an increasing concentration of nanoparticles 300
      according to one embodiment, where an inline filter of 5 [mu]m,
      similar to the filter 516, was used for these tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] These measurements were gathered using a switch, similar to
      the switch 506, where the flat electrode gap spacing was set at
      0.18 cm. The flat electrode geometry was used to generate a
      uniform electric field across the gap and mitigate the effect of
      field enhancement. During the test cycle 150 shots were taken with
      75 shots taken per pressure. The oil utilized was a hydrogenated
      1-decene polyalphaolefin.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The decrease of the electric breakdown strength in oil can
      be counteracted by a minimal increase in the gap spacing of the
      switch, so it should not be considered a detrimental effect. It is
      included in this section to show that the nanoparticles have a
      realizable effect on the breakdown. The decrease in the breakdown
      strength is even less significant considering that the tests in
      FIG. 4 were completed with no pre-filtering of the oil. After
      pre-filtering, it is predicted that there is less than 5% of the
      original nanoparticles remain in suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 9 depicts a method, indicated generally as 900 for
      reducing voltage breakdown jitter in a high voltage switch system,
      such as the switch system 500. At step 902, a switch having two or
      more electrodes 104-106 separated by a gap 102 is selected. At
      step 904, a pressurized dielectric suspension is pumped between
      the electrodes. The dielectric suspension includes the dielectric
      fluid 100, a surfactant to reduce a breakdown voltage of the
      dielectric fluid and to remove carbon from at least one of the two
      or more electrodes 104-106. The dielectric suspension also
      includes a plurality of nanoparticles, 300 held in suspension due
      at least in part to the surfactant, to enhance the formation of
      streamers thereby effectively reducing the electrode gap 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A voltage is applied across the two or more electrodes to
      form an electric field, at step 906. Within the electric field,
      the surfactant helps to reduce the breakdown voltage and the
      nanoparticles 300 encourage the formation of streamers that
      enhance the electric field between the electrodes 104-106. In one
      embodiment, the combination of the dielectric liquid 100,
      surfactant, and nanoparticles 300 work in combination to reduce
      the voltage breakdown jitter in the gap 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 10 depicts a method, indicated generally as 1000 for
      preparing a dielectric fluid to reduce voltage breakdown jitter in
      a high voltage spark gap. At step 1002, a dielectric oil to serve
      as the dielectric fluid 100 is prepared. The dielectric oil is
      sparged with dry nitrogen at step 1004. In one embodiment, the
      dielectric oil is sparged before being pumped into in the switch.
      The dielectric oil is sparged to reduce the water concentration to
      a uniform level of around 20 ppm or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] At step 1006, the plurality of nanoparticles 300 are added
      to the dielectric oil, while at step 1008 the surfactant is added
      to the dielectric oil. The oil, nanoparticles 300, and surfactant
      combination is sonicated at step 1010 to break up the
      nanoparticles and disperses them throughout the oil to maintain an
      adequate suspension of the nanoparticles in the oil. The oil,
      nanoparticles 300, and the surfactant are then filtered at step
      1012 to sufficiently remove the large nanoparticles agglomerates
      from the oil. In various embodiments, multiple filtering steps are
      used. For example, pre-filtering is necessary to sufficiently
      remove the large nanoparticles agglomerates from the oil so that
      it can be passed through the filter to remove carbon during a
      rep-rate operation. In this example, the oil is filtered by a
      vacuum filtration system that starts with a large pore size filter
      and uses other small-pore size filters. The oil and suspended
      additives are then pressurized at step 1014 to reduce the vapor
      bubble size and/or eliminate microcavities that result from an arc
      traveling through the oil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example <br>
        Dielectric Liquid Preparation Method</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0059] By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary method
      used to prepare the dielectric oil suspension is provided. An
      initial evaluation of a number of dielectric fluids was conducted
      to evaluate both the average electric field strength at breakdown
      over a number of breakdowns. The evaluation also considered the
      percent standard deviation of the electric field, which was
      defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value
      of the breakdown electric field for a sample of breakdown at
      approximately 20-80% of the attainable charge voltage. The
      selected dielectric fluids were military-grade decene-based
      poly-[alpha]-olefins and synthetic hydrocarbons having a
      controlled dielectric constant. The selected oils were first
      pre-filtered through a 0.45-[mu]m filter nitrocellulose filter to
      remove macro particle contaminants. Next BST particles and a
      chemical surfactant were added at with concentrations of 5% and 1%
      by weight relative to the volume of the suspension, respectively.
      An ultrasonic liquid processor was activated after the addition of
      the BST particles for a period of time, which then caused the
      particles to break apart and dispersed them throughout the oil.
      The oil was then filtered by a vacuum filtration system that had a
      filter pore size of 5 [mu]m. The pore size was gradually decreased
      until the nanoparticle oil passed easily through it. In this
      example, the oil was then passed through pre-filters having pore
      sizes that range from 200 nm to 5000 nm. In addition, the oil
      suspension was subjected to inline filtering using filter pore
      sizes ranging from 200 nm to 5000 nm. Before being placed in the
      switch system, the oil was sparged with dry nitrogen for 5 to 10
      minutes to reduce the water concentration to a uniform level of
      around 20 ppm or less. The oil and nanoparticle suspension was
      then placed in the switch and tested. By way of example, and not
      limitation the simulated gap was approximately 8 [mu]m which
      corresponded to an experimental gap spacing of approximately 1.8
      cm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] Table 1 presents experimental results using a variety of
      dielectric fluid configurations, filter configurations, and the
      corresponding breakdown jitter results. These tests were performed
      with an electric switch system in the same configuration as the
      system of the Electrostatic Field Simulation Study of
      Nanoparticles Suspended in Synthetic Insulating Oil publication.
      The first tests were done with hexadecane oil to establish a
      baseline.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The most desired results we obtained were from the NYCO oil
      pre-filtered through the 5-[mu]m filter and filtered through a
      5-[mu]m filter during testing. The value of the percent standard
      deviation (PSD) was 7.61% at 600-psi. The second best PSD of 9.80%
      was found with the NYCO oil pre-filtered with the 1-[mu]m filter
      and filtered through a 1-[mu]m filter during testing. After
      several test cycles at 300 and 600 psi, it was determined that
      lower PSD values were being found at the higher pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] One of the NYCO oil samples was contaminated with water
      saturated Diala AX transformer oil and was included in the table
      to show how increased water content can influence the results. The
      water was removed through sparging and retested with significantly
      better results.<br>

      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The invention relates generally to the field of composite
      materials, and, more particularly, to a composite material with a
      high dielectric constant. The composite materials may be used in a
      variety of applications requiring high-dielectric materials,
      including antennas, capacitors, and high voltage insulators, among
      others. The invention further relates to methods of manufacturing
      high dielectric constant composite materials and devices
      incorporating the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Ceramics are often used in applications that require
      materials with high dielectric constants, such as in capacitors
      and energy storage devices.<br>
      Conventional ceramic materials, however, are typically brittle and
      susceptible to fracturing under tensile and torsion stresses.
      Additionally, conventional ceramic materials exhibit a low
      dielectric strength, limiting their application in high voltage,
      high power, or high energy storage systems. [0005] Existing
      efforts to compensate for the inherent brittle nature and low
      dielectric strength of ceramic material rely on incorporating
      epoxies or other polymeric macromolecules into a mixture with high
      dielectric constant ceramic particles. Existing efforts however,
      do not achieve the ceramic particle packing fraction required to
      achieve a high effective dielectric constant for the composite.
      The current efforts also produce composites containing voids,
      which decrease the dielectric constant and the dielectric strength
      of the composite.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therefore, there remains a need for dielectric materials
      having high dielectric constants at a range of high frequencies
      that also possess a high dielectric strength and have robust
      mechanical properties and strengths.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] The present invention relates to composite materials having
      a high dielectric constant and high dielectric strength, methods
      of producing the composite materials, as well as various devices
      and structures, such as antennas, capacitors, and high-voltage
      insulator assemblies incorporating the composite materials. In one
      embodiment, the high dielectric constant composite material
      includes a distribution of high dielectric constant ceramic
      particles and a polymeric material that is mixed with the
      particles and polymerized in-situ. In various embodiments, the
      dielectric constant is greater than 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The ceramic particles may be of a single particle size
      ranging between about 2 nm to about 220 [mu][iota][tau][iota].
      Alternately, the distribution of high dielectric constant ceramic
      particles may be a bimodal distribution, a trimodal distribution,
      a quadmodal distribution, or higher. The distribution of the high
      dielectric constant ceramic particles has a first volume fraction
      of 50% or greater and the polymeric material has a second volume
      fraction of 50% or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The diameter of the ceramic particles of a largest
      distribution of the trimodal distribution may be between about 10
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] and about 220 [mu][iota][tau][iota], the
      diameter of the ceramic particles of the intermediary distribution
      may be between about 500 nm and about 5 [mu][eta][tau][iota], and
      the diameter of the ceramic particles of a smallest distribution
      of the trimodal distribution may be less than about 500 nm, and as
      small as 2 nm. In one embodiment, the trimodal distribution
      includes at least one first ceramic particle having a first
      diameter in a first range between 10 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 220
      [mu][iota][tau][iota], at least one second ceramic particle having
      a second diameter in a second range between 500 nm and 5
      [mu][iota][tau][iota], and at least one third ceramic particle
      having a third diameter in a third range between 50 nm and 500 nm.
      In another embodiment, the trimodal distribution includes at least
      one first ceramic particle having a first diameter in a first
      range between 0.5 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 3
      [mu][iota][tau][iota], at least one second ceramic particle having
      a second diameter in a second range between 65
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 150 [mu][iota][tau][iota], and at least
      one third ceramic particle having a third diameter in a third
      range between 150 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 500
      [mu][iota][tau][iota].<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Any high dielectric particles, including ceramic particles
      may be used in the composite material. In various embodiments, the
      ceramic particles are perovskites, including compounds thereof.
      More specifically, the perovskites may include barium titanate,
      strontium titanate, barium strontium titanate, lead zirconate
      titanate, lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate, and combinations
      thereof. Further, the surface portions of each of the ceramic
      particles that are not in contact with the surface of another
      ceramic particle are in contact with the polymeric material or a
      liquid filler.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The polymeric material substantially fills a void space
      between two or more of the high dielectric constant ceramic
      particles and, in one embodiment, the polymeric material binds
      directly to the surface of the high dielectric constant ceramic
      particles. In one embodiment, the polymeric material is an
      inorganic-organic coupling agent. Specifically, the binder
      material may be a polysilsesquioxane formed from coupling agents
      including silanes, titanates, zirconates, or combinations thereof.
      For example, the silane coupling agent may be any trialkoxysilane,
      including those selected from a group consisting of
      vinyltrimethoxysilane, triethoxyvinylsilane,
      aminopropytriethoxysilane, or combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] During fabrication, the composite material is compressed in
      a die press according to one embodiment. In various embodiments,
      the compression may further facilitate contact and binding between
      the polymeric material and the ceramic particles. A precursor of
      the polymeric material may be mixed with the distribution of high
      dielectric constant ceramic particles before compression in the
      die press. Further, the precursor may be polymerized and
      cross-linked in-situ by at least one of heat, a chemical catalyst,
      or ultraviolet light.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In various embodiments, the composite material further
      includes a dielectric fluid that may be separate and distinct from
      the ceramic particle and polymeric material mixture. The
      dielectric fluid or a mixture of dielectric fluids may be
      incorporated into the composite material after the polymerization
      of the polymeric material.&nbsp; Optionally, the dielectric fluid
      may also have a high dielectric constant. The dielectric fluid may
      be selected from a group consisting of water, an alkylene
      carbonate, an oil, or combinations thereof and the dielectric
      fluid may include silane, titanate, zirconate, or combinations
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] After polymerization or other formation of the polymer
      binder, the dielectric fluid is impregnated into the composite
      material to fill or displace any voids remaining in the composite
      material, thereby increasing both the dielectric constant and the
      dielectric strength of the composite material. The composite
      material may be submerged and/or bathed in the dielectric fluid.
      Alternately, the dielectric fluid may be forced into the pores of
      the ceramic material using a vacuum or other pressurized system.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A method for manufacturing a composite material having a
      high dielectric constant includes mixing a ceramic powder having a
      distribution of ceramic particles with a liquid polymer precursor
      into a paste, placing the paste into a die, compressing the paste,
      and polymerizing the polymer precursor to form a polymer binder
      that binds directly to ceramic particles of the ceramic powder
      distribution. The method may further include compacting the
      ceramic powder distribution such that the compacted distribution
      has a packing factor of at least 80%, and impregnating the
      composite material with a dielectric liquid to fill voids in the
      composite material and eliminate air from the composite material.
      In one embodiment, the dielectric fluid is injected or forced into
      the pores of the ceramic material by a pressurized system, such as
      a vacuum. [0016] In various embodiments, the paste is compressed
      by a pressure of about 30 tons per square inch in a die press.
      Polymerizing the polymer precursor to form a high dielectric
      constant polymer further includes at least one of heating the die
      containing the pressed paste for at least thirty minutes and
      cooling the high dielectric constant composite material, providing
      a chemical catalyst, or exposing the polymer precursor to
      ultraviolet light. After polymerization, the method may include
      removing the composite material from the die, machining the
      composite material into a desired shape, sanding the composite
      material, and applying one or more electrodes to the composite
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one embodiment, an antenna assembly includes a composite
      material having a high dielectric constant, where the composite
      material further includes a distribution of high dielectric
      constant ceramic particles and a polymeric material. The antenna
      assembly also includes conductive sheets or wires that may include
      copper. The antenna assembly may be a helical antenna, dielectric
      resonator antenna, or any other suitable antenna. Typically,
      antennas incorporating the high dielectric constant composite
      material disclosed herein may be fabricated with smaller
      dimensions relative to similar conventional antennas.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In another embodiment, the high dielectric constant
      composite material may be incorporated into a capacitive or
      high-energy storage device. The capacitive device has a high
      dielectric constant and high dielectric strength. In addition, the
      capacitive device includes two or more electrodes separated by the
      high dielectric constant composite material. The capacitive device
      may be formed as a single layer or a multi-layered structure, and
      the capacitive device may be used for high-density energy storage
      and filtering. In addition, the capacitive device incorporating
      the high dielectric constant composite material may be used as a
      substitute for conventional capacitors in a variety of
      applications. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] The present invention relates to a composite material
      having a high dielectric constant. In particular, the present
      invention relates to composites that have a high dielectric
      constant over a range of high frequencies, a high dielectric
      strength, and that can be formed or machined into complex
      geometries. The ceramic composite material may be used to
      manufacture antennas, radio frequency transmission components,
      microwave transmission components, high energy density capacitors,
      high-voltage insulators, and other applications that may benefit
      from a composite material with a high dielectric constant. As used
      herein, a high dielectric constant refers to a material having a
      dielectric constant of about 20 or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In various embodiments, the high dielectric constant
      composite material includes a distribution of ceramic particles
      ranging from about 2 nm to about 2000 [mu][iota][tau][iota]. Other
      embodiments include distributions of ceramic particles ranging
      from about 10 nm to about 1000 [mu][iota][tau][iota], 50 nm to
      about 500 [mu][iota][tau][iota], or 200nm to about 220
      [mu][iota][tau][iota]. In other embodiments, the high dielectric
      constant composite material contains ceramic particles of a
      uniform size. Similarly, the high dielectric constant composite
      material may contain a bimodal, trimodal, or greater distribution
      of particles. Preferably, the high dielectric constant composite
      material has a trimodal distribution of ceramic particles. In all
      embodiments, the ceramic particle distribution is configured to
      increase the ceramic packing factor (i.e. the fraction of the
      volume in the composite structure that is occupied by the ceramic
      particles), the dielectric constant, and other beneficial
      properties of the ceramic composite material.<br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, the high dielectric constant composite
      material is manufactured using in-situ polymerization in which
      polymer precursors are mixed and compressed with the ceramic
      particles prior to the polymerization and cross-linking of the
      precursors. In-situ polymerization further increases the packing
      factor of the ceramic composites. In addition, in-situ
      polymerization allows for the direct bonding between the polymer
      and the surfaces of the inorganic ceramic particles. Typically,
      the polymer is a substantially insulating or non-conductive
      dielectric polymer that does not contain any metal. As such, the
      matrix of non-metallic dielectric polymer formed after
      polymerization allows for higher breakdown voltages and extends
      the lifetime of the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment, the high dielectric constant composite
      material may be impregnated with a dielectric fluid, and
      preferably a fluid with a high dielectric constant. The dielectric
      fluid fills any remaining voids in the composite material to
      eliminate dead space occupied by air, thereby improving the
      dielectric properties of the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The high dielectric constant composites disclosed herein
      are suitable for use with applications requiring machinable
      dielectric material having robust mechanical properties, a high
      dielectric strength, complex shapes, or low temperature forming
      environments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Ceramic Particles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] Referring now to FIGS. 1A-C, various embodiments of the
      particle distributions for high dielectric constant composite
      materials 100A-C are depicted. As shown the composite materials
      100A-C include a distribution of at least one variety of
      dielectric particles 102-106 that are bound together by a polymer
      binder 108. For illustrative purposes, the particles 102-106 are
      shown as having a regular pattern of distribution in FIGS.1A-C. In
      various embodiments, the particles 102-106 may be randomly
      arranged to result in random particle packing. Despite the random<br>
      arrangement of the particles 102-106, the particles are dispersed
      evenly throughout the composite material by stirring and mixing,
      such that the particle density and other properties of the
      composite, including the dielectric constant and dielectric
      strength, are uniform throughout the material. [0037] The
      composite material may be made using particles of any high
      dielectric constant. Preferably, the particles 102-106 are
      ceramic, including but not limited to barium titanate (BaTiOs),
      strontium titanate (SrTiOs), or barium strontium titanate (BST)
      particles with the formula Ba(i - X)SrxTiO3. The BST particles may
      be incorporated as independent particles or they may be included
      in the composite material 100 as a constituent of a BaTiO3
      particle composite. Other suitable materials for the composite
      particles include lead zirconate titanate (PZT) a ceramic
      perovskite with the formula Pb[ZrxTii-x]O3, where 0&lt;=x&lt;1 ).
      In addition, other perovskite materials, non- perovskite
      materials, and non-linear ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric
      materials may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Perovskite particles are desired, as they possess a number
      of characteristics, such as magnetoresistance, robust dielectric
      properties, and an inherent polarity of the lattice structure,
      particularly when the unit cell has a tetragonal structure. In
      addition, the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the
      perovskite structure permit a variety of molecular distortions,
      including Jahn-Teller distortions, which may be desired in certain
      electronic applications.<br>
      [0039] Further, the particles 102-106 may be refractory ceramic
      particles, non-refractory ceramic particles, or combinations
      thereof. The ceramic particles 102- 106 may be chosen such that
      the Curie temperature of the particles is much different than the
      contemplated temperature of operation for the composite materials
      100A-C to ensure relative stability in the permittivity of the
      composite materials. For example, the particles 102-106 having a
      Curie temperature that differs from the operating temperature of
      the final composite material by about 20[deg.] C or greater may be
      chosen. Alternatively, the ceramic particles 102-106 may be chosen
      such that the Curie temperature of the particles is at or near the
      contemplated operating temperature for the composite materials
      100A-C to maximize the dielectric constant of the composite
      materials. Furthermore, ceramic particles 102-106 having varied
      Curie temperatures may be selected in order to broaden the
      temperature range at which the composite material's dielectric
      strength and dielectric constant are at peak values or otherwise
      stable. [0040] Although shown as spherical in FIGS. 1A-C, the
      ceramic particles 102-106 may have a variety of shapes, including
      but not limited to spherical and irregular shapes. FIGS. 2-3
      depict composite materials 100D and 100E having distributions of
      cubic and spherical particles, respectively. FIG. 4 depicts a
      mixture 200 of particles 102 and 104 that may be used to
      manufacture composite material, similar to the composite material
      100B. Irregular shapes are preferred for all particles 102-106, as
      irregular shapes typically result in high packing densities, which
      in turn yield a higher dielectric constant for the composite
      materials 100A-E. As the particles 102-106 may be any shape, the
      term diameter as used when referencing particle size, may refer to
      a nominal dimension of the particles. For example, the diameter of
      irregular shaped particles may refer to a mean diameter of the
      particle. Similarly, the diameter of predominately-cubic particles
      may refer to an edge length of the particle. For other particle
      shapes, such as elliptical, the diameter may refer to the greatest
      axial or transverse length.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The composite material 100A, as shown in FIG. 1A, has a
      trimodal distribution of the dielectric particles 102-106 that
      range in diameter from less than approximately 2 nm to greater
      than approximately 2000 [mu][iota][tau][iota]. The particles
      102-106 in each size range may be uniform. Alternately, the
      particles within each size range may be any of a variety of sizes
      within the size range. Similarly, the particles 102-106 within
      each size range (i.e. small, intermediate, and large) and across
      each size range may be the same material or be of different
      materials and compositions. For example, a combination of barium
      titanate, strontium titanate, and barium strontium titanate
      particles may be used within each size range and across size
      ranges.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The distribution and range of particle sizes are selected
      to increase the ceramic packing factor and the dielectric constant
      of the composites 100A-C. While ceramic particles of any size may
      be used, the ranges for the smallest particles 102 may be limited
      by manufacturing limits and the desire to keep the small particles
      from agglomerating, as agglomerations of small particles will
      degrade the dielectric characteristics of the composite materials
      100A-C. In one embodiment, the small particles 102 are
      approximately 50 nm in diameter; however, smaller particles as
      small as 2 nm may be used. Conversely, particles larger than 50 nm
      can be used as the small particles 102. It is preferably, however,
      that the smallest achievable nanoparticles are used to maximize
      packing of the particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Typically, the largest particles 106 are limited only by
      practical considerations relating to the thickness of the final
      composite material 100A-C. For example, it is preferred that any
      single large particle 106 is less than or equal to about 10% of
      the total thickness of the composite material 100A-C. For example,
      a composite material that is approximately 2-2.5mm thick may be
      fabricated using large particles 106 approximately 220
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] in size. Similarly, thin composite films may
      be made using large particles 106 that have smaller dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In one embodiment, the size range for the intermediate
      particles 104 is calculated such that the range of intermediate
      particle sizes is separated by a common factor from the size range
      for the smallest particles 102 and the size range for the large
      particles 106. For example, when using 50 nm small particles 102
      and 50 [mu][iota][tau][iota] large particles 106, the ratio of the
      large particle size to the small particle sizes is 1000. To
      determine the size range of the intermediate particles 104, the
      square root of 1000 (approximately 31 .6) is used as factor to
      determine an intermediate particle size of approximately 1 .58
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] (i.e. 50 nm x 31 .6 or 50
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] / 31 .6). In other embodiments, the size
      range for the intermediate particles 104 may be closer to the size
      range of the large particles 106 or closer to the size range of
      the small particles 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The ceramic particles 102-106 within each desired size
      distribution may be purchased commercially, or alternately,
      produced by milling large ceramic particles into the desired
      sizes. In various embodiments, the distribution of particle sizes
      may be optimized by using formulas similar to those used in
      various concrete or explosive manufacturing processes. In
      addition, the ceramic particles may be sintered before use.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] By way of example and not limitation, the composite
      material 100A may contain a trimodal distribution of ceramic
      particles consisting of <br>
      BaTiO3 large particles 106 having diameters between about 40
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] and about 220 [mu][iota][tau][iota], BaTiO3
      intermediate particles 104 with diameters between about 500 nm and
      about 5 [mu][iota][tau][iota]. and small particles 102 composed of
      BaTiO3 or BST with diameters less than about 500 nm. In one
      embodiment, the smallest particles may have diameters of
      approximately 2 nm or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Preferably, the ratio of each size distribution as well as
      the volume fraction for each particle size is calculated to
      achieve the highest packing factor and to minimize the volume of
      the polymer binder 108 within the composite materials 100A-C. As
      used herein, the volume fraction refers to the volume of a
      constituent (e.g. particle(s) or polymer) divided by the volume of
      all the constituents of the mixture. For example, in one
      embodiment of the composite material 100A, having a trimodal
      distribution of particles, the ratio of the large particles 106,
      the intermediate particles 104, and the small particles 102,
      respectively, is approximately 65:25:10 wherein the large
      particles constitute the largest proportion of the composite mass
      and volume. In another example, ratios of approximately 65-80 %
      large particles, approximately 15-20% intermediate particles, and
      approximately 5-15% small particles may be used. While any other
      ratio may be used, it is desirable that the ratios for the
      distribution of particles is determined based on the sizes of the
      particles and the void fraction for each distribution of the
      particles. As such, the largest particles 106 typically have the
      largest proportion of the mass and volume, while the
      intermediately sized particles have the second largest proportion.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In various other embodiments, the composite material may be
      composed of particles within a single size range as shown in FIG.
      1 C, or the composite material may have a bimodal distribution of
      particles as shown in FIG. 1 B. Other distributions, including
      quadmodal or greater may be used. Further, the sizes of the
      particles used in forming the composite materials need not be in
      "adjacent" size ranges. For example, a composite material may be
      formed using a mixture of large particles 106 and small particles
      102, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In various embodiments, the surfaces of the ceramic
      particles 102- 106 are functionalized to increase the direct
      bonding between the particles and the polymer binder. There are a
      multitude of ways in which the surface can be functionalized. For
      example, each particle 102-106 may be functionalized by
      hydroxylating the surface 300 to introduce a hydroxyl (-OH) group
      302, as shown in FIGS. 5A-C. The hydroxyl groups 302 may be
      introduced by treating the particles102- 106 with hydrogen
      peroxide; however, any other suitable method for hydroxylating the
      particle surfaces without unduly modifying the particles may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Once the surfaces of the ceramic particles 102-106 have
      been hydroxylated, silanes and zirconates, for example, may be
      used to functionalize the surface of the ceramic particles. By way
      of example, and not limitation, a heated solution of a
      silane-based polymeric precursor 304, such as the byproduct of
      vinyltrimethoxysilane and water, 306 may function as both a
      surface treatment to functionalize and bond directly to the
      particle surfaces and a binding material to form a highly
      cross-linked structure 308 between all of the ceramic surfaces
      102-106.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Polymer Binder</b><br>
      <br>
      [0051] The polymer binder 108 may be any dielectric polymer,
      including but not limited to cyanate esters or polycyanurates.
      Preferably, the polymer binder 108 is a polymer material that can
      be irreversibly cured, although other polymer materials may be
      used. The polymer binder 108 may also be any polymer or polymer
      precursor that, preferably, has a small molecular size, is capable
      of binding directly to the particle surfaces, and is capable of
      forming highly cross-linked polymer networks. Alternately, other
      embodiments may use polymers or polymer precursors that do not
      necessarily have these characteristics. These include gelling
      polymers and cellulose-based polymers, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In one embodiment, the polymer binder 108 is formed from a
      polymeric precursor that is polymerized in-situ to bind directly
      to the ceramic particles 102-106. In other embodiments, the
      polymer binder 108 is formed from the melting of a gelling
      polymeric precursor, such as agar, that swells in the presence of
      certain solvents, such as water. In these embodiments, the polymer
      binder 108 is formed when the mixture of the gelling polymeric
      precursor, the solvent, and the particles 102-106 is cooled and
      the solvent is removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Preferably, the polymer binder 108 or polymeric precursors
      do not contain metal particles. A composite material having a
      non-metallic polymer matrix allows for higher breakdown voltages
      and a longer life span of the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] When using a polymeric precursor, the polymer precursor is
      mixed with the distribution of ceramic particles 102-106 and
      allowed to penetrate through the distribution to contact the
      surface of each of the particles. For example, a silane-based
      polymer precursor, such as a trialkoxysilane and more specifically
      vinyltrimethoxysilane, tnethoxyvinylsilane,
      aminopropytriethoxysilane, or combinations thereof, may be used to
      form the polymer binder 108. In addition, other silane, zirconate
      or titanate-based coupling agents or polymer precursors that
      polymerize to form polysilsesquioxanes may be used. Preferably,
      the polymer precursors have physical and chemical characteristics
      that allow them to penetrate through the mixture to the particle
      surfaces 300 and to bind directly to the surfaces of the particles
      102-106. Preferably, the polymer precursor has a viscosity low
      enough to flow between the ceramic particles and coat the particle
      surfaces 300. Under pressure and optionally, heat, applied during
      formation of the composite materials 100A-E, the polymer binder
      108 and/or the polymeric precursor penetrates the nanometer and
      sub-nanometer level imperfections on the ceramic particle surfaces
      300. The polymer binder 104 therefore eliminates any air voids at
      the surface boundaries of the particles 102-106. By way of example
      and not limitation, silane, titanate, and/or zirconate-based
      polymeric precursors are used to facilitate direct binding between
      the ceramic particle surfaces 300 and to form the highly
      cross-linked polymer matrix, such as the matrix 308. [0055] In
      various embodiments, the dielectric constant of the final
      composite material 100A-E can be optimized for use based upon the
      selected polymer binder 104. In one example, a desirable
      silane-based polymeric precursor has a silane concentration higher
      than typical silane-based polymer precursors such that there is no
      need for an additional coupling agent to bind the inorganic
      ceramic particles 102-106. The elimination of extraneous binding
      additives, such as additional polymeric<br>
      macromolecules further improves the ceramic packing factor,
      thereby increasing the dielectric constant of the composite
      materials 100A-E.<br>
      [0056] In one embodiment, the polymer binder 108 is composed of a
      cyanoresin. The cyanoresin binder will yield a composite material
      100A-E, having a dielectric constant that may vary from between
      about 10 to about 55 at a frequency of hundreds of MHz. For
      example, the polymer binder may be a commercially available
      product such as CR-S manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd
      of Tokyo, Japan. CR-S is a cyanoethylated cellulose polymer having
      a high dielectric constant, good strength and is machinable.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another embodiment, the dielectric constant of the
      composite materials 100A-E is increased by using a gelling
      polymeric precursor, preferably agarose, which is typically in the
      form of agar. The gelling polymer may be a biopolymer that is
      naturally derived or synthetically produced. The gelling polymeric
      precursor is melted in a solvent and compacted into a composite
      mold with the distribution of ceramic particles 102-106. The
      composite mold is then cooled under pressure allowing the gelling
      polymeric precursor to swell in the presence of the solvent. The
      composite mold is subsequently reheated to a temperature below the
      melting temperature of the polymeric precursor to remove the
      solvent, thereby forming the polymer binder 108. As a result, the
      volume of the polymer binder 108 is reduced from that of the
      previously swollen polymeric precursor without changing the
      overall structure of the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The reduced volume of the polymer binder 108 may create
      voids or cavities around the ceramic particles 102-106. A
      dielectric liquid is then impregnated within the composite
      material to fill and displace all of the cavities or voids within
      the composite material and to surround the surfaces 300 of the
      ceramic particles 102-106. Other polymeric precursors may also be
      used, including gelatin, carrageen, or any other precursor for a
      polymer binder 108 that will swell in the presence of the solvent
      but will not absorb and swell in the presence of the dielectric
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Dielectric Liquid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0059] The dielectric liquid is a filler fluid that may be
      impregnated into the composite material to penetrate into and fill
      any remaining voids within the composite material. The dielectric
      fluid also coats, at the nanometer and sub-nanometer level, any
      exposed surfaces 300 of the ceramic particles. The addition of the
      dielectric liquid can increase both the dielectric constant and
      the dielectric strength of the composite by displacing voids in
      the material, reducing the porosity of the composite material, and
      enhancing the boundary interface of the ceramic particles. The
      dielectric fluid can be impregnated into the formed composite
      material by submerging the material in the dielectric fluid. The
      dielectric fluid may further infuse into the composite material
      via capillary action alone, or may be forced into the material
      with the aid of a vacuum or other pressurized system.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In one embodiment, the dielectric fluid has a high
      dielectric constant. For example, the high dielectric constant may
      be, but is not limited to, water, glycerine, and alkylene
      carbonates such as ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate,
      glycerine carbonate, butylene carbonate, and combinations thereof.
      Conversely, a dielectric fluid having a low dielectric constant
      may be used to increase the dielectric strength of the composite
      while, to a lesser extent, increasing the dielectric constant of
      the composite material. Example dielectric fluids having low
      dielectric constants include oils, such as those used in
      electrical insulators. Preferably, the dielectric liquid has a
      high dielectric constant, low viscosity, low dielectric losses,
      and a low evaporation rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The dielectric fluid may be impregnated into composite
      materials formed by the in-situ polymerization of the polymer
      binder, as well as those formed from the gelling polymeric
      precursor. In addition, composite materials that are infused with
      the dielectric liquid may optionally be coated with any suitable
      gas-impermeable material to prevent or reduce evaporation of the
      dielectric liquid. For example, the composite material may be
      coated with silane, titanate, and/or zirconate-based polymers.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In another embodiment, a composite material having a
      dielectric constant of approximately 100 at frequencies between
      100 and 1000 MHz may be made using silane, titanate, and zirconate
      chemicals that form polysilsesquioxanes after in-situ
      polymerization. The polymer precursors containing these compounds
      and the resulting polysilsesquioxanes have a small molecule size
      and are suitable for binding directly with the ceramic particle
      surface and forming highly cross-linked polymer networks.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In yet another embodiment, a composite material having a
      dielectric constant of approximately 550 at frequencies between
      100 and 1000 MHz may be made using a gelling polymeric precursor
      that swells in the presence of water. Preferably, the gelling
      polymeric precursor swells in the presence of water but not in the
      presence of alkylene carbonates. Further, the preferred gelling
      polymeric precursor can be melted before mixing with the ceramic
      particles 102-106, has a high strength when dried, has a high
      melting temperature, and is a biomaterial.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fabricating the Composite Material</b><br>
      <br>
      [0064] As previously described, the ceramic particles 102-106 may
      be obtained commercially or may be formed during a milling
      process. In one embodiment, where the ceramic particles are formed
      by milling, a solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone is used to
      prevent agglomeration of the particles. Additional solvents,
      including but not limited to acetone, methyl propyl ketone,
      polymethylmethacrylate, or dichloromethylene may also be used. In
      addition, a surfactant may be added to the milling process to
      prevent agglomeration. By way of example and not limitation, the
      surfactant may be oleic acid, alkylbenzene-sulfonic acid, or
      phosphate ester. Preferably, the surfactant is a polar additive.
      In addition, the surfactant may act to functionalize the surfaces
      of the ceramic particles to enhance bonding with the polymer
      binder. [0065] In various embodiments, the ceramic particles may
      be sintered to produce hardened particles before mixing with the
      polymeric precursors or binders. The sintered particles have
      reduced porosity which will decrease voids within the particles,
      increase the particle packing fraction of the particles, and
      prevent or at least minimize the infiltration of the polymeric
      precursors or binders into the particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one embodiment, a mixture of the ceramic particles and a
      polymer precursor containing silane, titanate, or zirconate, such
      as vinyltrimethoxysilane or triethoxyvinylsilane, is further mixed
      with water and prepared at a light boil while stirring. For
      example, the mixture may be prepared at a temperature between
      about 100[deg.]C and about 200[deg.]C. Heating the mixture
      increases the rate at which the surfaces of the ceramic particles
      are functionalized and increases the rate of formation for the
      polysilsesquioxane network.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The composite material is further formed by dry pressing in
      a die to shape the material. For example, a paste composed of the
      ceramic particles 102-106, the polymer precursors, and any
      surfactants are pressed in a die. Typically, the die is pressed
      using mechanical or hydraulic means to compact the paste to the
      shape of the die. In other embodiments, the composite material may
      be formed by isostatic pressing, where the paste is isostatically
      pressed using a flexible membrane acting as a mold. While pressing
      the composite paste is the preferred method of fabrication, the<br>
      composite materials may also be formed by spin coating or solution
      casting.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In various embodiments, the composite material is pressed
      at a pressure from about 100 pound per square inch (PSI) to well
      over 30 metric tons per square inch. The composite material 100
      may be formed by bidirectional orunidirectional pressing
      technique, although other pressing techniques may be used. In one
      embodiment, bidirectional pressing eliminates a density gradient
      that may form in the composite material and provides a uniform
      dielectric constant throughout the composite material. Conversely,
      if a gradient density is desired, the density of particles can be
      varied throughout the composite material by implementing a
      unidirectional pressing process to fabricate the composite
      material. [0069] Subsequent to or concurrent with pressing the
      paste, the die may be heated to facilitate in-situ polymerization
      of the polymer precursors, thereby forming the polymer binder 104.
      In other embodiments, the polymer precursors may be polymerized or
      cured using ultraviolet (UV) radiation or by the addition of a
      catalyst to bring about chemical polymerization. In one
      embodiment, the polymer binder 108 binds directly to the surface
      of the ceramic particles 102-106 and forms a highly-crosslinked
      structure. As such, there is no need for additional polymers to
      function as binders.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In various embodiments, the dielectric fluid having a high
      dielectric constant is added after polymerization of the polymer
      precursor to fill any voids that may remain between the polymer
      binder 108 and ceramic particles 102-106. In particular, the
      filler liquid improves the boundary interface at the nanometer and
      sub-nanometer level on the surface 300 of the ceramic particles
      102-106.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The final composite materials may be coated to prevent the
      evaporation of an infused dielectric liquid and to reduce the
      porosity of the composite material. The composite materials may
      then be cut, machined, and or sanded to the desired size.
      Additional finishing may include the addition of one or more
      electrodes to the final composite material. By way of example, the
      electrodes may be platinum, gold, or any suitable conducting
      material. In one embodiment, the electrodes are sputtered directly
      onto the composite material to eliminate any air gaps between the
      electrodes and the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In various embodiments, the in-situ polymerization process
      allows for particle packing factors of at least 80% to be achieved
      and correspondingly higher dielectric constants to be observed.
      The in-situ polymerization process also allows the loss tangent
      and the dielectric constant to be simultaneously tuned to desired
      requirements as determined by the final application of the
      composite material 100. The polysilsesquioxane used to bind the
      matrix of particles eliminates the need for a high viscosity
      polymer and epoxy to bind the particles. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Composite Material</b><br>
      <br>
      [0073] Examples of machined high dielectric constant composite
      materials are shown in FIGS. 6-9. As shown in FIG. 6, the
      composite materials 100A-E may be cut and machined into a solid
      disc 400. A ruler 402 is depicted to provide a sense of scale;
      however, the composite materials may be fabricated to any size and
      configuration. FIG. 7 is a photograph of a composite material that
      has been machined into substrate 500 for receiving additional
      elements. FIGS. 8A depicts a composite material that has been
      machined into a number of annular discs 600A-G. As shown in FIG.
      8B, the annular discs 600A-G may be mounted onto a rod 602 and
      secured together by fasteners 604A-B. FIG. 9 depicts a composite
      material that has been fabricated as a disc 700. In addition,
      single thin layer sheets or multiple-layer composite capacitors
      may also be fabricated using the high dielectric composite
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] As shown in FIG. 10, a profile 1000 of the dielectric
      constant for a composite material having an average dielectric
      constant of approximately 100 actually varies from approximately
      108 to approximately 90 or +/-10% over a frequency range from 200
      MHz to 4.5 GHz. As shown, a profile 1002 of the loss tangent over
      the entire frequency range is less than 0.12 and below 500 MHz,
      the loss tangent is less than 0.05. As previously described, the
      loss tangent and dielectric constant may be predetermined by the
      selected particle mixture, the heat and pressure applied during
      fabrication, and the period over which the heat and pressure are
      applied. In one embodiment, a loss tangent below 0.08 at 2 GHz has
      been achieved, while in other embodiments, loss tangents less than
      0.001 are possible. The low loss tangent significantly expands the
      variety of applications for using the high dielectric constant
      composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The range of dielectric constants and loss tangents for a
      composite material having an average dielectric constant of
      approximately 45 is shown in FIG. 1 1 . As shown, the profile 1
      100 of the dielectric constant varies from approximately 49 to
      approximately 39 over the frequency range from 200 MHz to 4.5 GHz.
      The profile 1 102 of the loss tangent over the entire frequency
      range is less than 0.14 and below 500 MHz, the loss tangent is
      less than 0.08. FIG. 12 depicts the profile 1200 of the dielectric
      constant range and loss tangent range for a composite material
      having a peak dielectric constant of approximately 550. As shown,
      the dielectric constant varies from approximately 550 to
      approximately 400 over the frequency range from 200 MHz to 4.5
      GHz. The profile 1202 of the loss tangent over the entire
      frequency range is less than 0.35 and below 500 MHz, the loss
      tangent is less than approximately 0.125. It is believed that the
      actual dielectric constant of the composite materials, as shown in
      FIGS. 10-12 may be approximately 10% higher than shown due, in
      part, to imperfections in the methods of measurement and surface
      imperfections in the tested composite materials and the testing
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In operation, the electric field of the high dielectric
      constant composite materials has been found to be in the range of
      about 1 -1 .84 MV/cm for single breakdowns. With variations to the
      mixing techniques, as disclosed herein, the electric field
      breakdown characteristics can be improved to well over 4 MV/cm, in
      some embodiments. Therefore, the high dielectric constant
      composite materials may have an energy storage density of over 200
      J/cm&lt;3&gt; and up to 1000 J/cm&lt;3&gt;. In one embodiment, the
      high dielectric constant composite material has an energy density
      at room<br>
      temperature of approximately 20 J/cm&lt;3&gt;. As such, low loss
      capacitors, either single layer or multilayer, can be fabricated
      using the in situ polymerization process disclosed herein.
      Further, the composite material has been produced having a
      dielectric constant over 550 at 200 MHz and as high as 56000 at 20
      KHz.<br>

      400, 500, 600A-G, and 700 are suitable for a variety of
      applications, including but not limited to antennas, capacitors,
      high-energy storage devices, and high-voltage insulators. The high
      frequency properties of the high dielectric constant composite
      materials make them an ideal material for radio frequency and
      microwave transmission components, including but not limited to
      antennas and microwave substrates. The high dielectric constant
      materials can also be used for tuning microwave cavities, high
      energy density capacitors, and high frequency capacitors. By way
      of example and not limitation, the high dielectric composite
      material is suitable for use in high power antennas. As such, the
      size of dielectric loaded antennas can be minimized by
      incorporating the high dielectric constant composite materials of
      the present disclosure. In particular, the composite materials may
      be incorporated into helical antennas, dielectric resonator
      antennas, or any antenna which may benefit from and whose
      dimensions may be reduced because of the inclusion of the
      composite material. For example, according to one embodiment,
      antennas incorporating the high dielectric constant composite
      disclosed herein may be fabricated with a six to ten-fold
      reduction in size. In other embodiments, the antennas
      incorporating the high dielectric constant composite material may
      be reduced even further to dimensions approaching the
      Chu-Harrington limit (Chu-limit).<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Typically, one or more dimensions of an antenna are a
      function of the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave propagating
      in the antenna material. As such, the antenna size for a given
      frequency is approximately proportional to one over the square
      root of the dielectric constant. In another aspect, the composite
      material 100 can be used to fabricate antennas, including
      broadband antennas, approximately one- tenth the size or less of
      conventional antennas that use an air dielectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In addition to antennas, the composite material may be used
      to improve the function and shrink the dimensions of conventional
      capacitors.<br>
      Capacitance between two points is proportional to the dielectric
      constant of the material separating those two points. By
      incorporating a composite material with a high dielectric
      constant, the area of the electrodes required for a given
      capacitance is reduced in proportion to the increase in the
      dielectric constant over a conventional dielectric. Therefore,
      capacitors incorporating the high dielectric constant composite
      material can be made more compact than traditional capacitors.
      Additionally, the energy stored in a capacitor increases by the
      square of the voltage across it. By incorporating the high
      dielectric constant material with a high dielectric strength
      compared to traditional high dielectric constant ceramic
      materials, the energy capable of being stored in the same volume
      is increased by the square of the increase of the dielectric
      strength over the conventional high dielectric constant material.
      Since the energy density of a capacitor is proportional to the
      dielectric constant and the square of the electric field within
      the dielectric, the energy density in capacitors incorporating the
      composite material with a high dielectric constant and a high
      dielectric strength can be orders of magnitude greater than those
      achieved with conventional low dielectric constant materials and
      conventional high dielectric constant ceramics.<br>
      [0080] The composite materials may also be incorporated into high-
      voltage insulators. The composite materials allow for greater
      control and field shaping of electrical fields. Field shaping may
      further allow the dimensions of the insulators, in particular the
      length, to be greatly decreased.<br>

      </b><b>High Dielectric Constant Composite Material Preparation
        Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0081] By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary method
      used to prepare the high dielectric constant composite material
      with a verified dielectric constant of between about 75-140 at
      frequencies ranging between 200 MHz and 4.5 GHz is provided.
      Initially, approximately 250 ml of water and 250 ml of
      triethoxyvinylsilane were poured into an open beaker in a fume
      hood. The liquids were mixed with a magnetic stirrer at a
      temperature just below the boiling point of the mixture. The
      mixture was removed from the heat source and stirring was
      suspended when the mixture became miscible.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The solution was cooled to room temperature for immediate
      use. Alternately, the solution may be chilled for long-term
      storage. While the solution was cooling to room temperature, a
      mixture of ceramic powder was prepared. The mixture was composed
      of 65 wt% BaTiO3 particles with diameters between 65
      [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 150 [mu][iota][tau][iota], 25 wt% BaTiO3
      particles with diameters between 0.5 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 3
      [mu][iota][tau][iota], and 10 wt% BaTiO3 and BST particles with
      diameters less than 100 nm. The ceramic powder was mixed with a
      mixer mill for approximately two minutes. Caution was exercised to
      avoid excessive mixing time that could have resulted in milling
      the larger particles down to smaller sizes.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The miscible solution cooled to room temperature was added
      to the powder mixture, while manually stirring. The miscible
      solution was added until a paste formed. The paste had a light
      consistency but was viscous enough to hold its shape. The paste
      was then placed in a dry pressing die and packed lightly to ensure
      an even distribution of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The die was placed on a lab press stand and the press was
      activated to apply force to the top and the bottom pistons of the
      die assembly.<br>
      Approximately, 30 metric tons per square inch was applied to the
      die. The force was applied to the die, while any excess fluid that
      emerged from the die was removed. While, the force was still
      applied, the die was heated to a temperature of approximately
      100[deg.] F by a heating element.<br>
      [0085] The temperature of the die was held at the desired level
      for approximately thirty minutes, and then the heating element was
      deactivated, while the die and pressed composite were allowed to
      cool to room temperature. After cooling, the composite was removed
      from the die, machined, and sanded to the desired dimensions.
      Lastly, electrodes were applied to the composite material 100 and
      a number of tests were performed to determine the dielectric
      constant and loss tangent of the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0086] By way of example and not limitation, another exemplary
      method is provided for producing a composite material with a
      dielectric constant between 400 and 600 at frequencies between 200
      MHz and 4.5 GHz. Initially, a mixture of perovskite ceramic
      particles was prepared. The mixture was composed of 72 wt% BaTiO3
      particles with diameters between 65 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 150
      [mu][iota][tau][iota], 21 wt% BaTiO3 particles with diameters
      between 0.5 [mu][iota][tau][iota] and 3 [mu][iota][tau][iota], and
      7 wt% BaTiO3 and BST particles with diameters less than 100 nm.
      The ceramic powder was mixed with a mixer mill for approximately
      two minutes. Caution was exercised to avoid excessive mixing that
      could have resulted in milling the larger particles down to
      smaller sizes.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Agar, primarily as agarose, was used as the polymer binder.
      While, stirring, the agar was heated and melted at a high
      concentration in water. While heated, the agar and water solution
      was slowly added to and mixed with the ceramic particles in a
      pre-heated container. The mixture was then heated and pressed in a
      pre-heated die. After pressing, the compacted composite material
      was allowed to cool while still under pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The agar within the composite material was further dried by
      heating the compacted composite material to temperature below the
      melting temperature of the agar binder, thereby allowing any
      remaining water to evaporate. The agar binder, no longer swollen
      with water, had a reduced volume, thereby creating a number of
      channels within the composite material. Despite the reduction in
      volume of the polymer binder, the structural integrity of the
      highly packed ceramic particles prevents the overall structure of
      the composite material from contracting. The composite material
      was then impregnated w<a name="us7390984"></a>ith a dielectric
      fluid to fill any voids that remained between the polymer binder
      and ceramic particle surfaces by submerging the composite in the
      dielectric fluid. The dielectric fluid was a mixture of akylene
      carbonates consisting of 50% ethylene carbonate and 50% propylene
      carbonate.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>High power liquid dielectric switch</b><br>
      <br>
      Method and apparatus for switching high power at high repetition
      rates. The apparatus is preferably a switch utilizing a
      pressurized flowing dielectric. The pressurized dielectric
      suppresses growth of dielectric breakdown byproducts, such as
      large bubbles and breakdown contamination, enabling lower
      dielectric flow rates to remove the byproducts. In addition to the
      advantage of lower flow rates, and thus smaller and lighter
      pumping means, the switch can switch high energies (up to
      megajoules) at fast repetition rates, up to thousands of pulses
      per second. The switch is preferably triggered to reduce jitter.
      The switch can also be used to remove water from oil.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>[0003] 1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention relates to a high power electric
      switch which has an ultra short rise time and can be fired at a
      repetition rate from less than a pulse per second to more than
      20,000 pulses per second and can switch joules to megajoules of
      energy per pulse with switch rise times of less than a nanosecond,
      yet switch pulse widths ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] 2. Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Note that the following discussion is given for more
      complete background of the scientific principles and is not to be
      construed as an admission that such concepts are prior art for
      patentability determination purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Large scale pulse power systems, such as accelerators,
      fusion accelerators, medical accelerators, high power microwave
      systems, and other high voltage or pulse power systems require the
      switching of very high power (megawatt) loads, for example from
      one Joule to megajoules per pulse, and high repetition rates, for
      example from less than one pulse per second to 20,000 pulses per
      second. Early studies at moderate pressures have shown breakdown
      strength in liquids to be a function of pressure up to at least
      350 psi (see K. C. Kao and J. B. Higham, "The effects of
      hydrostatic pressure, temperature, and voltage duration on the
      electric strengths of hydrocarbon liquids," J. Electrochem. Soc.,
      vol. 108, no. 6, pp. 522-528, June 1961). Pressurized flowing
      dielectric switches which can switch several hundred kilovolts are
      known in the art. However, such switches which operate at or near
      atmospheric pressure require substantial dielectric flow rates of
      10-1000 liters per second (l/sec) when they are used to switch
      multikilojoule pulses. In 1992, subnanosecond rise time, kilohertz
      rep-rate oil switches were built and demonstrated that could
      operate at up to 290 kV at 200 pps and at 170 kV with a rep-rate
      of 1000 pps. The demonstrated rise time into a 97 [Omega]
      resistive load was 280 ps. The modulator system, which utilized
      near atmospheric medium pressure oil switches, transferred a peak
      energy of 50 J per pulse (R. Curry et al., "The Development and
      Testing of Subnanosecond-Rise, Kilohertz Oil Switches for The
      Generation of High-Frequency Impulses", IEEE Transactions on
      Plasma Science, Vol. 20, No. 3, June 1992, pp. 383-392,
      incorporated herein by reference) and demonstrated significant
      improvement in the breakdown jitter of liquid switches. These oil
      switches utilized transformer oil at pressures ranging from 1
      atmosphere up to 100 psig. The flow rate geometries used in the
      switches included cross flow, or axial flow in switches that had a
      near uniform and enhanced electrode geometry. However, these
      switches were unable to switch kilojoules of energy for they were
      limited by residual bubbles at a flow rate of 1.6-7.57 l/sec at a
      repetition rate of over 100 pulses per second (pps).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Single-shot work on high pressure liquid switches examined
      the effects of pressure upon breakdown voltage (see J. Leckbee, R.
      Curry, K. McDonald, R. Cravey, and A. Grimmis, "An advanced model
      of a high pressure liquid dielectric switch for directed energy
      applications," in Proc. IEEE 14th Int'l. Pulse Power Conf., 2003,
      pp. 1389-1393, and J. Leckbee, R. Curry, K. McDonald, P. Norgard,
      R. Cravey, G. Anderson and S. Heidger, "Design and testing of a
      high pressure, rep-rate, liquid dielectric switch for directed
      energy applications," in Proc. IEEE 26th Int'l. Power Modulator
      Conf., 2004, pp. 193-196).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] When a high voltage pulse is applied to a flowing
      dielectric switch, once the switch breakdown voltage is reached, a
      streamer is launched and subsequent avalanche ionization and
      breakdown of the dielectric results. The arc then ionizes the
      dielectric medium and a gas bubble is formed between the
      electrodes. As the hydraulic or hydrostatic pressure is increased,
      the bubble size decreases. It is known that above a critical
      pressure for certain liquids, no bubbles are formed by charge
      injection (R. Kattan et al., "Formation of Vapor Bubbles in
      Non-polar Liquids Initiated by Current Pulses", IEEE Transactions
      on Electrical Insulation Vol. 26, No. 4, August 1991, pp 656-662,
      incorporated herein by reference). However, below a given
      operating or critical pressure the diameter of the bubble expands
      well beyond the electrode separation distance. The gas bubble
      grows and subsequently collapses, oscillating, until it finally
      rapidly degenerates into both suspended micro-bubbles and
      discharge byproducts (principally hydrocarbons) that encompass a
      large volume, if not the entirety, of the switch housing and
      electrode region.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Liquid dielectric insulated switches cannot sustain high
      voltages when gas bubbles, dissolved gases, and hydrocarbon
      byproducts are present because arcing or pre-firing is
      uncontrollably self-initiated. This also prevents recovery of the
      switch if voltage were reapplied before the entire volume of
      liquid in the switch could be exchanged, thus reducing the
      required achievable repetition rate because of the enormous liquid
      flow rates that would otherwise be required. Consequently, the
      repetition rate attainable by present day low-pressure liquid
      dielectric switches which transfer 100 J-1 MJ is typically limited
      to much less than one pulse per second, thereby eliminating them
      from addressing the high average power requirements of many
      crucial applications. This phenomenon occurs in all known liquid
      dielectric media suitable for pulse power switching applications,
      including water, water-glycol solutions, transformer oil,
      polyalphaolefin (PAO), and other synthetic dielectrics.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Thus there is a need for a kilovolt to megavolt capable,
      multijoule to megajoule range high power switch with high
      repetition rate operation, minimized dielectric media flow volume
      requirements with maximized local flow velocity in the vicinity of
      the electrodes; minimized electrode erosion; and reduced byproduct
      formation. There is also need for a compact switch with reduced
      acoustic impulse and a reduced EMI signature, and with enhanced
      reliability due to the inhibition of the access and/or adherence
      of the discharge byproducts to the switch housing solid
      insulators. The ability of the switch to utilize fluids such as
      PAO or other synthetic or natural dielectrics that are compatible
      with existing airframe and aerospace systems is a major advantage,
      allowing the switch to be integrated with an existing airframe
      hydraulic system, thereby reducing the volume of support equipment
      required for directed energy systems.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION (DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] The present invention is an electric switch comprising at

      most preferably less than approximately 0.2 liters per second.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The dielectric is preferably de-aerated and preferably
      comprises a synthetic lubricant, optionally hydraulic fluid. The
      dielectric most preferably comprises polyalphaolefin (PAO). The
      distance between the at least two electrodes is preferably
      variable. Each electrode preferably has at least one opening which
      enables the dielectric to flow between an interior and exterior of
      each electrode. The dielectric preferably enters the switch cavity
      through the opening in a first electrode and exits the switch
      cavity through the opening in a second electrode. Each electrode
      is optionally substantially hemispherical. Alternatively, a first
      electrode is partially surrounded by a second electrode. The
      switch optionally comprises at least one cylindrical flow channel,
      which preferably provides a flow of the dielectric around the
      first electrode. The switch preferably comprises an outer coaxial
      return and a dielectric flow system. The dielectric flow system is
      optionally integrated with the switch, or alternatively comprises
      an airframe hydraulic system, or alternatively comprises a stand
      alone pump cart or system.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The invention is also a method for switching comprising the
      steps of providing at least two electrodes, pressurizing a liquid
      dielectric to a pressure greater than about 100 psig, flowing the
      liquid dielectric between the electrodes, inducing a voltage drop
      between the electrodes of at least a breakdown voltage of the
      dielectric, breaking down the dielectric between the electrodes,
      thereby providing an electrical path between the electrodes; and
      switching greater than approximately 1 joule. The breaking down
      step is preferably performed at a rate of at least approximately
      one pps, or more preferably at least approximately 10 pps, or even
      more preferably at least approximately 100 pps, or yet more

      preferably less than approximately 100 liters per second, or more
      preferably less than approximately 20 liters per second, or even
      more preferably less than approximately 2 liters per second, or
      most preferably less than approximately 0.2 liters per second. The
      present method is for switching preferably greater than
      approximately 50 joules, or more preferably greater than
      approximately one kilojoule, or most preferably greater than
      approximately one megajoule. The method is also for switching
      preferably greater than approximately five kilovolts, or more
      preferably greater than approximately 50 kilovolts, or even more
      preferably greater than approximately one megavolt, or most
      preferably greater than approximately 5 megavolts.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The method preferably further comprises the step of
      de-aerating the dielectric, and preferably further comprises the
      step of varying a distance between the electrodes. The dielectric
      preferably flows out of a first opening in a first electrode and
      into a second opening in a second electrode. The method preferably
      further comprises the step of partially surrounding the first
      electrode with the second electrode, wherein the dielectric is
      preferably flowed around the first electrode. The method further
      preferably comprises the step of removing breakdown contamination,
      optionally comprising bubbles, from between the electrodes. The
      method further preferably comprises the step of lowering an
      inductance of a switch comprising the electrodes and the
      dielectric, preferably by partially surrounding the switch with an
      outer coaxial return.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The invention is also an electric switch comprising at
      least two electrodes, a flowing liquid dielectric having a
      pressure greater than approximately 100 psig; and a trigger for
      operating the switch. The trigger preferably comprises an element
      selected from the group consisting of a trigatron, a laser pulse,
      a microwave pulse, and series injection. The trigatron is
      preferably disposed substantially between the electrodes. The
      trigger is alternatively operated by adjusting a pressure of the
      dielectric. The switch optionally further comprises at least one
      additive in the dielectric for reducing the dielectric strength of
      the dielectric. The switch preferably further comprises an element
      for controlling flow of said dielectric. The element is preferably
      cylindrically disposed around one of the electrodes. The switch is
      preferably capable of switching greater than approximately 1
      joule.<br>
      [0017] The invention is further a method for switching comprising
      the steps of providing at least two electrodes, pressurizing a
      liquid dielectric to a pressure greater than about 100 psig,
      flowing the liquid dielectric between the electrodes; and
      triggering a dielectric breakdown between the electrodes, thereby
      providing an electrical path between the electrodes. The method
      preferably further comprises the step of switching greater than
      approximately 1 joule. The triggering step is preferably performed
      at a desired voltage or desired time and optionally comprises
      operating a trigatron. The triggering step optionally comprises
      raising a pressure of the dielectric, thereby increasing a gap
      between the electrodes to a first gap value, providing a voltage
      difference between the electrodes, and lowering the pressure of
      the switch, thereby decreasing the gap between the electrodes to a
      second gap value. The voltage difference is preferably not large
      enough to cause dielectric breakdown at the first gap value but is
      preferably large enough to cause dielectric breakdown at the
      second gap value. The method preferably further comprises the step
      of controlling a flow of the dielectric, preferably comprising
      employing a flow shaping element.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The invention is also a method for reducing water content
      in a dielectric, the method comprising the steps of providing at
      least two electrodes, pressurizing a liquid dielectric containing
      water to a pressure greater than about 100 psig, flowing the
      liquid dielectric between the electrodes, and triggering a
      dielectric breakdown between the electrodes, thereby removing at
      least some of the water from the dielectric. The dielectric
      preferably comprises a fluid selected from the group consisting of
      a synthetic lubricant, hydraulic fluid, and polyalphaolefin (PAO).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The invention is yet further a switch comprising at least
      two electrodes, a flowing liquid dielectric having a pressure
      greater than approximately 100 psig, and a flow shaping element
      for controlling the flow of the liquid dielectric. The switch
      alternatively comprises at least two electrodes, a flowing liquid
      dielectric having a pressure greater than approximately 100 psig,
      and a dielectric additive for reducing the dielectric strength of
      the dielectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] An object of the present invention is to provide a high
      power switch capable of achieving high repetition rates.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Another object of the invention is to provide a high
      pressure oil switching technology that results in low switching
      jitter and long electrode lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] An advantage of the switch of the present invention is its
      lower dielectric flow rate, which permits the use of a small,
      lightweight flow recirculating system, and increases the
      achievable repetition rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] A further advantage is the compatibility of the present
      switch with existing hydraulic fluids and airframe hydraulic
      systems, thus optionally eliminating the need for a separate
      dielectric flow system.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] The present invention is a liquid dielectric switch able to
      switch from hundreds of kilovolts to megavolts and thousands of
      kiloamperes, with discharge times ranging from a picosecond to a
      few milliseconds or less, operated at pressures ranging from 1
      psig to 8000 psig.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As used throughout the specification and claims, "breakdown
      contamination" means discharge, carbon, hydrocarbon and/or
      electrode byproducts, byproducts, debris, debris cloud, bubbles,
      micro-bubbles, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The switch preferably uses liquid dielectric pressures on
      the order of about 10 psig, and more preferably about 50 psig, and
      more preferably about 100 psig, and most preferably about 1000
      psig or more, thereby either preventing gas bubble formation or
      dramatically reducing bubble size, which enables rapid
      reabsorption of the bubbles by the fluid. Although a bubble of
      significant size is not generated at high enough pressures, a
      debris cloud containing discharge byproducts (principally carbon
      and electrode byproducts) expands from the discharge site and, if
      not removed, eventually fills a significant portion of the switch
      volume. However, pressurization minimizes this issue, reducing the
      volume of contaminated dielectric fluid, allowing the byproducts
      to be rapidly swept out of the inter-electrode gap with a minimum
      of flow and replacing them with fresh, uncontaminated flowing
      insulating dielectric material. That is, the velocity of the
      dielectric media flow in the vicinity of the electrodes easily
      exceeds the expansion velocity of the debris cloud, thus sweeping
      the debris away from the electrodes and into a field-free region
      prior to the next charge cycle. The combination of elimination of
      the large gas bubble expansion, reabsorption of the micro-bubbles,
      and a smaller debris cloud means a dramatically lower flow rate
      may be used. This enables a switch to recover in less time when
      operated above a threshold pressure, thus enabling higher
      repetition rates and higher power operation. In addition, use of
      the present invention is advantageous over the existing art even
      in low power and/or low repetition rate applications. This is
      because of the much lower dielectric flow rate required to sweep
      bubbles and debris out from between the electrodes. Not only is
      this easier to implement, but also it enables the use of smaller,
      lower power, and lower weight pumps, which is especially
      advantageous for aerospace applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Operation of the switch of the present invention at high
      pressures preferably results in undersaturation of the flowing
      dielectric, providing an advantage over other switches known in
      the art. For de-aerated, pressurized liquid dielectrics, the gas
      desorbed by the arc breaks up into microbubbles and then is
      partially reabsorbed into the liquid dielectric on a millisecond
      time scale. The amount of gas desorbed is also significantly less
      in undersaturated solutions, facilitating much quicker voltage
      recovery of the switch. In contrast, for prior art switches which
      operate at or near atmospheric pressure, the liquid dielectrics
      are normally saturated with gas, which greatly lengthens the
      reabsorption time of the desorbed gas, and thus the recovery time
      of the switch, thereby lowering the achievable repetition rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Several electrode geometries, including but not limited to
      axial electrodes or radial electrodes, may be employed to optimize
      the flow, discharge, and electrode erosion properties of the
      switch. One preferred embodiment, an inline switch with radial
      insulator, is depicted in FIG. 1. A high voltage pulse is applied
      to input electrode 10, which is preferably supported by high
      voltage insulator 20, which is preferably designed to operate at
      high voltage and high pressures simultaneously. An electric field
      is generated between the input electrode 10 and output electrode
      30. Electrodes 10, 30 are preferably substantially hemispherical.
      Switch cavity 40 is filled with liquid dielectric at a pressure
      significantly higher than atmospheric pressure, preferably between
      about 1000 and 2000 psig. The electric field causes the liquid
      dielectric between input electrode 10 and output electrode 30 to
      break down, enabling current to flow between the electrodes,
      thereby closing the switch. The current flow and resulting plasma
      causes the high pressure dielectric to form debris comprising
      carbon and other byproducts between the electrodes. Flowing
      dielectric enters the switch through inlet 50, preferably flows
      through hollow electrodes 10, 30 in the direction indicated by the
      arrow, and exits the switch via outlet 60. The dielectric
      preferably flows through a recirculating system (not pictured),
      more fully described below. This flow sweeps the debris out from
      the center of the electrodes. The breakdown voltage of the switch
      is determined by the electrode spacing, which is preferably
      adjusted by moving output electrode 30. Output electrode 30
      preferably comprises a threaded assembly to facilitate this
      adjustment. Sight ports 70, 70' are preferably used to view and/or
      record the breakdown process and clearing time of the debris.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 2 depicts a switch of the present invention having
      coaxial switch geometry. High voltage is applied to input
      electrode 100, which are preferably designed to be replaceable.
      Output electrode 110 is isolated from input electrode 100 by the
      high pressure liquid dielectric in breakdown region 120, which is
      preferably contained by annular high pressure insulator 130. One
      or more field shapers 140 are preferably used to control the
      electric field distribution across insulator 130. Gap adjuster 150
      is preferably threaded and is preferably used to adjust the gap
      spacing between input electrode 100 and output electrode 110.
      Micro-bubbles and breakdown contaminants in the liquid dielectric
      formed by the conducting plasma, which occurs during breakdown of
      the dielectric, are swept out of breakdown region 120 by the
      flowing dielectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Multiple dielectric flow paths may be utilized. Axial flow
      dielectric preferably enters the switch through axial flow inlet
      160 and enters cavity 180 through input electrode channel 170.
      Cylindrical flow dielectric optionally enters the switch through
      cylindrical flow inlet 200 and enters cavity 180 through
      cylindrical flow channel 210. A plurality, preferably twelve, of
      cylindrical flow inlets 200 and cylindrical flow channels 210,
      preferably circumferentially arranged around the switch, and
      preferably evenly spaced, may be employed. The cylindrically
      flowing dielectric facilitates the removal from breakdown region
      120 of the carbon and other breakdown byproducts. Dielectric from
      cavity 180 exits the switch through output electrode 110 via
      dielectric outlet 190. The axial flow topology may optionally
      operate in a "jet pump" mode, whereby the axial flow dielectric
      from entering cavity 180 from channel 170 has a high enough flow
      rate so that the dielectric media surrounding the electrodes,
      optionally partly comprising dielectric entering cavity 180 from
      cylindrical flow channels 210, is "pulled" radially into gap
      cavity 180 and exits axially through outlet 190. In the jet pump
      mode the flow may be provided by the main dielectric pumping
      system or alternatively by a separate, smaller system used solely
      for pumping the axial flow dielectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Fast switching times are accomplished preferably by
      utilizing outer coaxial return 220, which is substantially
      cylindrically disposed about the switch, thereby reducing the
      overall inductance of the switch. Outer coaxial return 220 is
      preferably connected via an electric load to the output electrode
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] As depicted in the above embodiments, the liquid dielectric
      media flow may enter the gap between the electrodes either
      radially or axially, or by a combination thereof, but preferably
      exits the gap axially in order to transport the discharge the
      byproduct debris cloud into the interior of the electrode, which
      is the nearest electric field-free region, prior to application of
      the next voltage pulse. The electrodes may be hollow or may
      optionally consist of machined electrodes that allow on axis flow
      and subsequent removal of the byproducts. Porous electrode
      surfaces may optionally be used to prevent boundary layers from
      forming.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In all embodiments of the present invention, the voltage
      breakdown of the system is preferably monitored in real time. In
      order to compensate for electrode erosion, the gap spacing of the
      electrodes is preferably adjusted to increase or decrease the
      breakdown voltage until the desired value is reached. The
      adjustment system preferably comprises a mechanical or electrical
      system, preferably comprising piezoelectric actuators, and
      optionally comprising a feedback system. The adjustment can
      alternatively be made manually. The electrodes preferably comprise
      a metal or other conducting material with low erosion rates,
      including but not limited to stainless steel, tungsten composites,
      tungsten-copper matrices, single crystal tungsten, and other
      synthetic materials that have a low erosion rate. Directed flow
      electrodes that allow the flow to be reduced and direct the
      byproducts into a field free region may alternatively be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The flowing dielectric used in the high pressure switch of
      the present invention may comprise transformer oil, water,
      water-glycol mixtures, synthetic oils such as hydraulic fluid, or
      any other dielectric with desirable insulation characteristics
      which can be pressurized. Some transformer oils, which have been
      traditionally used for high voltage switches, are not compatible
      with high pressure, flowing pumping systems. Water and other
      natural or synthetic dielectrics also may freeze and require
      external heaters or separate pumping systems as well as additives
      such as antifreeze. The preferable use of synthetic lubricants in
      the present switch further enhances its capabilities because of
      these lubricants' greater voltage hold-off capability and reduced
      formation of byproducts. The tested performance of the synthetic
      fluids also increase the electric breakdown field of the switch
      allowing the electrode spacing to be reduced and lowering the
      inductance of the switch, the switch losses and the flow rate due
      to the reduced volume of liquid between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A preferred synthetic oil is polyalphaolefin (PAO), which
      has a higher flashpoint, is compatible with current airframe
      systems, and has a superior viscosity than that of transformer
      oil. The measured breakdown voltage, 1.1-1.25 MV/cm, of de-aerated
      PAO was found to be comparable or superior to that of transformer
      oils operated at pressures in the range of 1000-2000 psig. For
      various pulse charge times the breakdown field may be in the range
      of 200 kV/cm up to 10 MV/cm. The utilization of flowing
      dielectrics that are compatible with existing airframe and
      aerospace hydraulic systems (that is, fluids that are currently
      used as hydraulic fluid in airframe systems), including but not
      limited to PAO, is a novel aspect of the present invention. Such
      fluids have not been used as dielectrics in the past. The PAO
      solution both lubricates the hydraulic system and provides the
      dielectric strength required to hold off voltage and achieve the
      low inductance required by directed energy systems. In certain
      applications the switch may be directly integrated with the
      airframe hydraulic system, thus eliminating the need for a
      separate dielectric flow system, along with its attendant weight,
      complexity, and cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The switch or the present invention preferably utilizes
      electrode configurations which permit the control of the location
      of the discharge and the ability to move the discharge location to
      different areas on the electrode surface, thereby minimizing
      localized electrode erosion. These electrode configurations are
      also preferably optimized to minimize global dielectric media flow
      volume requirements while maximizing the flow velocity in the
      critical area of the electrodes, thereby rapidly sweeping the
      discharge byproducts into a field free region.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The switch also preferably comprises an integrated flow
      system and preferably utilizes a design prohibiting discharge
      byproducts from accessing and adhering to the switch housing solid
      insulators. The switch preferably is operated with a hydraulic
      recirculating dielectric media flow system, preferably comprising
      a pump for pressurization of the system and a reservoir. The pump
      may comprise an onboard hydraulic pump; alternatively an actuator
      may be used to pressurize the switch. The flow system preferably
      comprises one or more accumulators and particulate filters, which
      actively filter out carbon particle byproducts, including but not
      limited to micron sized particles, and allow continuous flow of
      the dielectric through the switch. The filters preferably include
      a particulate filter and/or a coalescing filter for removal of
      water and/or particles as desired. During normal operation of the
      switch, gases are introduced into the liquid dielectric by the arc
      and the subsequent arc byproducts. Therefore the liquid dielectric
      should preferably be de-aerated prior to and during operation of
      the switch. A de-aeration system, comprising one or more
      de-aeration stages, which consists of a vacuum pump and a
      reservoir is therefore preferably integrated into the pumping
      system. In one embodiment, the flow is preferably pulsed on and
      off to reduce the power required for the hydraulic system. This
      recirculating system may be integrated with the switch, or
      alternatively comprises either an existing on-board hydraulic
      system, such as that employed on an aircraft, or a stand alone
      pump cart or system.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In pulsed power systems, or in other systems where low
      jitter is required, a triggered switch may be used, whereby a high
      voltage or trigger pulse is applied to the switch and the switch
      self-breaks upon command. The switch may be triggered by
      application of a high voltage trigger pulse, a laser pulse, a
      microwave pulse, series injection, or other means that introduces
      UV, electron avalanches or bubbles into the electrode gap and
      results in the switch breaking down, thereby triggering the switch
      with low jitter. If an electrical pulse is used to trigger the
      switch the switch may incorporate a midplane or a third electrode,
      as in a trigatron. FIG. 16 shows trigatron 400, which is placed so
      that there is a gap between it and both electrodes. The trigatron
      may be used on either the cathode or anode side of the switch,
      depending on the switch polarity. The high voltage electrical
      pulse starts streamers in the gap and introduces UV radiation and
      an electron avalanche which triggers the switch. In this
      embodiment the gas bubble introduced into the electrode gap
      provides a dielectric mismatch and an ionization path in the high
      electric field which exists in the gap between the electrodes. The
      initiation of the avalanche and subsequent ionization of the
      dielectric triggers the switch. The operation of an untriggered
      switch has high jitter, because without a trigger breakdown may
      occur at one value in one instance, for example 100 kV, but
      another value (for example 105 kV) during a different shot. Or, if
      the voltage is held constant, the time that the switch triggers
      will vary. By triggering the switch, the exact voltage or time can
      be chosen, thus reducing jitter.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] A pressure-induced triggering scheme may also be used.
      Increasing or decreasing the pressure in the switch housing
      preferably causes an increase and/or decrease in electrode gap
      spacing. For example, increasing fluid pressure expands insulator
      130, which expands output electrode 110 thereby increasing the gap
      between the electrodes. So one method may be to increase the
      pressure, charge up switch, and remove the pressure, at which
      point the electrodes get closer, and switch closes (breakdown
      occurs). This technique can be used to trigger the switch as well
      as adjust the breakdown voltage of the gap due to the variation in
      gap spacing.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It may also be desirable for oil additives to be added to
      reduce the dielectric strength of the liquid, enabling larger
      electrode gap spacing and increasing voltage hold-off. In general,
      examples of these additives include but are not limited to
      nanoparticles, solids, liquids, or any additive that can influence
      the breakdown behavior of the high pressure liquid dielectric.<br>
      <br>

      produces a 70 ns pulse. The switch was designed for the following

      jitter: &lt;&lt;50 ns; repetition rate: 50-150 pps; pulse width
      (duration): 50-500 ns; and lifetime: 10&lt;7&gt; -10&lt;8 &gt;
      pulses. These parameters were chosen because these are the
      requirements specified for potential directed energy systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The switch incorporated adjustable electrodes, allowing the
      electrode separation to be adjusted from 0.1 to 1 cm. Optical
      viewports were also integrated with the design allowing both the
      framing and high speed camera diagnostics to be integrated into
      the test stand, for characterization of bubble formation and
      byproduct expansion velocity. The single shot switch of the
      present example typically switched a 100 ns, 270-325 kV, 100 kA
      pulse into a 1.6 [Omega] load, with an energy per pulse delivered
      to the load of approximately 1 kJ. A graph of switching voltage
      vs. time for one experiment is shown in FIG. 3A. Both transformer
      oil and synthetic lubricants, such as PAO, were used in the
      experiments. For a 0.2 cm electrode gap the calculated arc
      inductance of the switch was 3 nH (15 nH/cm*0.2 cm). For a 1.6
      [Omega] discharge load the 10-90% inductive rise time of the
      switch was 3.8 ns, while the calculated 10-90% risetime of the
      switch was 10-11 ns, which is an order of magnitude less than the
      risetime for the rest of the circuit (thus the switch was not the
      limiting factor). The electrodes comprised a copper tungsten
      composite (K3); however, any conductive material may be used. The
      electrodes had a diameter of 3.81 cm (1.5 inches), although other
      sizes and/or shapes may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] High speed optical diagnostics were used to observe the
      formation of bubbles and other byproducts. FIG. 3B graphs the
      radius of the region containing carbon byproducts vs. time after
      pulse at 2000 psig, showing that this region expands rapidly for
      about the first two milliseconds, with a modest expansion velocity
      of about 12.5 cm/s after that. This indicates that a 300 kV switch
      for use at or near this pressure, which can switch kilojoules of
      energy per pulse with a repetition rate of 100 pps, requires only
      a modest flow rate of 1-2 l/sec, which is almost a factor of 10
      reduction from the atmospheric pressure switches known in the
      prior art. Concurrently the rise time of such a switch pulse
      charged in 1-1.2 microseconds will have a rise time of 10-11
      nanoseconds or less, and allow kilojoules per pulse to be
      transferred at 100-200 pps. In addition, high speed photography
      showed that the bubbles and byproducts were swept out of the
      inter-electrode region in a short enough time to enable a
      repetition rate of at least hundreds of pulses per second. Thus
      the technology is scaleable to the goal of 1 MV and 100 pps
      operation, since only a modest 3-7 l/sec flow-rate will be
      required for such a switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Experiments were conducted from atmospheric pressure up to
      13.8 MPa (2000 psig). The voltage breakdown of the switch versus
      pressure, for a 0.2 cm electrode gap, is shown in FIG. 4A. The
      data correspond to a breakdown electric field varying between
      1.1-1.25 MV/cm. Each data point represents the statistical average
      of ten breakdowns using unconditioned electrodes. The variation,
      about +-10%, decreased to about +-6.5% after conditioning of the
      electrodes. The error bars represent one standard deviation for
      each data set at the test pressure. The curve fit shown is a
      second order polynomial least squares approximation. The data
      shown in FIG. 4A indicate that the breakdown strength increases by
      25-30% from atmospheric pressure to 10.3 MPa (1500 psig). Thus the
      use of high pressures increases the switching voltage, in
      agreement with earlier experiments. In addition, there is
      indicated an optimal pressure for which maximum voltage breakdown
      occurs. The maximum bubble radius and bubble oscillation period
      vs. pressure are shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C, clearly demonstrating
      the advantage of operating the switch at high pressures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0063] An improved high power, high pressure flowing oil switch
      for gigawatt, repetitive applications was constructed and tested.
      The switch is of the present invention is typically operated at
      test pressures to 17.24 MPa (2500 psi), flow rates to 0.72
      L.s&lt;-1 &gt; (11.4 gpm), charge voltages to -300 kV and
      discharge energies to 275 J per pulse at 20 pps. An examination of
      the electrodes after 250,000 shots with the original design led to
      the design of an insert device which resulted in higher
      performance fluid flow within the switch. The flow shaper-enhanced
      switch was tested for 150,000 shots.<br>
      [0064] Typical operating parameters are presented in Table 1. A
      cross section of the switch geometry is shown in FIG. 5. As
      illustrated in the drawing, oil flows around the cathode electrode
      and into a contoured anode throat section. The switch gap spacing
      is a function of the operating pressure and preferably increases
      with pressure. Gap spacing is preferably set to 1.02 mm, with an
      estimated error of less than +-15 [mu]m, while the switch is under
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Test Stand</b><b>Pulse Generator</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] The pulse generator used for testing the high pressure
      switch concept under repetitive pulse conditions is a 4.8 [Omega],
      70 ns water pulse forming line (PFL). The water PFL was pulse
      charged to a maximum of -300 kV in 2.5 [mu]s through a pulse
      transformer. A capacitor-based pulse modulator was used to pulse
      charge the PFL. The modulator consisted of a hydrogen thyratron, a
      capacitor bank, and a snubber network as shown in FIG. 6, although
      other circuit configurations may be used. The capacitor bank was
      charged up to 26 kV, storing 273 J. Twelve 50 [Omega] cables 15.25
      m in length were used to provide 70 ns of time-isolation between
      the PFL and the load resistor.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The charge and discharge voltages were monitored with a
      pair of D-dot probes. The probes were installed in the outer wall
      of the cylindrical metal structure that surrounds the switch. A
      liquid tight fit was made via Swagelok fittings and the output was
      fed into a passive integrator. A typical output voltage waveform
      is presented in FIG. 7 which shows a 10-90 rise time of about 16
      ns. Hydraulic Power Supply<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Hydraulic power was provided by a portable hydraulic
      pumping unit. The pump utilized generated flow rates up to 0.72
      L.s&lt;-1 &gt; at pressures in excess of 17.24 MPa. The pump had
      an adjustable stroke compensation which was used to adjust
      volumetric flow at various pressures. The oil used for test
      purposes was an electrically insulating, thermally conductive,
      synthetic olefin-based liquid (PAO).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Fluid diagnostics used on the test stand included a pair of
      analog pressure gages and various flow rate sensors. Pressure in
      and across the switch was monitored with a pair of ENFM
      bourdon-tube pressure gages that had pressure resolution to 10
      psig. Both the inlet pressure and the outlet pressure were
      recorded, however only the inlet pressure is reported herein.
      Overall volumetric flow rate was monitored in the oil return line
      with a viscosity compensated turbine sensor manufactured by Cox
      Instruments. A pair of Hedland variable area flow sensors
      monitored relative flow rates in the two oil lines that fed the
      high pressure switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] High performance filters were installed to increase the
      cleanliness of the oil both entering and leaving the switch. The
      filter elements are rated to retain more than 99.9% of particles
      0.45 [mu]m or larger that are suspended in the oil passed through
      the media. Test Results<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The high pressure switch was tested under both single shot
      and repetitive conditions over a range of pressures, flow rates
      and temperatures. The single shot work examined the statistical
      nature of breakdown voltage, electric field strength, and jitter
      under typical test conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The high pressure switch geometry is a pin in hole type
      geometry as indicated in FIG. 5. In the original geometry oil is
      forced to flow around the cathode and down through the center of
      the anode. In the present test a flow shaping element was
      introduced that reduced the cross sectional area of the oil path,
      thereby reducing turbulence and effectively eliminating eddy flows
      near the stressed region of the switch. FIG. 8 shows a cross
      section and an end view of the flow shaping element or flow
      straightener. As shown in FIG. 9, flow shaping element 500 is
      preferably disposed approximately cylindrically around input
      electrode 100. The flow straightener preferably forces the flow to
      equalize across the switch volume, preventing circulation of the
      fluid azimuthally and radially. By shaping the flow cross section,
      the flow shaper also controls the velocity of the liquid
      dielectric in the switch. The addition of two flow sections in the
      switch produces a venturi or jet pump on-axis pumping action to
      break up boundary layers or stagnation layers that are inherent to
      flowing geometries. Flow through the on-axis nozzle or orifice can
      be controlled separately or independently from the flow through
      the shell of the switch. Use of this flow element enables high
      repetition rates for the switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The gap spacing was generally set at 1.016 mm and the
      electrodes had a pressure dependent field enhancement factor of
      about 11.7 at 13.79 MPa and 11.0 at 17.24 MPa. The peak field
      stress expected at 250 kV and 13.79 MPa was approximately 2.3
      MV.cm&lt;-1&gt; . Pressure drop across the switch varied,
      depending on the flow rate, from 69 kPa (10 psi) at the lowest
      flow rates to 207 kPa (30 psi) at the highest flow rates. Single
      Shot Tests<br>
      <br>
      [0073] An analysis of the single shot switch performance was
      undertaken to define a hold-off strength for oil under test
      conditions. Tests were performed at six pressures and two
      volumetric flow rates. At each combination of pressure and flow a
      sample of 50 shots was recorded, each shot separated in time by
      greater than 45 seconds. The tests were performed using 304
      stainless steel electrodes following 140,000 shots of electrode
      break in and conditioning. The D-dot probe adjacent to the charge
      electrode was used to record the waveforms. Post-processing was
      performed to reconstruct the actual charge waveform and generate
      an electric field strength value.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Plots of the electric field strength at breakdown as a
      function of pressure for two volumetric flow rates are shown in
      FIGS. 10 and 11. The graphs show a solid line representing the
      linear least-squares fit to the data. The dashed line represents
      the boundaries of a 90% confidence interval of the data at each
      pressure. The small slope of the solid lines combined with the
      relative width of the confidence intervals suggest that the
      electric field strength at breakdown is not strongly affected by
      pressure over the range of pressures reported.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Breakdown jitter was noted earlier to be an important
      performance parameter for the high pressure switch of the present
      invention. The data plotted in FIG. 10 shows no strong correlation
      between jitter over the range of pressures reported. The 1 [sigma]
      jitter for the data reported is +-9.7% at 13.79 MPa and +-10.0% at
      17.24 MPa. Examination of the 90% confidence interval data in FIG.
      11 does show some correlation between breakdown jitter and
      pressure, with jitter decreasing as a function of pressure. The 1
      [sigma] jitter is +-11.4% at 13.79 MPa and +-8.1% at 17.24 MPa.
      These results indicate a reduction of around +-3.3% over the range
      of pressures examined. Repetition Rate Tests<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The switch was tested under repetitive conditions for
      several hundred thousand shots. The repetition rate tests were
      conducted to establish the relationship between oil pressure,
      volumetric flow rate, breakdown hold-off jitter and recovery, and
      electrode wear. Waveforms were photographed to obtain information
      about total jitter and mean breakdown electric field strength
      under various rep rates. FIG. 12 shows the results of operation at
      1 pps and at constant pressure, constant flow rate and constant
      oil temperature. The time jitter in the figure, measured from the
      leading edge of the pulse train to the trailing edge of the pulse
      train, is approximately 125 ns or 5% of the time to peak.
      Qualitative analysis of the repetition rate data over 1000 shot
      bursts indicate that jitter is within the same order of magnitude
      as the single shot jitter. The switch has been tested at up to 22
      pps and the results are nearly identical to single shot and 1 pps
      results.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Electrode lifetime tests were conducted under rep rate
      conditions. Oil pressure was generally kept around 13.79 MPa (2000
      psig), flow rates varied from 0.379 L.s&lt;-1&gt; to 0.681
      L.s&lt;-1 &gt; and temperatures were kept between 18[deg.] C. and
      32[deg.] C. Tests were performed at repetition rates between 1 pps
      and 20 pps, with the majority of the tests taking place at 15 pps
      and in 1000 shot bursts.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Repetition rate testing was performed with two distinctly
      different fluid path designs. The original switch concept had a
      geometry that resembled that shown in FIG. 5. In the interest of
      improved switching performance a second design was implemented to
      modify the oil path. The design was meant to reduce random
      swirling that was predicted by a computational fluid dynamics
      simulation of the original geometry. The flow shaper design
      featured a constrained oil path with less cross sectional area to
      increase the average oil velocity and vanes in the fluid path to
      establish a swirl-free velocity profile within the electrically
      stressed regions of the switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The original switch design was run with 304 stainless steel
      electrodes. More than 250,000 shots were taken in the course of
      this first test series. When the switch was removed from the test
      stand the discharge pattern was recorded. The discharge is
      supposed to occur within a band on the side of the pin electrode.
      The arc sites were uniformly distributed over a band that was
      approximately 1.7 cm wide. A photograph of the discharge band is
      shown in FIG. 13.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] A set of K-33 sintered copper-tungsten electrodes was
      fabricated and installed in the hopes of increased performance
      over the stainless steel electrodes. In addition to the electrode
      material change the flow shaper was installed. After less than
      4000 shots under rep rate conditions rapid increases in system
      pressure were observed during operation. The switch was removed
      and the electrodes were inspected. The wear pattern was noted to
      be very localized, showing signs consistent with spallation. The
      pressure variations observed during operation were apparently a
      result of pieces of the electrode getting caught in a down-stream
      needle valve. A photograph of the damage is shown in FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] A second set of 304 stainless steel electrodes were
      installed with the flow shaper and lifetime tests were restarted.
      After approximately 140,000 shots the single shot tests already
      reported were performed. Following the single shot tests the
      electrodes were removed. The wear pattern that had developed was
      more distinct and defined than that seen on the first 304
      stainless steel electrodes. The width of the discharge band had
      decreased by 41% to about 1.0 cm. A photograph of the wear pattern
      is shown in FIG. 15. These tests indicate that the electrode
      lifetime may be greater than 10&lt;7 &gt; shots.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Throughout all of the tests described herein the dielectric
      oil was not flushed and replenished. Water content was expected to
      be around 200 to 300 ppm since the oil reservoir is open to the
      atmosphere and tests were performed in a region notorious for high
      humidity. Analysis unexpectedly revealed that water content was
      around 13 ppm. Thus during operation, the switch of the present
      invention removes water from the oil or hydrocarbon fluid used due
      to the high energy plasma arc which is produced. The present
      invention can therefore be used to remove water from the hydraulic
      fluid, PAO, or flowing dielectric with out chemically changing the
      oil. Further, this method can be used to remove water from such
      fluids, or related fluids, even when the use of a high power
      switch is not required. One example of such use is in an aircraft,
      where the fluid comprises hydraulic fluid. If water exists in any
      appreciable concentration in the fluid, corrosion of the hydraulic
      components can occur. The present invention can prevent that from
      happening.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As noted in Leckbee et al's 2004 paper, significant
      quantities of carbon are generated during discharge under high
      pressure. Following the first 250,000 shots the oil return line
      filter was examined and found to be jet black from all of the
      carbon deposits. Based on this examination the filter was changed
      between the first 304 stainless steel electrode tests and the K-33
      electrode tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success
      by substituting the generically or specifically described
      operating conditions of this invention for those used in the
      preceding components.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Although the invention has been described in detail with
      particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other
      embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and
      modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those
      skilled in the art and it is intended to cover in the appended
      claims all such modifications and equivalents. The entire
