      <p>A product developed by an Orange businessman could mean savings
        at the bowser for drivers. </p>
      <p>The Thompson Coupling is the world's first constant velocity
        universal joint that has no load bearing sliding surfaces. </p>
      <p>While that may not mean much to the average person, inventor
        and chairperson of Thompson Couplings Ltd, Glenn Thompson, is
        confident saving on fuel will. </p>
      <p>"Given the rising cost of fuel that impacts on every family
        budget this will make a difference," Mr Thompson said. </p>
      <p>"This is a smooth, powerful, durable and efficient product. </p>
      <p>It speaks for itself more efficiency means less fuel and that
        means savings for the end user." </p>
      <p>In addition to its application in light vehicles Mr Thompson
        said his coupling had a variety of potential uses and
        adaptations. </p>
      <p>Testing carried out at the Thompson Couplings test factory in
        Orange has confirmed the product has many advantages over
        existing commercial CV couplings and universal joints. </p>
      <p>"The trucking, marine, agriculture and aviation industries
        could all utilise this product," Mr Thompson said. </p>
      <p>"The sky's the limit." </p>
      <p>Last week a patent was granted for the Thompson Coupling in
        China, opening up a wealth of opportunity for the Australian
        owned Orange based company. </p>
      <p>"China is significant," Mr Thompson said. </p>
      <p>"It's a burgeoning tiger economy so being granted the patent
        there is a real coup for us." </p>
      <p>Thompson Couplings now holds patents in New Zealand, Singapore,
        South Africa and China with patents pending in a number of other
        countries including Japan and the US. </p>
      <p>Thompson Couplings Ltd is undertaking a fundraising venture to
        enable the manufacture and marketing of the product. </p>
      <p>An offer of statement has been released. An open day will be
        held at the company's test factory at 30 Lords Place on August
        12. </p>

      <p>The Thompson Coupling is the world's first and only Constant
        Velocity Joint which: </p>
      <blockquote>Has all loads carried by roller bearings <br>
        Has no sliding or skidding surfaces whatsoever <br>
        Can tolerate axial and radial loads without degradation <br>
        Has no torque limitation, constructed to any torque level <br>
        Does not require special lubrication <br>
        Does not require a dust boot <br>
        No wearing components except replaceable bearings and trunnions
        <br>
        Is suitable for automotive tail or propeller shaft applications
        <br>
        Is a true Constant Velocity Coupling as distinct from a cv joint
        <br>
        Is less bulky than a double coupling or double Cardan joint.</blockquote>
      <p><br>
        The Thompson Coupling is essentially two Cardan joints assembled
        coaxially where the cruciform-equivalent members of each are
        connected to one another by trunnions and bearings which are
        constrained to continuously lie on the homokinetic plane of the
        joint. </p>
      <p>The constraining means which constrains the said trunnions and
        bearings consists of a two segment spherical four bar linkage or
        spherical draglink.&nbsp; One end of the draglink is attached to
        a trunnion on an extension to the input shaft while the second
        end of the draglink is connected to a removable pin forming a
        trunnion on the inside of the yoke of the output shaft.&nbsp;
        Each arm or bar of the draglink continuously forms a great
        circle arc centered upon the axis of the joint.&nbsp; The
        central axis of the draglink is located on a trunnion in the
        middle of a "C" shaped member, the ends of the "C" shaped member
        are located on the extended trunnions which connect the two
        Cardan joints. </p>
      <p>With operation of the joint, the central axis of the draglink
        and therefore the trunnion in the center of the "C" member,
        continuously bisects the included acute angle between the
        extended axis of the input and output shafts and therefore
        continuously lies on the axis of the homokinetic plane of the
        joint. </p>
      <p>Consequently the axis of the trunnions which connect the inner
        and outer Cardan joints are constrained to continuously lie on
        the homokinetic plane of the joint. (Note:- The homokinetic
        plane is that plane which is perpendicular to the plane of the
        axis of the input and output shafts and which bisects the obtuse
        angle between the axis of the input and output shafts.) </p>
      <p>As is well known, four bar linkage mechanisms are structurally
        excellent and this remains true in spherical form. </p>
      <p>In operation the component parts of the coupling remain
        balanced about the three rotational axis of the joint namely the
        input shaft axis, the output shaft axis and the axis of the
        homokinetic plane. </p>
      <p>In mass production each and every component of the Thompson
        Coupling can be produced by forging and/or casting with the only
        further requirement being to drill and machine the bearing
        journals, holes and circlip grooves. </p>
      <p>No dedicated machinery is required and there is no complex
        machining at all. </p>
      <p>Bearings for most applications are stock and assembly is very
        simple. </p>
      <p>For one-off project applications, manufacture is simple and
        within the capability of any machine shop.&nbsp; No specialist
        machinery is required as is the case with Rzeppa type joints. </p>
      <p>The Thompson Coupling has essentially the same construction as
        a normal Cardan joint but does not suffer the dynamic loads due
        to fluctuating angular velocity of intermediate shafts and load
        as is the case where Cardan joints are used. </p>
      <p>As a result, the Thompson Coupling should have a life exceeding
        an ordinary Cardan joint.&nbsp; It stands to sense, and our
        testing will prove it.&nbsp; There is no untried technology in
        the Thompson Coupling.&nbsp; It is essentially identical to two
        Cardan joints in its torque transmission. </p>
      <p>The components and the moving components in the constraining
        mechanism are tried and true roller bearings.&nbsp; There are no
        mysteries or unknowns. </p>
      <p>A Thompson Coupling can be disassembled with a pair of circlip
        pliers and the bearings replaced with a minimum of expertise and
        downtime. </p>
      <p>The Thompson Coupling is very compact and may be
        over-engineered to increase reliability without adding
        substantially to bulk and weight. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that use of the Thompson Coupling in lieu of
        Cardan Joints will eliminate a large source of vibration in many
        machines and automotive applications. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A constant velocity coupling 10, 305 which rotabably connects
        an input shaft 11 to an output shaft 12 by means of a control
        mechanism or control system 21, 309 which, in particular forms,
        includes a gimbal arrangement comprised of an inner yoke 22
        rotatably connected to an outer yoke 16. The control mechanism
        including control yoke 21 constrains at least portions of the
        coupling to lie on or in association with a homokinetic plane
        300 of the coupling. In particular forms the control mechanism
        operates symmetrically about supplementary angle bisector 308. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to couplings between
        shafts and in particular forms to universal joints and, more
        particularly to couplings having or seeking to achieve equal
        instantaneous input shaft and output shaft angular velocities. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The problem of coupling two rotating shafts operating at
        an angle to each other has confronted engineers since at least
        the beginning of the industrial revolution. The "Cardan Joint"
        developed initially by Cardan in the 16.sup.th century is in
        principle still in use today despite its inherent shortcomings
        and is found for example in virtually every rear wheel drive
        vehicle. </p>
      <p>[0003] An inherent flaw in the design of the simple Cardan
        Joint is the fact that at any angle between input and output
        shafts other than 180 degrees, the angular velocity of the
        output shaft fluctuates sinusoidally relative to that of the
        input shaft. </p>
      <p>[0004] Commonly, and as employed again for example in the drive
        lines of rear wheel drive vehicles, two Cardan Joints are
        employed, coupling the input and output shafts to an
        intermediate shaft. By maintaining a parallel alignment between
        input and output shafts and matching orientations of joint
        elements, equal angular velocities can be maintained for the
        input and output shafts with the fluctuations now restricted to
        the intermediate shaft. </p>
      <p>[0005] However fluctuating stresses arising from the variations
        in input and output shaft angular velocities with that of the
        intermediate shaft are required to be absorbed in the two Cardan
        Joints. As well it is impossible in many applications and in
        particular in road vehicles to maintain a strict geometric
        relationship between input and output shafts giving rise to
        vibrations, mechanical stresses and power transmission losses. </p>
      <p>[0006] A partial solution to the problem of maintaining input
        and output shaft alignment was developed as the so-called
        "Double Cardan Joint", often referred to as a Constant Velocity
        Joint, which is an assembly of two Cardan joints coupled to a
        short intermediate shaft together with a centering mechanism
        which constrains both joints to be held in a fixed geometric
        relationship to each other such that the input and output shafts
        form equal angles with the intermediate shaft. The major
        shortcomings of this arrangement reside in the transfer of any
        axial and radial loads to the centering mechanism resulting in
        accelerated wear and frictional losses. </p>
      <p>[0007] Numerous other couplings have been developed to seek to
        achieve constant angular velocity transfer between shafts.
        Generally all suffer from being approximate solutions to the
        strict geometrical constraints of a true constant velocity
        coupling or achieve an approximation to the geometry at the cost
        of high wear frictional losses from sliding components. </p>
      <p>[0008] It is an object of the present invention to address or
        ameliorate at least one of the above disadvantages or at least
        provide a useful alternative. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0009] Accordingly, in one broad form of the invention there is
        provided a constant velocity coupling wherein the conditions for
        equal instantaneous transfer of angular velocities between an
        input and an output shaft are maintained by a control mechanism,
        said coupling including, [0010] (a) an input shaft rotation axis
        [0011] (b) an output shaft rotation axis [0012] (c) a control
        mechanism, said control mechanism adapted to constrain at least
        portions of said coupling so as to achieve a constant velocity
        characteristic. </p>
      <p>[0013] In a further broad form of the invention there is
        provided a constant velocity coupling wherein the angle between
        an input shaft and an output shaft is controlled so as to vary
        the volumetric characteristics of a swash plate hydraulic
        displacement device. </p>
      <p>[0014] In yet a further broad form of the invention there is
        provided a double constant velocity coupling wherein the
        conditions for equal instantaneous transfer of angular
        velocities between an input and an output axis are maintained by

        mechanism; said joint including mechanical control means which
        constrains said gimbal with respect to said input axis and said
        output axis whereby, in use, a constant velocity characteristic
        is maintained over a predetermined range of angles between said
        input shaft and said output shaft. </p>
      <p>[0021] In yet a further broad form of the invention there is
        provided a constant velocity joint incorporating a control.
        mechanism based on spherical geometry with respect to a
        geometric centre defined as the intersection of said input axis
        and said output axis. </p>
      <p>[0022] In yet a further broad form of the invention there is
        provided centering means for a constant velocity joint; said
        centering means incorporating joints defined with respect to
        spherical triangle structures so as to constrain at least
        portions of said joint on a homokinetic plane defined with
        respect to the point of intersection of said input axis with
        said output axis. </p>
      <p>[0023] In yet a further broad form of the invention there is
        provided a method of constraining a first input shaft with
        respect to a second output shaft of a constant velocity joint so
        as to achieve substantially constant velocity behaviour; said
        method comprising utilising control means centered on and
        pivotable about one or more axes passing through a coupling
        centre defined as the intersection of an input shaft with an
        output shaft axis. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0047] A significant number of varied embodiments will now be
        described. Broadly various ones of the embodiments relate to
        systems having an input shaft connected mechanically to an
        output shaft in such a way that torque can be transmitted from
        the input shaft to the output shaft whilst maintaining a
        substantially "constant velocity" characteristic. In particular
        forms the constant velocity characteristic is sought to be
        maintained despite variations in angle between the input and
        output shaft. </p>
      <p>[0048] In this specification a "constant velocity"
        characteristic refers to a characteristic wherein the
        instantaneous angular velocity of the input shaft is matched to
        the instantaneous angular velocity of the output shaft
        throughout a full rotation of the shafts. It is to be understood
        that the constant velocity characteristic is a design goal and
        various embodiments may achieve this characteristic to a greater
        or lesser degree based on parameters which can include
        mechanical and structural variations in the assembly. </p>
      <p>[0049] Where variation is allowed in the angle between the
        input and output shafts such joints are termed universal
        constant velocity joints in this specification. </p>
      <p>[0050] Broadly, the constant velocity characteristic as between
        the input and output shafts is achieved by use of a control
        system which, in the embodiments in this specification, is
        implemented in mechanical form and is variously termed in
        various embodiments as a control yoke, a control mechanism, a
        linkage mechanism, constraining means, an interposing connecting
        member, a centering mechanism and centering means. </p>
      <p>[0051] Throughout the embodiments the point of intersection of
        the axes of the input and output shafts is termed the coupling
        centre or the geometric centre and, in some instances, is
        referred to as the "contact points" of the axes of the two
        shafts. </p>
      <p>[0052] The coupling centre or geometric centre has significance
        in that in a significant number of embodiments this point
        becomes a common point 6f the constant velocity joint through
        which the rotational axes of all pivots forming part of the
        control system pass (as well as the axes of the input and output
        shafts by definition). </p>
      <p>[0053] Also, in a significant number of embodiments, a gimbal
        mechanism can be identified forming part of the coupling and
        more particularly including portions which are controlled by the
        control system so as to bring out the constant velocity
        characteristic. In this specification a gimbal most commonly
        comprises an inner substantially circular yoke residing within
        and pivotable with respect to an outer also substantially
        circular yoke. The yokes of the gimbal mechanism are, in turn,
        pivotably connected to respective input and output shafts. The
        gimbal is at least partially constrained in its movements by the
        control mechanism, most often in the form of a control yoke and
        associated control components so as to impose the constant
        velocity characteristic upon the relative movements of the input
        and output shafts. </p>
      <p>[0054] The constraining behaviour required to impart the
        constant velocity characteristic is described in the majority of
        embodiments with respect to the coupling centre or geometric
        centre as well as the "homokinetic plane" of the coupling. </p>
      <p>[0055] With reference to FIG. 23 the homokinetic plane in this
        specification is that plane 300 which lies on the bisector 301
        of the angle 302 between the input axis 303 and the output axis
        304 of an indicative constant velocity coupling 305. More
        specifically the homokinetic plane 300 is defined to lie at
        right angles to the plane defined by the input and output axes
        303, 304. In the particular case of FIG. 23 if it is taken that
        the input axis 303 and output axis 304 lie in the plane of the
        page then the homokinetic plane 300 will lie at right angles to
        the page. </p>
      <p>[0056] In specific forms the control system is better defined
        by reference to supplementary angle 306 which is defined as the
        angle between, in this instance, the output axis 304 and the
        extension of the input axis 303 through the coupling or
        geometric centre 307. Mathematically the supplementary angle 306
        is 180.degree. minus the angle 302 between the input and output
        shafts. </p>
      <p>[0057] The supplementary angle bisector 308 is the bisector of
        supplementary angle 306 and passes through centre 307 and, by
        definition, lies at right angles to the homokinetic plane 300
        and at right angles to bisector 301. The supplementary angle
        bisector 308 is labelled CC in FIG. 23 and corresponds to axis C
        in FIG. 4 described with reference to the first embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0058] It is a particular characteristic of many of the
        embodiments of the present invention that the control system in
        the form of the control mechanism is centred upon axis 308 and
        operates symmetrically about this axis in all modes of
        operation. In particular embodiments the terms "spherical
        triangles" and "spherical geometry" are utilised in the context
        of linkages and axes for the control system 309 all of which
        rotate about axes which pass through centre 307. </p>
      <p>[0059] In particular forms the entire control system providing
        the constant velocity characteristic (or an arbitrary
        approximation thereto) can be implemented using joints which are
        revolutes about these axes such as, for example, ball or roller
        bearings, which is to say utilising bearing surfaces which
        require no load bearing sliding surfaces. </p>
      <p><i>1. First Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0060] A first preferred embodiment of a constant velocity
        coupling will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 5. </p>
      <p>[0061] With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2 there is shown a
        constant velocity coupling 10 in which an input shaft 11 is
        coupled to an output shaft 12. Input shaft 11 is rigidly
        connected to input shaft boss 13. Output shaft 12 is rigidly
        connected to output shaft yoke 14 which is provided with
        journals 15. </p>
      <p>[0062] Output shaft yoke 14 is pivotally connected to outer
        yoke 16 by pivot shafts 17 and bearings (not visible) in outer
        yoke journals 18. </p>
      <p>[0063] Input shaft boss 13 is able to pivot about shaft 19
        located through inner yoke journals 20. </p>
      <p>[0064] A control yoke 21 is pivotally connected to outer yoke
        16 and inner yoke 22 by means of shafts 23 in control yoke
        journals 24 and bearings (not visible) in outer yoke journals 25
        and inner yoke journals 26. The axis Y-Y defined by control yoke
        21 and the journals of outer yoke 16 and inner yoke 22 is the
        principle axis of the coupling 10. </p>
      <p>[0065] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, all pivotal axes, together
        with input shaft axis 27 and output shaft axis 28 intersect at
        the coupling center 29. </p>
      <p>[0066] With reference to FIG. 3 inner yoke 22 and outer yoke 16
        have been removed for clarity to show first scissor mechanism 30
        comprising first scissor arm 31 and first scissor links 32 and
        33. Also visible in FIG. 3 is input shaft extension 34 and input
        shaft control pin 35. The axis of input shaft control pin 35
        intersects coupling center 29 and lies in the plane defined by
        input shaft axis 27 and input shaft boss axis 36. </p>
      <p>[0067] With reference to FIG. 4 where input shaft 11 has been
        removed for clarity, the geometric characteristics of a first
        half of scissor control mechanism 30 will now be explained. </p>
      <p>[0068] Output shaft yoke 14 is provided with output shaft
        control pin 37. The axis A of control pin 37 lies in the plane
        defined by output shaft axis 28 and the axis X-X through the
        centers of output shaft yoke journals 15, and intersects
        coupling center 29. </p>
      <p>[0069] Control yoke pivot pin 38 is rigidly connected at the
        center of control yoke 21 such that its axis C intersects
        coupling center 29. First scissor arm 31 pivots about control
        yoke pivot pin 38 and is provide at its outer ends with pivot
        shafts 39, the axes of which also intersect at coupling center
        29. First scissor links 32 and 33 are pivotally connected to
        pivot shafts 39 of first scissor arm 31. The outer end of first
        scissor link 32 is pivotally connected to input shaft control
        pin 35 (refer to FIG. 3) and outer end of first scissor link 33
        is pivotally connected to output shaft control pin 37. </p>
      <p>[0070] Because all axes of rotation of first scissor mechanism
        30 intersect at coupling center 29, it is clear that a
        rotational displacement of input shaft control pin 35 out of the
        plane defined by output shaft axis 28 and the axis X-X will
        cause a rotation of control yoke 21 about axis X-X. If the
        inter-center distances of pivot shafts 39 from control yoke
        pivot pin 38 and pivot centers of links 32 and 33 are equal, it
        follow that angular displacement of control yoke 21 will be half
        that of the angular displacement of input shaft control pin 35.
      </p>
      <p>[0071] This angular ratio holds true as long as axes A, B and C
        are constrained to lie in a common plane passing through
        coupling center 29. As shown in FIG. 5, the control scissor
        mechanism actually comprises dual symmetrical scissor arms and
        linkages which ensure that this condition is met. The mechanism
        can be considered to lie on a series of concentric spheres such
        that the nominal pivot intersection points of scissor arms and
        linkages lie at the vertices of spherical triangles, so
        constrained that corresponding angles within the triangles
        remain equal as the scissor mechanism re-orients due to the
        inputs from the two control pins. </p>
      <p>[0072] For clarity the following example refers only to one
        half of the dual scissor control mechanism but it will be
        understood that the motions described are controlled by the
        complete mechanism. </p>
      <p>[0073] With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, let it be assumed that
        the axis 28 of output shaft 12 is retained in the orientation
        shown, that is lying in a horizontal plane through X-X. If now
        input shaft 11 is rotated downward, only about axis X-X, that is
        the axis 27 of input shaft 11 continues to lie in the same
        vertical plane as that passing through the axis of output shaft
        12 and axis Y-Y, then the end of axis B at its pivotal
        connection to first scissor link 32, will follow a path upward
        on a sphere radius B centered at coupling center 29. That path
        is a small circle on the sphere radius B and lies in a vertical
        plane parallel to the vertical plane through the axes of input
        shaft 11 and output shaft 12. This displacement of link 32
        forces primary scissor arm 31 to rotate about control yoke pivot
        pin 38 fixed to control yoke 21. But scissor arm 31 is
        constrained by its connection to link 33 and output shaft
        control pin 37. If the angle between the plane defined by axis
        X-X and rotated axis B and the horizontal plane through X-X is
        ax, then the scissor arm 31 and linkages 32 and 33 will rotate
        axis C into a plane through X-X at angle a/2. Now the angle
        between input shaft axis 27 and the horizontal plane is also a,
        so that it follows that the axis Y-Y bisects the angle
        (180-.alpha.) between input shaft axis 27 and output shaft axis
        28. </p>
      <p>[0074] Clearly the axis Y-Y now lies in the plane bisecting the
        obtuse angle between input shaft axis 27 and output shaft axis
        28 and normal to the plane defined by axes 27 and 28. This plane
        is the so-called homo-kinetic plane and axes Y-Y may be defined
        as the axis of symmetry of the coupling. </p>
      <p>[0075] It can be shown that the axis Y-Y satisfies this
        relationship to the axes 27 and 28, that is it lies in the
        homo-kinetic plane, for any relative angle between input shaft
        11 and output shaft 12, within the physical constraints of the
        coupling 10. </p>
      <p>[0076] This satisfies the theoretical condition for a constant
        velocity coupling which requires that the input and output shaft
        axes meet at a point and that the contact points between the two
        shafts lie on the axis of symmetry in the homo-kinetic plane. </p>
      <p>[0077] Clearly all relative movements of components within the
        coupling are rotational and are realized by roller bearings,
        thus largely eliminating torque losses through friction; </p>
      <p><i>2. Second Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0078] In a second preferred embodiment, the scissor control
        mechanism previously described may be interchanged for a geared
        mechanism 40 as shown in FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>[0079] With reference to FIGS. 3, 4 and 6 the center 45 of main
        arm 41 and central gear. 44 are mounted so as to rotate about
        control yoke pivot pin 38. Linkage arms 42 and 43 are provided
        with meshing gear segments 48 and 49 respectively and at their
        outer ends with pivot centres 46 and 47. Linkage arms 42 and 43
        are pivotally mounted to main arm 41 on shafts 50 and 51. </p>
      <p>[0080] All rotation and pivot axis of control mechanism 40 are
        radial to the geometric center 29 of the coupling 10 (see FIG.
        4). Linkage arms 42 and 43 are of equal length and subtend equal
        angles with main arm 41. Thus the pivot centers 46 and 47 and
        the center of central gear 44 are constrained to lie on a great
        circle arc of a sphere centered on the geometric center 29, and
        the center of gear 44 will always lie at the midpoint of that
        great circle arc regardless of any variation in the length of
        that arc. </p>
      <p>[0081] On assembly, pivot 46 of control mechanism 40 is
        connected to input shaft control pin 35 and pivot 47 is
        connected to output shaft control pin 37. </p>
      <p>[0082] It will be seen that any change in the angle between
        input shaft 11 and output shaft 12 will cause displacements of
        linkage arms 42 and 43. For example, let it be assumed that
        pivot center 47 of linkage arm 43 remains stationary. Then any
        displacement induced in pivot center 46 by input shaft control
        pin 35 will induce half that displacement in the center of gear
        44. Thus the axis through control yoke pivot pin 38 will
        continually bisect the complementary angle between input shaft
        11 and output shaft 12 and remain in the plane defined by the
        axes of the shafts 11 and 12. It follows then that the axis Y-Y
        will be constrained to lie in the homokinetic plane as
        previously defined. </p>
      <p><i>3. Third Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0083] In a third preferred embodiment with reference to FIG. 7
        there is provided a linkage system 60 which takes the place of
        inner yoke 26 and outer yoke 27 of coupling 10 in FIGS. 1 and 2.
        Shaft 61 is rigidly connected at its outer ends to linkage
        members 62 and 63 each of which has at its outer end boss 64 and
        65 respectively. Boss 64 and boss 65 carry control trunnion
        shafts 66 and 67 respectively. Linkage system 60 is further
        provided with linkage arms 68 and 69 each provided with ends 70
        and 71 pivotally connected to control trunnion shafts 66 and 67
        respectively. Linkage arms 68 and 69 have outer ends 70 and
        provided with output shaft yoke trunnion shafts 74 and 75. </p>
      <p>[0084] Linkage members 62 and 63 and linkage arms 6B and 69 lie
        within spherical shells centered on the intersection point 80 of
        the axis of shaft 61 and axis Y-Y and all rotation axes of the
        linkage system 60 intersect at axes intersection point 80. </p>
      <p>[0085] On assembly axes intersection point 80 is coincident
        with the geometric center 29 of the coupling 10 of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>[0086] In this embodiment input shaft boss 13 of input shaft 11
        of FIG. 1, rotates about shaft 61 of the linkage system 60 shown
        in FIG. 7, and output shaft yoke journals 15 of output shaft
        yoke 14 are connected to trunnion shafts 74 and 75. Control yoke
        journals 24 of control yoke 21 are connected to control trunnion
        shafts 74 and 75. </p>
      <p>[0087] As before, the control yoke axis Y-Y is constrained to
        remain in the homokinetic plane by the use of either the scissor
        control mechanism or the geared control mechanism described
        above. </p>
      <p>[0088] An advantage of the arrangement of axis Y-Y and shaft 61
        at a preferred angle of 45 degrees in this embodiment is that
        the space so created allows greater freedom of movement of the
        various rotational elements and the control mechanisms described
        above. </p>
      <p><i>4. Fourth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0089] In a fourth preferred embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7,
        there is provided a double constant velocity coupling 100
        comprising input shaft 111 and output shaft 112. Each of shafts
        111 and 112 is provided with yokes 113 and 114 respectively in
        which the shafts 111 and 112 are pivotally connected about axes
        X-X and X'-X'. Yokes 113 and 114 are in turn pivotally connected
        to connecting tube 115, each yoke 113 and 114 able to rotate
        about axes Y-Y and Y'-Y' respectively. </p>
      <p>[0090] As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, input shaft 111 and output
        shaft 112 are of identical construction each being provided with
        shaft extensions 116 and 117 respectively with each shaft
        extension having control pins 118 and 119 respectively. The axes
        of control pins 118 and 119 each lie in the plane defined by the
        shaft axis and the shaft rotation axis X-X and X'-X' of shafts
        111 and 112, and intersect with the intersection of these axes.
      </p>
      <p>[0091] Positioned in the center of connector tube 115 (removed
        in FIGS. 8 and 9 for clarity) is control assembly 120 including
        upper and lower transmission blocks 121 and 122 respectively.
        Blocks 121 and 122 are hinged together about the control block
        hinge shaft 129 lying on central axis Z-Z of connector tube 115.
        Shaft 129 is supported by means of a fixed pivot (removed for
        clarity) attached to the inner wall of connector tube 115. </p>
      <p>[0092] As shown in FIG. 8 all rotation axes at the input shaft
        end of the coupling 100 are radial to the intersection of axes
        X-X and Y-Y; similarly all rotation axes at the output end of
        coupling 100 are radial to the intersection of axes X'-X' and
        Y'-Y'. </p>
      <p>[0093] Any rotation within the physical constraints of the
        coupling of input shaft 111 about its axes of rotation X-X and
        Y-Y will cause control shaft 118 to displace connected linkages
        125 and 126 causing in turn a rotation of transmission blocks
        121 and 122 about hinge shaft 129. Corresponding linkages 125
        and 126 at the output end of control assembly 120 are forced to
        duplicate the displacement generated at the input end,
        transferring the displacement to linked control shaft 119,
        thereby causing output shaft 112 into corresponding rotations
        about its axes X'-X' and Y'/Y'. </p>
      <p>[0094] The angular displacements of input shaft 111 and 112 are
        symmetrical about a plane normal to the plane defined by the
        axes of shafts 111 and 112 and passing through the center of
        control assembly 120. As such the plane lies on the intersection
        of the axes of shafts 111 and 112, bisecting the angle between
        them and containing the axis of symmetry. That plane is
        therefore the homo-kinetic plane and the conditions for constant
        velocity of input and output shafts are satisfied. </p>
      <p>[0095] Again, all relative movements between components of the
        coupling in this embodiment are rotational and are realized by
        roller bearings, largely eliminating torque losses due to
        friction. </p>
      <p><i>5. Fifth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0096] A fifth preferred embodiment is now described wherein a
        constant velocity coupling is provided in which the angle
        between input and output shafts is maintained at some desired
        value by a variable control mechanism so as to vary the
        volumetric displacement of a swash plate operated hydraulic pump
        or motor. In this preferred application the reciprocating pump
        or motor elements are incorporated within the structure of the
        coupling. </p>
      <p>[0097] In this fifth preferred embodiment a constant velocity
        coupling is adapted to incorporate a variable swash plate
        hydraulic displacement device. </p>
      <p>[0098] With reference to FIG. 11 there is shown a constant
        velocity coupling 200 with input shaft 211 and output shaft 212.
        It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the terms
        "input shaft" and "output shaft" in this embodiment can be
        assigned to each of these elements interchangeably depending on
        the application of the coupling. </p>
      <p>[0099] The axis of each of shafts 211 and 212 intersect at a
        point 220 coincident with the intersection of axes X-X and Y-Y
        in FIG. 11; point 220 defining the geometric center of the
        coupling. The angle between the axes of shafts 111 and 112 may
        be varied from time to time as desired within the physical
        constraints of the coupling by a suitable control mechanism. The
        control mechanism is further adapted to maintain the angle of
        control yoke 213 in a fixed relationship to that angle set
        between shafts 211 and 212. This relationship is illustrated in
        FIG. 12, where if the supplementary angle between shafts 211 and
        212 is .alpha., then the axis of rotation of control yoke 113
        bisects the angle .alpha.. Thus the axis Y-Y is constrained to
        rotate in the homokinetic plane, satisfying the condition for a
        constant velocity coupling. </p>
      <p>[0100] FIG. 13 shows the disparate elements of the coupling
        including control yoke 213, inner yoke 214 and outer yoke 215.
        Input shaft 211 is rigidly connected to swash plate 216 provided
        with swash plate trunnion shafts 217. </p>
      <p>[0101] On assembly, swash plate trunnion shafts 217 pivotally
        connect in inner yoke journals 218 of inner yoke 214. Inner yoke
        214 is pivotally connected by its inner yoke trunnion shafts 219
        to the outer yoke journals 221 of outer yoke 215. In turn outer
        yoke 215 is pivotally mounted by its outer yoke trunnion shafts
        222 in output shaft yoke journals 223 of output shaft yoke 224.
        Control yoke 213 (shown from its yoke end) is pivotally
        connected by control yoke journals 225 to the extended inner
        yoke trunnion shafts 219 of inner yoke 214. </p>
      <p>[0102] The output shaft 212 of coupling 200 is further provided
        with cylinder block 226. Cylinder block 226 is provided with a
        radial array of cylinders 227. Each of cylinders 227 accepts a
        piston 228 provided at its compression end with seals 229 and at
        its opposite end with ball socket 230. Each piston 228 is
        connected by its ball socket 230 to first end 231 of connecting
        rod 232. Second end 233 of connecting rod 232 is connected to a
        ball socket 234 of swash plate 216. </p>
      <p>[0103] On assembly when input shaft 211 and output shaft 212
        are coaxially in alignment, the face of swash plate 216 is
        oriented normal to the axis of output shaft 212 and thus the
        axes of cylinders 227. In this situation the rotation of input
        shaft 211 and output shaft 212 about this common axis will leave
        pistons 228 stationary in cylinders 227. When an angle a is
        introduced between input shaft 211 and output shaft 212, by
        means of the control mechanism, a reciprocal axial displacement
        is induced in each of the cylinders 227 by pistons 228 for every
        revolution of the coupling 200. </p>
      <p>[0104] The volumetric displacements caused by the reciprocal
        movement of pistons 228 in cylinders 227 within a revolution of
        the coupling 200 increases as the angle a increases. </p>
      <p>[0105] Possible advantages of this configuration are: [0106] A.
        Previous are used a rzeppa type constant velocity joint with the
        inner member of the constant velocity joint held coaxial with
        the cylinder body and the outer member of the constant velocity
        joint forming th swash plate. With such an arrangement the
        entire torque of the assembly was transmitted through the
        constant velocity joint and the torque transmission members at a
        lesser radius than the swash plate with the result that the
        torque transmitting means were subject to high loadings. [0107]
        B. With present configuration torque may be transmitted to or
        from the swash plate by one of two methods both of which are
        superior to the prior art: [0108] 1. Torque transmitted by shaft
        connected to the cylinder body--In this case the torque
        transmitting means is at a greater radius than the swash plate
        with the result that the torque transmitting members are subject
        to lesser torque loads than with the prior art. [0109] 2. Torque
        transmitted by shaft connected to the swash plate--In this case
        the torque transmitting members of the constant velocity joint
        are not subject to the working torque of the device, the only
        load transmitted through the coupling is the torque necessary to
        rotate the cylinder body. </p>
      <p><i>6. Sixth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0110] This embodiment referring to FIGS. 14 provides for a
        joint of the modified Hooke's type where axis A5 continuously
        lies on the homokinetic plane due to the operation of a system
        of gears and levers arranged in such a manner that the rate and
        degree of revolution of a first actuating gear is at all times
        identical to the rate and degree of revolution of a second
        actuating gear by means of maintaining the angle of inclination
        between axis A3 and the axis of a first actuating gear the same
        as the angle of inclination between axis A4 and the axis of a
        second actuating gear. Alternatively a system of levers alone is
        envisaged where the levers perform similar functions to the
        abovementioned gears. </p>
      <p>[0111] Several preferred methods of implementing this
        embodiment will now be disclosed. In each preferred method there
        is provided two halves of a modified Hooke's joint as shown in
        FIG. 6. It will be observed that the joint shown in FIG. 6 is
        identical to the joint shown in FIG. 1 excepting that the
        cruciform member 6 as shown in FIG. 1 is omitted and a circular
        member 7 is located to yoke 4 such that it is free to rotate
        about axis A4. The size of ring member 7 and yoke 4 is such that
        the assembly may fit inside the inside the ring member 5 which
        is attached to yoke 3. The components shown in FIG. 14.6 are
        common to all preferred embodiments of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0112] FIG. 14.7 shows a cruciform member with two of the arms
        having the same axis longer than the two other arms such that
        the two longer arms have a combined length at least equal to the
        outside diameter of the larger ring member 5 and the two shorter
        arms have a combined length less than the internal diameter of
        ring member 7 such that when assembled the longer arms connect
        the two halves of the joint shown in FIG. 14.6 at axis A5 and
        the cruciform member is free to rotate on axis A5 within ring
        member 7. </p>
      <p>[0113] FIG. 14.8 is the cruciform member shown in FIG. 14.7
        with four intermeshed bevel gears one of which is located on and
        free to revolve on each of the arms of the said cruciform
        member. The two gears which are located on the shorter arms of
        the cruciform member have a lever rigidly attached to them but
        not shown in this drawing. </p>
      <p>[0114] FIG. 14.9 shows one of the gears with the rigidly
        attached lever arm. The lever arm has a ball 25 the end of it.
        Within the parameters discussed below neither the length of the
        lever arm nor its offset along the axis of the gear is critical.
        One such gear is located on each of the shorter arms of the
        cruciform member such that a lever arm extends out on opposite
        sides of the cruciform member. The lever arm attached to one of
        the gears must be aligned half a tooth different from the
        alignment of the other lever arm and gear such that the axis of
        the two longer arms of the cruciform member bisects the angle
        between the two levers as they rotate in mesh with the other two
        gears. </p>
      <p>[0115] FIG. 14.10 shows a yoke with a ball member rigidly
        attached to the centre of the inside surface of the yoke, both
        yokes have such a ball member attached. </p>
      <p>[0116] FIG. 14.11 shows a linkage member being a rod with a
        ball socket at either end adapted to connect at one end to the
        ball on the end of the lever shown in FIG. 14.9 and at the other
        end to the ball in the centre of the yoke member as shown in
        FIG. 14.10. </p>
      <p>[0117] The components described above and shown in FIGS. 14.6,
        7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are assembled such that the longer arms of
        the cruciform member extend through the holes in ring members 5
        and 7 such that the said ring members are located in respect to
        one another by the longer arms of the cruciform member and free
        to rotate about axis A5 and the cruciform member is also free to
        rotate on axis A5. The positions of the various components upon
        assembly is such that when the axis of shaft 1 and shaft 2 are
        in line the component parts have the relative positions as shown
        in FIG. 14.12 and in that view axis A3 and A4 and the axis of
        the gears located on the shorter arms of the cruciform member
        are all coaxial and axis A5 is perpendicular to the plane of
        axis A3, A4, A1 and A2. </p>
      <p>[0118] The joint as represented in FIG. 14.12 is intentionally
        shown with yoke 3 substantially larger then yoke 4 in order to
        illustrate the relationship between the various components. A
        linkage member 13 (as shown in FIG. 14.11) is connected at one
        end to the ball at the end of lever 11 and at the other end to
        the ball which is fixed to the centre of the inside surface of
        yoke 3 a similar linkage member 14 is similarly connected in the
        other half of the joint and the length of each linkage member
        and the length of the two lever arms 11 and 12 are determined as
        follows. The important consideration is that the triangle which
        is formed between the point of axis of the lever arm 11 and the
        centre of the ball which is fixed to the centre of yoke 3 and
        the centre of the ball at the end of lever 11 has the same
        internal angles as the triangle similarly formed in the other
        half of the joint; in other words the two triangles so formed
        should be identical except for size in this embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0119] If the centrelines of the lever arms project to the
        centre of the cruciform member (or disk member described below)
        then the internal angles of the triangle remain the same at all
        times while the joint rotates. However if the centreline of the
        lever arms project to a point which is offset from the centre of
        the cruciform member the internal angles of the triangle
        continuously change with revolution of the joint. If the
        centreline of the lever arms are offset from the centre of the
        cruciform member it is essential that both lever arms are offset
        to the extent that identical triangles are formed on either side
        of the joint. </p>
      <p>[0120] It will be seen that with operation of the joint
        described above both of the triangles described above
        effectively rock about their respective bases and also rock
        about the point of axis of the lever arms with the effect that
        when axis A3 and A4 are coaxial then the axis of the two levers
        are also coaxial with axis. A3 and A4 and whenever axis A3 and
        A4 are not coaxial the axis of the lever arms and associated
        gears always bisects the angle between axis A3 and A4 as they
        rotate about axis A5 with the result that the angle between the
        axis of the actuating levers 11 and 12 and their associated
        gears are always equally inclined to axis A3 and A4 respectively
        with the result that with rotation of yoke 3 about axis A3 and
        with rotation of yoke 4 about axis A4 the levers 11 and 12 and
        their attached gears will contra rotate about their axes at
        different rates and to a different degree than the rotation of
        the yokes about axis A3 and A4. However the said levers and
        associated gears will contra-rotate at equal rates and to equal
        degree as one another with the result that axis AS will
        continuously lie on the homokinetic plane and the joint will
        operate as a constant velocity joint in that the angular
        velocity of shaft 1 and shaft 2 will always be equal no matter
        what the angle of inclination of the said shafts to one another
        and will do so even if the angle of inclination alters during
        operation. </p>
      <p><i>7. Seventh Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0121] In another embodiment the cruciform member of FIGS. 14
        and four bevel gears and associated levers are replaced with a
        member adapted to hold two meshing gears in such a position that
        when the axis of shaft 1 and shaft 2 are in line their
        respective axis are perpendicular to the axes of both of the
        gears and axis A5 is perpendicular to and central to the plane
        between the axis of the two gears. A lever arm is rigidly
        affixed to each gear and a ball is on the end of each lever arm.
        With reference to FIG. 14.13 the member adapted to hold the two
        gears is a disk like member the diameter of which will fit
        inside ring 7. The disk member has two lugs which are used to
        locate and provide the axis for rings 5 and 7. The disk member
        has a rectangular hole through it so as to permit the meshing of
        the two gears through the disk. The disk member is free to
        rotate on axis A5. The disk member has two protrusions from each
        face and the axle for each of the gears is held by these
        protrusions. FIG. 14.14 is a side elevation of the disk member
        with the two gears in place. The lever arms one of which is
        rigidly attached to each gear are part shown. The operation of
        this disk like member and associated gears and levers is
        identical to the operation detailed above in respect to the
        cruciform member and four bevel gears and the same
        considerations apply. </p>
      <p><i>8. Eighth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0122] Another embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 14 is a system
        of levers arranged to pivot on each of the four arms of the
        cruciform member described above where their action is similar
        to the arrangement of the four intermeshing gears. </p>
      <p><i>9. Ninth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0123] Another embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 14 which may be
        used with either the cruciform member and the four bevel gears
        or the disk like member and the two gears or the system of
        levers alone is as follows. The ball member which is attached to
        the centre of the inner surface of each yoke is omitted and each
        of the yolks has an arcuate groove formed in the inside face of
        the yolk such that upon assembly the ball at the end of the
        lever arms is located in that groove so that with operation of
        the joint and as axis A3 and A4 change angle between each other
        the ball on each lever is caused to traverse the groove. If
        constructed in this manner the triangle referred to above is not
        available to maintain the correct relationship between the axis
        of the actuating gears and axis A3 and A4 so a different means
        of maintaining equal inclination between the axis of the gears
        and levers and the axis of their respective actuating yokes must
        be employed. One such method is to employ the scissor action of
        rings 5 and 7 which occurs as the angle between axis A3 and A4
        changes. </p>
      <p>[0124] One method of employing this scissor action is to
        rigidly fix a rod to either one of the longer arms of the
        cruciform member or one of the lugs of the disk like member as
        the case may be such that it is oriented perpendicular to the
        plane of the four arms of the cruciform member or the face of
        the disk like member as the case may be, two lever arm are used
        one of which is rotatably fixed to each of the ring members 5
        and 7 at one end and the other end is fixed to a member which
        joins both lever arms at their other end by a member which
        slides along the rod which is fixed to the arm of the cruciform
        member or disk member as the case may be so that the rod
        continuously bisects the angle between ring members 5 and 7.
        FIG. 14.15 is a representation of just such a scissor mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>[0125] It will also be appreciated that without departing from
        the present invention various other configurations of gears and
        levers will also work to maintain the relationship between the
        various components as disclosed herein. </p>
      <p>[0126] It will also be appreciated that without departing from
        the present invention it is also possible to arrange a system of
        levers alone instead of the gear and lever systems to maintain
        the relationships described herein. </p>
      <p>[0127] It has been found that in respect of the sixth to ninth
        embodiments it is helpful to provide separate means to ensure
        that the shorter arms of the cruciform member bisect the angle
        between axis A3 and A4 whenever they are not coaxial and in the
        seventh embodiment it is also helpful to provide separate means
        to ensure that the plane of the member shown in FIG. 14.13
        bisects the angle between axis A3 and A4 whenever they are not
        coaxial. In both instances such centering means may be to
        utilise the scissor action between member 5 and 7 as discussed
        above in respect to the eighth embodiment. </p>
      <p><i>10. Tenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0128] There is now disclosed with further reference to FIGS.
        14 a further, unique and novel means of providing a constraining
        means so as to facilitate a constant velocity joint by
        constraining axis AS on the homokinetic plane. </p>
      <p>[0129] This further novel means provides for members which
        describe two identical spherical triangles one in each half of
        the joint described below. </p>
      <p>[0130] As with the previously disclosed constant velocity
        universal joints the members shown in FIG. 6 are used however in
        this novel embodiment and with reference to FIG. 14.16 a disk
        like member 15 is provided. The disk member has two pins or
        trunnions 16 which provide the connecting means between ring
        members 5 and 7 and forms axis A5. The disk like member has a
        hole 17 through the center of the disk. It will be seen that
        upon assembly of the two halves of a joint as shown in FIG. 14.6
        using the disk like member shown in FIG. 14.16 then all of axis
        A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 intersect at a point. For the purpose of
        the present disclosure the point at which all of the said axes
        intersect will be called "the geometric centre". </p>
      <p>[0131] With reference to FIG. 14.17 there is also provided a
        double ended crank like member having a crank pin 18 at each end
        where the crank pin is angled such that upon assembly the axis
        A6 of each of the crank pins are each on a radius which
        intersects the geometric centre. </p>
      <p>[0132] Upon assembly and with reference to FIG. 14.18 the shaft
        of the crank like member is passed though the hole in the disk
        like member shown in FIG. 14.16 such that one crank pin is on
        either side of the said disk like member. </p>
      <p>[0133] With reference to FIG. 14.19 which shows the two yokes
        of a joint a pin 19 is fixed to the inside arc or surface of the
        yoke members 3 and a further pin 20 is similarly fixed to the
        inside surface or arc of yoke 4 such that the axis of each of
        the said pins also lies on a radius which intersects the
        geometric centre. The pins are situated such that they are on
        the same side of the joint as one another rather than diagonally
        opposite. </p>
      <p>[0134] With reference to FIG. 14.20 a further member 21 is
        provided having a hole 22 at one end such that member 21 can be
        located on pin 19 and a further hole 23 such that the other end
        of member 21 may be located on the first pin 18, a further
        similar ember is provided and is located on one end on pin 20
        and at the other on the second pin 18. The length or more
        correctly the angle between the holes at either end of member 21
        is as set out below. </p>
      <p>[0135] Upon assembly of the joint and when the joint is in a
        position where axis A1 and A2 are in line and axis A3 and A4 are
        coaxial the axis of the crank pins 18 is on the plane of axis A5
        and A1 and A2 and the axis of pins 19 and 20 are each on the
        plane of axis A3 and A4 and A1 and A2. The angle between the
        holes in either end of member 21 is such that the relationships
        described in this paragraph are held or true. </p>
      <p>[0136] With the novel restraining means last described herein
        it will be seen that a spherical triangle is described by the
        great circle arcs between firstly the axis of pin 19 and axis
        A1, secondly Axis. A1 and the axis of the first crank pin,
        thirdly the axis of the first crank pin and the axis of pin 19.
        A similar spherical triangle is described between the
        corresponding components on the other side of the joint. It will
        be seen that with rotation of the assembled joint at any time
        when shafts 1 and 2 are inclined to each other a unique
        spherical triangle is formed at each point of revolution and
        angle of inclination and such a triangle is formed on each half
        of the joint with the result that the axis of the crank like
        member is equally inclined to firstly axis A1 and secondly axis
        A2 with the result that the plane of the disk like member 15 and
        therefore axis A5 is constrained to remain continuously on the
        homokinetic plane of the joint. </p>
      <p><i>11. Eleventh Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0137] The present embodiment of FIGS. 15 provides firstly a
        linkage mechanism as set out in FIG. 15.1 hereof and described
        below and secondly as described below a constant velocity
        universal joint utilizing the said linkage mechanism. </p>
      <p>[0138] With reference to FIG. 15.1 hereof the linkage mechanism
        disclosed consists of the following. Members 1 and 2 which are
        two similar members each having a hole formed in each end with
        the axis of the said holes intersecting at a point. Members 3
        and 4 are also two similar members and also similar to members 1
        and two excepting that members 3 and 4 have the holes formed in
        each end at a greater radius than do members 1 and 2. Members 1
        and 2 are connected to one another by a shaft 5. Locating pin 6
        connects members 1 and 3 such that members 1 and 3 may rotate in
        relation to one another about axis A1. The said members are
        assembled in such a manner that the normal axis of shaft 5
        intersects axis A1. It will be seen that with such an assembly
        members 1 and 2 which are connected together by shaft 5 will
        rotate in unison about axis A1 such that the normal axis of
        shaft 5 rotates about axis A1 and similarly if members 3 and 4
        are held in fixed relationship to each other then they also will
        rotate in unison about axis A1 such that their axis, axis A2
        will also rotate about axis A1 and axis A1, A2 and the normal
        axis of shaft 5 will always intersect at the geometric centre of
        the above described linkage mechanism. </p>
      <p>[0139] One application utilizing the above described linkage
        mechanism is a constant velocity universal joint as now
        disclosed. FIG. 15.2 depicts a shaft with a hole formed in one
        end such that shaft 5 may be passed through the said hole. FIG.
        15.3 depicts a yoke as commonly used in universal joints such as
        the common hooke's joint (also known as a cardan joint). Holes
        13 and 14 are formed in the arms of the yoke such that the yoke
        may be located in relation to the linkage mechanism described
        above by locating pins 8 and 9 in holes 13 and 14 respectively.
        Shaft 10 is located on shaft 5 such that axis A3 being the
        normal axis of shaft 10 intersects axis A1 and A2 at the
        geometric centre of the linkage mechanism. Similarly it will
        observed that upon assembly as disclosed above axis A4 which is
        the normal axis of the yoke member 12 also intersects Axis A1
        and A2 at the geometric centre of the linkage mechanism. It will
        be seen that with such an assembly at any time where axis A3 and
        A4 are not in line or coaxial to one another rotation of shaft
        10 and yoke 12 about axis A3 and A4 respectively will result in
        members 1 and 2 rotating in unison about axis A1 while
        concurrently members 3 and 4 will also rotate in unison about
        axis Al but in opposite direction of rotation to members 1 and
        2. With such an assembly it will be observed that whenever axis
        A3 and A4 are not in line or coaxial and axis A2 and the normal
        axis of shaft 5 are not in line or coaxial then the plane of
        rotation of axis A1 always bisects the angle between the plane
        of rotation of axis A2 and the normal axis of shaft 5 and
        additionally the plane of rotation of axis A1 is perpendicular
        to the plane between axis A3 and A4 and hence the requirements
        of a constant velocity joint are present at all times. </p>
      <p>[0140] FIG. 15.4 is a representation of the linkage mechanism
        assembled with shaft 10 and yoke 12 so as to form a constant
        velocity joint as described above. In this representation axis
        A3 and A4 are inline and axis A2 and the normal axis of shaft 5
        are also in line or coaxial. In this representation axis A2 and
        the normal axis of shaft 5 are on the plane of the paper while
        axis A1 enters the page from the bottom at an inclination equal
        to the angle between the holes in members 1,2,3 and 4. In this
        particular representation it will be seen that if shaft 10 was
        rotated anticlockwise on the plane of the paper and yoke 12 was
        rotated clockwise on the plane of the paper then shaft 5 would
        rotate about axis A1 and Axis A2 would also rotate about axis A1
        but on the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>[0141] There is herein disclosed a linkage mechanism having
        three intersecting axes two of which rotate in relation to the
        third. There is also disclosed a constant velocity universal
        joint utilizing the said linkage mechanism and is a constant
        velocity universal joint having at least three axes two of which
        rotate about the third. This embodiment should utilise the same
        control system including the control yoke and control pins of
        the first embodiment, so as to constrain axis A1 on the
        homokinetic plane, </p>
      <p><i>12. Twelfth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0142] The term "spherical geometry" as intended for the
        purpose of this embodiment is as follows and with reference to
        FIGS. 16. FIG. 16.1 is a depiction of a sphere with a spherical
        triangle and associated trihedral set out on it. With reference
        to FIG. 16.1 axis 2 and 3 are diameters of sphere 1. Spherical
        triangle sides AD, AO and AZ are the intercepted great circle
        arcs of trihedral face angles D, Z and 0 respectively and angles
        A,B and C are the internal angles of the spherical triangle AD,
        A0, AZ. With further reference to FIG. 16.1 it will be seen that
        if spherical triangle AD, A0, AZ is rotated about either radius
        4 or radius 5 or diameter 3 then the rotating radii describe
        cones within the sphere. With further reference to FIG. 1 it
        will also be seen that if any of the face angles D, 0 or Z are
        changed then its intercepted great circle arc also changes as
        does the spherical triangle AD, A0, AZ. Obviously all of the
        rules of spherical geometry apply. </p>
      <p>[0143] With reference to the above the term "spherical
        geometry" for the purpose of this embodiment means the movement
        of component parts of a joint in such a manner that they
        describe or form spherical geometric forms or functions. </p>
      <p>[0144] The primary purpose of the present embodiment is to
        provide firstly a basis for a genre of constant velocity
        universal joint having members interposed between a first
        rotating shaft and a second rotating shaft where each of the
        moving or operating interposed members describe spherical
        geometric forms or functions and the second purpose of the
        present invention is to provide several specific and novel
        iterations of constant velocity universal joint based upon
        spherical geometry. </p>
      <p>[0145] From the following it will be seen that basing constant
        velocity joints on spherical geometry 15 rather than geometry
        other than spherical provides for joints of reduced size and
        also joints having no sliding and/or skidding components. </p>
      <p>[0146] The sixth embodiment described earlier provided for a
        means to form identical spherical triangles in each half of a
        joint so as to provide a means to maintain an interposed member
        on the homokinetic plane of the joint described therein. The
        above mentioned embodiment described a centering means
        consisting of a shaft having a crankpin at either end and also
        provided for two yokes each having a pin located on the inside
        surface and where the extended axis of the said crankpins and of
        the said pins intercepted the geometric centre of the joint
        described. For the purpose of clarity the joint described in the
        sixth embodiment comprised of a modified Hooke's joint having
        two halves as depicted in FIG. 16.2 herewith. An interposed
        connecting member is depicted in FIG. 16.3 and consists of a
        disk like member 15 with a hole 17 in the center and two lugs 16
        fixed to it such that the two lugs are used to connect the two
        halves of the joint shown in FIG. 16.2 by locating the said lugs
        in the holes 8, 9, 10 and 11 shown in FIG. 16.2. FIG. 16.5
        depicts a shaft member 12 having arms 13 and crankpins 18
        located at either end oriented in such a manner as the extended
        axis A6 of the said crankpins intersect at the geometric centre
        of the joint when assembled. FIG. 16.4 shows a depiction of
        shaft 12 assembled with disk like member 15. FIG. 16.6 shows
        yoke member 3 and yoke member 4 each of which has a pin 19 and
        20 protruding from the inside surface of the yokes and which
        pins are oriented such that the extended axis of each pin
        intersects the geometric centre of the joint upon assembly. The
        said yokes are assembled such that the pins 19 and 20 are on the
        same side of the joint or in other words that the extended axis
        of pins 19 and 20 are not in line or coaxial. Two instances of a
        further member 21 as depicted in FIG. 16.7 are provided, this
        member has a hole 22 at either end and the length of the said
        member and the angle between the said holes is such that upon
        assembly of the joint the first such member is located at one
        end on pin 19 and on the other on its adjacent pin 18 and the
        second such member is located on pin 20 and the second pin 18.
        The length of each of the members 21 and the angle between the
        holes 22 in each of member 21 is such that upon assembly of the
        joint and when the axis A1 and A2 are in line two identical
        right spherical triangles having the sides G,H,I and J, K, Las
        depicted in FIG. 16.8 are formed one in each half of the joint
        and with the right angle being on the axis of the input or
        output shaft as the case may be. The first member 21 forms side
        I on the first right spherical triangle and the second member 21
        forms side J on the second right spherical triangle. </p>
      <p>[0147] FIGS. 16.8A and 16.8B are both depictions of the joint
        according to the above described embodiment. It will be observed
        by an analysis of FIGS. 16.8A and 16.8B together with the
        foregoing that at any time when the axis of the input shaft and
        the output shafts are inclined to one another a unique spherical
        triangle is formed for each possible rotational position and
        angular position and it will be further observed that the
        spherical triangle formed in each half of the joint by virtue of
        the construction must be identical to each other with the result
        that the plane of rotation of axis A5 as shown in FIG. 16.1 and
        as located by lugs 16 must always bisect the angle which exists
        from time to time between the axis of the input and output
        shafts. </p>
      <p>[0148] While the joint and centering means described above
        utilizes spherical geometry to provide the centering means the
        remaining components other than the centering means all describe
        disks or planes centred upon the geometric centre of the joint
        upon rotation and each of these disks may be described by simple
        planar geometry. From the following it will be seen that it is
        advantageous to modify the above described joint according to
        the present invention which is to provide construction such that
        the components and the relationship between components describe
        shapes and forms found in spherical geometry and not in planar
        geometry. </p>
      <p><i>13. Thirteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0149] With reference to FIG. 16.9 of FIGS. 16 there is
        provided a member 22 which is a disk-like member with a hole 32
        in the centre. Its purpose and function is identical to member
        15 as described above in respect of the twelfth embodiment.
        Member 22 has two pins 23 and 24 rigidly attached. Members 25,
        26, 27 and 33 are each identically formed components which are
        formed to an arc centred upon the assembly shown in FIG. 16.9
        and each of members 25, 26,27 and 33 are free to rotate upon
        pins 23 and 24. To complete the joint two yokes are provided
        identical to those shown in FIG. 16.6 one such yoke is located
        on pins 28 and 29 while the other yoke is located on pins 30 and
        31. Centering means are provided as disclosed on the first
        described joint consisting of members 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 and 21
        as shown in FIGS. 16.5, 6 and 7. FIG. 16.10 is a depiction of
        the assembled joint shown while the axis of the input shaft and
        output shaft are in line and the view shown is directly along
        the axis of shaft 2 as numbered in FIG. 16.2. Only the ends of
        the forks of yoke 3 are visible in this view. It will be seen
        that with operation of the last described joint at any time that
        the axis of the input shaft and the output shaft are inclined to
        one another then there is a spherical triangle formed by the
        intercepted arcs of the trihedral formed by the axis of pins 23,
        28 and 31 and a further identical spherical triangle formed by
        the intercepted arcs of the trihedral formed by the axis of pins
        24, 29 and 30 excepting that twice per revolution when the axis
        of pins 28 and 31 are coaxial there is momentarily no trihedral
        formed on either side of the joint. It will also be seen that
        with operation of the joint pins 28, 29, 30 and 31 each describe
        great circle arcs and a great circle arc exists between the axis
        of pins 28 and 31 and also between the axis of pins 29 and 30.
        It will be observed that with operation of the last described
        joint there are four constantly changing spherical triangle
        formed within the joint in that in addition to the last
        described spherical triangles there are the two spherical
        triangles associated with the centering means described above. </p>
      <p><i>14. Fourteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0150] A further modification enable by adhering to spherical
        geometry rather than planar geometry is shown with reference to
        FIG. 16.11 of FIGS. 16. This further modification provides for a
        linkage mechanism identical to that shown in FIG. 16.9 excepting
        that members 27 and 33 are omitted. With reference to FIG. 16.12
        there is also provided two yokes as shown in FIG. 16.6 excepting
        that one arm on each of the yokes is omitted or shortened, it
        will be observed that in order to maintain pins 19 and 20 on the
        same side of the joint it is necessary to extend at least one of
        the foreshortened arms so as to locate pin 20 or pin 19 as the
        case may be in the required position. With this iteration it
        will be seen that operation is identical to the last described
        joint excepting that the spherical triangles related to pins 23
        and 24 are both right spherical triangles formed between the
        axis of pins 23 and 31 and the point where the arc described by
        pin 31 intercepts the arc of the plane of rotation of pin 23 and
        the identical triangle is formed on the other side in relation
        to pins 24, 30 and the arc of pin 24. </p>
      <p>[0151] It will be observed that in the last three described
        joints the centering means itself is capable of transmitting
        power through the joint and in the joints described it does take
        part of the load. It is possible therefore to construct a
        constant velocity joint constructed solely from the centering
        means provided by pins 19, 20 together with the members depicted
        in FIGS. 16.5 and 16.7. </p>
      <p>[0152] With reference to FIG. 16.13 shaft 12 is rigidly located
        to a surface by bearing means 36 and associated mount. Shafts 37
        and 38 are also rigidly fixed in such a manner that while the
        angle between their axes may be either fixed or variable their
        axes always intersect at the centre of shaft 12 and the axis of
        the two crankpins 18 and the axis of pins 19 and 20 also
        intersect at the same point. </p>
      <p>[0153] It will be readily obvious to an ordinary worker that
        such an assembly may be incorporated into a stand alone
        supporting means such as a hollow ball joint from which extends
        tubes so as to locate shafts 37 and 38. </p>
      <p><i>15. Fifteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0154] With reference to FIGS. 16, a further embodiment is
        described below. While each of the above described embodiments
        may be broadly classed as modified Hooke's joints a quite
        different embodiment can be described which is more akin to the
        Rzeppa joint. With reference to FIG. 16.14 there is provided a
        member substantially similar to that depicted in FIG. 16.12
        excepting that the spherical plane of the spherical triangle
        described by members 25 is a solid member 36 of at least that
        size and shape and similarly on the other side of the joint the
        spherical plane described by member 26 is also a solid member of
        at least that size and shape. (notwithstanding the appearance of
        the drawing in FIG. 16.14 the assembly is symmetrical). Formed
        into the surface of each solid 36 and 37 is a groove which
        describes a great circle as would be described by pins 30 and 31
        if they were present in this iteration. There is also provided
        two yokes 38 and 39 as depicted in FIG. 16.15 each such yoke
        having an extended and curved arm and each having a groove 40
        and 41 formed in the inside surface of each of yoke 38 and 39
        such that with operation of the joint the ball rolls in the
        grooves with sliding or skidding. Assembly of this joint is
        similar to the foregoing descriptions where yokes are used
        excepting that a ball is interposed between yoke 39 and solid 36
        and also between yoke 38 and solid 37. In the last described
        iteration the third and fourth spherical triangles formed are
        formed by the great circle arcs between the axis of pin 23 and
        the centre of the ball and between the point where the path of
        the ball intercepts the plane of rotation of pin 23 and
        similarly on the other side, the first and second spherical
        triangles are formed by the centering means as described
        elsewhere above. </p>
      <p>[0155] From the foregoing it will be observed that a potential
        common characteristic where all of the moving members operate to
        describe spherical geometry paths and constructions of the type
        referred to in this specification it is believed possible to
        construct forms of substantially constant velocity joints where
        there are no sliding and/or skidding members. It may also
        possible to reduce all of the component members to members of
        simple construction whereas in all iterations of the prior art
        relating to constant velocity joints which do not adhere to
        spherical geometric functions it is submitted that there is both
        sliding and/or skidding components and also members of extremely
        complex construction. </p>
      <p><i>16. Sixteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0156] FIG. 17.1 is a copy of FIG. 16.2 and is a representation
        of the two halves of a modified Hooke's joint as is well known
        and referred to in the earlier embodiments. With reference to
        FIG. 17.2 the method of this sixteenth embodiment provides for
        two yokes 3 and 4 each of which have a pin 19 and 20 located on
        the inside arcuate surface of the said yokes as disclosed in the
        earlier embodiments. FIG. 17.3 and FIG. 17.4 represent the
        members which are unique to the presently described or disclosed
        centering means. FIG. 17.3 is a representation of a circular
        ring like member having an inside diameter greater than the
        diameter of the ring member 5 shown in FIG. 17.1 FIG. 17.4 is a
        further circular ring like member having an inside diameter
        greater than the outside diameter of the circular member shown
        in FIG. 17.3. With reference to FIG. 17.3 circular ring like
        member 21 has two lugs or trunnions 24 and 25 diametrically
        opposed to one another and holes with bearing means 22 and 23 to
        permit or facilitate assembly of ring 21 on axis A5 as shown in
        FIG. 17.6. With reference to FIG. 17.4 circular ring like member
        26 has two diametrically opposed holes with bearing means to
        permit or facilitate assembly of ring member 26 with ring member
        21 where lugs or trunnions 24 and 25 are located in bearing
        means 27 and 28 respectively. With further reference to FIG.
        17.4 members 29 and 30 are pins having their axis coaxial with a
        radii of ring member 26 and each of the said pins being equally
        angularly disposed from the centre of bearing means 27 and 28
        respectively. Circular ring like members 21 and 26 are assembled
        as shown in FIG. 17.5 and further assemble in relation to the
        joint as shown in FIG. 17.6. Two arcuate members as depicted in
        FIG. 17.7 are provided with each having an arc or angle between
        holes 32 and 33 being equal to the angle between members 29 and
        19 and also between members 30 and 20 when the axis of shafts 1
        and 2 are in line with one another so that a first spherical
        triangle is formed on the first half of the joint shown in FIG.
        17.6 and a second spherical triangle is formed on the second
        half of the joint shown in. FIG. 17.6 with the first spherical
        triangle being formed by the great circle arcs existing between
        pin 29 and pin 19 and pin 19 and the axis of shaft 1 and the
        axis of shaft 1 and pin 29. The second spherical triangle is
        formed by the great circle arcs existing between the
        corresponding points and members in the second half of the
        joint. </p>
      <p>[0157] It will be observed that the assembly disclosed herein
        effectively performs the identical function as does the assembly
        described in the twelfth embodiment wherein the shaft with the
        crankpin at either end is utilized to perform the identical task
        as does ring member 26 and pins 29 and 30 as disclosed herein. </p>
      <p>[0158] The assembly disclosed herein facilitates the use of a
        member as depicted in FIG. 17.8. The member depicted in FIG.
        17.8 is a shaft member adapted to connect to the center of the
        joint as either an input shaft or output shaft in place of one
        of the yoke members. So as to facilitate operation of the
        centering mechanism as disclosed herein the member shown in FIG.
        17.8 has an arcuate slot 36 formed therein so as to permit ring
        members 21 and 26 to pass through and within the said arcuate
        slot there is provided a pin 37 so as to perform the same task
        as pin 19 or 20 as the case may be. FIG. 17.9 is a depiction of
        the linkage mechanism disclosed in the eleventh embodiment. It
        will be observed that the centering means disclosed herein
        together with the member depicted in FIG. 17.8 is particularly
        applicable as a suitable centering means for a constant velocity
        joint utilizing the linkage means depicted in FIG. 17.9. In such
        an application bearing 22 and 23 would be located by pins 38 and
        39 respectively. </p>
      <p>[0159] The present embodiment is a further instance of the
        centering means which forms a first spherical triangle in a
        first half of a constant velocity joint and also forms an
        identical spherical triangle in a second half of a constant
        velocity joint so as to maintain or constrain members of the
        joint on the homokinetic plane of the joint as the said
        spherical triangles continuously change but remain identical to
        one another with operation of the joint. </p>
      <p><i>17. Seventeenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0160] This embodiment, with reference to FIGS. 18 is a hybrid
        of the earlier joints disclosed together with a truncated
        instance of the specific instance of the centering mechanism
        disclosed in the sixteenth embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0161] With reference to FIGS. 18, FIG. 18.1 is yoke member 1
        with a shaft 2 attached and holes 4 and 5 in the yoke member. A
        pin 3 protruding from the inside arcuate surface of the yoke 1.
        The axis A1 of pin 3 intersects the axis A2 of holes 4 and axis
        A3 of shaft 2. FIG. 18.2 is a circular member 6 having four
        equally spaced holes 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the sides. FIG. 18.3 is a
        further circular member 11 having an outside diameter smaller
        than the inside diameter of circular member 6. Circular member
        11 has four equally spaced holes 12, 13, 14 and 15 in the sides.
      </p>
      <p>[0162] FIG. 18.4 and FIG. 18.5 are a side elevation and plan
        respectively of a 'shaft member 16 having a hole 17 through it
        and protrusion 18 attached. Two arcuate members 19 and 20 are
        attached to protrusion 18 one of which is solely for balance
        purposes while the other is to provide supporting means for pin
        21. The axis A5 of pin 21 intersects axis A4 and A:6 which are
        the axis of shaft 16 and hole 17 respectively. </p>
      <p>[0163] FIG. 18.6 depicts part circular members 22 and 23.
        Member 22 has a pin 24 which is assembled into hole 25 and
        supported by bearing means 26 such hat member 22 may rotate on
        axis A7. </p>
      <p>[0164] Member 22 has pins 27 and 28 equally spaced from axis
        A7. </p>
      <p>[0165] FIG. 18.7 depicts an arcuate member having two holes 30
        and 31, two such members are provided. </p>
      <p>[0166] Assembly of the various component parts is shown in FIG.
        18.8, FIG. 18.9 and FIG. 18.10 which are a plan view and side
        elevation section and side elevation respectively of the
        assembled joint. One member 29 is assembled on pins 27 and 3
        while the second member 29 is assembled on pins 28 and 21. </p>
      <p>[0167] FIG. 18.11 is a further view of the assembled joint with
        components not numbered. </p>
      <p>[0168] FIG. 18.12 is a representation of the two spherical
        triangles formed by the above assembly. The first spherical
        triangle has the sides formed by the great circle arcs between
        members 3, 27 and 24 while the second spherical triangle is
        formed by the great circle a members 21, 28 and 24. It will be
        observed that when the axis members 2 and 16 are coaxial then
        both of the abovementioned spherical triangles are right
        spherical triangles and that with operation of the joint at any
        time when axis A4 and A3 are not coaxial then the said spherical
        triangles continuously change but remain identical to one
        another with the result that the pin connecting means 60 between
        members 11, 6 and 23 is constrained to continuously rotate on
        the homokinetic plane of the joint. </p>
      <p>[0169] With reference to FIG. 18.13 which is a representation
        of a sphere, spherical triangles A,B,C and A,E.D are formed with
        the relationships shown and with the corresponding members of
        the joint shown in brackets. </p>
      <p>[0170] As an alternative to the members disclosed and depicted
        in FIG. 18.4 and FIG. 18.5 member 11 is provided with a series
        of lands and grooves or spline cut into the inner circular
        surface and holes 12 and 13 are omitted. In such an embodiment
        an arm is rigidly fixed to the alternative member 11 so as to
        locate pin 21 in the same relative position as disclosed herein.
      </p>
      <p><i>18. Eighteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0171] With reference to FIG. 19.1 this embodiment introduces
        the doubling of the equal spherical triangle centering mechanism
        disclosed in the earlier embodiments, to become the scissor
        mechanism employed in the coupling of the first embodiment. </p>
      <p><i>19. Nineteenth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0172] With reference to FIGS. 20, this embodiment has two
        forms, firstly a constant velocity joint or coupling for
        coupling two shafts which have fixed angular axial displacement
        and secondly a constant velocity universal joint or coupling for
        the coupling of two shafts which have variable angular axial
        displacement. In both instances the extended axis of the two
        shafts intersect at a point and in the second instance the axis
        may also be coaxial. </p>
      <p>[0173] With reference to FIG. 20.1 there is provided a means to
        rigidly locate at least three pins or trunions equally radially
        spaced from a central axis and equally angularly spaced from one
        another and such that the extended axis of the said pins or
        trunnions all intersect at a point. FIG. 20.1 shows one
        preferred embodiment of such a member and the embodiment shown
        is on the bottom of part spherical concave profile and on the
        top of part spherical convex profile and has three equally
        dimensioned arms radiating from the centre of the member and
        three holes are provided, one in each arm for the receiving of a
        pin. </p>
      <p>[0174] For the purpose of this embodiment as it relates to
        joints or couplings for shafts having a fixed angular
        displacement there is provided two such members as depicted in
        FIG. 20.1 with the concave inner surface of the first such
        member of a greater radius than the convex outer surface of the
        second such member such difference in radii being greater than
        the radial thickness of the linkage member set out in FIG. 20.2
        and described below. FIG. 20.2 depicts a curved or part
        spherical member having essentially parallel sides and a pin
        protruding from either end such that the extended axis of the
        said pins intersect at a point which is also intersected by a
        radial bisecting the axis of the two pins and perpendicular to
        the inner or concave surface of the said member. One such pin
        protrudes from the concave side while the second such pin
        protrudes from the convex side. The outer or convex surface
        having a radius less than the concave side of the first or
        larger instance of the member depicted in FIG. 1 while the inner
        or concave surface has a radius greater than the convex surface
        of the second or smaller instance of the member depicted in FIG.
        20.1. </p>
      <p>[0175] For the purpose of this embodiment of as it relates to
        couplings for shafts having a fixed angular displacement there
        is provided three instances of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1
        each of identical dimension and each such member has an angular
        distance between the axis of the pins at either end equal to the
        fixed angular displacement of the shafts which it is intended to
        couple but in no instance can that angle be greater than the
        angle of the lesser great circle arc between any two of the
        holes in the members depicted in FIG. 20.1 minus the angle
        between the axis of a pin of the curved member depicted in FIG.
        20.2 and its nearest adjacent end. </p>
      <p>[0176] The above described members are assembled as follows.
        [0177] 1. The pin protruding from the convex side of each of the
        three instances of the member depicted in FIG. 2 is rotatably
        located into the holes in the concave surface of the larger
        instance of the members depicted in FIG. 20.1. [0178] 2. The pin
        protruding from the concave side of the member depicted in FIG.
        20.2 is rotatably located in the holes in the convex surface of
        the smaller instance of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1. </p>
      <p>[0179] The above described members and assembly thereof provide
        a three layered assembly where each of the three instances of
        the members depicted in FIG. 20.2 connect or link between a hole
        in the larger instance of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1 with
        a hole in the smaller instance of the member depicted in FIG.
        20.1 and where the extended axis of each of the pins protruding
        from each of the three instances of the member depicted in FIG.
        20.2 and the extended axis of each of the holes in both
        instances of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1 intersect at a
        point. In addition with the above assembly the arc between the
        axis of the pins of each one of the three instances of the
        member depicted in FIG. 2 lies on a great circle arc centred
        upon the point of intersection of all of the before mentioned
        axis namely the extended axis of each of the three holes in the
        larger instance of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1 and the
        extended axis of the three holes in the smaller instance of the
        member depicted in FIG. 20.1 and the extended axis of each of
        the pins protruding from each of the three instances of the
        member depicted in FIG. 20.2. In addition the axis of each of
        the instances of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1 also intersect
        at the same point. </p>
      <p>[0180] FIG. 20.3 is a schematic, side elevation, sectional,
        depiction of the above described assembly without regard to
        perspective. With respect to FIG. 20.3 member 1 is the larger
        instance of the member depicted in FIG. 20.1, members 2 and 3
        are a first and second instance of the member depicted in FIG.
        20.2, member 6 is the smaller instance of the member depicted in
        FIG. 20.1, members 4. 5, 7 and 8 are the pins protruding from
        members 2 and 3 as described above and each such pin is located
        in a hole of either the larger or smaller instance of the member
        depicted in FIG. 20.1. Axis A1. A3, A4 and A6 are each extended
        axis of the pins 7,4, 8 and 5 respectively and axis A2 and A5
        are respectively the axis of members 6 and 1. </p>
      <p>[0181] The above described assembly provides a constant
        velocity linkage system whereby if axis A2 and A5 are held in
        fixed relationship to each other and member 1 is caused to
        rotate about axis A5 then the linkages provided between members
        1 and 6 by each of the three instances of the member depicted in
        FIG. 20.2 two of which are visible in the view shown in FIG.
        20.3 will cause member 6 to rotate about axis A2 at an identical
        angular velocity to the rotation of member 1 about axis A5 and
        the reverse is also true in that if member 6 is caused to rotate
        about axis A2 then the said linkages will cause member I to
        rotate about axis A5 at an identical angular velocity to member
        6. </p>
      <p>[0182] Using the above described assembly or linkage system is
        it possible to provide a constant velocity coupling or joint for
        two shafts having a fixed angular displacement. Where the above
        described assembly is schematically represented by a block
        representation as set out in FIG. 20.4 attention is drawn to
        FIG. 20.5 which is a representation of a complete joint or
        coupling. </p>
      <p>[0183] With regard to FIG. 20.5 base 12 is a solid base having
        a corner 15 around which it is required to transmit shaft power
        from a first shaft 10 to a second shaft 11. Shaft 10 is rigidly
        mounted to base 12 by means of bearing and mounting means 13 and
        shaft 11 is similarly rigidly mounted to base 12 by bearing and
        mounting means 14. Any suitable connecting means is used to
        rigidly connect shaft 10 to assembly 9 such that it is fixed to
        member 6 and coaxial with axis A2 as depicted in FIG. 20.3 and
        similarly any suitable fixing means are used to rigidly connect
        shaft 10 to assembly 9 such that it is fixed to member 1 and
        coaxial with axis A5 as depicted in FIG. 20.3. Point B is the
        point of intersection of all of the above described axis and
        also of the axis of shafts 10 and 11. Such an assembly will
        transmit power at a constant or uniform angular velocity from
        shaft 10 to shaft 11. </p>
      <p>[0184] In order to provide a constant velocity universal joint
        or coupling capable of transmitting power between shafts having
        a variable angular axial offset there is firstly provided an
        assembly identical to that described above and depicted in FIG.
        20.3 together with three further instances of the members
        depicted in FIG. 20.2 and one further instance of the member
        depicted in FIG. 20.1 where the further three instances of the
        member depicted in FIG. 20.2 and the further instance of the
        member depicted in FIG. 20.1 have a decreasing radius so as to
        form a further layer added below or more central to the point B
        as depicted in FIG. 20.3 to the earlier described assembly,
        although the members decrease in physical size their angular
        size is identical to those corresponding members in the higher
        layers so that all axis intersect at a point. </p>
      <p>[0185] FIG. 20.6 is a representation of an embodiment
        configured to provide an assembly suitable for inclusion in a
        joint or coupling where the shafts have a variable angular
        relationship to one another. Member 22 is a third instance of
        the member depicted in FIG. 20.1 and has the same angular size
        as the first two instances of the said member namely members 1
        and 6. Members 16 and 17 are a fourth and fifth instance of the
        member depicted in FIG. 20.2 and they have the same angular size
        as the first three instances. It should be noted that the third
        and sixth instance of the member depicted in FIG. 20.2 are not
        visible and not shown in the perspective shown in FIG. 20.6.
        Shaft 23 is rigidly connected to the centre of the concave
        surface of member 22 and shaft 24 is rigidly connected to the
        convex surface of member 1 such that in the position of the
        assembly as depicted in FIG. 20.6 shafts 23 and 24 are coaxial
        with one another and also coaxial with the axis of members 1 and
        22. All axes converge on point B. </p>
      <p>[0186] In order for the last described assembly to function as
        a constant velocity universal joint it is necessary to provide a
        mounting or coupling which provides for angular movement of the
        axis of shafts 23 and 24 while concurrently constraining the
        axis of shafts 23 and 24 such that at any time when the axis of
        the said shafts are not coaxial they intersect at a point. Where
        the assembly depicted in FIG. 20.6 as described above is
        schematically represented by a block representations as depicted
        in FIG. 20.7 attention is first drawn FIG. 20.8 which is a
        representation depicting the important relationships between the
        shafts and the assembly disclosed above. During operation of the
        joint of this embodiment it is important that point B as shown
        in FIG. 20.6 always falls on the axis of shaft 23 and it is
        important that a point on the axis of shaft 24 always falls on a
        spherical plane centred upon point B. If constructed with
        sufficient strength and tolerance the assembly depicted in FIG.
        20.6 will maintain the required relationships or alternatively
        constraining means may be provided to maintain the said
        relationships, one example of such a constraining mechanism is
        depicted in FIG. 20.9. </p>
      <p>[0187] With respect to FIG. 9 yoke 25 has a bearing means 26
        adapted to receive shaft 24 such that shaft 24 may rotate within
        bearing means 26. Bearing means 27 is adapted to receive shaft
        23 such that shaft 23 may rotate within bearing means 27 but is
        held rigidly such that point B as 10 depicted in FIG. 20.6 and
        FIG. 20.8 is always located at the intersection of the axis A7
        and A8. Axis A7 is the axis for bearing means 27 within housing
        28, axis A8 in turn is the axis for housing 28. </p>
      <p>[0188] It will be seen that with an assembly such as that
        disclosed herein and depicted in FIG. 20.6 and constrained so
        that point B as depicted in FIG. 20.6 is the point of axis of
        all the above mentioned axes, there is provided a constant
        velocity universal joint without any load bearing sliding
        surfaces as distinct from rotating surfaces and which has all
        operating members operating to transfer or transmit the torque
        from a first shaft to a second shaft being of part spherical
        construction and operating within a spherical system. </p>
      <p>[0189] There is claimed a joint having the characteristics
        inherent in the construction disclosed and a joint based upon
        spherical geometry and a joint having the construction first
        described and depicted in FIG. 20.3 and a joint having the
        construction second described and depicted in FIG. 20.6 and
        there is claimed a mounting means as described and set out in
        FIG. 20.5 and also FIG. 20.9. </p>
      <p><i>20. Twentieth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0190] With reference to FIGS. 21, this embodiment provides for
        two instances of the assembly depicted in FIG. 21.3 which is a
        spherical four bar linkage with the extended axes of each of the
        four axis A1, A2, A3 and A4 in the linkage extending to a single
        point and where the arcs between each axis form great circle
        arcs. </p>
      <p>[0191] A mounting means is provided in the centre of the double
        yoke member 5 such that the two instances of the assembly
        depicted in FIG. 21.3 are held within double yoke member 5 in
        relationship to each other as depicted in FIG. 21.4. In FIG.
        21.4 points P1 and P2 represent the centre of cruciform members
        1 and 2 respectively, C1 and C2 are great circles of spheres
        centred upon points P1 and P2 respectively. </p>
      <p>[0192] A pin (not shown) extends from shaft members 3 and 4
        such that the axis of each such pin extends radial from point P1
        and P2 respectively when assembled and forms the axis for axis
        A3 in each instance of the assembly depicted in FIG. 21.3. </p>
      <p>[0193] It will be observed that with such an assembly if means
        are provided to cause both instances of the assembly depicted in
        FIG. 21.3 to move uniformly with operation of the joint then the
        angle between shaft 1 and double yoke member 5 will remain the
        same as the angle between shaft 4 and double yoke member 5 and
        the necessary requirements for a constant velocity joint of the
        double Cardan type will have been satisfied. </p>
      <p>[0194] One method of ensuring that the two instance of the
        assembly depicted in FIG. 21.3 move uniformly is to rigidly
        connect the first instance of member 6 with the second instance
        of member 6 and similarly rigidly connect the two instances of
        member 7. </p>
      <p>[0195] One method of rigidly connecting each instance of member
        6 to each other is to provide a single member as shown in FIG.
        21.5 where pins 10 and 11 provide the axis for each of the two
        instances of axis A2 and hole 12 is axis A1. </p>
      <p>[0196] It will be observed without further illustration that
        the two instances of member 7 may also be constructed as a
        single component as in FIG. 21.5. </p>
      <p><i>21. Twenty-First Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0197] With reference to FIGS. 22, a further embodiment is
        described for constraining the mechanism of the seventeenth
        embodiment so that the spherical triangles formed by that
        mechanism remain identical to one another with operation of the
        joint. </p>
      <p>[0198] FIG. 22.1 hereof is a further depiction of the mechanism
        depicted in FIG. 18.12 thereof. FIG. 22.2 hereof is a depiction
        of the mechanism disclosed in the eighteenth embodiment. FIG.
        22.3 hereof is an exploded view of a constant velocity joint
        according to the disclosures of the seventeenth and eighteenth
        embodiments. FIGS. 22.4, 5 and 6 are assembled views of that
        joint with the spherical assembly numbered 7 in FIG. 22.3 being
        the spherical linkage disclosed in substance in the eighteenth
        embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0199] With reference to FIG. 22.1 hereof it will be observed
        that arm or bar 1 is free to pivot about axis A1 and arm or bar
        2 is free to pivot about axis A2 such that angles 4 and 5 which
        are the angles between bar 1 and bar 3 and between bar 2 and bar
        3 respectively may differ from one another. The present
        disclosure is to provide a means whereby angles 4 and 5 are
        continuously essentially identical to one another with the
        result that the two spherical triangles formed by the mechanism
        remain identical to one another. </p>
      <p>[0200] According to the present embodiment, with reference to
        FIG. 22.7 hereof there is provided a mechanism as disclosed in
        FIG. 1 hereof with the addition of a gear wheel 6 interposed
        between arm 1 and arm 2. Arm 1 and arm 2 are each provided with
        gear teeth to mesh with gear wheel 3. With such a mechanism it
        will be observed that angles 4 and 5 will always remain
        substantially identical to one another with the result that the
        spherical triangles formed by the mechanism also remain
        substantially identical to one another. </p>
      <p>[0201] According to the present embodiment therefore there is
        disclosed a centering mechanism as depicted in FIG. 22.7 and
        there is provided a constant velocity joint as depicted in FIGS.
        22.3, 4, 5 and 6 wherein the centering mechanism 7 is replaced
        with the mechanism disclosed in FIG. 22.7 hereof. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY</b> </p>
      <p>Summary of Embodiments </p>
      <p><i>First Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0202] A constant velocity coupling wherein the axes of all
        rotational elements intersect at the intersection of the input
        and output shaft axes. The coupling is provided with a control
        yoke and control mechanism wherein the control yoke defines an
        axis of rotation bisecting the supplementary angle between the
        input shaft axis and output shaft axis of the coupling. </p>
      <p>[0203] The control mechanism is in the form of a double scissor
        assembly where all linkages have axes radial to the intersection
        point of the input and output shaft axes, the pivoting centers
        of the control linkages effectively lying at the vertices of
        equal spherical triangles. </p>
      <p><i>Second Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0204] A constant velocity coupling wherein all elements are
        identical to those of the first embodiment except that the
        control mechanism consists of a geared mechanism where two
        linkage arms provided with gear segments mesh with a central
        gear, this assembly controlling the axis of the control yoke to
        lie on the bisector of the supplementary angle between the input
        and output shaft axes. </p>
      <p><i>Third Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0205] A constant velocity coupling wherein either the scissor
        mechanism of the first embodiment, or the geared mechanism of
        the second embodiment controlling the axis of the control yoke
        to lie on the bisector of the supplementary angle between the
        input and output shaft axes but where the inner and outer yokes
        are modified from a full circular form to a partial segment
        form. </p>
      <p><i>Fourth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0206] A constant velocity coupling where the rotational
        elements supporting the ends of the input and output shafts are
        separated by a connecting tube and where the connecting tube
        supports a control mechanism such that the tube axis is
        constrained to lie on the bisector of the supplementary angle
        between the input and output shafts. </p>
      <p><i>Fifth Embodiment</i> </p>
      <p>[0207] A constant velocity coupling in which the angle between
        the input and output shafts may be varied from time to time by a
        control mechanism, the control mechanism further constraining
        the orientation of a control yoke such that its axis of rotation
        lies on the bisector of the supplementary angle between the
        input and output shafts. The coupling incorporates a swash plate
        variable hydraulic displacement device. </p>
      <p><i>Additional Embodiments</i> </p>
      <p>[0208] In one form an embodiment provides for a constant
        velocity coupling in a first form in which a control mechanism
        may be tailored to a particular fixed angle between the axes of
        the input shaft and the output shaft using a limited assembly of
        control elements. The control elements are based on spherical
        geometrical forms. </p>
      <p>[0209] In a second form, an extended assembly of similar
        control elements are adapted to provide a control mechanism for
        a constant velocity coupling in which the angle between input
        and output shafts is variable. </p>
      <p>[0210] In a further embodiment a constant velocity coupling is
        provided having a control mechanism of the form described in the
        first preferred embodiment. The initial form (as disclosed in
        PR5731) comprised one half of the scissor mechanism of the first
        embodiment with the modification to the double scissor system in
        PR5992. </p>
      <p>[0211] In a further embodiment, the conditions for a constant
        velocity coupling are realized through a variety of linkages to
        constrain the alignment of the axis of rotation of a control
        yoke such that the axis bisects the supplementary angle between
        the axes of the input and output shafts of the coupling. The
        control linkages are formed as elements based on arcs of
        spherical triangles. </p>
      <p>[0212] In a further embodiment a linkage mechanism is disclosed
        which is a novel realization of the principles of an inner and
        outer yoke system or gimbal system such as commonly used in
        double Cardan joints. It is in the form of the yoke mechanism as
        utilized in the fourth preferred embodiment. </p>
      <p>[0213] Yet a further embodiment discloses a centering mechanism
        for a constant velocity coupling comprising a system of
        intermeshing pinion gears and levers to control the angular
        relationship between the two halves of the coupling. </p>
      <p>[0214] With particular reference to the first embodiment
        described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4 it will be noted that a
        significant number of the characteristics referred to in the
        introductory portion of the detailed description with reference
        to FIG. 23 are exhibited by this embodiment including: [0215]
        (a) The control yoke in conjunction with the scissor mechanism
        and forming the control mechanism for the gimbal assembly
        comprising the inner and outer yoke operates entirely
        symmetrically about the supplementary angle bisector 308
        (designated C in FIG. 4); [0216] (b) All axes of the control
        mechanism pass through the coupling centre 307 (also termed
        geometric centre); [0217] (c) The otherwise substantially
        unconstrained linkage between the input and output shafts
        provided by the gimbal mechanism in the form of the inner yoke
        and outer yoke is constrained by the control mechanism in the
        form of the control yoke, in this instance so that axis YY
        (referred to in FIG. 1) lies on the homokinetic plane. </p>
      <p>[0218] The above describes only some embodiments of the present
        invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the
        art, can be made thereto without departing from the scope and
        spirit of the present invention. </p>
