            The world frets about the rise in fuel prices and the
            environmental damage caused by motor pollution. An inventor
            in Kiryat Gat says he has the solution.<br>
            <br>
            Hugo Tour, a retired Israel Air Force officer, claims the
            engine he's been working on for three years is the biggest
            breakthrough in motor technology since the invention of the
            internal combustion engine by Nikolaus Otto in 1876.<br>
            <br>
            At his home laboratory in Kiryat Gat, Tour has built a
            working bench-prototype of a split cycle engine, which he
            predicts will <span style="font-weight: bold;">improve
              engine efficiency by up to 100 percent and reduce carbon
              emissions by 50% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 80%. He
              also says his engine will work with any type of fuel </span>and




            can be easily produced with slight modification of existing
            engines.<br>
            <br>
            Two years ago, Tour, with the aid of his son Oded, a
            biophysicist who lives in San Diego, and a small group of
            investors, decided to found a company to bring his idea to
            fruition. The company was listed in the United States and so
            far has secured three patents.<br>
            <br>
            "The existing motor is the worst thing a person could come
            up with, but all the other motors are even worse," Tour said
            recently. "The internal combustion engine takes heat energy
            and converts it to kinetic energy. In the process, 80% of
            the energy is wasted. It is a wonderful machine for
            producing stench and pollution, but we are all content to
            utilize only 20%. The question is, can it be done
            otherwise?"<br>
            <br>
            Tour discovered that the biggest problem with the internal
            combustion engine is not in its mechanics but in the
            thermodynamic theory on which it is based. In the
            traditional internal combustion engine the energy transfer
            takes place in a single cylinder, where four actions take
            place: Intake - the piston sits at the bottom of the
            cylinder, air and fuel fill it up; compression - the piston
            pushes up, compressing the air and fuel; combustion - spark
            ignites the air and fuel mixture, producing a small
            explosion that pushes the piston down to its original
            position; and exhaust - gases and unburned fuel are vented
            from the cylinder.<br>
            <br>
            In Tour's model the process is divided into two parts, each
            taking place in a separate cylinder. It is this separation,
            says Tour, which is the secret to the engines increased
            efficiency.<br>
            <br>
            "The common four-stroke design is limited in how efficient
            it can become since it hosts, in the same location,
            dramatically conflicting thermodynamic strokes:
            Intake/compression, which should be optimized in a cold
            environment, and combustion/exhaust, which should be
            optimized in a hot environment. All reside in the same
            cylinder. The basic design is compromised," Oded Tour said.
            "We have a basic engine design with a superior thermal
            management layout - the opposed cylinders split the cycle,
            enabling optimization of the cold strokes at a cold
            environment and the hot strokes at a hot environment."<br>
            <br>
            In essence, what Hugo Tour did, was take two off-the-shelf
            motors and fuse them so as they face each other. In his
            design, the air and fuel flow into the first (cold)
            cylinder, where they are compressed, pass through a
            timed-opening valve, and flow into the second (hot)
            cylinder, where the explosion takes place, pushing the
            piston which drives the crankshaft, thus producing motion.<br>
            <br>
            "The increase in efficiency is obtained at multiple stages
            of the thermodynamic cycle. Firstly, it is more efficient to
            compress cold air than hot air.<br>
            <br>
            "Secondly, the elevated temperature in the combustion
            chamber allows extraction of more mechanical work by
            elongation and widening of the combustion chamber,
            increasing the amount of energy extracted during the
            expansion stroke.<br>
            <br>
            "And thirdly, higher grade waste-energy will be generated at
            the combustor that can be more efficiently converted into
            additional mechanical work with a secondary system,"
            explained Oded Tour.<br>
            <br>
            The company has the backing of scientists at the University
            of California, Irvine, and San Diego State University and is
            applying for a US government grant together with the
            Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<br>
            <br>
            Dr. Joseph Katz is the chairman of the department of
            aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at San Diego
            State. He started at the Technion-Israel Institute of
            Technology, designing motors for the Merkava tank. After the
            Technion, he worked for NASA on its 40 by 80 foot (12.2 by
            14.4 meter), full-scale wind tunnel. He is also chief
            aerodynamicist for Devon motor works, an American company
            that is working on a prototype supercar based on the Dodge
            Viper.<br>
            <br>
            He was impressed with the alteration to the expansion
            capacities of the cylinder. When there was more room for the
            gases to expand in the chamber, you get a better usage of
            the energy, Katz explained. "They had elements that stand
            out above what you normally see with inventors. I liked it,"
            he said.<br>
            <br>
            Katz said that if the Tour engine had been invented a
            hundred years ago, when the now-standard auto-cycle engine
            was, then it would have conquered the market, but today
            things were different and decisions were more political.
            "They can probably do well in niche markets where the
            starting costs are not so high," he said.<br>
            <br>
            The company's short-term objective is to secure government
            and private sector support to continue development and to
            produce a full sized state-of-the-art prototype, which can
            then be taken to the market.<br>
            <br>
            Up until now, the project has been funded by personal
            investment on Tour's part and with the aid of a small group
            of Angel investors. Shlomo Caspi came into the picture after
            meeting Oded Tour at the San Diego Jewish Film Festival. "I
            saw he was reading a book in Hebrew and we got to talking,"
            Caspi said.<br>
            <br>
            Caspi, an Israeli immigrant to the US who has had success
            investing in biotech products, was immediately drawn to the
            idea of a new engine. Today he is the company's chief
            financial officer. "So far the investors have put $400,000
            into the development. Some of the consultants were paid in
            options," he said.<br>
            <br>
            Caspi said they have had problems raising the $3 million
            necessary to produce the next prototype. They've approached
            the leading venture capitalists, all of who have shown
            enthusiastic interest, but because of the tough economic
            times, none are taking on new projects, he said.<br>
            <br>
            Tour said the company's long-term vision was to bring a
            family of high fuel efficiency engines to market.<br>
            <br>
            The engine that Henry Ford built in 1906 and the engine you
            drive with today, delivers more or less the same kilometers
            per litre. Its time for a change," Tour said.<br>

          </small></font>Instead of using the same cylinder for all four
        strokes, we propose a split-cycle engine configuration in which,
        we separate the four strokes between two cylinders:<br>
        <br>
        On the left, Intake and compression, the two cold strokes, take
        place in a ‘cold' cylinder<br>
        <br>
        On the right, Combustion and exhaust, the two hot strokes, are
        hosted by a ‘hot' cylinder<br>
        <br>
        Cycle dynamics: following Intake and Compression strokes at the
        ‘cold' cylinder the compressed working fluid is transferred
        through a timely opened interstage valve to a newly cleared
        space at the ‘hot' cylinder for the Power stroke. The Exhaust
        stroke follows the power stroke and ends one complete split
        cycle. Notice that as the Power stroke occurs, the Intake stroke
        of the following cycle commence.<br>

        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
          Tour Engine, Inc. has designed and prototyped an internal
          combustion engine that is predicted to dramatically increase
          fuel efficiency by 30-80%, while reducing CO<sub>2</sub> and
          NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Today’s gasoline engines convert
          only 20-30% of the energy in fuel into kinetic energy; most of
          the remaining 70-80% is rejected to the atmosphere as heat. By
          comparison, the Tour Engine’s patented</span><span
          style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span
          style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">design





          is projected to convert 40-55% of the fuel’s energy into
          kinetic energy. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New
          Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Because our revolutionary technology
          uses conventional cylinders and pistons, the engines can be
          readily manufactured in today’s production plants and quickly
          adopted for use in a variety of applications ranging from
          power generation to vehicle propulsion. Figure 1 depicts the
          basic configuration of the Tour engine<br>
        </span><br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img
            src="Tour_Engine_Pic%201.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>. Tour engine
          opposed-cylinder split-cycle design separates the location of
          the cold stokes (intake/compression) from the hot strokes
          (expansion/exhaust). The cold cylinder on the left has an
          intake port while the hot cylinder on the right is larger than
          the cold one, enabling a larger expansion ratio, and has the
          exhaust port. The interstage valve (not shown, but is
          displayed on Figure 2) is located where the two cylinder heads
          overlap (yellow highlight). Shifting the two cylinders
          relative to each other limits the heat flow between the two
          cylinders by minimizing the contact area. This shift also
          exposes sufficient room for a mechanical actuation system for
          the interstage valve. Multi-cylinder configurations are
          feasible by stacking the above cylinder pair unit. A pair of
          crankshaft connecting rods that couple the power piston to the
          compression piston is depicted. This coupling could be
          achieved by a variety of means including helical gear wheels,
          timing belts etc.<br>

        <br>
        By design, the Tour engine mitigates the thermodynamic
        inefficiencies of the current 4-stroke engine by separating the
        4-stroke process between two cylinders. The two cold strokes,
        the intake and compression, occur in a relatively cold cylinder
        while the two hot stokes, combustion and exhaust, take place in
        a relatively hot cylinder.<span>&nbsp; </span>An interstage
        valve located between the two cylinders opens in a timely
        fashion to allow the flow of the compressed charge from the cold
        cylinder to the hot combustion cylinder. Since this interstage
        valve is designed to induce maximal flow and complete transfer
        of the working fluid it results in minimal losses.<br>

        <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>. Panels <strong>A-D</strong>
          depict a simplified cross-sectional view of the engine
          configuration while performing the intake, compression,
          combustion and exhaust strokes. Notice that there is a
          phase-lag between the two pistons with the hot piston (right)
          leading and that the cylinders are design in a way to optimize
          the strokes they host <strong>(A) Intake -</strong> a
          snapshot of the left piston about halfway through the intake
          stroke with the intake valve open. <strong>(B) Compression -
          </strong>after the intake stroke is completed, the intake
          valve closes and the left piston compress the working
          fluid.&nbsp; At this snapshot, the hot piston is leading the
          cold piston and has almost completed the exhaust stroke of the
          preceding cycle (n-1; the magnitude of the phase lag can be
          fine-tune. Notice that the two pistons of the Tour engine do
          not have any “clearance” at Top Dead Center (TDC). The hot
          piston continues its movement all the way to the cylinder
          head, clearing away completely the burned working fluid. Only
          after the power piston reaches its TDC, does the exhaust valve
          close and the interstage valve opens to permit the transfer of
          the compressed working fluid from the cold chamber to the hot
          chamber. Again, notice that also the compression piston does
          not have a “clearance” (the left piston in panel <strong>C</strong>),
therefore





          all the compressed working fluid is transferred to the
          combustion chamber. <strong>(C) Combustion –</strong> in one
          example configuration, fuel is injected into the hot chamber
          and combustion evolves while the compressed working fluid is
          transferred to the combustor and the interstage valve is
          closed. Following closure of the interstage valve, the power
          stroke will progress in the right chamber, while
          simultaneously in the chamber on the left, the next cycle will
          commence with the opening of the intake valve. <strong>(D)
            Exhaust -</strong> following the completion of the power
          stroke, the exhaust valve opens and the power piston moves to
          the left to completely clear the burned working fluid.&nbsp;
          Notice that at any given time the Tour engine is
          simultaneously performing two consecutive cycles. In Panel <strong>D</strong>,
          the compression of the following cycle (n+1) is depicted. <br>

          efficient engine with a more complete expansion of the hot
          combustion products. The following list summarizes the Tour
          engine’s advantages compared to a standard spark ignited
          engine or prior split-cycle designs:<strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <strong>Intake</strong>: colder cylinder walls increases the
          amount of charge that is inducted<strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <strong>Compression</strong>: decreases the amount of energy
          that is invested to compress the cold charge due to colder
          cylinder walls<strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <strong>Transfer</strong>: working fluid transfer via the
          interstage valve <span>is design properly to permit free
            flow. By eliminating the need for a connecting tube/ passage
            we almost eliminated completely potential loss</span><strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <strong>Fuel mixture</strong>: the fuel is transferred via the
          interstage valve during compression (or directly injected to
          the combustion cylinder), greatly promoting a robust mixing
          and turbulence, ensuring homogeneous combustion<strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <strong>Combustion</strong>: occurs on every revelation.
          Compared to the common engine that fires every other
          revolution, the hot cylinder of the Tour engine hosts double
          the combustion, while the cold cylinder does not host
          combustion. Therefore, the two engines have the same rate of
          combustion per cylinders<strong><br>

          <strong>Combustion</strong>: the dedicated combustor will have
          higher wall temperature<span>&nbsp; </span>(partial
          insulation/less cooling). We can permit the temperature to be
          at a higher steady-state level since the combustor does not
          host intake and compression. The hotter combustor promotes a
          more complete combustion resulting in minimization of HC and
          CO emissions. It also reduced heat losses from the working
          fluid to the cylinder walls due to reduced temperature
          differential<strong><br>

            the combustor piston/cylinder surfaces we can build an
            optimized low-heat-rejection Tour engine that would boost
            efficiency. Conventional </span><span>4-stroke </span><span>ceramic
engines,





            while being promising in theory, failed to live to the
            expectations. This is because their expansion ratio was
            coupled to their compression ratio and therefore the extra
            heat could not be realized and was rejected in the form of
            elevated exhaust gasses. The second reason was that the hot
            ceramic surfaces radiated (acting as a heat capacitor) heat
            back to the working fluid during the intake/compression
            strokes decreasing the cycle efficiency. The Tour engine
            uncouples the expansion ratio from the compression ratio and
            hosts the cold strokes in a dedicated cylinder, therefore
            overcoming the two main reasons ceramic technology failed to
            display a quantum leap in&nbsp;</span><span> efficiency</span><span>.</span><span><strong><br>

          expansion ratio can be achieved by increasing the bore and/or
          the stroke of the power cylinder. Similar but better than the

            (eliminating potential loss) and the power piston clears

            charge transfer, the maximum compression pressure occurs
            significantly after hot piston TDC (20<sup>O</sup> - 30<sup>O</sup>).




            The point of maximum compression is the most effective point

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The present invention relates generally to internal combustion
          engines and, more specifically, it relates to a steam enhanced
          double piston cycle engine (SE-DPCE) that is more efficient
          than conventional combustion engines. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the Related
            Art </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          It can be appreciated that internal combustion engines are
          ubiquitous today and have been in use for over 100 years.
          Typically, an internal combustion engine includes one or more
          cylinders. Each cylinder includes a single piston that
          performs four strokes, commonly referred to as the intake,
          compression, combustion/power, and exhaust strokes, which
          together form a complete cycle of conventional pistons. <br>
          <br>
          The main problem with a conventional internal combustion
          engine is low fuel efficiency. It is estimated that more than
          one half of the potential fuel thermal energy created by
          conventional engines dissipates through the engine structure
          without adding any useful mechanical work. A major reason for
          this thermal waste is the essential cooling requirements of
          conventional engines. The cooling system (e.g., radiator)
          alone dissipates heat at a greater rate and amount than the
          total heat actually transformed into useful work. Another
          problem with conventional internal combustion engines is their
          inability to increase efficiencies while using heat
          regeneration or recycling methods to provide higher combustion
          temperatures. <br>
          <br>
          Another reason why conventional engines suffer from efficiency
          problems is that the high-temperature in the cylinder during
          the intake and compression strokes makes the piston work
          harder and, hence, less efficient during these strokes. <br>
          <br>
          Another disadvantage associated with existing internal
          combustion engines is their inability to further increase
          combustion temperatures and compression ratios; although
          raising chamber temperatures during the power stroke and
          increasing compression ratios would improve efficiencies. <br>
          <br>
          Another problem with conventional engines is their incomplete
          chemical combustion process causing harmful exhaust emissions.
          <br>
          <br>
          While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose
          to which they address, they are not as efficient as the
          proposed SE-DPCE that utilizes temperature differentiated dual
          cylinders that divide the conventional four strokes of a
          piston into two low temperature strokes (intake and
          compression) and two high temperature strokes (power and
          exhaust), performed by each of the respective dual pistons,
          while further utilizing the heat generated by the high
          temperature strokes to generate steam, which is used to
          convert additional thermal energy to mechanical energy. <br>
          <br>
          Although others have previously disclosed dual-piston
          combustion engine configurations, none provide the substantial
          efficiency and performance improvements of the present
          invention. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,372,216 to Casaday
          discloses a dual piston combustion engine in which cylinders
          and pistons are arranged in respective pairs. The piston of
          the firing cylinder moves in advance of the piston of the
          compression cylinder. U.S. Pat. No. 3,880,126 to Thurston et
          al. discloses a two-stroke cycle split cylinder internal
          combustion engine. The piston of the induction cylinder moves
          somewhat less than one-half stroke in advance of the piston of
          the power cylinder. The induction cylinder compresses a
          charge, and transfers the charge to the power cylinder where
          it is mixed with a residual charge of burned products from the
          previous cycle, and further compressed before igniting. U.S.
          Pat. Application No. 2003/0015171 A1 to Scuderi discloses a
          four-stroke cycle internal combustion engine. A power piston
          within a first cylinder is connected to a crankshaft and
          performs power and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle. A
          compression piston within a second cylinder is also connected
          to the crankshaft and performs the intake and compression
          strokes of the same four-stroke cycle during the same rotation
          of the crankshaft. The power piston of the first cylinder
          moves in advance of the compression piston of the second
          cylinder. U.S. Pat. No. 6,880,501 to Suh et al. discloses an
          internal combustion engine that has a pair of cylinders, each
          cylinder containing a piston connected to a crankshaft. One
          cylinder is adapted for intake and compression strokes. The
          other cylinder is adapted for power and exhaust strokes. U.S.
          Pat. No. 5,546,897 to Brackett discloses a multi-cylinder
          reciprocating piston internal combustion engine that can
          perform a two, four, or diesel engine power cycle. <br>
          <br>
          However, these references fail to disclose how to
          differentiate cylinder temperatures to effectively isolate the
          firing (power) cylinders from the compression cylinders and
          from the surrounding environment. The references further fail
          to disclose how to minimize mutual temperature influence
          between the cylinders and the surrounding environment. In
          addition, the references fail to disclose engine improvements
          that further raise the temperature of the firing cylinder and
          lower the temperature of the compression cylinder beyond that
          of conventional combustion engine cylinders to enhance engine
          efficiency and performance. Specifically, minimizing
          temperature of the compression cylinder allows for a reduced
          compression work investment, while increasing temperature in
          the power cylinder allows for increased heat regeneration. In
          addition, the separate cylinders disclosed in these references
          are all connected by a transfer valve or intermediate
          passageway of some sort that yields a volume of "dead space"
          between cylinders, permitting gases to accumulate in between
          cylinders and further degrading the efficiency of the engine.
          Additionally, none of these prior art references discussed
          above teach an opposed or "V" cylinder and crankshaft
          configuration that minimizes dead space between cylinders
          while isolating the cylinders to maintain an improved
          temperature differential between the cylinders. Finally, none
          of these prior art references disclose splitting the
          combustion/power chamber into two separate chambers and
          utilizing steam energy in an outer chamber for additional
          engine efficiency and work. Additionally, none of the prior
          art references disclose or suggest a secondary system,
          enveloping the primary combustion chamber, that converts the
          excessive thermal energy produced by the hot chamber into
          additional kinetic energy. <br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,894 to Clarke discloses a dual compression
          and dual expansion internal combustion engine. An internal
          housing containing two pistons moves within an external
          housing forming separate chambers for compression and
          expansion. However, Clarke contains a single chamber that
          executes all of the engine strokes preventing isolation and/or
          improved temperature differentiation of cylinders such as
          those disclosed in the present invention. Clarke also fails to
          disclose forming a separate chamber for utilizing additional
          energy (e.g., heated air or steam) generated by excess engine
          heat. <br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,974 to Thomas discloses a combustion
          engine comprising a combustion cylinder formed in part of
          material which can withstand high temperatures in a ringless
          section containing a power piston and connected to a ringed
          section maintaining a relatively low temperature containing
          another piston. However, elevated temperatures in the entire
          Thomas engine reside not only throughout the combustion and
          exhaust strokes, but also during part of the compression
          stroke. Further, Thomas fails to disclose a method of
          isolating the engine cylinders in an opposed or "V"
          configuration to permit improved temperature differentiation
          and discloses an engine containing substantial dead space in
          the air intake port connecting the cylinders. Finally, Thomas
          fails to disclose forming a separate chamber for utilizing
          additional energy (e.g., heated air or steam) generated by
          excess engine heat. <br>
          <br>
          In these respects, the SE-DPCE according to the present
          invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts
          and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides a
          dramatically improved internal combustion engine that is more
          efficient than conventional internal combustion engines. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known
          types of internal combustion engine now present in the prior
          art, the newly proposed invention provides a SE-DPCE
          combustion engine utilizing temperature differentiated
          cylinders that converts fuel into energy or work in a more
          efficient manner than conventional combustion engines, as well
          as converting excessive engine heat into additional useful
          work. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment of the invention, a steam enhanced dual
          piston cycle engine (SE-DPCE) utilizes temperature
          differentiated cylinders that convert fuel into energy or work
          in a more efficient manner than conventional combustion
          engines, as described in U.S. provisional application Ser. No.
          60/661,195, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference
          herein, and further enhances the DPCE apparatus by utilizing
          engine heat to create and convert steam energy into additional
          useful engine work. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment of the present invention, the engine
          includes a first cylinder coupled to a second cylinder, a
          first piston positioned within the first cylinder and
          configured to perform intake and compression strokes, and a
          second piston positioned within the second cylinder and
          configured to perform power and exhaust strokes.
          Alternatively, the first and second cylinders can be
          considered as a single cylinder having two separate chambers
          coupled to each other within the single cylinder, wherein the
          first piston resides in the first chamber and the second
          piston resides in the second chamber. <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, the engine further includes an intake
          valve coupled to the first cylinder, an exhaust valve coupled
          to the second cylinder and an interstage valve that couples an
          internal chamber of the first cylinder to an internal chamber
          of the second cylinder. <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, the engine includes two piston
          connecting rods, a compression crankshaft, a power crankshaft
          and two crankshaft connecting rods. The connecting rods
          connect respective pistons to their respective crankshafts.
          The compression crankshaft converts rotational movement into
          reciprocating movement of the first piston. The power
          crankshaft converts second piston reciprocating movement into
          engine rotational output movement. The crankshaft connecting
          rods transfer the power crankshaft rotation into compression
          crankshaft rotation. <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, the engine includes a fuel injector,
          water/steam inlet valves and water/steam exhaust valve. The
          first compression cylinder houses the compression piston, the
          intake valve, and part of the interstage valve. The second
          power cylinder comprises two separate cylinders: an outer
          cylinder and an inner cylinder. Within the outer and inner
          cylinder resides a dual piston: a disc shaped inner piston and
          a ring shaped outer piston. In addition, the second power
          cylinder includes an exhaust valve, an outer exhaust shell
          (wrapped exhaust pipe), a heat isolation layer, part of the
          interstage valve, fuel injector, spark plug, steam/water valve
          (and/or injectors), and steam/water/air exhaust valve. The
          first compression piston performs the intake and the
          compression engine strokes. The inner power piston performs
          the fuel combustion power stroke and the exhaust (burned
          gaseous) relief stroke. The outer power piston produces power
          and absorbs engine excessive heat by utilizing hot compressed
          air with or without steam/water. The connecting rods connect
          the compression piston and both power pistons to their
          respective crankshafts. The compression crankshaft converts
          rotational movement into compression piston reciprocating
          movement. The power crankshaft converts inner and outer power
          pistons reciprocating movement into engine rotational output
          movement. The crankshaft connecting rods transfer the power
          crankshaft rotation into compression crankshaft rotation. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, the engine intake valve includes a
          shaft having a conic shaped sealing surface, same as used in
          most four stroke engines. The exhaust valve includes a shaft
          having a conic shaped sealing surface, same as in most four
          stroke engines. The interstage valve (in the preferable
          embodiment) is composed of a shaft having a conic shaped
          sealing surface. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, a method of improving combustion engine
          efficiency includes separating the intake and compression
          chamber (cool strokes) from the combustion and exhaust chamber
          (hot strokes), and thus enabling reduced temperature during
          intake and compression strokes and increased temperature
          during the combustion stroke, thereby increasing engine
          efficiency. <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, a method of improving engine
          efficiency includes minimizing or reducing the temperature
          during intake and compression strokes. The lower the incoming
          and compressed air/charge temperature is, the higher the
          engine efficiency will be. <br>
          <br>
          In yet another embodiment, a method of improving engine
          efficiency includes regenerating and utilizing exhaust thermal
          energy. <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, a dual piston combustion engine is
          provided that greatly reduces external cooling requirements
          which in turn increases the potential heat available for heat
          output work conversion during the power stroke, which also
          burns fuel more efficiently and thereby decreases harmful
          emissions. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, a method of providing an improved
          efficiency combustion engine includes performing the intake
          and compression in a first cylinder and performing the power
          and exhaust strokes in a second cylinder, wherein the first
          cylinder is maintained at a cooler temperature than the second
          cylinder. In a further embodiment, the method also includes
          injecting the compressed air and fuel mixture from the first
          cylinder into the second cylinder, thereby cooling the second
          cylinder. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, a steam enhanced dual piston combustion
          engine additionally comprises a ring-shaped chamber in the
          combustion cylinder to receive compressed gases and/or liquids
          utilizing excess engine heat to produce additional power and
          increase engine efficiency. In a further embodiment a steam
          enhanced dual piston combustion engine additionally comprises
          a ring-shaped chamber in the compression cylinder to
          facilitate efficient transfer of compressed gases and/or
          liquids to the steam chamber. In an additional embodiment, a
          steam enhanced dual piston combustion engine contains two
          separate power producing systems, with a primary system
          utilizing fuel-air combustion and secondary system utilizing
          excess engine heat for steam power generation. <br>

          power cylinder 02 is a piston engine cylinder that houses the
          power piston 04, the exhaust valve 11, part of the interstage
          valve 12 and a spark plug (not shown) located in front of the
          surface of power piston 04 facing the combustion chamber in
          cylinder 02. The compression piston 03 serves the intake and
          the compression engine strokes. The power piston 04 serves the
          power and the exhaust strokes. The connecting rods 05 and 06
          connect their respective pistons to their respective
          crankshafts. The compression crankshaft 07 converts rotational
          movements into compression piston 03 reciprocating movement.
          The reciprocating movement of the power piston 04 is converted
          into rotational movement of the power crankshaft 08, which is
          in turn converted to engine rotational movement or work (i.e.,
          crankshaft 08 serves as the DPCE output shaft). The crankshaft
          connecting rod 09 translates the rotation of power crankshaft
          08 into rotation of the compression crankshaft 07. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, the intake valve 10 is composed of a shaft
          having a conic shaped sealing surface, the same as is used for
          intake valves in most conventional four stroke engines. The
          exhaust valve 11 is composed of a shaft having a conic shaped
          sealing surface, the same as is used for exhaust valves in
          most conventional four stroke engines. The interstage valve 12
          is also composed of a shaft having a conic shaped sealing
          surface. <br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 1, within the compression cylinder 01
          inner cavity B is a compression piston 03. The compression
          piston 03 moves relative to the compression cylinder 01 in the
          direction as indicated by the illustrated arrows. Within the
          power cylinder 02 inner cavity C is a power piston 04. The
          power piston 04 moves relative to the power cylinder 02 in the
          direction as indicated by the illustrated arrows. The
          compression cylinder 01 and the compression piston 03 define
          chamber B. The power cylinder 02 and the power piston 04
          define chamber C. In a preferred embodiment, the power piston
          pressure surface has a shaped hollow cavity 26 (see also FIG.
          12) that supplements chamber C and functions as an additional
          combustion chamber volume during combustion. Chamber B through
          an interstage mechanical operated valve 12 is in fluid
          communication with chamber C. Compression cylinder 01 has an
          intake valve 10. Chamber B through intake valve 10 is in fluid
          communication with carbureted fuel/air charge A. Power
          cylinder 02 has an exhaust valve 11. Chamber C through exhaust
          valve 11 is in fluid communication with ambient air D. When in
          open position, exhaust valve 11 allows exhaust gases to
          exhale. During a combustion stroke the power piston 04 pushes
          the power connecting rod 06, causing the power crankshaft 08
          to rotate clockwise. During an exhaust stroke, inertial forces
          (initiated by flywheel mass--not shown) cause the power
          crankshaft 08 to continue its clockwise rotation, and cause
          the power connecting rod 06 to move power piston 04, which in
          turn exhales burnt fuel exhaust through valve 11. The power
          crankshaft 08 rotation through a crankshaft connecting rod 09
          articulates the compression crankshaft 07 for synchronous
          rotation (i.e., both crankshafts rotate at the same speed and
          dynamic angles). In one embodiment, both pistons, the power
          piston 04 and the compression piston 03 pass through their top
          dead center (TDC) positions and through their bottom dead
          center (BDC) positions at the same time. In alternative
          embodiments, depending on desired timing configurations, the
          relative positions of the power piston 04 and the compression
          piston 03 may be phase-shifted by a desired amount. In one
          embodiment, the DPCE dual cylinder apparatus utilizes
          conventional pressurized cooling and oil lubrication methods
          and systems (not shown). Although in embodiments according to
          the present invention the power chamber C structure components
          (such as the cylinder 02 and piston 04) maintain a much higher
          temperature than conventional combustion engines, in one
          embodiment, the components of the power chamber C are
          temperature controlled using a cooling system. Moreover, some
          or all of the components may be fabricated out of
          high-temperature resistant materials such as ceramics, carbon,
          or stainless steel. In further embodiments, the DPCE apparatus
          can utilize well-known high voltage timing and spark plug
          electrical systems (not shown) as well as an electrical
          starter motor to control spark plug ignitions, timing, and
          engine initial rotation. <br>
          <br>
          As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 9, as an electrical starter
          engages DPCE output shaft 6' (FIG. 15), both crankshafts 07
          and 08 start their clockwise rotation and both pistons 03 and
          04 begin their reciprocating motion. As illustrated in FIG. 5,
          the compression piston 03 and the power piston 04 move in the
          direction that increases chamber B and chamber C volume. Since
          intake valve 10 is in its open position and because at this
          stage chamber B volume constantly increases, carbureted fuel
          or fresh air charge (when using a fuel injection system) flows
          from point A (which represents carburetor output port, for
          example) through intake valve 10 into chamber B. As shown in
          FIGS. 6 through 8, respectively, chamber B volume increases
          while fuel--air charge flows in. As compression piston 03
          reaches its BDC point, intake valve 10 closes trapping chamber
          B air--fuel charge content. While crankshafts clockwise
          rotation goes on, and as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 1 through 3
          respectively, chamber B volume decreases and its now trapped
          air--fuel charge temperature and pressure increases. As the
          compression piston 03 approaches a predetermined point (FIG.
          3), interstage valve 12 opens and chamber B air--fuel charge
          flows into chamber C. As the compression piston approaches its
          TDC point (according to some embodiments some delay or advance
          may be introduced), the interstage valve 12 simultaneously
          closes and a spark plug firing occurs. <br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 5 through 8 illustrate the power stroke. As combustion
          occurs chamber C pressure increases forcefully pushing power
          piston 04 which in turn moves connecting rod 06 to rotate
          power crankshaft 08, which is coupled to a DPCE output shaft
          06'. Meanwhile, as compression piston 03 is pushed back from
          its TDC position, intake valve 10 reopens allowing a new air
          fuel charge A to be sucked into chamber B. <br>
          <br>
          The exhaust stroke begins when power piston 04 reaches its BDC
          point (FIG. 8). The exhaust valve 11 opens and as chamber C
          volume decreases the burned exhaust gases are pushed out from
          chamber C through open exhaust valve 11 into the ambient
          environment D. <br>
          <br>
          Thus, the DPCE engine divides the strokes performed by a
          single piston and cylinder of convention combustion engines
          into two thermally differentiated cylinders in which each
          cylinder executes half of the four-stroke cycle. A "cold"
          cylinder executes the intake and compression strokes and a
          thermally isolated "hot" cylinder executes the combustion and
          exhaust strokes. Compared to conventional engines, this
          innovative system and process enables the DPCE engine to work
          at higher combustion chamber temperatures and at lower intake
          and compression chamber temperatures. Utilizing higher
          combustion temperatures while maintaining lower intake and
          compression temperatures reduces engine cooling requirements,
          lowers compression energy requirements and thus boosts engine
          efficiency. Additionally, thermally isolating the power
          cylinder from the external environment limits external heat
          losses, allows the reuse of the same heat energy in the next
          stroke, and burns less fuel in each cycle. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, the compression cylinder 01 is similar to a
          conventional piston engine cylinder that houses the
          compression piston 03, the intake valve 10, and part of the
          interstage valve 12. The compression cylinder 01 works in
          conjunction with the compression piston 03 to suck and
          compress incoming air and/or fuel charge. In a preferable
          embodiment the compression cylinder is cooled. FIG. 10 shows
          an air cooled compression cylinder having heat absorbing and
          radiating ribs 20. FIG. 11 shows a liquid cooled compression
          cylinder having liquid coolant passages 22. In preferred
          embodiments, the cooling air source or the liquid coolant
          sources can be the same as well known in the previous art. In
          a preferable embodiment, the compression cylinder 01 and the
          power cylinder 02 should be thermally isolated from each
          other, as well as the surrounding environment. FIG. 26
          illustrates an embodiment in which the two cylinders are
          constructed in dissimilar planes, and thus, exercise minimum
          reciprocal conductivity between the cylinders. <br>
          <br>
          The power cylinder 02 is a piston engine cylinder that houses
          the power piston 02, the exhaust valve 11, part of the
          interstage valve 12, and a spark plug (not shown). The power
          cylinder 02 functions in conjunction with the power piston 04
          to combust a compressed air/fuel mixture within a chamber of
          the cylinder 02 and transfer the resulting energy as
          mechanical work to the power crankshaft 08. During the second
          half of its reciprocating movement cycle, the power piston 04
          works to exhale or push the exhaust gases out from the
          cylinder 02 via the exhaust valve 11. The power cylinder 02
          accommodates a spark plug located in front of the surface of
          power piston 04 facing the combustion chamber in cylinder 02.
          As shown in FIG. 12, in one embodiment, the power piston 04
          has a shaped hollow cavity 26, which serves as a combustion
          chamber. During the exhaust stroke, the power piston 04 pushes
          the burned gases out of the cylinder 02 via exhaust valve 11.
          <br>
          <br>
          In one preferred embodiment, the power cylinder 02 is exhaust
          heated, in addition to being externally thermally isolated.
          FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate exhaust heat utilization as exhaust
          gases, during their exhale stream, conduct heat into power
          cylinder heating passages 24. <br>
          <br>
          As explained above, the compression connecting rod 05 connects
          the compression crankshaft 07 with the compression piston 03
          causing the piston 03 to move relative to the cylinder in a
          reciprocating motion. The power connecting rod 06 connects the
          power crankshaft 08 with the power piston 04. During the
          combustion phase, the power connecting rod 06 transfers the
          piston 04 movement into the power crankshaft 08 causing it to
          rotate. During the exhaust phase, the power crankshaft 08
          rotation and momentum pushes the power piston 04 back toward
          the compression cylinder 01, which causes the burned gases to
          be exhaled via the exhaust valve (exhaust stroke). <br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 13, the compression crankshaft 07 converts
          rotational movement into compression piston 03 reciprocating
          movement. The compression crankshaft 07 connects the
          compression connecting rod 05 (FIG. 1) with the crankshaft
          connecting rod 09. Movement of the crankshaft connecting rod
          09 causes the compression crankshaft 07 to rotate. Compression
          crankshaft 07 rotations produce movement of the compression
          connecting rod 05 that in turn moves the compression piston 03
          relative to its cylinder housing 01 in a reciprocating motion.
          <br>
          <br>
          In various embodiments of the invention, the compression
          crankshaft 07 and power crankshaft 08 structural configuration
          may vary in accordance with desired engine configurations and
          designs. For example, some crankshaft design factors are:
          number of dual cylinders, relative cylinder positioning,
          crankshaft gearing mechanism, and direction of rotation. For
          example, if the compression crankshaft 07 and the power
          crankshaft 08 rotate in the same direction, the axes of the
          crankshafts 07 and 08 should be positioned 180 degrees from
          each other, as illustrated in FIG. 13. Alternatively, if the
          compression and power crankshafts 07 and 08, respectively,
          rotate in opposite directions, both crankshaft axes should be
          positioned in phase with respect to one another, as shown in
          FIG. 14. <br>
          <br>
          The power crankshaft 08 connects the power connecting rod 06
          with the crankshaft connecting rod 09. As combustion occurs,
          the power piston 04 movement, through its power connecting rod
          06, causes the power crankshaft 08, which is also coupled to
          the engine output shaft (not shown), to rotate, which causes
          the connecting rod 09 to rotate the compression crankshaft 07
          and generate reciprocal movement of the compression piston 03.
          <br>
          <br>
          The crankshaft connecting rod 09 connects the power crankshaft
          08 with the compression crankshaft 07 and thus provides both
          crankshafts with synchronous rotation. FIG. 15 illustrates a
          perspective view of the crankshaft connecting rod 09 coupled
          to respective crankshafts 07 and 08, in accordance with one
          embodiment of the invention. The function of the crankshaft
          connecting rod 09 is to link the power crankshaft 08 and the
          compression crankshaft 07. In certain designs, both
          crankshafts 07 and 08 may rotate synchronously and
          respectively relative to each other (same direction, same
          angle). In other designs the two crankshafts 07 and 08 may
          rotate in opposite directions with or without a predetermined
          phase angle. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 17 illustrates perspective view of the connecting rod 09
          coupled to respective crankshafts 07 and 08, which are in turn
          coupled to respective piston connecting rods 05 and 06,
          wherein the crankshafts 07 and 08 are oriented with respect to
          each other so as to provide a predetermined phase difference
          between the otherwise synchronous motion of the pistons 03 and
          04. A predetermined phase difference means that in order to
          achieve a time difference between the compression piston TDC
          position, as illustrated in FIG. 4, and the power piston TDC
          position, a relative piston phase delay or advance can be
          introduced into either piston. FIG. 17 illustrates that the
          piston connecting rods 05 and 06 are out of phase with respect
          to each other so as to provide a desired phase delay or
          advance between the times the pistons 03 and 04 reach their
          respective TDC positions. In one embodiment, a phase delay is
          introduced such that the piston of the power cylinder moves
          slightly in advance of the piston of the compression cylinder,
          permitting the compressed charge to be delivered under nearly
          the full compression stroke and allowing the power piston to
          complete a full exhaust stroke. Such advantages of phase
          delays with the power piston leading the compression piston
          are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 1,372,216 to Casaday and
          U.S. Pat. Application No. 2003/0015171 A1 to Scuderi. In an
          alternative embodiment, an opposite phase delay is introduced
          such that the compression piston moves in advance of the power
          piston, wherein the power piston further compresses the charge
          from the compression cylinder before firing. The benefits of
          this approach are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,880,126 to
          Thurston et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,974 to Thomas. <br>
          <br>
          In an additional embodiment, in order to enforce proper
          direction of rotation of the compression crankshaft 07 and the
          power crankshaft 08, a second crankshaft connecting rod 13 is
          utilized as shown in FIG. 16. <br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 18, an alternative means to establish the
          direction of rotation of the crankshafts 07 and 08, may be
          implemented by having one crankshaft connecting rod 14
          combined with a timing belt or a chain mechanism 15. As
          illustrated in FIG. 19, in another embodiment, a chain
          mechanism or a timing belt mechanism 15 may by itself serve as
          an alternative to any of the above-mentioned crankshaft
          connecting mechanisms. <br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 20 and 21 illustrate alternative mechanisms to replace
          the crankshaft connecting rod 09. FIG. 20 illustrates
          crankshafts connecting gearwheels mechanism 30, comprising
          three gearwheels 32 engaged to each other. In this embodiment,
          both crankshafts 07 and 08 rotate in a unilateral direction
          (utilizing 3 gearwheels). FIG. 21 shows two embodiments of a
          crankshaft connecting gearwheels mechanisms 40 and 42 having
          an even number of gearwheels 32, thereby configured to turn
          crankshafts 07 and 08 in opposite directions. <br>
          In one embodiment, the intake valve 10 is composed of a shaft
          having a conic shaped sealing surface, the same as is used as
          intake valves in most four stroke engines. The intake valve 10
          governs the ambient air or the carbureted air/fuel charge as
          they flow into the compression cylinder 01. The compression
          cylinder 01 has at least one intake valve. In preferred
          embodiments, relative to the compression pistons 03 momentary
          position, the intake valve location, function, timing and
          operation may be similar or identical to the intake valves of
          conventional four strokes internal combustion engines. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, the exhaust valve 11 is composed of a shaft
          having a conic shaped sealing surface, the same as is used in
          exhaust valves in most four stroke engines. The exhaust valve
          11, located on the power cylinder 02 governs burned gaseous
          exhale flow. The power cylinder 02 has at least one exhaust
          valve. In preferred embodiments, the exhaust valve location,
          functions, timing and operation method may be similar or
          identical to exhaust valves found in well-known conventional
          four stroke combustion engines. <br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 22, in one embodiment, the interstage valve
          12 is composed of a shaft having a conic shaped sealing
          surface. The interstage valve governs the compressed air flow
          or the compressed carbureted air/fuel charge (collectively
          referred to herein as "fuel" or "fuel mixture") flow from a
          volume B within the compression cylinder 01 as it is pushed
          into a volume C within the power cylinder 02. The interstage
          valve 12 also prevents any reverse flow of fuel from volume C
          back into volume B. When in an open position, the interstage
          valve 12 enables compressed fuel to flow from the compression
          cylinder 01 into the power cylinder 02. During combustion and
          along the power stroke, the interstage valve 12 remains
          closed. In one embodiment, the interstage valve operation
          mechanism may be similar or identical to well-known combustion
          engine inlet or exhaust valve mechanisms. The closed or opened
          position of the interstage valve 12 is operated by mechanical
          linkages coupling or engagement with one of the dynamic DPCE
          shafts/parts (e.g., piston 03). It should also be understood
          that the exact valve timing depends on many engineering design
          considerations; however, as a general rule the interstage
          valve 12 should open around the time the exhaust valve 11
          closes and remain closed during the power stroke and at least
          most of the exhaust stroke. <br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 23, in another embodiment, a preloaded
          spring-operated relief valve 17 serves as the interstage valve
          12. This embodiment provides an automatic valve that does not
          require any linkage based operating mechanism. During the
          intake and work strokes the working pressure and the preloaded
          spring 16 forces the valve stem 17 to remain closed and
          sealed. During the compression and exhaust strokes, the
          increased compressed fuel pressure in volume B along with the
          decreased exhaust pressure in volume C overcome the valve
          preloaded spring 16 forces and thus opens the valve stem 17,
          thereby allowing the compressed fuel to flow into the power
          cylinder 02 chamber C. <br>

          FIG. 24 illustrates a combination of a combustion chamber E
          with a unique semi automatic interstage valve comprising valve
          18 having a cylindrical or ring portion that surrounds a plug
          valve 19. In this embodiment a combustion chamber E is sealed
          from the compression chamber B by the valve 18 and sealed from
          the working chamber C by valve 19. A spring 20 pushes
          simultaneity both valves 18 and 19 toward their corresponded
          closed positions. A spark plug 21 is located inside the
          combustion chamber E cavity. The combustion chamber E and
          interstage valve operation is as follows: As illustrated at
          stage J, during initial compression and exhaust strokes,
          spring 20 pushes valve stem 18 and valve stem 19 causing both
          valves to stay in a sealed closed position. At stage H, as the
          compression stroke progresses, its compressed air/charge
          pressure raises and in a certain stage the rising pressure,
          acting on valve 18, overcomes the spring 20 preload force,
          thereby forcing valve 18 to open and the compressed air/charge
          flows into combustion chamber E. At stage G, when the
          compression and work pistons approach their TDC positions,
          spark plug 21 is fired and a protruding portion 23 of the
          power piston 22 mechanically engages valve 19 forcing it to
          move and unseal (open) valve 19 that in turn engages and
          pushes valve 18 toward its closed position. Additionally, the
          rising combustion volume pressure works in conjunction with
          the power piston to force valve 18 to close. At stage F, when
          combustion occurs, chamber E pressure drastically and
          immediately rises, valve 18 is already closed and the hot
          combustion stream flows through valve 19 pushing power piston
          22 away from the valve 19. <br>
          <br>
          As the power piston 22 retreats back (during the power
          stroke), valve 19 stays open because of the differential
          pressure which exists between chamber C high combustion
          pressure vis-a-vis the much lower pressure that resides in
          chamber B which is now in its intake phase. The combustion
          chamber and interstage valve cycle ends as the power stroke
          ends. Spring 20 then pushes back valve 19 to its closed
          position as the power piston 22 begins its exhaust stroke. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 25 illustrates a DPCE dual cylinder configuration having
          supercharge capabilities, in accordance with one embodiment of
          the invention. As shown in FIG. 25, the compression cylinder
          portion 50 is larger than the power cylinder portion 52,
          therefore allowing a greater volume of air/fuel mixture to be
          received and compressed in the compression chamber B. At the
          completion of the compression stroke, the larger volume and
          increased pressure of compressed air/fuel mixture (i.e.,
          "supercharged" fuel mixture) in the compression chamber B is
          injected into the combustion chamber C via interstage valve
          12. Therefore, a greater amount and/or higher pressure of fuel
          mixture can be injected into the combustion chamber C of power
          cylinder 52 to provide a bigger explosion and, hence, more
          energy and work, during the power stroke. <br>
          <br>
          As mentioned above, FIG. 26 illustrates an alternative DPCE
          dual cylinder configuration, in accordance with one embodiment
          of the invention, wherein the compression cylinder 60 is
          offset from the power cylinder 62, to provide minimal thermal
          conductivity between the two cylinders. In this embodiment,
          the interstage valve 12 is located in the small area of
          overlap between the two cylinders. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 27 illustrates a DPCE dual cylinder configuration in
          which both cylinders are constructed parallel to each other
          and both pistons are moving in a tandem manner, in accordance
          with a further embodiment of the invention. In this
          embodiment, the intake, exhaust, and interstage valves may
          operate in the same manner as described above. However, as
          shown in FIG. 27, the interstage valve is located in a lateral
          conduit that couples the first and second cylinders. <br>
          <br>
          In an alternative embodiment according to the invention, a
          steam enhanced double piston cycle engine (SE-DPCE) is
          configured to use excess heat in the combustion chamber to
          convert added water into steam to increase engine efficiency
          and output. Like the DPCE described above, separating the
          compression stroke location from the power stroke location
          enables the development of significantly higher combustion
          chamber temperature. In this embodiment, the DPCE described
          above is extended to additionally comprise a unique
          ring-shaped steam cylinder that is located between the
          combustion chamber and the exhaust passage. The SE-DPCE
          utilizes concentrated heat residing in areas located between
          the combustion chamber and the internal surface of an exhaust
          tube shell, which is wrapped around the combustion piston
          cylinder. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 28, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention,
          illustrates a cross-sectional view of a SE-DPCE that includes
          many similar features described above: a compression cylinder
          01, a power cylinder 02, a compression piston 03, a power
          piston 04, two respective piston connecting rods 05 and 06, a
          compression crankshaft 07, a power crankshaft 08, a crankshaft
          connecting rod 09, an intake valve 10, a combustion exhaust
          valve 11, and part of an interstage valve 12. The compression
          cylinder 01 is a piston engine cylinder that houses the
          compression piston 03, the intake valve 10 and an interstage
          valve 12. The power cylinder 02 is a piston engine cylinder
          that houses the power piston 04, the exhaust valve 11, and
          part of the interstage valve 12. The power cylinder 02 further
          comprises an inner cylinder 02a and an outer cylinder 02b. The
          power piston 04 further comprises a dual-head piston further
          comprising a disc-shaped inner piston 04a and a ring-shaped
          outer piston 04b. The power cylinder 02 also includes: a
          compressed air valve 16 located within the outer power
          cylinder 02b and extending to the compression cylinder 01, a
          steam/air exhaust valve 13 located within the outer power
          cylinder 02b, an outer exhaust shell comprising a wrapped
          exhaust pipe 14, and a heat isolation layer 15. In one
          embodiment, the power cylinders 02, 02a and 02b are
          manufactured using highly conductive materials for further
          heat energy utilization. <br>
          <br>
          In one preferred embodiment, the compression piston 03 serves
          for the intake and the compression engine strokes. The inner
          power piston 04a serves for the fuel combustion power and the
          exhaust (burned gaseous) strokes. The outer power piston 04b
          produces additional power and at the same time serves to cool
          chamber c and power piston 04a by the absorption of engine
          excessive heat, utilizing hot compressed air with or without
          steam/water. The connecting rods 05 and 06 connect the
          compression piston 03 and both power pistons 04a and 04b to
          their respective crankshafts 07 and 08. The compression
          crankshaft 07 converts rotational movement into compression
          piston 03 reciprocating movement. The power crankshaft 08
          converts inner and outer power pistons 04a and 04b
          reciprocating movement into engine rotational output movement.
          The crankshaft connecting rod 09 transfers the power
          crankshaft 08 rotation into compression crankshaft 07
          rotation. The engine intake valve 10 is composed of a shaft
          having a conic shaped sealing surface, the same as is used in
          most four stroke engines. The exhaust valve 11 is composed of
          a shaft having a conic shaped sealing surface, that same as is
          used in most four stroke engines. The interstage valve 12 is
          composed of a shaft having a conic shaped sealing surface. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 29 illustrates a cross-sectional, perspective view of the
          power cylinder 02: a spark plug 22 located within the inner
          cylinder 02a, a fuel injection nozzle 20 located within the
          inner cylinder 02a, and a water/steam injection nozzle/valve
          21 located in the outer cylinder 02b. In further embodiments,
          the SE-DPCE apparatus can additionally utilize electrical
          starters, pressurized oil lubrication systems, controlled
          water/steam systems to control water quantity, pressure and
          temperature, well-known high voltage timing and spark plug
          electrical systems, and output shaft flywheels. A combustion
          exhaust valve 11 includes a shaft having a conic shaped
          sealing surface, same as in most four stroke engines. When
          open, the valve 11 enables burned hot gaseous to exit the
          combustion chamber and stream into the exhaust wrapped shell
          14. An interstage valve 12 is composed of a shaft having a
          conic shaped sealing surface. When open the interstage valve
          12 enables compressed charge (fuel air mixture) to be pushed
          from the compression chamber into the combustion chamber. The
          steam/water outlet valve 13 is configured to open and close
          mechanically. When open the valve 13 enables the expanded
          steam water mixture to be pushed out by power piston 4b and be
          exhaled from the secondary power chamber E back into a supply
          water closed-loop system (not shown) or totally out of the
          engine <br>
          <br>
          The power cylinder 02 further includes a compressed air
          connecting valve 16, which is also configured to open and
          close mechanically. When open the valve 16 enables compressed
          hot air to be pushed from the engine compression chamber into
          the secondary power chamber E. A thermal isolation layer 15 is
          an external thermal isolation shield that prevents heat energy
          escape. By utilizing this shield 15 most of the engine
          excessive heat is forced to stay within the engine inner
          structure and thus to be converted by the secondary power
          chamber E into additional useful work. A fuel injection nozzle
          20 is a mechanically operated valve that includes a fuel spray
          nozzle. In one embodiment, a direct pressurized fuel injection
          system, operated through predetermined engine cycle time band,
          pushes fuel into the combustion chamber. Using this system is
          an alternative to a common carburetor fuel supply system in
          which the fuel is sprayed in advance into either, the engine
          incoming air supply or during the engine compression stroke. <br>
          <br>
          The power cylinder 02 further includes a water injection valve
          21 configured to open and close mechanically and further
          including a water spraying nozzle. A pressurized water
          injection system, operated through a predetermined engine
          cycle time band, pushes water into the secondary power chamber
          E. The water is vaporized into compressed hot steam and thus
          produces elevated pressures and at the same time cooling
          cylinder 2a. A spark plug 22 is used to initiate fuel air
          compressed mixture explosions. Finally, FIG. 29 illustrates a
          cross-sectional view of an exhaust passage 23 that is wrapped
          around the secondary power cylinder perimeter in order to
          maintain and provide additional heat to the power cylinder. <br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 28, when both the compression piston
          03 and the power pistons 04 are at their TDC positions, the
          available volume in chamber B of cylinder 01 is minimized. At
          TDC, cylinder 02a and 02b also have minimized volumes in their
          respective contained chambers C and E. In one embodiment, the
          power crankshaft 08 rotates clockwise and causes the
          connecting rod 09 to move and rotate the compression
          crankshaft 07 clockwise. The rotation of crankshafts 07 and 08
          actuates both pistons 03 and 04 to perform a symmetrical
          synchronous reciprocating movement in which the compression
          piston 03 and the power piston 04 moves inboard and outboard
          symmetrically in an equally paced manner. In alternative
          embodiments according to the present invention, a phase lag or
          phase advance between the relative location of the compression
          piston 03 and either the inner power piston 04a or outer power
          piston 04b, or both, may be introduced. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment according to the present invention, the
          SE-DPCE cycle begins as compression piston passes through its
          TDC and the intake valve 10 opens. Ambient air flows into
          compression cylinder 01 chamber B. The compression crankshaft
          07 rotates and the compression piston 03 moves until it
          reaches BDC, at which point the intake valve 10 closes. The
          compression piston 03 then performs its reciprocal movement
          back toward TDC causing the air pressure and temperature
          within chamber B to increase. At various predetermined points,
          one or both of the interstage valve 12 and the connecting
          valve 16 open. The connecting valve 16 allows compressed air
          to be pushed from the relatively high pressure chamber B into
          the then lower pressure combustion chamber C and into the ring
          shaped air/water/steam chamber E. In one embodiment, the
          compressed air is substantially transferred to the power
          cylinder 02 when the compression piston 03 and power piston 04
          reach their TDC. Around the time the compressed air is
          finished being transferred to the power cylinder 02, the
          interstage valve 12 and compressed air valve 16 close. Fuel is
          injected into chamber C through fuel injection nozzle 20 and
          temperature-controlled water is sprayed and/or injected into
          chamber E via a water injection valve 21 (FIG. 29),
          respectively. The temperature-controlled water may be added
          into chamber E before, during, or after the valves 12 and 16
          have finished closing. Spark plug 22 (FIG. 29) fires, causing
          combustion to occur, which forcefully pushes the inner power
          piston 04a toward its BDC. Simultaneously, the injected water
          and compressed air within chamber E expand and evaporate into
          steam which in turn dramatically increases pressure in chamber
          E. This increased pressure forcefully pushes the outer power
          piston 04b toward BDC. During the water to steam conversion
          (phase change), the engine excessive heat produced during
          combustion in chamber C is efficiently and productively
          removed to chamber E. <br>
          <br>
          The SE-DPCE cycle ends as power piston 04 begins moving back
          towards TDC. At the same time, the exhaust valve 11 opens, the
          high temperature combustion products are directed from exhaust
          valve 11 into a port 19 and then pushed within a pipe wrapped
          around the outer cylinder 02b and exhaled out through area D,
          thereby heating the cylinder 02b. At or near the same time the
          exhaust valve 11 opens, the steam outlet valve 13 opens and
          the previously extract products (steam, water, air) of chamber
          E are recycled into the supply water close-loop system. In one
          embodiment, the steam outlet valve 13 opens and the previously
          extracted products (e.g., steam, water, air) of chamber E are
          drained or expelled out of the engine without recycling any
          water or steam for further energy generation. In alternative
          embodiments, in order to save energy, water and/or steam is
          recycled and the recycled liquids in chamber E can be used to
          pre-heat the incoming injected water. Before power piston 04
          reaches TDC, the exhaust valve 11 and steam outlet valve 13
          close again. A new cycle begins as the compression piston 03
          retreats toward its BDC, and the intake valve 10 re-opens. In
          one embodiment, the external power cylinder 02 outer
          circumference is covered by a thermal isolation material layer
          15, in order to minimize SE-DPCE heat energy losses. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 30, piston 04 includes a
          hot section 30, which is adjacent to and/or in direct contact
          with the combustion product and hotter cylinder surfaces. The
          hot section 30 is made out of temperature resistance materials
          like carbon or ceramic. This piston section carries only
          longitudinal forces. A secondary sliding disk 36 receives most
          of the sliding side friction forces. Section 30 is the hot
          part of piston 04, and it is cooled and lubricated utilizing a
          small amount of water and steam leakages. Section 32 is the
          colder part of piston 04 and it is further cooled and
          lubricated utilizing well known piston engine lubrication
          methods. A disk 38 separates the oil lubricated colder section
          32 from the hotter piston steam lubricated section 30. A power
          connecting rod 06 connects a piston ear 34 to the power
          crankshaft 08. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 31 illustrates construction and lubrication of the power
          piston 04 in accordance with one aspect of the present
          invention. In one embodiment, the power cylinder 02 and
          pistons 04, 04a and 04b surfaces that are directly engaged
          with the combustion process are enforced with ceramic. The
          ceramic surfaces of the power cylinder 02 and pistons 04, 04a,
          and 04b are water/steam cooled and lubricated. As the outer
          power piston 04b approaches BDC a small amount of steam is
          released through nozzles into the area in between the power
          piston 04 and inner and outer power pistons 04a and 04b. The
          hot piston portion side forces are absorbed by an additional
          piston sliding disc 36, which carries most of the piston side
          stresses and is oil-lubricated using well-known methods. The
          piston sliding disc 36 separates and seals the area around the
          crankshaft 08 from the rest of the area within the power
          cylinder 02. Thus, by utilizing innovative cooling and
          lubrication aspects of the present invention, the SE-DPCE can
          operate under higher temperatures. <br>
          <br>
          The oil separation disc 36 takes most of piston 04 side
          sliding friction forces, during engine crankshafts rotation,
          machine oil is allowed to flow toward cylinder surface 48
          (between cylinder 02 and piston 04). In one embodiment, engine
          common seal rings 42 may be installed around the perimeter of
          disc 36. Piston and cylinder sliding surfaces 46 and 50
          utilize water and steam as cooling and lubrication liquids,
          those substance are than drained out of cylinder 02 through
          drain port 44. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 32 illustrates another embodiment according to the
          present invention wherein the SE-DPCE comprises a split
          compression piston 03. The compression piston 03 is divided
          into an inner compression piston 03a and an outer compression
          piston 03b. The inner compression piston 03a sucks ambient
          air, with or without carbureted fuel, through an intake valve
          54 and compresses it through the interstage valve 12 into the
          combustion chamber C. The outer compression piston 03b that
          sucks ambient air through an intake valve 10 and compresses it
          through a connecting intake valve 16 into air-steam chamber E.
          In one embodiment, water is also added into the intake air
          chamber F and then compressed through connecting intake valve
          16 into chamber E, or alternatively, water can be injected
          directly into chamber E via water injection nozzle 21 (FIG.
          29). A split compression piston configuration enables the
          engine to make use of carbureted fuel that is sucked into
          chamber G. In addition, the split compression piston and
          chamber configuration enables the SE-DPCE to be designed such
          that the total incoming air is volumetric divided between
          chambers F and G and the volume of each chamber F and G can be
          independently determined. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 33 illustrates another embodiment according to the
          present invention wherein the SE-DPCE comprises two separate
          power producers in which a primary combustion system utilizes
          the fuel-air combustion process, while a secondary
          water-steam-air system utilizes excess engine heat. In this
          embodiment, the primary combustion system comprises a
          compression piston 03a, a power piston 04a, an intake valve
          54, an exhaust valve 11, an interstage valve 12 and an output
          shaft 08. In one embodiment, the exhaust from exhaust valve 11
          is input into the cylinder heating port 19 to heat cylinder
          02b, as described above. The secondary water-steam-air system
          comprises a compression piston 03b, a power piston 04b, an
          intake valve 10, an interstage valve 16, a steam/air exhaust
          valve 13 and a secondary power output shaft 60. The primary
          combustion system converts fuel and air into engine work as
          describe above. The secondary water-steam-air system in one
          embodiment utilizes substantially identical piston reciprocal
          movement, connecting rod motion and crankshaft rotation to the
          primary combustion system. However, in the secondary
          water-steam-air system, heated air, water, and/or steam can be
          used to produce engine work. Each power producing system
          actuates its own operating valves. The primary combustion
          system actuates valves 54, 12 and 11, as well as an optional
          fuel injection system in one embodiment. In this embodiment,
          the secondary system actuates valves 16 and 13 and optionally
          the water chamber E direct injection system (nozzle 24, FIG.
          29). In accordance with the discussions above, in some
          embodiments, the primary compression piston 03a and primary
          power piston 04a are configured to operate with a phase
          difference such that they reach their TDC positions at
          different times. Similarly, the secondary compression piston
          03b and secondary power piston 04b can also be configured to
          operate with a phase difference with respect to one another. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, the SE-DPCE makes use of the following
          dynamic parts, which serve the secondary power output (the
          compression and power pistons movements which utilizes engine
          heat for additional engine power output). The secondary power
          output includes two pistons, comprising a ring compression
          piston 03b and a ring output piston 04b, two compression
          connecting rods 70, a compression crankshaft 68, a power
          crankshaft 60, a power crankshaft connecting rods 64 and
          crankshaft connecting rod 66. The connecting rods connect
          respective pistons to their respective crankshafts. The
          compression crankshaft 68 converts rotational movement into
          reciprocating movement of the compression ring piston 03b. The
          output power crankshaft 60 converts output power ring piston
          04b reciprocating movement into secondary output 60 rotational
          movement. The crankshaft connecting rod 66 transfers the
          output power crankshaft 60 rotation using crankshaft 62 into
          compression crankshaft 68 rotation. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment, there is no engine internal engagement
          between the primary and secondary shafts 08 and 60. In this
          embodiment, each system is independent, with the power and
          speed of each shaft depending on engine working condition and
          engine input parameters. In an additional embodiment, the
          SE-DPCE is capable of accepting a carbureted fuel/air charge
          as well as performing a fuel injection method of combustion.
          And, in yet another embodiment, the SE-DPCE is capable of
          accepting air and water as well as air followed by injected
          water directly sprayed into chamber E. In another embodiment
          according to the present invention, the SE-DPCE utilizes an
          electronic optimization management computer (not shown) which
          monitors engine temperature, RPM, engine torque, fuel
          consumption, injected water temperature, and injected water
          quantity. The computer analyzes these various engine physical
          parameters accordingly adjusts the injected water quantities,
          temperatures and injected fuel quantities for best
          performance. <br>
          <br>
          In various other embodiments according to the present
          invention, the SE-DPCE may have any of several additional
          features. In one embodiment, the water-steam chamber E
          operates with water and/or steam instead of compressed air. As
          piston reaches TDC, water and/or steam are injected into
          chamber E. Combustion piston 03 transfers compressed air only
          through interstage valve 12 into chamber C. The water cooling
          and work producing functions describe above are performed with
          injected water into chamber E and the accompanying phase
          change into steam. During piston retraction, as the piston
          moves toward TDC, chamber E steam and/or water is exhaled
          through the steam/air exhaust valve 13. In an additional
          embodiment, the steam may be heated to a higher temperature
          for better engine performance. <br>
          <br>
          In another alternative embodiment either water and/or steam
          may be replaced with another liquid or gas such as Ammonia,
          Freon, Ethanol or any other suitable expandable liquids
          (include gaseous). <br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment, compressed air alone, and not water
          or steam, is injected into chamber E. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, a boiler layer 71 comprises a plurality
          of passages 71 for holding fluids and/or gases therein,
          wherein the boiler layer 71 is wrapped around at least a
          portion of the combustion chamber housing 02. As shown in FIG.
          34, in one embodiment, the boiler layer/passages 71 are
          surrounded by the passages 14 of the wrapped exhaust pipe 14,
          both of which are surrounded by heat isolation/insulation
          layer 15. It is understood that the cross-sectional views of
          passages 71 and 14 are illustrated as square and circular
          shapes, respectively. for purposes of illustration only. In
          actual implementations, any desired shape may be utilized for
          these passages. In alternative embodiments the passages 71
          and/or passages 14 may each be configured as a single larger
          passage or channel for holding fluids and/or gases therein
          that is wrapped around the combustion chamber housing. In one
          embodiments, pressurized water or other suitable fluid from an
          external source (not shown) is pushed by a hydraulic pump (not
          shown) into the boiler passages 71 via an inlet port 72. Since
          combustion chamber C, cylinder 02 and the inner wrapped
          exhaust layer 14 temperature are very high, any water (or any
          other liquid) flowing or injected into the inlet port 72 will
          rapidly turn into high pressure steam. In one embodiment, the
          high pressure steam is then directed from steam output port 74
          toward an external steam piston engine (not shown) or steam
          turbine (not shown), which converts the steam energy into
          additional useful mechanical work, such as turning an
          electrical generator or mechanically engaging the SE-DPCE main
          output shaft 08. The isolation layer 15 keeps most of SE-DPCE
          heat energy within the engine structure. As power piston 04
          begins its exhaust stroke hot combustion gases flows through
          exhaust valve 11 into inlet exhaust wrap port 19, thereby
          heating the inner wrapped exhaust layer 14. After transferring
          part of their heat energy into the water/steam wrap tube 14,
          the exhaust gases are exhaled from the engine through output
          port D. <br>
          <br>
          By implementing the above-described method and apparatus, the
          SE-DPCE embodiment creates and utilizes steam energy by using
          previously unused thermal energy. The generated steam energy
          is then used to produce additional mechanical work. In one
          embodiment, the steam energy is utilized by an auxiliary steam
          engine or steam turbine, which then converts the steam energy
          to additional work. <br>
