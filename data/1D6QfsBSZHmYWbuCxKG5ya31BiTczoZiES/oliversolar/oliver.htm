      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventive Research</span>, a
      Division of S. R. Widows Company, Inc., of Indiana, has patented a
      way to generate AC power directly from a solar panel. Why is this
      so important? It makes it possible to simply hook the solar panels
      directly into the power grid without the need for expensive DC to
      AC power conversion equipment. This invention, when
      commercialized, will make the cost of solar power more practical
      and affordable.<br>
      <br>
      We’ve heard about the promise of cheap solar energy now for
      decades. You’d think by now that at least in the world’s sunniest
      areas all the cities would be supplementing their power with clean
      renewable solar power. Sadly this is not the case.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s the problem. Solar panels today produce DC power which has
      to be converted to AC to be used by by most homes and businesses.
      The price of solar panels combined with the price of inverters,
      phase synchronizers, installation and maintenance has made the
      price of solar prohibitive. Add to that the loss of power from the
      different components used in the DC to AC conversion process and
      it becomes even more unattractive. But what if there was a better
      way?<br>
      <br>
      Nearly a century ago a battle between two of America’s most
      influential inventors decided the power we use today. Thomas
      Edison’s inventions generated and utilized DC power and Nikola
      Tesla’s inventions used his newly discovered AC power. Tesla’s AC
      eventually won out because it could be transfered over long
      distances more efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jason Oliver</span>, lead
      inventor for Inventive Research is not the typical researcher;
      he’s an automotive master mechanic from Indiana who more than a
      decade ago developed a passion for the inventions of Tesla. He
      looked for clues from how power is generated today to come up with
      their newest invention, the AC generating solar panel.<br>
      <br>
      Today AC power is produced for the power grid by AC generators.
      The generators are powered by mechanical energy provided by water
      turbines (hydro-electric) or steam turbines powered from coal,
      natural gas or nuclear fuel. The mechanical energy rotates the
      coils of the generator in a magnetic field to produce voltage.
      Because the conductor coil of the generator flips direction during
      rotation in the magnetic field the resulting voltage produced is
      sinusoidal or AC.<br>
      <br>
      Inventive Research replicated this sinusoidal voltage by
      mechanically manipulating alternate banks of solar cells to turn
      off and on. They spent many years years developing this
      technology. They call it the AC Solar Generator. It’s so simple
      and practical you won’t believe it hasn’t been done before, but it
      hasn’t. Inventive Research and their attorneys did an exhaustive
      patent search to make sure of that.<br>
      <br>
      The process Inventive Research used to do this is simple but pure
      genius in its application. Jason arranged modified standard solar
      cells into a circular pattern mounted on a base.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the cells are wired in one circuit and half in another
      circuit<br>
      <br>
      Mounted above the solar cells is a spinning disk powered by a DC
      electric motor. The DC motor gets its power from four small DC
      solar cells mounted in the corners of the base. The disk has
      portals cut into it allowing light to pass through to every other
      solar cell below it. As the disk spins each of the banks of solar
      cells is alternately exposed to light and alternately produce
      power. When the portal is half way between the two cells the
      voltage cancels and drops to zero. The resulting voltage is
      sinusoidal or AC. It can even be configured to produce three phase
      AC power...<br>
      <br>
      Combining the phase matching with the alternating current
      generation is what allows the AC solar generator to create AC
      power without the losses and cost associated with the AC to DC
      power conversion process.<br>
      <br>
      Other benfits include:<br>
      <br>
      • Generates free energy from the sun<br>
      • Non-polluting energy reduces emissions: Has no direct impact on
      the environment<br>
      • It’s easily scalable<br>
      • Grid-Tie systems allow you to sell excess electricity back to
      the utility<br>
      • Can be installed and operated anywhere including areas of
      difficult access and remote locations<br>
      • Helps get us off dependence on foreign oil<br>
      • PV cells make no noise and give off no exhaust<br>
      <br>
      This is truly a transforming technology. The AC solar generator
      has the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels tremendously
      if you just imagine them installed photovoltaic solar power
      centers around the country generating supplemental power for the
      grid.<br>
      <br>
      Inventive Research is expecting to receive the final patents later
      this year. If you are interested in licensing or purchasing the
      patents for this technology you can contact Stan Widows at

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A device,
      system and method for generating alternating current (a/c)
      electricity directly from photovoltaic cells utilize an array of
      photovoltaic cell pairs that are each connected in anti-parallel
      to form an a/c junction. The system, device and method
      mechanically gradually exposes and shades photovoltaic cell pairs
      to sunlight to generate alternating current electricity at an a/c
      junction of the solar cell pairs. Gradually and alternately
      exposing and shading the two anti-parallel connected solar cells
      of each solar cell pair causes the amplitude and polarity of the
      electricity at the a/c junction to gradually rise and fall to
      produce alternating current electricity. The gradual, alternating
      exposure and shading of the two anti-parallel solar cells is
      accomplished by mechanically covering and exposing the solar cell
      pairs. This is efficiently accomplished by a rotating segmented
      disc positioned over an array of solar cell pairs.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Field of the Invention</span><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to photovoltaics (i.e. technology
      and research related to the application of photovoltaic cells in
      producing electricity for practical use) and, more particularly,
      to devices, systems and methods for generating alternating current
      electricity from photovoltaic cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background Information</span><br>
      <br>
      The demand and need for clean and renewable energy is becoming
      more urgent as earth undergoes global climate changes. Generation
      of electricity from coal produces over 50% of the carbon dioxide
      released into the atmosphere each year. Coal and other fossil
      fuels will also eventually run out. The hydroelectric power
      generation of electricity is limited to places where there is an
      adequate water source. Nuclear energy for the creation of
      electricity has the drawback of creating nuclear waste. However,
      one type of clean renewable energy is solar energy or sunlight.
      Solar energy is a constant source of clean energy that can shine
      on all areas of the surface of the planet. Solar energy or
      sunlight can be converted into electricity by a photovoltaic cell.
      A photovoltaic cell known as a solar cell captures and converts
      sunlight into electricity. A solar cell is made from a
      semiconducting material (a semiconductor) such as silicon that
      absorbs the sunlight which generates a flow of electricity through
      the solar cell. Because of the properties of semiconductors,
      positive and negative terminals of the solar cell are static and
      electron flow from a solar cell is uni-directional (i.e. the
      electricity can only flow in one direction). Thus, as with all
      photovoltaic cells, the solar cell produces only direct current
      (d/c) electricity. The problem with direct current electricity is
      that direct current electricity is difficult to transmit any
      appreciable distance, which limits its use. Thus, alternating
      current electricity is more usable than direct current
      electricity. Moreover, most electrical devices utilize alternating
      current (a/c) electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Various prior art devices have attempted to provide suitable
      alternating current electricity from photovoltaic or solar cells.
      For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,075,034 issued to Butler on
      February 21 , 1978 (hereinafter, "Butler") provides a solar
      converter for producing variable amplitude alternating current
      waveforms directly from solar energy by using a photo-voltaic cell
      bank array formed of a plurality of weighted photo-voltaic
      segments. A multi-sided high speed, rotating and light
      concentrating concave mirror system provides light on and past the
      weighted segments of the photo-voltaic bank to produce
      instantaneous output which are proportional to the number of cells
      scanned in each segment. A simulated alternating current (a/c)
      waveform is produced by suitable arrangement of the photo-voltaic
      segments. The simulated a/c waveform of Butler and its fragile
      manner (glass mirrors) of producing the simulated a/c waveform by
      the high speed rotating mirror is not efficient. Moreover, Butler
      is not easily scalable to produce larger voltages/amperes nor is
      it relatively maintenance free. In U.S. Patent Publication No.
      2005/0034750 by Rabinowitz published February 17, 2005
      (hereinafter, "Rabinowitz"), a solar cell alternating current
      generator is provided that uses a dynamic spinning ensemble of
      mini-mirrors to both concentrate and modulate rays from the sun
      onto a photovoltaic collector array. The focusing and superimposed
      spinning action produces single phase and multiphase alternating
      current electricity. The problem with Rabinowitz is again, the use
      of glass mirrors, the need for focusing the mini-mirrors and
      maintain their high speed spinning is not efficient.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Patent No. 6,774,299 issued to Ford on August 10, 2004
      (hereinafter, "Ford"), a solar alternating current electricity
      generator is provided that utilizes a rotating, partitioned array
      of photovoltaic cells. Contact brushes and wiring are provided to
      transfer the electric current to an applied load. The drawback to
      Ford is the need for contact brushes and wiring to generate the
      alternating current electricity. Moreover, the rotating
      photovoltaic cell vanes of Ford are not efficient.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Patent No. 4,728,878 issued to Anthony on March 1 , 1988
      (hereinafter, "Anthony"), a solar energy electric generating
      system is provided for space vehicles which directly generates
      alternating current from ambient light without power conversion.
      Light incident to photocell arrays is mechanically or electrically
      gated to produce fluctuating direct current (d/c) electricity. A
      number of transforming devices are provided to convert the
      fluctuating d/c current to alternating current (a/c). Through
      variation of the frequency and duty cycle of the pulsing output
      voltage, frequency and phase relative to a reference may be
      controlled. However, with the Anthony solar energy electric
      generating system, the mechanical gating provides a square wave
      that is then conditioned to provide an alternating current
      waveform.<br>
      <br>
      Last, in U.S. Patent No. 4,577,052 issued to Schutten et al. on
      Mach 18, 1986 (hereinafter, "Schutten"), an alternating current
      solar cell is provided by connecting solar cells (P/N junctions)
      in anti-parallel between a pair of main terminals. Light is
      provided alternately on the P/N junctions through a mirror system
      that splits the beam and causes the split beam to impinge on the
      P/N junctions.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear from the above that the prior art devices for
      generating alternating current electricity directly from
      photovoltaic or solar cells are complicated, difficult to align
      and maintain, and cannot provide adequate scaling for small and
      large a/c current production.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the above, it is desirable to have a solar powered
      alternating current (a/c) electricity generator, system and method
      that produces single or multi-phase a/c electricity that is
      simple, efficient and easily scalable in voltage and/or amperage.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is a system, device and method for directly
      generating alternating current electricity from photovoltaic
      cells. The system, device and method mechanically gradually
      exposes and shades photovoltaic cell pairs connected in
      anti-parallel to sunlight to generate alternating current
      electricity at an a/c junction of the solar cell pairs. Gradually
      and alternately exposing and shading the two anti-parallel
      connected solar cells of each solar cell pair causes the amplitude
      and polarity of the electricity at the a/c junction to gradually
      rise and fall to produce alternating current electricity. The
      gradual, alternating exposure and shading of the two anti-parallel
      solar cells is accomplished by mechanically covering and exposing
      the solar cell pairs.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, while one solar cell of an anti-parallel connected
      solar cell pair undergoes gradual exposure to sunlight from 0%
      exposure (100% shaded) of the solar cell electricity generating
      area to 100% exposure (0% shaded) of the solar cell electricity
      generating area, the other solar cell of the solar cell pair
      undergoes gradual shading from sunlight from 0% shaded (100%
      exposure) to 100% shaded (0% exposure). Such gradual, alternating
      exposure and covering of each solar cell of each anti-parallel
      connected solar cell pair is periodic. The rate of exposure and
      shading determines frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In one form, a rotating disc situated over the solar cell pairs
      has spaced apart openings forming coverings between each opening
      to alternately expose and shade the solar cell pairs during
      rotation. A direct current motor is utilized to rotate the
      segmented disc. The motor is preferably powered by separate solar
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provides a phase synchronizer for
      maintaining a desired alternating current frequency. The phase
      synchronizer controls the motor to control rotation of the
      segmented disc.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention makes solar energy a viable, cost effective,
      environmentally friendly option for residential and/or commercial
      use. The present invention is capable of being used on a minute,
      small or large scale through appropriate scaling the solar cell
      a/c electricity generator and/or the use of a plurality thereof.
      Solar cell a/c electricity generator arrays can easily produce the
      power equivalent to an average power plant today, while being
      environmentally friendly enough to be located proximate a
      playground, school or in any urban environment. Large scale solar
      cell a/c electricity generator arrays can be easily set up even in
      the most remote places in the world. The present invention reduces
      the need of other forms of power. Moreover, the present solar cell
      a/c electricity generator can be set up and used anywhere.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus an object of the present invention to produce
      alternating current electricity of specific frequencies, single or
      three phase, from solar cells in a cost efficient and simple
      manner. <br>

      A description of the features, functions and/or configuration of
      the components depicted in the various figures will now be
      presented. It should be appreciated that not all of the features
      of the components of the figures are necessarily described. Some
      of these non discussed features as well as discussed features are
      inherent from the figures. Other non discussed features may be
      inherent in component geometry and/or configuration.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN
        EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to Figs. 1-5, there is depicted various views of an
      exemplary embodiment of a photovoltaic alternating current (a/c)
      electricity generator, generally designated 10, fashioned in
      accordance with the present principles. The photovoltaic a/c
      generator 10 is embodied as a solar cell a/c electricity generator
      10, but it should be appreciated that a photovoltaic a/c
      electricity generator fashioned in accordance with the present
      principles may use photovoltaic cells other than solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      The solar cell a/c electricity generator 10 has a base, frame or
      other mounting structure 12 ("base 12") that supports the various
      components thereof. The base 12 may be formed of wood, plastic or
      other suitable material which is preferably, but not necessarily,
      a non conducting material. It should be understood that while the
      base 12 is shown as a box or a box-like structure, the base may be
      a substrate, board or other suitable mounting or supporting
      structure. The base 12 includes an alternating current (a/c)
      electricity production portion 14 formed by a disk 15 and a
      plurality of photovoltaic or solar cells 20 (hereinafter, "solar
      cells 20"). As best seen in Fig. 3, the plurality of solar cells
      20 is arranged in a generally circular array 21 on an upper
      surface 13 of the base 12. It should be appreciated that arrays
      other than circular may be used within the present principles. It
      should also be appreciated that while the solar cells 20 are shown
      as rectangles, the size and shape of the solar cells 20 may be
      otherwise, such as truncated conical, triangular, polygonal or
      square.<br>
      <br>
      As best seen in Fig. 4, the disc 15 has a generally flat body made
      of a sunlight blocking material that is generally the
      circumference of the solar cell array 21 in order to extend over
      the solar cell array 21 when in use (see, e.g., Figs. 1 and 2).
      The disc 15 is also preferably made of a lightweight material that
      resists warping or is not susceptible to warping. The disc 15 is
      preferably reflective either inherently or via a coating, film,
      overlay or the like. It should be appreciated that the disc 15 may
      be partially reflective or non-reflective if desired. The disc 15
      has a plurality of cutouts, openings, windows or the like 16
      ("cutouts 16") formed thereabout. The size and shape of the
      cutouts 16 generally correspond to the size and shape of the solar
      cells 20 and particularly is sized and shaped to allow total
      exposure of a solar cell 20 to sunlight when the cutout 16 is
      positioned over the solar cell 20. The cutouts 16 are situated and
      spaced on the disc 15 so as to define a plurality of covers,
      coverings, blocks or the like 18 ("coverings 18"). The coverings
      18 are sized and shaped to completely cover or block a solar cell
      20 when the covering is over the solar cell 20.<br>
      <br>
      The cutouts 16 and coverings 18 are alternately radially situated
      about the disc 15. The number of cutouts 16 corresponds by 1 /2 to
      the number of solar cells 20 so that the number of coverings 18
      corresponds by 1/2 to the number of solar cells 20. Therefore,
      when the disc 15 is situated on frame 12 and over the solar cell
      array 21 , the cutouts 16 and coverings 18 expose 1/2 of the total
      solar cell array area and cover 1/2 of the total solar cell array
      area. As the disc 15 rotates over the array 21 of solar cells 20,
      the cutouts 16 and coverings 18 continuously gradually expose and
      cover the array of solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      The disc 15 is rotated over the solar cell array 21 by a direct
      current motor 26 (see, e.g., Fig. 3) that is supported by the base
      12. Rotation may be either clockwise or counterclockwise. A
      counterclockwise rotation of the disc 15 is represented in the
      figures by the curved arrow(s). The motor 26 is coupled to a phase
      synchronizer 40 via a motor connection 44 (see Fig. 5). The phase
      synchronizer 40 provides control/control signals to the motor 26
      for varying the rotational speed of the disc 15. Rotational speed
      of the disc 15 determines the frequency of resultant alternating
      current(s) from the solar cell a/c electricity generator 10.
      Additionally, the phase synchronizer 40 determines phase of the
      resultant a/c electricity relative to a predetermined phase or
      phase value (e.g. 60Hz) and causes the motor 26 to speed up or
      slow down if necessary. The motor 26 is powered by photovoltaic
      (solar) cells 22 that are situated on the base 12 so as to be
      continuously exposed to any sunlight. As best depicted in Fig. 5,
      the solar cells 22 are connected via connectors 23 to provide the
      proper voltage and amperage to the motor 26 and motor controller
      of the phase synchronizer 40) for properly operating the motor 26
      for rotation of the disc 15. If desired, rechargeable batteries 28
      may be connected to the phase synchronizer 40 that charge with
      energy from the solar cells 22 and provide startup energy for the
      motor 26.<br>
      <br>
      The solar cell a/c electricity generator 10 may include a power
      on/off switch 11 for making the solar cell a/c electricity
      generator 10 operable or not operable. Alternately, or in
      addition, the solar cell a/c electricity generator 10 may include
      a light sensor 42 (shown in Fig. 5) that senses when sunlight is
      present to then turn on the solar cell a/c electricity generator
      10. Other configurations may be used.<br>
      <br>
      As can be discerned from Figs. 1 and 2, rotation of the disc 15
      causes the cutouts 16 and coverings 18 to alternately expose and
      cover adjacent solar cells 20. The faster that the solar cells 20
      are exposed and covered (rotation speed of the disc 15), the
      higher the frequency of a/c electricity produced. The slower that
      the solar cells 20 are exposed and covered (rotation speed of the
      disc 15), the lower the frequency of the a/c electricity produced.
      Since the solar cells are wired in anti-parallel, an alternating
      current is generated between the a/c junction of the solar cell
      pairs as the solar cell pairs are alternately, gradually exposed
      and covered. Alternately stated, the total solar cell area of a
      solar cell pair comprises 100% where one solar cell of the solar
      cell pair defines 50% of the total area and the other solar cell
      of the solar cell pair defines the other 50% of the total area.
      The one solar cell of an anti-parallel connected solar cell pair
      undergoes gradual exposure to sunlight from 0% exposure (100%
      shaded) of the solar cell electricity generating area to 100%
      exposure (0% shaded) of the solar cell electricity generating
      area, the other solar cell of the solar cell pair undergoes
      gradual shading from sunlight from 0% shaded (100% exposure) to
      100% shaded (0% exposure). Such gradual, alternating exposure and
      covering of each solar cell of each anti-parallel connected solar
      cell pair is periodic.<br>
      <br>
      This periodic sequence is illustrated in Figs. 8A through 8E.
      Figs. 8A through 8E are a representation of the manner in which
      two solar cells of a solar cell pair are alternately, gradually
      exposed and covered to produce an a/c waveform. The principles of
      the present invention are applicable to any connection
      configuration of solar cell pairs, whether opposite one another as
      in Figs. 8A through 8E, or adjacent one another as in Fig. 3.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8A is an arbitrary beginning to the sequence wherein there is
      represented a negative current at the output terminals Aout and
      Bout of the solar cell pair, at its peak negative amplitude. In
      Fig. 8A, solar cell 2OB of a solar cell pair is 100% exposed (0%
      covered) while solar cell 2OA is 0% exposed (100% covered).
      Particularly, a cutout 16 is fully over the solar cell 2OB thus
      fully exposing solar cell 2OB, while at the same time, a covering
      18 is fully over the solar cell 2OA thus fully shading (covering
      or blocking) the solar cell 2OA. A peak negative current is thus
      provided at output terminals Aout and Bout which is shown on the
      graph of Fig. 8A as current point isA- In Fig. 8B of the sequence,
      the rotating disc 15 has moved slightly counterclockwise such that
      the opening 16 that was totally exposing the solar cell 2OB is now
      exposing only 1/2 (and/or covering 1/2) of the area of the solar
      cell 2OB, while the covering 18 that was totally shading the solar
      cell 2OA is now covering only 1/2 (and/or exposing 1/2) of the
      area of the solar cell 2OA. This results in a zero (0) current at
      the output terminals Aout and Bout as shown on the graph of Fig.
      8B as current point isB- It should be appreciated that the
      rotational movement of the disc 15 from point shown in Fig. 8A to
      that shown in Fig. 8B gradually exposes and covers the solar
      cells, as described above, to create the gradual and not stepped
      a/c waveform as depicted in the graph of Fig. 8B.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 8C of the sequence, the rotating disc 15 has moved further
      slightly counterclockwise. In Fig. 8C, solar cell 2OA of a solar
      cell pair is now 100% exposed (0% covered) while solar cell 2OB is
      now 0% exposed (100% covered). A cutout 16 is fully over the solar
      cell 2OA thus fully exposing solar cell 2OA, while at the same
      time, a covering 18 is fully over the solar cell 2OB thus fully
      shading (covering or blocking) the solar cell 2OB. A peak positive
      current is thus provided at output terminals Aout and B0Ut which
      is shown on the graph of Fig. 8A as current point i8C. Again, it
      should be appreciated that the rotational movement of the disc 15
      from point shown in Fig. 8B to that shown in Fig. 8C gradually
      exposes and covers the solar cells, as described above, to create
      the gradual and not stepped a/c waveform as depicted in the graph
      of Fig. 8C.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 8D of the sequence, the rotating disc 15 has moved further
      slightly counterclockwise such that the opening 16 that was
      totally exposing the solar cell 2OA is now exposing only 1/2
      (and/or covering 1/2) of the area of the solar cell 2OA, while the
      covering 18 that was totally shading the solar cell 2OB is now
      covering only 1/2 (and/or exposing 1/2) of the area of the solar
      cell 2OB. While opposite to that of Fig. 8B, this results in a
      zero (0) current at the output terminals Aout and Bout as shown on
      the graph of Fig. 8D as current point i8D. Again, it should be
      appreciated that the rotational movement of the disc 15 from point
      shown in Fig. 8C to that shown in Fig. 8D gradually exposes and
      covers the solar cells, as described above, to create the gradual
      and not stepped a/c waveform as depicted in the graph of Fig. 8D.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, in Fig. 8E of the sequence, the disk has moved further
      counterclockwise such that a cutout 16 has moved fully over solar
      cell 2OB such that solar cell 2OB is again 100% exposed (0%
      covered) while a covering 18 has again moved fully over the solar
      cell 2OA such that the solar cell 2OA is 0% exposed (100%
      covered). Particularly, the cutout 16 is fully over the solar cell
      2OB thus fully exposing solar cell 2OB, while at the same time, a
      covering 18 is fully over the solar cell 2OA thus fully shading
      (covering or blocking) the solar cell 2OA. A peak negative current
      is thus again provided at output terminals Aout and Bout which is
      shown on the graph of Fig. 8E as current point i8E- Again, it
      should be appreciated that the rotational movement of the disc 15
      from point shown in Fig. 8D to that shown in Fig. 8E gradually
      exposes and covers the solar cells, as described above, to create
      the gradual and not stepped a/c waveform as depicted in the graph
      of Fig. 8E. Fig. 8E completes a full cycle of the a/c waveform.<br>
      <br>
      Referring back to Fig. 3, the total number of solar cells 20 must
      be an even number since two solar cells 20 are utilized to provide
      a solar cell pair having a single a/c junction. Multiple solar
      cell pairs are connected together to increase the voltage or
      amperage depending on the connection. Connection of all of the
      solar cell pairs of the array 21 produces a single phase a/c
      waveform. The solar cell pairs may use three connected banks of
      solar cells pairs to achieve a three-phase a/c waveform. In Fig.
      3, since the total number of solar cell pairs is fifteen (15) they
      all can be connected to form a single phase a/c waveform, or they
      can be divided into three (3) banks of five (5) solar cell pairs
      each to achieve a three-phase a/c/ waveform.<br>
      <br>
      Referring additionally to Fig. 6, a solar cell pair 66 of solar
      cells 2OA and 2OB is shown. As can be seen, the solar cell pair 66
      is connected in anti-parallel to provide an a/c junction (i.e. two
      a/c output terminals Aout and Bout)- Particularly, the positive
      terminal of the solar cell 2OB is connected to the negative
      terminal of the solar cell 2OA, while the positive terminal of the
      solar cell 2OA is connected to the negative terminal of the solar
      cell 2OB. It should be appreciated that Fig. 6 is illustrative of
      the manner in which solar cell pairs 66 are connected and form an
      a/c junction. Other configurations are contemplated. In Fig. 3 for
      example, two adjacent solar cells 20 are connected in
      anti-parallel to provide a solar cell pair such that junctions 60
      and 61 (as seen in Figs. 3 and 5) correspond to the two a/c output
      terminals Aout and Bout-<br>
      <br>
      A single solar cell pair 66 may be used to create a/c electricity
      utilizing an appropriately fashioned rotating disc. A single solar
      cell pair would thus produce a single phase a/c waveform. Three,
      single solar cell pairs can produce a three-phase a/c waveform.
      Multiple, single solar cell pairs can produce a multi-phase a/c
      waveform. However, to generate a 60 Hz a/c waveform, the disc
      (having only a single cutout) would have to spin at a rate of
      sixty revolutions per second. Therefore, multiple solar cell pairs
      may be connected together to provide a single a/c junction. This
      allows voltage and amperage to be increased as desired since the
      number of such series or parallel connected solar cells is
      unlimited, as well as slow down the rate of revolution of the disc
      15.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 7, the array 21 is shown connected for a single
      phase a/c waveform wherein any number of solar cells represented
      by solar cells 20Ai, 20A2, 20A3, 20A4, 20A5 through 20An are
      coupled to form the single a/c junction terminal Aout, while any
      number of solar cells represented by solar cells 20B1, 20B2, 20B3,
      20B4, 20B5 through 20Bn are coupled to form the single a/c
      junction terminal Bout&gt; thereby forming a "solar cell pair".
      The solar cells 20 are shown connected in parallel to increase the
      amperage and maintain the voltage. Connecting the solar cells 20
      in series would increase the voltage and maintain the amperage. In
      Fig. 3, the solar cell array 21 is wired to produce single phase
      a/c electricity. Each solar cell pair of the array 21 has the
      first and second a/c junctions 60, 61 which can be seen in Fig. 5
      to be connected to provide a single a/c junction 56, 58. As such
      one of the output terminals 46, 48 would provide the single phase
      a/c electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The connections 24 to and from the phase synchronizer 40, as best
      discerned in Fig. 5, provide a/c output from the phase
      synchronizer and signal input to the phase synchronizer. Terminals
      46 and 48 provide a/c electricity output. Terminal 51 provides a
      shared signal input, while terminal 52 provide a commercial signal
      input. These can be used by the phase synchronizer to regulate the
      present a/c generator.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 9 is a schematic of an exemplary embodiment of the motor
      control portion of the phase synchronizer 40. Motor speed is
      controlled in order to adjust the rotation rate of the disc 15 to
      provide a correct phase. As discerned in Figs. 2 and 3, the
      present solar cell a/c electricity generator 10 includes three (3)
      photo or opto transistors 30, 32, and 34 that are situated
      proximate one solar cell 20. Particularly, a first phototransistor
      30 is positioned ahead of the solar cell 2Op (see Fig. 3) as per
      counterclockwise rotation of the disc 15. A second phototransistor
      32 is positioned at the middle of the solar cell 2Op, while a
      third phototransistor 34 is positioned at the end of the solar
      cell 2Op. The first, second and third phototransistors 30, 32, 34
      work to provide a signal to control the motor which controls the
      rate of rotation of the disc 15 which controls the frequency of
      the generated a/c electricity. Although 60 Hz is shown as an input
      (a predetermined operating frequency) to the phase synchronizer,
      other frequencies can be generated and synchronized by the present
      solar cell a/c electricity generator 10. The inputted signal
      provides power for the phototransistors 30, 32, 34 through
      transistor Ti . The phototransistors detect phase of the waveform
      through rotation of the disc 15 and, particularly the cutouts 16
      and/or the coverings 18 relative to the phototransistors 30, 32,
      34. The phototransistor 30 provides a slow phase signal, the
      phototransistor 32 provides an in-phase signal, while the
      phototransistor 34 provides a fast phase signal. The
      phototransistors provide their signals to the signal conditioning
      network TN which, in turn, provides a signal to the motor 26.
      Phototransistor 30 connects through transistor T2, while
      phototransistor 34 connects through transistor T3. An in-phase LED
      68 is provided for indicated when the waveform is in phase. As
      well, a bank of LEDs 770 may be provided to provide visual
      indication of phase. It should also be appreciated that the
      resistor Ri and R2 may be variable resistors if desired to provide
      adjustment to the signal conditioning network TN.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 10 is a flow chart 100 of an exemplary manner of operation of
      the present solar cell a/c electricity generator 10. Through use
      of the photocell 42, the light intensity is checked via the light
      sensor 102. If there is low light or no light, the generator 10
      goes into a timed standby 104. At the end of the standby period,
      light intensity is checked again 102. If there is sufficient
      light, the phase choice is started 106. It should be appreciated
      that the check light intensity portion may be excluded when there
      is a switched on and off. After the start of phase choice 106, it
      is determined whether a commercial signal is detected 108. If no,
      then it is determined whether it is a shared signal 110. If yes
      then on to motor control 114. If no, then it is determined whether
      the signal is an internal signal 112. Motor control 114 is then
      started if it is. If a commercial signal is detected at 108, then
      motor control 114 is started.<br>
      <br>
      Once motor control is started, it is determined whether phase
      match is reached 116. If yes, then the generator 10 will connect
      to a load 118. If no, then phasing is adjusted 120. Thereafter, it
      is determined when phase match is reached in order to connect to
      load 118. Also, there may be a periodic check or ongoing check to
      determine phase match with a possible disconnect of the load if
      phase match is not occurring.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be appreciated that the present solar cell a/c
      electricity generator 10 may be one of a plurality of solar cell
      a/c electricity generators that can form a power station or any
      wattage assembly. A plurality of solar cell a/c electricity
      generators may be connected as desired to provide various power
      configurations.<br>
