      Recent development tend to fulfill the old, old dream of power
      transmission without wires. For years men have labored in vain to
      transmit power without wires and thus solve a myriad of
      transportation problems, such as propelling vehicles, ships,
      trains, aircraft, etc., without having to include a source of
      power in their construction. It makes one's head almost reel to
      think of the possibilities in such an achievement and now the
      dream promises to come true.<br>
      <br>
      By one bold stroke an English genius, Mr John Hettinger, has
      unthinkingly opened up the way for its realization. Like numerous
      other inventions, the way lay before our very eyes, but we were
      all too blind to see it.<br>
      <br>
      While working on a means for transmitting radio waves without
      aerials, Mr Hettinger hit upon the idea of using ionized light
      beams as conductors. Obviously simple when one thinks about it.<br>
      <br>
      It is a well known fact that an ionized gas is a conductor; in
      fact, the conductivity of a gas is a measure of its ionization.
      Furthermore, it is possible to ionize a gas by means of a stream
      of ultraviolet rays. Working with these facts, Mr Hettinger
      devised means to utilize them in the following manner.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 1, a source of ultraviolet rays, an arc or
      mercury lamp, A, is arranged to throw a beam of ionizing rays
      vertically.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="wireless1a.jpg" height="531"
          width="710"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      These rays result in an ionized stream of air that acts as a
      conductor, the surrounding un-ionized air being practically a
      perfect insulator. By making connection to this conducting beam
      with a metallic screen or mesh at B, it can be utilized as an
      aerial for radio communication.<br>
      <br>
      We are perfectly aware that this ionized beam rapidly loses its
      conducting power as the distance from the source increases,
      therefore the effective height of such an arrangement is
      determined by the intensity of the ray generator. So much for the
      idea as applied to radio communication.<br>
      <br>
      But let us consider further. In studying the spectrum we find that
      the sunlight on reaching the earth contains few ultraviolet rays
      of shorter wavelength than 3000 Angstrom units, yet we are able to
      generate much shorter rays with an arc light. It is unreasonable
      to assume that shorter waves do not leave the sun, and in view of
      the fact that it has been determined that the upper stratum of our
      atmosphere is ionized, it is accepted that the shorter rays are
      absorbed to cause this ionization.<br>
      <br>
      It will now be apparent that a very good condition exists for the
      transmission of energy without wires. As shown in Fig. 2, we have
      the earth, a good conductor, surrounded with a blanket of
      insulating air about ten miles thick, beyond which, up to about
      100 miles, the air is highly rarefied and kept in a state of
      ionization by light from the sun and stars.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, we have two good conductors separated by several miles of
      atmosphere, practically a perfect insulator, an ideal arrangement
      for our purposes. We have but to connect a source of current to
      the earth and to the ionized strata of air and energy can be
      transmitted entirely around the earth without wires. The energy
      could be utilized in any part of the earth by merely connecting to
      the pair of conductors.<br>
      <br>
      This condition has been recognized for some time, but the
      difficulty lies in making connections to the upper atmosphere. It
      is hardly practical to construct towers six or seven high for the
      purpose, then again the energy could not be utilized without using
      a similar structure at the point of reception, which makes this
      scheme hardly feasible for aircraft or moving vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Return then to the ionized stream for radio aerials. We can easily
      construct arcs that will throw a beam 10 or 20 miles. Then why not
      make connection to that upper stratum with an ionized stream of
      air? Wonderful in its simplicity.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 2 the writer attempts to portray a generating station
      embodying these principles. In the main building will be housed
      the generating units for supplying the current to the arc and the
      primary of the high voltage apparatus for transmission of energy.
      Supported on the roof of this structure will be a monstrous arc
      lamp capable of throwing a stream of UV rays for at least 10
      miles. In this beam is supported a conducting screen to make
      connection to the con<b>d</b>ucting stream of ionized air. The
      insulation of these parts present no great difficulties to modern
      engineering.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="wireless1ab.jpg" height="292"
          width="481"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The building will also house a huge stepup transformer, a set of
      high voltage condensers, a spark gap either of the rotary or
      quenched type and a huge oscillation transformer or Tesla coil.
      These instruments are connected in the usual manner and tuned so
      that the inductance in the circuit and the capacity formed by the
      earth and ionized upper strata will have a well defined
      oscillation period.<br>
      <br>
      By these means the whole body of the earth will become an
      electrified body, energy to be drawn at any point simply by making
      metallic connection to the earth and pointing a beam of light
      vertically, a screen being used to take the energy that will flow
      down the beam. An inductance coil being necessary in the circuit
      to ensure resonance with the transmitter at the receiving set.
      After once started, the receiving energy can be used to keep the
      arc going.<br>
      <br>
      Ships will have an arc and reflector mounted on the masts,
      aeroplanes have two arcs, one on top, the other below, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      This scheme will not interfere with short range transmission, it
      being hardly practical for each home to have an arc on the roof
      when one arc would serve for a town and several for a large city.<br>
      <br>
      Rather its benefit will lie in the utilization of water falls far
      from civilization, now unused on account of difficulties in
      transmitting the power hundreds or thousands of miles.<br>
      <br>
      Aside from the transmission of power other advantages may accrue.
      Will such stress between the earth and upper air reduce the
      presence of dust particles in the atmosphere? Or again, cause the
      immediate condensation of fogs and moisture in the air to give us
      perfectly cloudless days? Perhaps it will become simply a matter
      of changing the frequency or voltage of the current to cause rain
      to to prevent it.<br>
      <br>
      Then the question of effect on radio communication: will it make
      our present sets obsolete, a transmitter of the future being
      connected directly to the power set and acting by superimposing
      different frequencies on the power frequency? Or will
      radio-telephony work hand in hand with the power system, the voice
      currents being impressed on the power circuit and filtered out at
      the receiver?<br>
      <br>
      There are a thousand and one things such an arrangement might
      effect. Will trees and vegetation increase in growth as
      experiments in electrical culture would indicate? What effect
      would such stresses have on germs and bacilli? Their numbers will
      be decreased by the destructive effects of the UV light. Will man
      grow to an unsuspected height and become uniformly healthier due
      to the electrical treatment he would be constantly undergoing?<br>
      <br>
      And so on -- conjecture is without bounds, but the scheme is
      practical to all appearances; it requires but some financial
      genius to give it a trial.<br>
      <br>
      And to think it was all within reach such a short time ago! Had
      Tesla but put a gigantic arc on top of the tower of his
      experimental station in Long Island accurate data would be at hand
      now -- were it but even a promise it would mean another step
      towards the final mastery of all matter by man.<br>
