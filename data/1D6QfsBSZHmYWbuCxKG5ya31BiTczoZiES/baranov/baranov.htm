        <p align="left">My name is Alexander Baranov, I'm a scientist of
          National University of the Nuclear energy and the Industry,
          being outside the Russian Federation. I develop the
          alternative "know-how" of energy which are available me data,
          allow to approve, that there has come the end of an epoch of
          oil and gas. As a matter of fact, I am the enemy of Russia,
          successful realization of my theme will essentially reduce
          receipt to Russia of money from sale of oil and gas. </p>
        <p align="left">And as to me is what to tell on the given theme,
          still and the dangerous enemy. </p>
        <p align="left">I perfectly understand, my scientific activity
          can result in what consequences for economy of Russia. Also I
          guess, what consequences can come for me personally. </p>
        <p align="left">Nevertheless, I have made a decision, and I
          operate according to this decision. The person has practically
          destroyed the inhabitancy, but there is not passed yet a point
          of return, on my belief, it is necessary to accept emergency
          measures for rescue of biosphere... </p>
        <p align="left">Each person has a strength, as well as at metal,
          and today there was an event which has compelled to operate me
          as much as possible quickly, and is as much as possible
          effective. </p>
        <p align="left">Water can be used as fuel in automobile internal
          combustion engines without their essential alteration. </p>
        <p align="left">How it to make? </p>
        <p align="left">Water in itself is not fuel, and does not burn.
          But water is an initial component of fuel, by simple
          transformations it will be transformed that burns, for
          example, in methane, the chemical formula-CH4, propane, and
          butane-C2H5. All these gases are hydrocarbons, that is contain
          two chemical elements - carbon and hydrogen, and turn out from
          water the chemical formula of -H20. But allow, you will tell,
          in fact in water there is no carbon? No, but during
          transformation to water it appears under scheme O = C + D + D,
          where about - oxygen, with - carbon, D - deuterium (double
          hydrogen). D, by the way is the most valuable chemical element
          for the nuclear industry. For allocation of heavy water from
          usual into which it enters, complex, expensive technologies
          are used. Here, it turns out without special problems. </p>
        <p align="left">That you have read through, it any more
          chemistry, is NUCLEAR reaction. </p>
        <p align="left">How it to carry out? </p>
        <p align="left">For this purpose the process externally
          reminding electrolysis is used, <b>high-frequency resonant
            transformer ( Tesla Coil )</b> which impulses of a current
          transform atom of oxygen so only is used, that it breaks up to
          three splinters - carbon and two D. </p>
        <p align="left">Power balance of reaction of full conformity
          with the law of conservation of energy k=50. </p>
        <p align="left">That is energy of combustion of gaseous products
          of decomposition of water in 50 times surpasses the energy
          spent for it. </p>
        <p align="left">For those who has not understood, I shall
          remind, that the Law of conservation of energy - the organic
          law of the nature, consisting that energy of the closed system
          is kept in time. In other words, energy cannot arise from
          anything and cannot disappear anywhere, it can pass only from
          one form in another. </p>
        <p align="left">Then superfluous energy is 50 times more spent
          whence has undertaken? Where a mistake? </p>
        <p align="left">This that well-known energy of communication
          counted with Enstein’s formula: delta E = delta MC^2, where C
          -speed of light. </p>
        <p align="left">The known scientist, <b>Boris Vasilevich
            Bolotov</b> has constructed skilled installation, on
          splitting water with the subsequent synthesis of hydrocarbons,
          more in detail </p>

            "><b>http://www.aif.ua/articles/article.aspx?IssueId=115&amp;ArticleId=1835</b></a>
        </p>
        <p align="left">I confirm, working capacity of this
          installation. </p>
        <p align="left">The water having cluster structure, except for
          it can be transformed to fuel due to redistribution of own
          internal energy after introduction of an additive, for example
          a liquid mix of hydrocarbons which on weight can be less than
          one percent. </p>
        <p align="left">Process of transformation reminds a chain
          falling , a domino where in a role of an initial impulse
          dropping the first&nbsp; **&nbsp; the domino acts an additive.

        <p align="left">Hydrogen fuel </p>
        <p align="left">I with my colleague Evgeny Gurevich Antonov
          working main technologist scientifically a production
          association of name LAVOCHKIN, about 20 years ago we have
          dealt with a problem of alternative fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">In 1996 the congress of the USA has made a
          decision on creation of fuel on a hydrogen basis calculated on
          2&amp;#1054; years. </p>
        <p align="left">Back or little bit earlier president Bush has
          declared half a year, that through 5 years the USA will not
          require oil. 5years&nbsp; the big term and president Bush can
          be mistaken, or to it have given the incorrect information. </p>
        <p align="left">You now will see burning water, hydrogen fuel on
          the basis of water is more exact. Percent of the maintenance
          of water in initial components of a mix it is essential more
          than 99 %. </p>
        <p align="left">I suggest to construct our dialogue under the
          following scheme: you see water. Check up, that it is water. </p>
        <p align="left">Smell, drink. </p>
        <p align="left">Tell, what you have drunk? </p>
        <p align="left">-it pure water </p>
        <p align="left">I ask the second witness to confirm that it is
          water. </p>
        <p align="left">I confirm, pure water. </p>
        <p align="left">Now you drink. To follow-I shall drink. </p>
        <p align="left">Water is&nbsp; it an Africa water. Russian
          humour. </p>
        <p align="left">And suddenly it burns? From Americans have
          bought. Russian humour. </p>
        <p align="left">Let's check up it. </p>
        <p align="left">After the flame of a lighter has evaporated
          water, the paper has started to burn. </p>
        <p align="left">You see, water does not burn. </p>
        <p align="left">Now add water in two small bottle, up to the
          certain level. </p>
        <p align="left">There is enough. </p>
        <p align="left">Now here. </p>
        <p align="left">Before you two small bottles of water. </p>
        <p align="left">Now I am insolent in a hand diesel fuel which
          has been bought on automobile refuelling. </p>
        <p align="left">Let's check up it and we shall see, how burns
          diesel fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">You see a bright flame and a soot. The result is
          predicted a paper impregnated by fuel burns well. </p>
        <p align="left">Now I type diesel fuel and we add in water. We
          close bottles. Bottles after that we shake up. Water has grown
          turbid. </p>
        <p align="left">How you estimate quantity of the added fuel in
          water? </p>
        <p align="left">I believe the additive of fuel in water less
          than 1 %. </p>
        <p align="left">That there has passed process of reorganization
          of structure of water and water has ceased to be water and
          diesel fuel has reconstructed the structure too and as a
          result it has turned out new substances some time is
          necessary. Therefore we still a little bit shall stir up. </p>
        <p align="left">While it is two phase mix, but it becomes a
          homogeneous liquid after a while. </p>
        <p align="left">We expect 5 minutes, Now we wish to declare: </p>
        <p align="left">I shall speak and Evgeny Gurevich will show
          documents. </p>
        <p align="left">That you see is a product. You are convinced of
          it. </p>
        <p align="left">This product has obtained the international
          recognition. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Swiss corporation RGS or RJS investigated and
            has confirmed properties of a product and has estimated,
            here the conclusion: heat of combustion of standard fuel 46
            Points, and diesel fuel 43 Points. We gave them a mix of 50
            % of fuel.</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Also you see the conclusion of laboratory of
          mineral oil and fuel of South Korea with tables in figures,
          schedules. Also we have the offer on cooperation from
          South-Korean investors. </p>
        <p align="left">Also we have the conclusion from institute of
          problems of natural sciences which confirm, that the product
          is fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">It is small station of generation of heat near
          the city of Zelenograd. This standard boiler-house constructed
          in 1950. Boilers of a Podolsk factory are used. On a photo in
          the bottom boiler burns diesel fuel, on top photo-our new
          fuel. 50 % are mixed with standard fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">It has been made not by us. It has been made by
          one of services of the government of Moscow. </p>
        <p align="left">They have made fuel under our control, and they
          stored its two months for full reorganization of structure. </p>
        <p align="left">After tests, results and the report have been
          transferred to us. The mix of standard fuel of 50 % -50 % new
          fuel was used. The charge of a mix was on 30 % less, than at
          use of standard fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">I am most of all convinced that we have made
          unique technology the conclusion about market cost of actives
          of the project. The conclusion is made by a bureau of
          financial consultations and estimations. The patent for the
          invention is estimated from above $ 5 billion. </p>
        <p align="left">Also I was convinced that we have made a great
          thing, after viewing a response of The academician Frolov
          Konstantin Vasilevich, unfortunately it has died, I know. </p>
        <p align="left">It was very cautious person, it carefully checks
          all. </p>
        <p align="left">Search for the conclusion of academician Frolov.
        </p>
        <p align="left">Here it: </p>
        <p align="left">Dear Konstantin Fedorovich, writes it to the
          manager of the project. It is possible to show, the form of
          committee at the president of Russia. Academician Frolov
          writes: <b>During special physical processing
            water-hydrocarbonic mixes with a high probability an
            established fact of reception steady in time and on
            properties of essentially new class of the chemical
            compounds possessing properties of liquid combustible
            materials. The parity of water and hydrocarbons in
            investigated samples made from 10 up to 90 %, with
            preservation of ability to ignition</b>. I consider this
          direction very important for industrial application as
          effective ecological fuel. In current of two years after
          optimization the output on an industrial level of production
          is possible. </p>
        <p align="left">The person which wrote it very cautious. I have
          read through its conclusion in which it has recognized the
          important invention and have understood, that we could
          convince it that this technology works well. </p>
        <p align="left">I wish to tell, Jury Ivanovich began career in
          firm Lavochkin we have started to cooperate 15-17 years ago. </p>
        <p align="left">We have begun earlier other interesting theme
          which has received Paul Borodina's high estimation which held
          a post of the president of Russia operating affairs. </p>
        <p align="left">It writes: Dear Valery Nikolaevich! </p>
        <p align="left">Researches on creation of thermal energy sources
          spent by Mr. Krasnov are priority for creation of alternative
          power of the future. </p>
        <p align="left">I ask to accelerate as much as possible works on
          this theme, and bench tests. </p>
        <p align="left">Then we worked with other theme – heat
          generator, we for the first time have fixed plasma in a
          liquid. </p>
        <p align="left">On result of these tests we have come to
          conclusion about danger of cold thermonuclear synthesis
          without reliable biological protection. Experiences were spent
          on mice. </p>
        <p align="left">That theme has been transferred to other
          experts, and we have borrowed in this technology. </p>
        <p align="left">Hydrogen liquid fuel on the basis of
          connections. </p>
        <p align="left">We have agreeed to creating pre-production
          models of installations both for the structured water and for
          reception of fuel and for application of this water in an
          agriculture and farmers. </p>
        <p align="left">I think, we should in it to year at support
          leave on creation of installations, carry out all researches.
          And we on a horse. I am right, Jury Ivanovich? </p>
        <p align="left">But it is difficult. The problem is solved very
          much greater. To replace oil with water. </p>
        <p align="left">We can speak about it much. The biosphere is
          practically destroyed. Let's look, has passed more than 5
          minutes. </p>
        <p align="left">Yes the god will help us. And it is completely
          not ridiculous. </p>
        <p align="left">The paper burns not. And by what it is
          impregnated. </p>
        <p align="left">Let's repeat with other bottle. Too most. </p>
        <p align="left">Character of burning and temperature above than
          at burning diesel fuel. Everyone see a greater difference.
          Even in the city of Odessa. Russian humour. </p>
        <p align="left">Through certain time when reorganization of
          structure will occur more strongly water, water is more exact
          any more, will burn a <b>dark blue flame</b> as spirit. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Now the product burned 1500-1600 degrees
            celsies, and at long endurance temperature reaches 2000
            degrees.</b> </p>
        <p align="left">We speak a science and a science, Evgenie, where
          leaflets red? </p>
        <p align="left">Closely look at these two documents, </p>
        <p align="left">These are absolutely unique photos. You see
          structure of a product about which academician Frolov wrote. </p>
        <p align="left">And here it is structure of water. Here that
          water. Which is a source of a life. </p>
        <p align="left">Pictures are made with use of an electronic
          microscope in chamber Kirlian and with ex-potential influence

        <p align="left">This installation is only in Russia in any
          country except for Russia these researches to make it is
          impossible. </p>
        <p align="left">Conclusion before you plasma. </p>
        <p align="left">Water in the form of plasma. </p>
        <p align="left">That plasma to receive which 40 years scientists
          of all world and academician Velihov for thermonuclear
          synthesis try. </p>
        <p align="left">Instead of 20 billion roubles on researches,
          Russia did not finance us. </p>
        <p align="left">We have not received any cent. All have made. </p>
        <p align="left">Besides our work was stirred by competitors.
          They created to us problems. I understand, that we see a
          miracle, but it not a miracle, -it is physics. </p>
        <p align="left">You remember the Bible where it is told about a
          miracle in a temple when </p>
        <p align="left">Jesus has transformed water into wine? </p>
        <p align="left">Then it was a miracle. Now we speak, it is
          physics. </p>
        <p align="left">We are able to do it by means of technical
          devices. </p>
        <p align="left">According to the bible the Christ could to do
          miracles without the industrial equipment. </p>
        <p align="left">Modern researches in the physicist show, that
          transformation of one chemical elements in another for example
          Li2O=Si is possible </p>
        <p align="left">Water turns to wine, the basis hydrogen and
          oxygen and is a little carbon. </p>
        <p align="left">Which turns out from oxygen. </p>
        <p align="left">The modern science knows far not all. We are
          waited with new opening. </p>
        <p align="left">The science does not answer a question why the
          ground why galaxies have the form of a spiral as the atom we
          till now is arranged do not know precisely, interaction of a
          proton spins and **&nbsp; is not studied. </p>
        <p align="left">The modern science only pretends, that
          understands the device of the world. In 1946 Schrödinger has
          told: any of laws of a modern science in wildlife does not
          work in exact conformity with the theory. </p>
        <p align="left">Hence, I have the right to draw a conclusion: </p>
        <p align="left">Or the wildlife is arranged incorrectly, or our
          representations are erroneous, and knowledge are inexact and
          incomplete. </p>
        <p align="left">That you have now seen that, it is the first
          confident step to true understanding of the device of the
          world and space, understanding of an essence of things... </p>
        <p align="left">As a matter of fact it is revolution, in fact if
          chemical elements in a periodic table represent assembly from
          hydrogen, as from LEGO, new opening will be often. </p>
        <p align="left">Very important question. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Cost of reception of this water of 1000 kg =
            $5-7 can be $10.</b> </p>
        <p align="left">You know cost of diesel fuel, how many it is
          necessary you saw. </p>
        <p align="left">Business the plan write. We trust you. </p>
        <p align="left">Jury Ivanovich has not noted one important
          moment-clearly, that it is a new kind of fuel. </p>
        <p align="left">We filled diesel engines of tractors of our
          farmers, and they worked without problems. </p>
        <p align="left">I confirm. The technology is tested. Tractors
          ploughed the ground. </p>
        <p align="left">Evgeniy, it has what value in comparison with
          the fact that water burns. </p>
        <p align="left">All is equal where it burns in boilers, tractors
          or turbines. </p>
        <p align="left">Problem in other: today for Russia is
          unprofitable to open to the world this technology. </p>
        <p align="left">Russia a big exporter of oil and gas. </p>
        <p align="left">Therefore it is absolutely unprofitable to
          Russia. </p>
        <p align="left">Moreover, introduction of this fuel represents
          threat for the budget of Russia. </p>
        <p align="left">And this threat not only for Russia. </p>
        <p align="left">Therefore we address to the world that you knew,
          that such technology exists, and Russian are still capable of
          much. </p>
        <p align="left">We plan to put pressure through distribution of
          this technology upon the government of Russia. </p>
        <p align="left">The last, that I wish to tell. </p>

        <p align="left"><b>Abstract --</b>&nbsp; The present invention
          is directed to a method for cracking hydrocarbons whereby the
          hydrocarbon educt is fed to a reactor in which the educt is
          provided with deuterium or deuterium compounds or with the
          disintegration product thereof. The invention further is
          directed to a reactor for cracking hydrocarbons having an
          inlet and an outlet as well as a substance which is adapted to
          release deuterium or deuterium compounds in the heated state
          when applying electric current pulses. The invention is
          further directed to an ultrasonic reactor having a spherical
          reactor wall in which at least two ultrasonic generators are
          provided at opposite portions of the reactor such that the
          ultrasonic waves are focused in the centre of the reactor. </p>
