      Professor Moussa, leader of the study team says in the interview
      that C60 (Buckminsterfullerene) is totally non-toxic. He has been
      researching Fullerene C60 for 18 years. Perhaps the most
      interesting part of the interview is that the research team killed
      the last surviving rat after 5.5 years because they were eager to
      conclude the experiment and publish its incredible results. So
      that rat did not die of natural causes and could have lived even
      longer. The Wistar rat used in the study normally lives only 2 to
      3 years.<br>
      <br>
      This site has articles on all aspects of this exciting new
      product. We found animal studies that documented brain
      rejuvenation in mice and the near-doubling of lifespan (PDF) and
      the prevention of cancer and the diseases of old age in rats. We
      also found toxicological studies that show that C60
      (Buckminsterfullerene) in olive oil is safe. C60 in olive oil also
      has an extremely effective liver-protective effect, as documented
      in the same publication, where rats were poisoned to death with
      liver-destroying chemicals but the rats that took C60 barely were
      affected at all. Prof. Moussa mentions this in the interview:<br>
      <br>
      “The rats that took C60 did not develop any tumors, unlike the
      rats in the control group.”<br>
      <br>
      The scientific article this product is based on can be downloaded
      on the left sidebar of this site and in it you can see the autopsy
      results of the rat livers that were poisoned with a very toxic
      chemical. The rats that did not receive C60 beforehand quickly
      died and their livers look very pale and damaged. The C60-rats
      barely were affected and an autopsy showed healthy-looking livers.<br>

      At the time of publication of the scientific publiction, many
      mainstream newspapers reported on this extraordinary breakthrough,
      however they all appeared to have pulled their articles because
      there is not a single trace to be found anywhere online anymore,
      not even using Google news. Zero search results for
      buckminsterfullerene lifespan in Google News, for example.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to this strange scrubbing of news articles, there
      seems to be a concerted effort underway to spread disinformation
      on those articles that remain in the “really free press” (not
      owned by large multinational media conglomerates). Blatant
      disinformation is posted such as: “The longevity effect was mainly
      due to the olive oil, there was not much added benefit of the
      buckyballs” – blatantly untrue, since the C60-rats lived a full
      two years longer than the EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) control
      group. Note that the average rat only gets a couple of years old!
      There are also commenters who falsely claim that the extended
      lifespan was “theoretical only”, “based on
      extrapolation/estimation”. The opposite is the case: The rats were
      monitored until they died of natural causes. They lived 90% longer
      than rats on a normal diet. 5.5 years old, breaking the record for
      Wistar rats by an incredible margin. None of the rats died of the
      usual tumors or pneumonia – they all died of the generalized
      effects of old age. They aged twice as slow as normal and none of
      them died of any disease. Interestingly, the C60 preserved the
      extra virgin oilive oil very effectively: After six years, when
      the experiment had been concluded after all rats had died, the oil
      still had not turned rancid.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion: Carbon 60 in extra virgin olive oil is perhaps the
      most effective anti-aging and cancer-prevention agent imaginable.
      The brains of elderly mice rejuvenated to the level of young mice
      in a separate study. The C60-oil rats reached their maximum
      genetically determined lifespan (Hayflick limit). None of the rats
      died of the typical tumors they get in old age or, another common
      cause of death, pneumonia due to a weakened immune system. This
      news seems to be deliberately suppressed by the corporate media
      and there appears that there is an effort underway to discredit
      the published rat study and spread disinformation about its
      findings. A world where people don’t get cancer is a very scary
      world for Big Pharma.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Who is taking this and what do they report?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the news of the scientific experiment broke, a group of
      “early adopters” started to manufacture their own C60 in olive
      oil. Some invested in expensive equipment or had access to a lab
      and followed the original experiment to the letter, others cut
      corners. More than a thousand bottles have been sold by us in that
      phase as well. Initially, on Longecity.org was a huge thread with
      the experiences of those intrepid first-timers, but that thread
      has been removed, apparently because nearly everyone who took it
      reported immediate, long-lasting beneficial effects of the C60 in
      oil. The moderators then removed the thread, deleted the positive
      mentions of dozens of first-time-users and announced that they had
      split the thread into a scientific discussion on C60 only and a
      discussion on how to manufacture the product at home only, and
      that any mention of positive effects of C60 in extra virgin olive
      oil was explicitly forbidden and would be censored. You can verify
      this announced policy in these threads:<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      The above threads are by far the most important threads discussing
      C60 online and the censorship is fortunately limited to the
      deletion of the mention of positive side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, on the deleted thread, the majority of experimenters
      reported these beneficial effects: More energy ... Less sleep
      needed ... “Mental inprovements” ... Can lift much heavier
      weights, sometimes to the point of causing tendon injury. Commonly
      reported... Can do more reps of the same weight. This was the most
      commonly reported benefit. People were adamant that there was a
      great difference, comparable to taking Creatine and that not even
      anabolic steroids enabled such an immediate increase of both
      repetitions and max. weight... Calmer, reduction in stress... Can
      run longer with seemingly more effective utilization of Oxygen.
      Less fatigue. “Cardiac improvements”. Better stamina and
      endurance... Can run faster whilst feeling more comfortable with a
      pulse that would normally be too high for steady-state... Higher
      libido. This is also seen in rat trials, already with 4
      micrograms/kg, a dose five times lower than what we recommend as a
      daily dose.... Faster recovery of the skin after sunburn (with
      topical application).<br>
      <br>
      Some of these reported effects may of course be due to the Placebo
      effect, on the other hand any longevity- or cancer-protective
      effects would not necessarily have to be accompanied by any
      noticeable physiological phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      The current situation is:<br>
      <br>
      - Mainstream media ignored the discovery or made a cursory mention
      that they later unceremoniously removed from their sites.<br>
      <br>
      - Longevity and anti-aging forums had people taking this product
      but as soon as they started to report beneficial effects their
      posts were censored. To be honest, we do not think most people
      will notice (m)any noticeable effects when taking this product. We
      think that it may help prevent cancer and add some healthy years
      to a human’s life, but there is no way to be sure, and we will
      likely not find out this century. The results in higher mammals
      such as rodents are extremely encouraging however.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In lower organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila,
      many genes identified as key regulators of aging are involved in
      either detoxification of reactive oxygen species or the cellular
      response to oxidatively-damaged macromolecules. Transgenic mice
      have been generated to study these genes in mammalian aging, but
      have not in general exhibited the expected lifespan extension or
      beneficial behavioral effects, possibly reflecting compensatory
      changes during development. We administered a small-molecule
      synthetic enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic to wild-type
      (i.e. non-transgenic, non-senescence accelerated) mice starting at
      middle age. Chronic treatment not only reduced age-associated
      oxidative stress and mitochondrial radical production, but
      significantly extended lifespan. Treated mice also exhibited
      improved performance on the Morris water maze learning and memory
      task. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration that an
      administered antioxidant with mitochondrial activity and nervous
      system penetration not only increases lifespan, but rescues
      age-related cognitive impairment in mammals. SOD mimetics with
      such characteristics may provide unique complements to genetic
      strategies to study the contribution of oxidative processes to
      nervous system aging.<br>

      <br>
      Countless studies showed that [60]fullerene (C60) and derivatives
      could have many potential biomedical applications. However, while
      several independent research groups showed that C60 has no acute
      or subacute toxicity in various experimental models, more than 25
      years after its discovery the in vivo fate and the chronic effects
      of this fullerene remain unknown. If the potential of C60 and
      derivatives in the<br>
      biomedical field have to be fulfilled these issues must be
      addressed. Here we show that oral administration of C60 dissolved
      in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml) at reiterated doses (1.7 mg/kg of body
      weight) to rats not only does not entail chronic toxicity but it
      almost doubles their lifespan. The effects of C60-olive oil
      solutions in an experimental model of CCl4 intoxication in rat
      strongly suggest that the effect on lifespan is mainly due to the
      attenuation of age-associated increases in oxidative stress.
      Pharmacokinetic studies show that dissolved C60 is absorbed by the
      gastro-intestinal tract and eliminated in a few tens of hours.<br>
      <br>
      These results of importance in the fields of medicine and
      toxicology should open the way for the many possible -and waited
      for- biomedical applications of C60 including cancer therapy,
      neurodegenerative<br>
      disorders, and ageing.<b><br>

      <br>
      <b>Methods:</b> Lewis lung carcinoma was transplanted into

      antitumor and antimetastatic effects have been used. Results: The
      C60FAS at low single therapeutic dose of 5 mg/kg inhibited the
      growth of transplanted malignant tumor (antitumor effect) and
      metastasis (antimetastatic effect): the maximum therapeutic effect
      was found to be of 76.5% for<br>

      </b>...Bob Lazar is a pathological liar also in mundane business
      matters, because he now claims another spectacular feat (again
      without offering the slightest evidence):<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Lazar, in March 2012 when the rat study was published,
      traveled in a time machine to around 2007, so that he had the six
      years required to replicate that study, so that at the time of
      this writing, March 3, 2013, he could say: “Our partner lab
      recently completed a duplicate experiment involving 8 rats. We
      were able to produce superior results with very minor changes in

      In order to replicate the study, he needed to have rats survive to
      at least 5.5 years of age. When he used rats that were 10 months
      old, and he produced “superior results”, he would have needed
      approx. 5 years to do the study. But how can he have spent that
      time, if the study itself was only published one year ago? And
      what are “superior results”? The rats lived even more than 90%
      longer, on average? Lazar is not going to publish the results of
      his “partner lab experiment”, even though it would establish him
      as a major authority in this field, since the entire world is
      waiting for a confirmation of its results. Lazar is not going to
      publish these results, and neither is the “partner lab” because he
      is lying – there are no such results because these has never been
      such a replicated study. This means that the very high price he
      asks for his “improved” “F60? is based on a lie. There is no
      improvement – it is a shameless lie.<br>
      <br>
      On top of that, Mr. Lazar sternly warns only to buy C60 in olive
      oil from him, because others are out to scam you: “Beware of bogus
      companies and scam websites that claim to sell similar compounds
      and state that it authentic – but isn’t. We recently purchased
      some Fullerene-60 in olive oil from a very impressive website –
      only to find that there was no Fullerene-60 in it at all!”. Hmm..
      We wonder what that very impressive website might be? There is a
      very, very modest website selling C60-in-oil in the US. It’s
      basically two spartan pages. And then there was Revgenetic’s
      website, but it hardly qualifies as impressive and they stopped
      selling C60 in oil after being exposed as yet-another-scammer
      (they used sonication to force-dissolve the C60 rapidly at high
      temperature, yielding a likely less effective product), having
      only sold it for a few weeks. But even though they took a very bad
      shortcut, their C60 itself was bona-fide. That leaves our site. We
      are indeed “impressive” – we have gathered close to all relevant
      info on this topic. We offer a wealth of sometimes hard-to-find
      scientific publications, all relevant toxicity studies, user
      comments, original research, manufacturing cost breakdown,
      allotropic dosing calculations, the works. So Bob Lazar implies
      that the C60 we sell is fake, all the while making a
      preposterously fraudulent statement about his “improved F60?,
      based on a “reproduced rat study with improved results”. Abject
      nonsense of course, since there are many ways to produce
      Buckyballs, but there is only one C60 molecule. All C60 molecules
      are absolutely identical on the quantum mechanical level! But Mr.
      Lazar in his infinite wisdom found a “better way with superior
      results” and used his connections in the UFO/Area 51 world to
      travel half a decade back in time, so as to have his “improved
      replicated experiment (of rats living at least 5.5 years..)” done
      in time to start selling now...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Countless studies showed that [60]fullerene (C60) and derivatives
      could have many potential biomedical applications. However, while
      several independent research groups showed that C60 has no acute
      or sub-acute toxicity in various experimental models, more than 25
      years after its discovery the in vivo fate and the chronic effects
      of this fullerene remain unknown. If the potential of C60 and
      derivatives in the biomedical field have to be fulfilled these
      issues must be addressed. Here we show that oral administration of
      C60 dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml) at reiterated doses (1.7
      mg/kg of body weight) to rats not only does not entail chronic
      toxicity but it almost doubles their lifespan. The effects of
      C60-olive oil solutions in an experimental model of CCl4
      intoxication in rat strongly suggest that the effect on lifespan
      is mainly due to the attenuation of age-associated increases in
      oxidative stress. Pharmacokinetic studies show that dissolved C60
      is absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and eliminated in a few
      tens of hours. These results of importance in the fields of
      medicine and toxicology should open the way for the many possible
      -and waited for- biomedical applications of C60 including cancer
      therapy, neurodegenerative disorders, and ageing.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nano-scale particles have attracted a lot of attention for its
      potential use in medical studies, in particular for the diagnostic
      and therapeutic purposes. However, the toxicity and other side
      effects caused by the undesired interaction between nanoparticles
      and DNA/RNA are not clear. To address this problem, a model to
      evaluate the general rules governing how nanoparticles interact
      with DNA/RNA is demanded. Here by, use of an examination of 2254
      native nucleotides with molecular dynamics simulation and
      thermodynamic analysis, we demonstrate how the DNA/RNA native
      structures are disrupted by the fullerene (C60) in a physiological
      condition. The nanoparticle was found to bind with the minor
      grooves of double-stranded DNA and trigger unwinding and
      disrupting of the DNA helix, which indicates C60 can potentially
      inhibit the DNA replication and induce potential side effects. In
      contrast to that of DNA, C60 only binds to the major grooves of
      RNA helix, which stabilizes the RNA structure or transforms the
      configuration from stretch to curl. This finding sheds new light
      on how C60 inhibits reverse transcription as HIV replicates. In
      addition, the binding of C60 stabilizes the structures of RNA
      riboswitch, indicating that C60 might regulate the gene
      expression. The binding energies of C60 with different genomic
      fragments varies in the range of -56 to -10 kcal mol-1, which
      further verifies the role of nanoparticle in DNA/RNA damage. Our
      findings reveal a general mode by which C60 causes DNA/RNA damage
      or other toxic effects at a systematic level, suggesting it should
      be cautious to handle these nanomaterials in various medical
      applications....<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In this study, we have investigated the static and dynamic
      hybridization properties of C60 with DNA/RNA, and analyzed the
      potential toxic effects of the nanomolecule. Using statistical
      survey, MD simulations and thermodynamic analyses, we have found
      that:<br>
      <br>
      In the C60–dsDNA hybrids, C60 prefers the minor grooves of dsDNA
      involving three consecutive GC base pairs (GC3), and the major
      grooves with three consecutive AT base pairs (AT3). The presence
      of the base pair AT in the binding sites plays a key role in
      determining the groove binding specificity of C60.<br>
      <br>
      In the C60–dsRNA hybrids, C60 prefers the GC-rich regions of RNA,
      especially the GC-GC-AU sequences. More strikingly, the
      nanomolecule binds only to the major groove regions of RNA.<br>
      <br>
      The difference between the initial identified sites and the final
      stabilized sites implies that C60 initially binds to the initial
      identified sites of DNA/RNA to induce the structural changes of
      the nucleotides, such as DNA/RNA twist, unwinding and curling.
      Then, the C60 molecule moves to the final stabilized sites, which
      probably leads to potential toxic effects. This is similar to the
      process of food intake by mouth (initial) and then digestion in
      stomach (final).<br>
      <br>
      C60 hybridization enables to trigger the initiation of dsDNA
      unwinding, which probably inhibits the DNA discontinuous
      replication.<br>
      <br>
      C60 enables to disrupt the structure of G-quadruplex DNA, and
      thereby provides a possibility to activate the telomerase by
      facilitating its access to telomeres and in this way promotes the
      proliferation of tumor cells.<br>
      <br>
      C60 induces the conformational transition of HIV TAR RNA sequences
      from the stretch state to the curling state, which probably
      inhibits the HIV reverse transcription and represses the
      expression of HIV.<br>
      <br>
      C60 binds to the substrate-binding site of riboswitch RNA, showing
      great potential to be a new type of riboswitch substrate to
      regulate the gene expression.<br>
      <br>
      The nucleotides in the dsDNA stability, G-quadruplex disruption
      and stabilized riboswitch modes display much higher binding
      affinities to C60 than those in other modes, mainly due to the
      significant movement of C60, such as sliding.<br>

      A water-insoluble fullerene is at least partially dissolved in a
      biocompatible lipid carrier, especially a fat or an oil such as
      butter, olive oil, and liquid paraffin. When administered to
      mammals, the fullerene, most preferably [60]fullerene dissolved in
      olive oil, scavenges free radicals and prolongs life span in rats.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention concerns [60]fullerene and stable
      biocompatible compositions comprising [60]fullerene dissolved in a
      carrier. The present invention also relates to a method for
      increasing the expected lifespan (longevity) of a mammal, which
      comprises a step of administering [60]fullerene or a composition
      comprising a therapeutically effective amount of [60]fullerene.
      The present invention further concerns a method for preserving a
      mammal to damages caused by free radicals using said [60]fullerene
      or said composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of related art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Free radicals, such as oxygen radicals and other reactive
      oxygen/nitrogen/chlorine species (hydroxyl, nitric oxide
      radicals), are constantly formed in vivo. Some of these molecules
      are physiologically useful, but they can also result in
      pathological oxidative stress to cells and tissues. Endogenous
      defences include both antioxidants and repairing systems. However,
      excess production of free radicals, their production in
      inappropriate relative amounts or deficiencies in endogenous
      defences can have deleterious effects. Free radicals can cause
      oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, bio molecules, rises in the
      concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as activation of
      proteases, nucleases and protein kinases. Considerable evidence
      supports the view that oxidative damage involving free radicals
      occurs in most, if not all, human diseases. Oxidative stress is
      now recognized as an important contributor to the development of
      many human diseases including liver fibrosis,
      ischemia-reperfusion, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disease
      and age-related cancer as well as to process of ageing. Thus
      antioxidants and systems that can protect against oxidative stress
      are needed to maintain health. A large body of scientific evidence
      supports that oxidative stress is directly responsible for aging
      (Aging Cell. 2009, 8(3):258-69) and an array of neuropathology
      conditions (Nutrition 2010, 26:595-603. Neurochem Res. 2007,
      32:757-73). The free radical theory of aging proposes that the
      organism is unable to repair all of them and that, with time,
      unrepaired damages accumulate and put the organism at risk: in
      other words, free radicals provoke aging and death (FEBS Letters
      2009, 498: 183-186. J. Neurochem. 2009, 108:1251-65). Antioxidants
      are the substances able to react with free radicals and to protect
      the body from the damage caused by these molecules (Ital J
      Biochem. 2006, 55:263-282). In particular, consumption in excess
      of some foods which are rich sources of antioxidants is considered
      to promote good health and longevity. It is now believed that the
      maintenance of redox balance within the body can forestall aging
      and promote good health and longevity.<br>
      <br>
      Due to its 30 carbon double bonds, [60]fullerene
      (Buckminsterfullerene, Ceo) is a powerful free radical scavenger
      which characterize it as a radical sponge (Science 1991, 254, 1
      83- 1185). Biological applications of fullerenes and derivatives,
      in particular as antioxidants, have been extensively reviewed
      (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996, 4: 767- 779. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003,
      38: 913-923. Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy, 2005, 59:
      351-358). Ceo is only soluble in a limited number of organic
      solvents, such as toluene, benzene, chloronaphtalene and
      dichlorobenzene. Availability of biocompatible aqueous solutions
      of Ceo and its derivatives that are insoluble in water have been
      major obstacles to toxicity and in vivo studies of this new family
      of compounds. Biological properties of water-insoluble fullerenes
      are still misunderstood and to our knowledge there are no
      certified toxicology data about them. Most of the fullerenes
      studied until now are water-soluble derivatives, since study of
      water-insoluble fullerenes, such as pristine Ceo, in biological
      medium proves difficult. It is a common practice to derivatize the
      fullerene core with substituants such as OH, COOH, NH2 to increase
      hydrophilicity (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996, 4: 767-779. Eur. J. Med.
      Chem. 2003, 38: 913-923. Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy, 2005,
      59: 351-358). Water-soluble Ceo derivatives have been found to
      retain in vitro the free radical scavenger properties of their
      parent fullerene molecule, allowing these properties to be
      exploited in biological systems. Many patents already exist for a
      broad range of biomedical applications and other commercial
      applications of water-soluble fullerenes, including anticancer and
      anti-HIV therapies, drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, drug
      delivery systems, and preparations that retard aging. In
      particular, a group of hydrophilic Ceo derivatives,
      carboxyfullerenes, were proposed to increase metazoan's lifespan
      (U.S. Patent Application 2003/0162837). However, water-soluble
      fullerenes are difficult to synthesize and to purify. Besides, in
      contrast to pristine Ceo, which is non-toxic, some C6o-derivatives
      can be highly toxic (Adv Exp Med Biol, 2007, 620, 168-80).<br>
      <br>
      Pristine C6o has been shown to be more effective as an antioxidant
      than certain carboxyfullerenes in Wang, I. et al., J. Med. Chem.
      1999, 42, 4614-4620. However, Ceo has not been employed as an
      active ingredient to develop an in vivo treating method in this
      publication. Aqueous suspensions of Ceo are well known in the art.
      They are stable for long periods and can be delivered to cells. A
      study of &lt;14&gt;C-labeled C-60 reported that it is possible to
      form suspensions of C6o in water that are stable for long periods
      (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 4517-4518). However, the authors
      failed to detect the fullerene inside the cells and these
      suspensions containing very low concentrations of fullerene
      (typically 0.1 mg per ml) were inadequate to perform in vivo
      studies, especially toxicity studies. and metabolic fate
      investigations ((J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 4517-4518). Other
      vectorisation methods include the formation of inclusion complexes
      with cyclodextrins, calixarenes, tween-20, micelles, liposomes,
      and vesicles; however the Ceo concentrations reached by such
      methods are still very low (1 mg/mL at most) and inadequate to
      perform in vivo toxicity studies. Further, these methods present
      another drawback because they generally necessitate a preliminary
      dissolution step of the fullerene in an organic solvent. Other
      studies proposed the use of Ceo nanoparticles suspended in aqueous
      media to form a colloidal solution so-called nC60, however such
      solutions prpved to be highly toxic because they contain
      impurities linked to the oxidation byproducts of the solvents used
      during their preparation (Adv Exp Med Biol, 2007, 620, 168-80.
      Journal of Nanoscience Letters 2011 , 1 : 62-63). Another method,
      disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3186-3188 uses
      polyvinyl-pyrrolidone to solubilize C6o; however this vehicle can
      react with fullerene and the formed complex may cause harmful
      effects on mice embryos.<br>
      <br>
      Moussa et al. described in Fullerene Science &amp; Technology
      1995, 3, 333-342 that partially micronized Ceo particles can be
      incorporated into living human phagocyte cells. C6o was directly
      suspended in the culture media and did not exhibit acute toxicity.
      Moussa et al. also described in Fullerene Science &amp; Technology
      1996, 4, 21-29 that micronized particles of water-insoluble
      fullerenes may be administered to mice on the form of a
      biocompatible aqueous suspension comprising a surfactant (tween
      80) and a suspending agent (carboxym ethyl cellulose) which
      stabilizes the suspension. The authors disclosed that C6o is
      non-toxic, can cross cellular membranes and accumulates in liver
      and spleen (Fullerene Science &amp; Technology 1996, 4: 21-29).
      The same group headed by F. Moussa have already used Micronized
      Ceo suspensions as free radical scavenger in vivo (Nano Letters
      2005, 5: 2578 - 2585). However, the effective doses were very high
      (i.e. &gt; 1 g/kg of body-weight) and intra peritoneal (i. p.)
      administration was the only route of administration for such
      suspensions. The authors also disclosed that Ceo can solubilize in
      vivo inside lipid droplets (Nano Letters 2005, 5: 2578 - 2585).
      This result has been confirmed in vitro by other authors whom
      studied [Omicron][beta][omicron] solubility in vegetable oils
      (Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and Carbon Nanostructures, 2007, 15:
      311-314. Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and Carbon Nanostructures, 2007,
      15: 331-339). Stable biocompatible compositions comprising water
      insoluble fullerenes dispersed and/or dissolved in a carrier
      selected from the group consisting of fats and oils in an amount
      ranging from 0.2 to 10 % by weight relative to the total weight of
      the composition, preferably from 0.1 to 2 % by weight, were
      already proposed by N Gharbi and F Moussa for preventing damages
      caused by free radicals (2005/lnternational Application No.
      PCT/EP2005/004963). However, in such compositions the
      water-insoluble fullerene is not fully dissolved and their oral
      absorption was unknown. Further, large aggregates of the
      administered fullerene can be filtered by liver and spleen and
      confined in their reticulo-endothelial system (RES) thus altering
      the diffusion and biodistribution of Ceo in the whole body. Thus,
      the in vivo use of water-insoluble fullerenes as free radical
      scavengers through delivery thanks to a non-aqueous carrier is
      still not satisfactory.<br>

      The inventors of the instant invention have now discovered a
      surprising use of [60]fullerene as agent that promotes an

      damages caused to metazons by free radicals are disclosed in TN
      Patent No.TN 2011/327 issued June 30, 2011 to Moussa et al. which
      is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

      <b>SUM MARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is in view of the above problems that the present invention was
      developed. The main objective of the invention is to provide a
      process or method for extending the longevity of a mammal, which
      comprises a step of administering to said mammal a composition
      comprising an effective amount of [60]fullerene, which avoids the
      drawbacks of the prior art processes, and in particular : 1-
      avoids the use of charge transfer complexes, 2-avoids the use of
      organic solvents, and 3- avoids in situ aggregation of the
      administered fullerene. It has now been discovered by the
      inventors that the compositions comprising [60]fullerene dissolved
      in a suitable carrier selected from the group consisting of oils
      and fats proved suitable to achieve the aforementioned objectives.
      In particular, not only they allow [60]fullerene to be
      administered orally or intramuscularly or intra peritoneally to
      prolong the longevity of mammals but they are at least several
      times more active than previous compositions. Thus, a first
      embodiment of the instant invention comprises a stable
      biocompatible composition comprising (a) a carrier selected from
      the group consisting of fats and oils; and (b) [60]fullerene,
      wherein [60]fullerene is almost dissolved in said carrier. The
      embodiment is further drawn to compositions, in which
      [60]fullerene is dissolved in the carrier. Another embodiment of
      the instant invention is a method to prolong the longevity of
      mammals, which comprises a step of administering to said mammal a
      stable biocompatible composition comprising an effective amount of
      [60]fullerene dissolved in a carrier selected from the group
      consisting of fats and oils. In a preferred embodiment, the
      invention is drawn to a method of prolonging the longevity of
      mammals, which comprises a step of adding to food or any
      nutritional composition a stable composition comprising an
      effective amount of [60]fullerene dispersed in a carrier selected
      from the group consisting of fats and oils.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Free radicals are constantly formed in vivo. Some of these
      molecules are physiologically useful, but they can also result in
      pathological oxidative stress to cells and tissues. Endogenous
      defences include both antioxidants and repairing systems. However,
      excess production of free radicals, their production in
      inappropriate relative amounts or deficiencies in endogenous
      defences can have deleterious effects. Free radicals can cause
      oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, bio molecules, rises in the
      concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as activation of
      proteases, nucleases and protein kinases. Considerable evidence
      supports the view that oxidative damage involving free radicals
      occurs in most, if not all, human diseases. Oxidative stress is
      now recognized as an important contributor to the development of
      many human diseases including liver fibrosis,
      ischemia-reperfusion, atherosclerosis, several neurological
      disorders and age-related cancer as well as to process of ageing.
      Thus antioxidants and systems that can protect against oxidative
      stress are needed to maintain health and prolong the expected
      lifespan in metazoans. This has led to attempts to develop
      additional antioxidants to supplement the antioxidant defences of
      cells as potential therapeutic agents. Diet-derived antioxidants
      and a number of small molecules that can scavenge free radicals as
      well as super oxide dismutase-mimetics and chelators of transition
      metal ions were proposed as potential therapeutic agents against
      oxidative stress. Compositions according to the invention
      comprising [60]fullerene have been found to exhibit highly
      efficient antioxidant properties in vivo. The fullerene core, i.e.
      the fullerene skeleton without lateral substituants, used in the
      practice of this invention comprise clustered carbon structures
      generally spherical in shape and having a carbon content of 60
      carbon atoms. Typically, [60]fullerene according to the invention
      is present in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 0.0.08 % by weight
      relative to the total weight of the composition, preferably 0.08 %
      by weight. [60]fullerene is preferably dissolved in the carrier,
      i.e. the composition can be filtered through a 0.2 pm filter. The
      stable, biocompatible compositions according to the invention
      comprise a carrier selected from the group consisting of fats and
      oils; and [60]fullerene, wherein said fullerene is mostly
      dissolved in said carrier. The carrier used in the present
      invention is a pharmaceutically acceptable and biocompatible
      carrier, selected from the group consisting of fats and oils. The
      fat or oil may be any natural or synthetic fat or oil suitable for
      administration to a mammal. They are not particularly restricted
      inasmuch as they are components which can be used in
      pharmaceutical preparations or in foods. Oils and fats can be
      hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated. They are used at a solid,
      a semisolid, or a liquid state. Vegetable and animal fats and oils
      are preferred, vegetable fats and oils are most preferred. Oils
      and fats include, without limitation fatty acid esters, fatty
      acids, fatty alcohols and fatty alcohol esters. Synthetic lipids

      carbon atoms, which may be branched or unbranched, saturated or
      unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic. Fatty acids may be natural or
      synthetic, polyunsaturated, mono-unsaturated or saturated. Natural

      employed. Fatty acid esters are preferably esters of fatty acid as
      defined hereinabove with C-1-C40 aliphatic or aromatic alcohols,
      preferably aliphatic, saturated or unsaturated, straight-chain or
      branched-chain, cyclic or acyclic. Alcohols can be polyols, having
      preferably up to five hydroxyl groups. Examples of fatty acid

      Preferred carriers according to the invention are butter, cocoa
      butter, peanut butter, olive oil, soybean oil, cod-liver oil and
      liquid paraffin. As defined above, carriers may be used each alone
      or in a combination of two or more species. [60]fullerene is
      dissolved in the carrier, depending on the nature of the carrier.
      Some carriers are able to dissolve substantial amounts of water-
      insoluble fullerenes (several mg / g of carrier). In one
      embodiment, at least 0.8 mg of fullerene is dissolved per ml of
      the carrier (the carrier being a liquid). As an example, it is
      possible to dissolve a total weight up to 1 mg of C60 per g of
      olive or soybean oil in less than one week. The compositions
      according to the invention may be pharmaceutical compositions
      comprising the fullerene in a therapeutically effective amount.
      Preferably, said fullerene can protect against biologically
      reactive radical species, which means chemicals that are free
      radicals or contribute to the generation of free radicals.
      Generally, the biologically reactive radical species are generated
      from O2 or H2O2. Thus, the invention also concerns a method to
      prolong the longevity of a mammal, which comprises a step of
      administering to said mammal a stable biocompatible composition as
      defined hereinabove. [60]fullerene, when dissolved in the carriers
      of the present invention, can be administered to mammals and this
      compound is well absorbed by said mammals. Generally, the said
      fullerene is administered in an amount of at least 0.1 mg/kg of
      body weight per day. According to the method of the invention, the
      inventive compositions may be administered orally,
      intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intra dermally or intra
      peritoneally, rectally by suppositories or sublingually. For oral
      ingestion by a mammal to be treated, the carrier is preferably an
      edible carrier. In at least one embodiment, said composition is
      administered in a pure form. In another embodiment, it is
      administered in the form of an emulsion in water. In another
      embodiment the fullerene is administered as a labile
      C6o-derivative derivative that can deliver Ceo after
      administration. The compositions of the instant invention can be
      in any liquid or solid conventional pharmaceutical formulation.
      The carrier enables the fullerene to be formulated as tablets,
      pills, dragees, capsules, liposome, pomade, ointment, cream ,
      lotion, emulsions, gels, syrups, slurries and the like. The
      compositions of the present invention are preferably presented for
      oral administration to mammals in unit dosage forms, such as
      tablets, capsules, and oral solutions, containing suitable
      quantities of [60]fullerene. The compositions may be sterilized
      and/or may contain some adjuvants such as preservatives,
      stabilizers, acidity regulators, natural or synthetic flavour,
      anti-foaming agents, viscosity- control agents, emulsifiers, salts
      for varying the osmotic pressure and/or other buffers. In
      addition, compositions may contain other pharmaceutically active
      agents. The level of free radicals and reactive oxygen species in
      mammal cells decreases following treatment as compared to the
      level of reactive oxygen species in a cell that has not been
      contacted with a composition according to the invention. Indeed,
      [60]fullerene according to the invention can act as antioxidant
      and supplement the antioxidant defences of cells. That means they
      inhibit oxidation or inhibit reactions promoted by reactive oxygen
      species. Physiologically relevant reactive oxygen species, which
      contribute to the generation of free radicals, include hydrogen
      peroxide, super oxide anion, and the like. The protective method
      of the invention reduces cell damage and death, and thus generally
      maintains the health of treated mammals. Further, the inventors
      discovered that [60]fullerene administered as biocompatible
      composition as described herein -1) can be absorbed after oral
      administration (Figure 2); -2) they can react inside the liver
      with vitamin A (retinol) and esters thereof following a
      Diels-Alder-like reaction without any toxic effect (New J Chem,
      1998, 989-992) ; -3) they are eliminated through the bile ducts
      (Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12): 2578 - 2585); and -4) despite the
      large amounts administered, no acute or sub-acute toxicity could
      be observed in mice and rats. No behaviour or growth disorder
      could be observed in treated animals either, which can be seen on
      figure 1. The latter shows growth rate of three groups (n = 6) of
      rats which received weekly per os 1 ml of olive oil containing 0.8
      mg of Ceo or 1 ml of olive oil only or 1 ml of water only. The in
      vivo new properties of [60]fullerene are due to fullerenes
      themselves and/or to the fullerene-retinol and fullerene-retinyl
      ester adducts formed after administration inside the liver. Also
      disclosed herein is a method for preparing a composition according
      to the present invention, comprising a carrier and particles of
      [60]fullerene. Said method comprises the steps of: - (a) Charging
      a milling vessel with the fullerene, the carrier and balls, said
      milling vessel and balls being made out of any biocompatible metal
      or polymer; - (b) Agitating the mixture resulting from step (a)
      until a homogeneous dissolution is obtained; and - (c) Sterilizing
      the composition resulting from step (b) by filtration. Direct
      mechanical milling in the carrier presents the advantages to
      accelerate the dissolution. Said method comprises the steps of: -
      (a) Charging a milling vessel with the fullerene, the fat or oil
      and balls, said milling vessel and balls being made out of any
      biocompatible metal or polymer; - (b) Agitating the mixture
      resulting from step (a) until complete homogenization of the
      solution; - (c) Agitating .the composition resulting from step (b)
      until complete dissolution of the fullerene; and - (d) Sterilizing
      by filtration the composition resulting from step (c). Other than
      in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all
      numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions,
      and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be
      understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about."
      Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical
      parameters set forth in the following specification and attached
      claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired
      properties sought to be obtained by the present disclosure. At the
      very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the
      doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
      parameter should be construed in light of the number of
      significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
      Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting
      forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the
      numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported
      as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently
      contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard
      deviation found in their respective testing measurements. The
      invention is further illustrated by the examples described below.
      These examples are meant to illustrate the i nvention and are not
      to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>General considerations</b><br>
      <br>
      C60 (Purity: 99.98 %) was purchased from Term USA (Fort Bragg, CA,
      USA). Its characterization and its purity were assessed by HPLC,
      UV, C-NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. No impurity could be observed.
      It was used without further purification as well as after
      sublimation. All the other reagents were analytical grade and were
      purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Animals received human care
      and the study protocols complied with general guidelines for the
      care and use of laboratory animals. Male Wistar rats (Charles
      River, France) were housed by groups of 3 in polypropylene cages
      at constant temperature (22 [deg.]C) and humidity (60 %) and with
      a 12 h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard diet ad libitum. All
      rats were allowed to acclimate to this facility for at least one
      week before being used in the experiments. At the end of the
      experiment, body weights were determined and the animals were
      sacrificed under the same conditions by bleeding through the
      thoracic aorta after sodium pentobarbital (1.0 mL/kg of body
      weight) anaesthesia.<br>
      <br>
      Biochemical tests, Cso determinations and statistics were
      processed as previously described in Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12):
      2578 - 2585.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1 : Direct dissolution of [60]fullerene in a vegetable
        oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the stainless steel milling vessels of a Pulverisette 7
      (Fritsch, Idar- Oberstein, Germany) or a similar device, add 8 mg
      of [60]fullerene and 10 mL of olive oil or 10 g of butter and 6
      stainless steel balls (8 mm of diameter) (the milling vessels and
      the balls can be made out of any biocompatible metal or polymer
      such as stainless steel, tempered chrome steel, silicon nitride,
      corundum, tungsten carbide, agate, oxide of zirconium etc).
      Agitate the mixture during several hours (at 600 rpm for instance)
      until complete dissolution. The resulting homogenous solution or
      paste is then ready for use for oral administration or by any
      route of administration after appropriate sterilization.
      Sterilization may be achieved by filtration under vacuum (pore
      size: 0.2 [mu][eta][iota]). The sterilized composition is stable
      for at least 1 month. It is also possible to dissolve water-
      insoluble fullerenes in natural or mineral oils without stirring
      however the dissolution may be time consuming (up to several days
      at room temperature). Therefore, the former protocol is preferred.
      The fullerene concentration in compositions according to the
      invention can be determined by HPLC after adequate dilution in
      mobile phase as described previously (J. Chromatogr. B 1997, 696:
      153-159).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of an oily
        solution after oral and intra-peritoneal administration in rats.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out with male Wistar rats
      (weighing 200 - 220 g). Rats were housed in individual cages and
      maintained in an air-conditioned room (22-25 [deg.]C) on a 12 h
      light/dark cycle with water and food available. The rats were
      acclimated for 7 days and they were fasted overnight but with
      access to water, before treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Under general anesthesia, a catheter was introduced into the rat
      right jugular vein, positioned subcutaneously with the tip in the
      inter-scapular region. The prepared rats were then allowed to
      recover for 24 h, and the blood catheters were flushed with 0.9 %
      NaCI solution containing 20 l U/ml of heparin to avoid possible
      clot obstruction. Before Ceo administration, the rats were fasted
      overnight but with access to water. The same single dose of Ceo (4
      mg/kg) was delivered orally, by a gavages needle, or
      intra-peritoneally to two groups of three rats. Blood (0.20 ml)
      was withdrawn via the canular prior to dosing (f = 0) and at 15,
      30, 60 min and then at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h post-dosing.
      Antithrombin heparin (20 lU/ml) was added in each blood sample.
      After each blood collection 0.20 ml of sterile 0.9 % NaCI solution
      were injected to the animal, to avoid hypovolemia. The rats were
      sacrificed 48 h after eo administration for organ collection
      (livers, spleens, and brains).<br>
      <br>
      It was now discovered by the inventors that: -1) Soluble Ceo is
      absorbed and eliminated after either intraperitoneal or oral
      administrations. Table 1 represents the main pharmacokinetic
      parameters; 2- the maximal concentrations (Cmax) are reached 4 and
      8 hours after i.p. and oral administrations, respectively (Fig.
      2); 3- the maximal concentration after i.p. administration (1.47
      +- 0.15 pg/ml) is higher than that after oral administration (0.52
      +- 0.16 Mg/ml). Consequently, the area under the curve (AUC) is
      about 5 times larger when Ceo is administered by i.p. route as
      compared to oral route. Although these results do not allow
      determining the bioavailability of Ceo, they clearly show that a
      non-negligible % of the orally administered dose is absorbed as
      compared to the i.p. administered one (Fig. 2); and -3) the
      fullerene is well distributed in the whole body, in particular it
      can cross the brain barrier (table 2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3: Ceo-induced protection of the liver against acute
        toxicity of carbon tetrachloride (CCU) in rats</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Carbon tetrachloride is a classical hepatotoxicant that causes
      rapid liver damage progressing from steatosis to centrilobular
      necrosis. CCU intoxication in rodents is an important model for
      elucidation of the mechanism of action of hepatotoxic effects such
      as fatty degeneration, fibrosis, hepatocellular death, and
      carcinogenicity. These effects are consistent with the known
      induced metabolic activation of CCI4 to reactive intermediates,
      including CCI3" and CCI02' free radicals, and mobilization of
      intracellular calcium. Kupffer cells (liver resident macrophages)
      participate in the mechanism of toxicity of CCI4 in vivo by
      release of chemoattractants for neutrophils and a series of
      chemical mediators (cytokines). Both expression and synthesis of
      these cytokines are mainly modulated through redox-sensitive
      reactions. Further, involvement of reactive oxygen species and
      lipid peroxydation products can be demonstrated in other
      fundamental events of hepatic fibrogenosis, like activation of
      hepatic stellate cells (HSC: liver resident nonparenchymal cells
      also referred to as fat-storing or perisinusoidal cells, lipocytes
      and Ito cells). In a previous work, the effects of
      C60-pretreatments on acute carbon tetrachloride intoxication in
      rats, a classical model for studying free-radical-mediated liver
      injury was reported. The results obtained by the authors leaded by
      F Moussa (Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12), 2578 - 2585) showed that
      aqueous C6o suspensions not only have no acute or subacute
      toxicity in rodents but they also protect their livers in a
      dose-dependent manner against free-radical damage. The most
      effective dose of C6o reported in the latter paper was about 2.5
      g/kg of body-weight and was administered intra-peritoneally and
      the better protection was obtained at day 14 after administration.
      It was now discovered by the inventors that the fullerene is about
      100 times more active it is administered in solution than in
      suspension, and the effect is more rapid (24 hours after
      administration) as compared to the results published previously in
      the same experimental model (Nano Letters 2005, 5: 2578 - 2585).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4: Ceo prolongs the longevity in rats without chronic
        toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The rats were housed one per cage and acclimated for 14 days,
      before dosing. Three groups of 10 rats ( 10 months old, weighing
      495 +- 31 g) were administered daily for one week, then weekly
      until the end of the second month and then every two weeks until
      the end of the 7th month, by gavages with 1 ml of water or olive
      oil or Ceo dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml), respectively. The
      rats were weighed before each dosing. Routine observations
      following official recommendations (EC Commission Directive
      2004/73/EC of 29 April 2004 Adapting to Technical Progress for the
      Twenty-Ninth Time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the
      Approximation of the Laws, Regulations and Administrative
      Provisions Relating to the Classification, Packaging and Labeling
      of Dangerous Substances. O.J. No. L1522004) were made on all
      animals inside and outside the cage once a day throughout the
      study for signs of departure from normal activity, morbidity and
      mortality.<br>
      <br>
      This experiment was initiated after observing that Ceo is absorbed
      through oral administration. To study the chronic toxicity of Ceo
      we designed a protocol according to the general guidelines of US
      food and drug administration (Chronic Toxicity Studies with
      Rodents in Toxicological Principles for the Safety Assessment of
      Food Ingredients. Redbook 2000, revised July 2007, Chapter
      IV.C.5.a. IV.C.5.a.) with some modifications. It was now
      discovered by the inventors that oral administration of Ceo
      increases significantly the longevity of rats (Fig. 5). At 25
      months after the beginning of the treatment, the % of survival is
      equal to 25 %, 67 % and 100 % for the rats treated with water,
      olive oil or C6o-dissolved in olive oil, respectively (Fig. 5). At
      37 months, after the beginning of the treatment, this percentage
      is always equal to 100 % for the rats treated with C6o-dissolved
      in olive oil, 17 % for the rats treated with olive oil, and 0 %
      for the rats treated with water (Fig. 5). The increase of the
      expected lifespan reported herein has never been reported for any
      other substance, to our knowledge.<br>
