        <b>By R.S. Hedin</b></center>
      <p>Around the year 1900 Nikola Tesla, the inventor of the
        alternating current motor, developed a different kind of steam
        turbine. It had no blades or buckets but only smooth disk
        closely spaced on the rotor shaft. The steam entered
        tangentially via a nozzle and spiraled around between the disks,
        exiting through holes near the rotor shaft. Friction between the
        steam and the sides of the disks turned the rotor. It is said
        that Tesla’s first turbine, the size of a "hat box", put out 35
        hp with 125 psi steam. </p>
      <p>My model was made from a written description of the turbine and
        does not pretend to be a copy of the original Tesla unit.
        However, it works well on compressed air and probably would
        produce more torque on steam. </p>
      <p>The construction of this model includes a number of options.
        The full-blown unit can be made as shown, or with only one
        nozzle or without the valves and piping. Made as shown, the
        turbine will run in either direction, depending on which valve
        is open. </p>
      <p>Starting construction with the case, make parts 1, 2 and 3 as
        shown on the drawings. The tubing (2) is silver soldered to the
        plate (1). Then after chucking on the inside and centering the
        tube, the plate is bored and faced to fit the 0.800" diameter of
        the bearing housing (3). The housing is then silver soldered
        into the plate. Again chuck the assembly on the large tube as
        before, and bore the bearing housing to fit the ball bearings.
        Also, take a cleanup cut on the outside diameter at the same
        setup. This diameter will be used later for boring inside of the
        rotor case. At this point the decision is made to install one or
        two nozzles and mill the pockets in the case a shown. The end
        mill will leave a radius in the corner file this to a sharp
        corner so the nozzle will fit up tight against the plate (part
        1). </p>
      <p>To finish the case, make parts 4, 5, and 6. Soft solder these
        parts in place. For strength use a solder that has a small
        amount of silver with the remainder tin. If the turbine is to be
        used with steam, drill a small hole at the lowest point in the
        case to drain the condensate. The inside of the case, the 2.50"
        diameter, is bored to a cleanup, because a small amount of the
        nozzle projects into this diameter. Chuck on the OD of the
        bearing housing. Also, face to clean up the end of the case,
        including the nozzle blocks. Complete the cover, item 13, and
        spot the holes in the case. Drill and tap for no. 2-56 screws. </p>
      <p>The rotor disks are made from flat aluminum sheet. They can
        best be cut using a flycutter in a drill press. The center hole
        is reamed 0.250". The spacing washers can be made in the lathe
        by parting off slices of stock with a 0.250" hole. With items 7,
        8, 9, 10, and 14 completed, assemble the rotor and turn the OD
        of the disks to about 0.005" smaller than the inside diameter of
        the case. Round the edges of the disks with a smooth file. </p>
      <p>With items 11 and 12 completed, the turbine can be assembled
        for testing. The setscrew in the bearing housing keeps the
        spacer (12) in place, and the collar (11) keeps the rotor
        assembly from shifting. The 0.31" diameter of the collar is
        placed against the ball bearing inner race. The entire rotor
        assembly with the ball bearings is adjusted endways by loosening
        the setscrew in the housing. Test the turbine on compressed air
        at about 40 to 50 psi. </p>
      <p>The parts for the valves and piping are, in the main,
        self-explanatory. The female union is silver soldered in the
        valve body in the same manner as the tee. The valve stem is
        packed with graphited string or something similar. The completed
        valves and pipes are assembled on the turbine with the pipes
        loose in the tee. The pipes are then soft soldered in the tee. </p>
      <p>All that remains is to disassemble to clean and paint the case.

      <p><b>Summary ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Tesla-type turbomachinery is distinguished by the fact that
        the rotor is composed of flat parallel corotating disks, spaced
        along a shaft. A throughflow of fluid between the disks results
        in momentum exchange between the fluid and the disks and hence
        shaft torque and power. Tesla designed, built and tested such
        machines but was not able to achieve industrial applications of
        them. </p>
      <p>In the subsequent years, many investigations have been carried
        out to determine the performance and efficiency of this type of
        turbomachinery. These have been both analytical and
        experimental. Most of the investigations have had a certain
        limited application as the objective, with regard to size and
        speed as well as the nature of the operating fluid. However,
        some of the investigations have tried to establish the
        generalized performance of Tesla-type turbomachines. In general,
        it has been found that the efficiency of the rotor can be very
        high, at least equal to that achieved by conventional rotors.
        But it has proved very difficult to achieve efficient nozzles in
        the case of turbines. For pumps and compressors, efficient
        diffusion after the rotor has proven difficult to achieve. As a
        result, only modest machine efficiencies have been demonstrated.
        Principally for these reasons the Tesla-type turbomachinery has
        had little utilization. There is, however, a widespread belief
        that it will find applications in the future, at least in
        situations in which conventional turbomachinery is not adequate.
        This includes the use with very viscous fluids, fluids
        containing abrasive particles, and two-phase fluids. </p>
      <p>The flow in the rotor may be either laminar or turbulent, with
        certain advantages and disadvantages in each of the regimes. It
        is necessary to carefully distinguish which type of flow is
        considered in reports by the various investigators. </p>
      <p>Herein, the principles of the Tesla-type turbomachinery are
        reviewed and the problems with nozzles and diffusers (which
        limit the machine efficiency) are discussed. The analytical
        methods that have been found useful in modeling and calculating
        the flow in the rotor are reviewed and the experimental results
        obtained by some investigators are described. An extensive list
        of References is presented and summaries are made of the main
        results and conclusions that have been reported. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>Tesla is most widely recognized for his outstanding
        achievements in the fields of generation, transmission and
        utilization of electrical power. However, he was also the
        inventor of a unique type of turbomachinery that can be applied
        as liquid pumps, liquid or vapor or gas turbines, and gas
        compressors (1). The Tesla turbine was widely recognized in the
        semi-technical press at the time of the invention (2-7). The
        Tesla turbomachinery is distinguished by the fact that the rotor
        is composed of flat parallel corotating disks spaced along a
        shaft. A throughflow of fluid between the disks results in
        momentum exchange between the fluid and the disks and hence
        shaft torque and power. Tesla designed, built and tested such
        machines but was not able to achieve significant industrial
        application of them. Figures 1 and 2 are schematic diagrams of a
        Tesla-type pump and turbine. </p>
      <p>As a turbine, the multiple-disk rotor is contained in a housing
        provided with nozzles to supply high-speed fluid approximately
        tangential to the rotor. The fluid flows spirally inward and
        finally exhausts from the rotor through holes or slots in the
        disks near the shaft. As a pump or compressor, fluid enters the
        rotor through holes near the shaft, flows spirally outward, and
        exhausts from the rotor into a diffuser such as a volute scroll.
        Shaft power is delivered by the turbine and shaft power must be
        supplied to the pump or compressor. The performance and
        efficiency of the rotor of such machines is dependent on the
        combination of shaft speed, disk inner and outer diameters, the
        spacing between the disks and the fluid properties and flow
        rate. The performance of the overall turbine is strongly
        dependent also on the efficiency of the nozzles and the
        nozzle-rotor interaction. The performance of the pump is also
        strongly dependent on the interaction of the fluid leaving the
        rotor with that in the volute and on the efficiency of diffusion
        in the volute. In general, flow in the rotor may be laminar or
        turbulent or mixed. </p>
      <p>There was little activity concerning the Tesla turbomachinery
        until a revival of interest began in the 1950s (8-17). Research
        was widespread after that, particularly in the area of
        analytical modeling of the flow in the space between two disks
        in a rotor, and continues at present. References (18-79) are
        representative. Many attempts have been made to commercialize
        Tesla-type turbomachinery, especially as pumps, but no
        widespread applications are apparent. While rotor efficiencies
        can be very high in this type of turbomachine, there are
        inherent losses in the fluid flows entering and exiting the
        rotor. As a turbine, the nozzles are necessarily long and
        inefficient. As a pump or compressor, the diffuser or volute
        must handle flow with a very small entering angle which causes
        the volute to be very inefficient. For these and other reasons
        actual Tesla turbomachines have efficiencies much less than
        might be expected from consideration of the flow in the rotor.
        There is little or no literature devoted to the flows that cause
        the main losses in Tesla-type turbomachinery. The Tesla-type
        turbomachinery is variously referred to in the literature as
        multiple-disk or friction or shear-force (or, nonsensically,
        boundary layer) turbomachinery. </p>
      <p><b>Multiple-Disk Rotors Having Laminar Flow ~</b> </p>
      <p>A way of analytically modeling the flow in a multiple disk
        rotor known as bulk-parameter analysis, was used by early
        investigators (7, 9-11, 16, 17, 21, 24, 49). It is usable for
        both laminar and turbulent flow. In this method of analysis, the
        frictional interaction between the fluid and the disks is
        represented in terms of an empirical fluid friction factor. This
        results in ordinary differential equations which, together with
        simple boundary and entrance conditions, constitute a problem
        easily solved using computer-implemented step-wise calculations.
        The method is limited in usefulness by the inadequacy of the
        friction factor concept. </p>
      <p>In the case of laminar flow, much better analytical modeling
        can be achieved. Partial differential equations can be
        established rather simply together with appropriate boundary and
        inlet conditions. Because the flow path is long compared with
        the disk spacing, order-of-magnitude arguments can be made to
        simplify the equations somewhat and reduce them to
        pseudo-parabolic form. The problem can then be solved by any one
        of several available means. </p>
      <p>Some investigators have used truncated series substitution
        methodology to make solutions (23, 25, 29, 32) but the method
        has accuracy limitations. A much more widely used method is to
        solve the problem using computer-implemented finite difference
        methods; references (19) and (33) are typical examples. Integral
        methods have also been used, mainly to shorten the computer
        execution time required for solution (38). Most of the
        literature has considered the fluid to be incompressible
        although some investigators have calculated compressible flows
        (48, 53, 65, 71). </p>
      <p>Wu (78) in 1986, made detailed comparisons of results from all
        of the available literature. It was found that when the results
        of investigations using similar solution means were compared
        there was close agreement, within accuracy limitations. It was
        also concluded that the finite difference solutions all obtained
        good accuracy and produced essentially the same results and such
        solutions are recommended to be used. </p>
      <p>It is also clear from the literature that the calculated
        results for laminar flows between corotating disks are in
        excellent agreement with experimental results for such flows
        (35, 44). While future efforts may lead to increased efficiency
        or shorter computer execution time, present published
        methodology and results are sufficient for use in the design of
        laminar flow multiple disk rotors for pumps, compressors, and
        turbines. Some generalized information for such rotors has been
        presented. (45, 46) </p>
      <p>The results of a solution of a flow consist of detailed
        knowledge of the distribution of the velocity and pressure
        throughout the flow between the disks. From this, the
        relationship between the mass flow and the pressure change from
        inlet to exit become known and allow determination of design
        facts such as the number of disks required for an application of
        interest. The solutions are parameterized using the following or
        equivalent parameters: for outward flows (pumps), Reynold’s
        number, flow rate number and radius ratio; for inward flows
        (turbines) the additional parameter ( vo/omega ro : average
        disk-disk radial component of velocity, at outer radius of disk
        / angular velocity of pair of disks x outer radius of disk ) is
        required. The results can be arranged to provide values of
        dimensionless torque, dimensionless pressure, dimensionless
        power, rotor efficiency, etc. </p>
      <p>With proper use of the analytical results, the rotor efficiency
        using laminar flow can be very high, even above 95%. However, in
        order to attain high rotor efficiency, the flowrate number must
        be made small which means high rotor efficiency is achieved at
        the expense of using a large number of disks and hence a
        physically large rotor. For each value of flow rate number there
        is an optimum value of Reynolds number for maximum efficiency.
        With common fluids, the required disk spacing is dismally small
        causing laminar flow to tend to be large and heavy for a
        prescribed throughflow rate. </p>
      <p>Extensive investigations have been made of Tesla-type liquid
        pumps using laminar-flow rotors (64). It was found that overall
        pump efficiency was low even when rotor efficiency was high
        because of the losses occurring at the rotor entrance and exit
        earlier mentioned. </p>
      <p><b>Criteria for the Occurrence of Laminar and of Turbulent Flow
          in Multiple-Disk Rotors ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is established that a wide range of types (or regimes) of
        flow can occur between corotating disks including wholly laminar
        flow, laminar flow with regions of recirculation, wholly
        turbulent flow, and turbulent flow proceeding through "reverse
        transition" or "relamination" to laminar flow. There is
        experimental evidence concerning these flows (26, 27, 31, 35,
        42, 44) and the hydrodynamic stability of laminar flows between
        corotating disks has been investigated (31, 66). Wu (78)
        considering all available experimental and analytical evidence,
        concluded that the visco-geometric number alpha proposed by
        Nendl (42, 55) most adequately characterizes the flow regime,
        where alpha = uh2/vr. While the data of the various
        investigators are somewhat contradictory, a reliable guide
        appears to be that flow is laminar for alpha &lt; 10, in
        transition for 10&lt; alpha &lt; 20 and turbulent for alpha &gt;
        20. Various investigators introduce rather pragmatic and
        differing definitions of "laminar" and "turbulent" which further
        complicates the matter. It is desirable that it be explored
        further both experimentally and by additional hydrodynamic
        stability analysis. </p>
      <p><b>Multiple-Disk Rotors Having Turbulent Flow ~</b> </p>
      <p>The bulk-parameter (friction factor) type of analysis of flow
        in a multiple-disk type of rotor was referenced in the foregoing
        discussion of laminar flows. It has been used extensively to
        calculate turbulent flows but with mostly unknown degrees of
        adequacy. The transition criteria presented is not applicable
        for bulk-parameter use and the hydraulic diameter concept is
        required and the assumption must be made that pipeflow
        frictional correlations are valid for flows between corotating
        disks. Nevertheless, such analyses has been the only analytical
        prediction method available until relatively recently and
        methods now becoming available are not yet well-established. Wu
        (78) gives an extended comparison of the results of various
        bulk-parameter methods of analysis with several sources of
        experimental data for turbulent flows between corotating disks.
      </p>
      <p>Momentum integral equation methods have been and continue to be
        used to calculate the subject turbulent flows (26, 34, 36). In
        these methods, ordinary differential equations describing the
        flow are written based on assumed distribution forms for the
        velocity and on empirical expressions for the stresses in the
        flow. Some of these rely on experience and/or specialized
        experimental results and are found not to be universal. Within
        carefully noted bounds however these methods can be very
        successfully used by an experienced investigator and have
        yielded strong insights into and design information for the
        turbulent flows of interest. </p>
      <p>In principal, the set of partial differential equations
        applicable for turbulent flow can be written, provided with
        appropriate boundary and entrance conditions, and then solved in
        some manner using computer-implemented calculations. In
        practice, there are several aspects of the process that cannot
        be executed with confidence that the calculated results will
        agree with reality. Principally among these is that a model or
        mechanism describing the turbulent transport of linear momentum
        must be prescribed. Furthermore, the partial differential
        equations are much more complicated for turbulent than for
        laminar flow. In the entrance region, the equations must be
        solved in elliptical form before changing over to simplified
        pseudo-parabolic equations to continue the calculations. </p>
      <p>Truman (73) carried out calculations for turbulent flow between
        corotating disks using eddy-viscosity/mixing-length turbulence
        (stress) modeling, and using a finite-difference method for
        solving the partial differential equations. Wu (78) used a
        slightly modified version of the computer-implemented
        calculations provided by Truman, to compare calculated results
        with experimental data for turbulent flow due to Bakke (26) and
        Kohler (34). In general, agreement was good but with some
        qualifications and reservations discussed in detail by Wu (78).
        It was noted that at high rotor angular speeds the calculations
        indicated recirculation in the turbulent flow that could not be
        detailed since the pseudo-parabolic equations are not applicable
        for recirculating flows. </p>
      <p>Truman, et al.(76) have also calculated similar flows using an
        anisotropic two-equation turbulence model. More analytical study
        and much more experimental investigation of the turbulent flow
        between corotating disks is needed to establish the most
        applicable methods for calculating the flows with confidence and
        for the results to be useful in the design of turbomechanics. Wu
        (78) has outlined an experimental apparatus and procedure that
        might provide the next needed insights for progress in this
        area. </p>
      <p><b>Actual Tesla-Type Turbomachinery ~</b> </p>
      <p>Many individuals and groups attempting to commercialize
        Tesla-type turbomachines have designed, constructed and operated
        them. Pumps have received the most interest but compressors and
        turbines have also been built and operated. While much useful
        test data has no doubt been recorded, very little has been
        published or otherwise made known because of the perceived need
        for keeping information proprietary. Thus, this large body of
        information is not available to most investigators. </p>
      <p>Most Tesla-type turbines and pumps have been designed using
        intuition and simple calculations or empirical experience and
        rules-of-thumb. This has almost always led to the use of large
        spaces between the disks corresponding to turbulent flow between
        the disks. </p>
      <p>The published information concerning actual Tesla-type pumps
        includes references (17, 18, 20, 21, 28, 34, 37, 47, 49, 50, 54,
        59, 64, 67). All of the information presented shows lower
        efficiency than was desired. In general, the pumps designed with
        little prior calculated rotor design information showed
        efficiencies below 40%. Adequate calculated rotor design
        information resulted in higher efficiency but still in the range
        of 40 to 60%. All things considered, it seems probable that
        Tesla-type pumps of reasonable size, operating with common
        fluids, will not exceed an efficiency of 65% at best, with
        careful attention to volute/rotor matching. Many Tesla-type
        pumps intended to be commercially competitive have not been
        provided with a volute or any other type of diffuser. </p>
      <p>A number of Tesla-type turbines have been constructed for use
        with steam, gas and water. Very few data have been published
        concerning them. The published information includes references
        (2-6, 8-11, 13, 16, 24, 51, 63). As with pumps, the turbine
        efficiencies have been low and the machine sizes large per unit
        of power delivered. All of the turbines reported probably
        operated with turbulent flow in the rotor. </p>
      <p>Most recent pumps and turbines of the Tesla-type have used
        rotors composed of disks with a central hole rather than the
        spoke construction used by Tesla. The disks are carried on
        throughbolts extending from a thicker masterdisk fastened to the
        shaft; thus the rotor is overhung. Although most machines have
        used thick disks, there seems to be little reason to do so since
        the disks have only small forces acting on them and are not
        required to be perfectly flat. </p>
      <p>Many design questions remain unanswered at this time. Whether
        the disks should be rough or smooth, for best performance, is
        controversial as is the question concerning appropriate
        rotor-to-housing seals. There are some ideas concerning ways to
        improve volute or nozzle performance that remain undemonstrated.
        An early idea of improving performance of rotors by composing
        them of nested cones rather than flat disks has been shown to
        produce no performance advantages and to introduce structural
        handicaps (20, 79). </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>Tesla-type turbomachinery probably cannot prove competitive in
        an application in which more conventional machines have adequate
        efficiency and performance. Thus, they cannot be expected to
        displace conventional water pumps or conventional water turbines
        or gas turbines. Tesla-type turbomachinery should be considered
        in applications in which conventional machines are inadequate.
        This includes applications for small shaft power, or the use of
        very viscous fluids or of non-Newtonian fluids. There is some
        reason to believe that multiple-disk turbomachines can operate
        with abrasive two-phase flow mixtures with less erosion of
        material from the rotor. For that reason they should be further
        investigated for applications to produce power from geothermal
        steam and particle-laden industrial gas flows. There may also be
        unique applications possible using ceramic disks. There is
        considerable evidence that multiple disk turbomachinery can be
        quieter in operation than is conventional machinery and that the
        noise is more nearly "white" without a prevailing sound
        signature. Multiple-disk pumps are well-known to resist
        cavitation (20, 49). It is the only type of turbomachinery that
        can be easily constructed in a relatively primitive machine
        shop. </p>
