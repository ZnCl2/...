        </center>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Suppose some
          one should discover a new mechanical principle -- something as
          fundamental as James Watt’s discovery of the expansive power
          of steam -- by the use of which it became possible to build a
          motor that would give ten horse power for every pound of the
          engine's weight, a motor so simple that the veriest novice in
          mechanics could construct it and so elemental that it could
          not possibly get out of repair. Then suppose that this motor
          could be run forward or backward at will, that it could be
          used as either an engine or a pump, that it cost almost
          nothing to build as compared with any other known form of
          engine, that it utilized a larger percentage of the available
          power than any existing machine, and, finally, that it would
          operate with gas, steam, compressed air or water, any one of
          them, as its driving power. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It does not
          take a mechanical expert to imagine the limitless
          possibilities of such an engine. It takes very little effort
          to conjure up a picture of a new world of industry and
          transportation made possible by the invention of such a
          device. "Revolutionary" seems a mild term to apply to it.
          That, however, is the word the inventor uses in describing it
          -- Nikola Tesla, the scientist whose electrical discoveries
          underlie all modern electrical power development, whose
          experiments and deductions made the wireless telegraph
          possible, and who now, in the mechanical field, has achieved a
          triumph even more far reaching than anything he accomplished
          in electricity. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">There is
          something of the romantic in this discovery of the famous
          explorer of the hidden realms of knowledge. The pursuit of an
          ideal is always romantic, and it was in the pursuit of an
          ideal which he has been seeking twenty years that Dr. Tesla
          made his great discovery. That ideal is the power to fly -- to
          fly with certainty and absolute safety -- not merely to go up
          in an aeroplane and take chances on weather conditions, "holes
          in the air", tornadoes, lightning and the thousand other
          perils the aviator of today faces, but to fly with the speed
          and certainty of a cannon ball, with power to overcome any of
          nature's aerial forces, to start when one pleases, go whither
          one pleases and alight where one pleases. That has been the
          aim of Dr. Tesla's life for nearly a quarter of a century. He
          believes that with the discovery of the principle of his new
          motor he has solved this problem and that incidentally he has
          laid the foundations for the most startling new achievements
          in other mechanical lines. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">There was a
          time when men of science were skeptical -- a time when they
          ridiculed the announcement of revolutionary discoveries. Those
          were the days when Nikola Tesla, the young scientist from the
          Balkans, was laughed at when he urged his theories on the
          engineering world. Times have changed since then, and the
          "practical" engineer is not so incredulous about "scientific"
          discoveries. The change came about when young Tesla showed the
          way by which the power of Niagara Falls could be utilized. The
          right to divert a portion of the waters of Niagara had been
          granted; then arose the question of how best to utilize the
          tremendous power thus made available -- how to transmit it to
          the points where it could be commercially utilized. An
          international commission sat in London and listened to
          theories and practical plans for months. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Up to that
          time the only means of utilizing electric power was the direct
          current motor, and direct current dynamos big enough to be of
          practical utility for such a gigantic power development were
          not feasible. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Then came
          the announcement of young Tesla's discovery of the principle
          of the alternating current motor. Practical tests showed that
          it could be built -- that it would work. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">That
          discovery, at that opportune time, decided the commission.
          Electricity was determined upon as the means for the
          transmission of Niagara's power to industry and commerce.
          Today a million horse power is developed on the brink of the
          great cataract, turning the wheels of Buffalo, Rochester,
          Syracuse and the intervening cities and villages operating
          close at hand the great new electro-chemical industries that
          the existence of this immense source of power has made
          possible, while all around the world a thousand waterfalls are
          working in the service of mankind, sending the power of their
          "white coal" into remote and almost inaccessible corners of
          the globe, all because of Nikola Tesla's first great epoch
          making discovery. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Today the
          engineering world listens respectfully when Dr. Tesla speaks.
          The first announcement of the discovery of his new mechanical
          principle was made in a technical periodical in mid-September,
          1911. Immediately it became the principal topic of discussions
          wherever engineers met. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"It is the
          greatest invention in a century", wrote one of the foremost
          American engineers, a man whose name stands close to the top
          of the list of those who have achieved scientific fame and
          greatness. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"No
          invention of such importance in the automobile trade has yet
          been made", declared the editor of one of the leading
          engineering publications. Experts in other engineering lines
          pointed out other applications of the new principle and
          letters asking for further information poured in on Dr. Tesla
          from the four quarters of the globe. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Oh, I've
          had too much publicity", he said, when I telephoned to him to
          ask for an interview in order to explain his new discovery to
          the non-technical public. It took a good deal of persuasion
          before he reluctantly fixed an hour when he would see me, and
          a good bit more after that before he talked at all freely.
          When he did speak, however, he opened up vistas of possible
          applications of the new engine that staggered the imagination
          of the interviewer. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Looking out
          over the city from the windows of his office, on the twentieth
          floor of the Metropolitan Tower, his face lit up as he told of
          his life dream and its approaching realization, and the
          listener's fancy could almost see the air full of strange
          flying craft, while huge steamships propelled at unheard of
          speeds ploughed the waters of the North River, automobiles
          climbed the very face of the Palisades, locomotives of
          incredible power whisked wheeled palaces many miles a minute
          and all the discomforts of summer heat vanished as marvelous
          refrigerating plants reduced the temperature of the whole city
          to a comfortable maximum -- for these were only a few of the
          suggestions of the limitless possibilities of the latest Tesla
          discovery. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Just what
          is your new invention?", I asked. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"I have
          accomplished what mechanical engineers have been dreaming
          about ever since the invention of steam power", replied Dr.
          Tesla. "That is the perfect rotary engine. It happens that I
          have also produced an engine which will give at least
          twenty-five times as much power to a pound of weight as the
          lightest weight engine of any kind that has yet been produced.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"In doing
          this I have made use of two properties which have always been
          known to be possessed by all fluids, but which have not
          heretofore been utilized. These properties are adhesion and
          viscosity. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Put a drop
          of water on a metal plate. The drop will roll off, but a
          certain amount of the water will remain on the plate until it
          evaporates or is removed by some absorptive means. The metal
          does not absorb any of the water, but the water adheres to it.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"The drop of
          water may change its shape, but until its particles are
          separated by some external power it remains intact. This
          tendency of all fluids to resist molecular separation is
          viscosity. It is especially noticeable in the heavier oils. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"It is these
          properties of adhesion and viscosity that cause the 'skin
          friction' that impedes a ship in its progress through the
          water or an aeroplane in going through the air. All fluids
          have these qualities -- and you must keep in mind that air is
          a fluid, all gases are fluids, steam is fluid. Every known
          means of transmitting or developing mechanical power is
          through a fluid medium. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Now,
          suppose we make this metal plate that I have spoken of
          circular in shape and mount it at its centre on a shaft so
          that it can be revolved. Apply power to rotate the shaft and
          what happens? Why, whatever fluid the disk happens to be
          revolving in is agitated and dragged along in the direction of
          rotation, because the fluid tends to adhere to the disk and
          the viscosity causes the motion given to the adhering
          particles of the fluid to be transmitted to the whole mass.
          Here, I can show you better than tell you." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Dr. Tesla
          led the way into an adjoining room. On a desk was a small
          electric motor and mounted on the shaft were half a dozen flat
          disks, separated by perhaps a sixteenth of an inch from one
          another, each disk being less than that in thickness. He
          turned a switch and the motor began to buzz. A wave of cool
          air was immediately felt. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"There we
          have a disk, or rather a series of disks, revolving in a fluid
          -- the air", said the inventor. "You need no proof to tell you
          that the air is being agitated and propelled violently. If you
          will hold your hand over the centre of these disks -- you see
          the centres have been cut away -- you will feel the suction as
          air is drawn in to be expelled from the peripheries of the
          disks. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Now,
          suppose these revolving disks were enclosed in an air tight
          case, so constructed that the air could enter only at one
          point and be expelled only at another -- what would we have? </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"You'd have
          an air pump", I suggested. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Exactly --
          an air pump or blower", said Dr. Tesla. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"There is
          one now in operation delivering ten thousand cubic feet of air
          a minute. Now, come over here." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">He stepped
          across the hall and into another room, where three or four
          draughtsmen were at work and various mechanical and electrical
          contrivances were scattered about. At one side of the room was
          what appeared to be a zinc or aluminum tank, divided into two
          sections, one above the other, while a pipe that ran along the
          wall above the upper division of the tank was connected with a
          little aluminum case about the size and shape of a small alarm
          clock. A tiny electric motor was attached to a shaft that
          protruded from one side of the aluminum case. The lower
          division of the tank was filled with water. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Inside of
          this aluminum case are several disks mounted on a shaft and
          immersed in a fluid, water", said Dr. Tesla. "From this lower
          tank the water has free access to the case enclosing the
          disks. This pipe leads from the periphery of the case. I turn
          the current on, the motor turns the disks and as I open this
          valve in the pipe the water flows." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">He turned
          the valve and the water certainly did flow. Instantly a stream
          that would have filled a barrel in a very few minutes began to
          run out of the pipe into the upper part of the tank and thence
          into the lower tank. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"This is
          only a toy", said Dr. Tesla. "There are only half a dozen
          disks -- 'runners', I call them -- each less than three inches
          in diameter, inside of that case. They are just like the disks
          you saw on the first motor -- no vanes, blades or attachments
          of any kind. Just perfectly smooth, flat disks revolving in
          their own planes and pumping water because of the viscosity
          and adhesion of the fluid. One such pump now in operation,
          with eight disks, eighteen inches in diameter, pumps four
          thousand gallons a minute to a height of 360 feet." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">We went back
          into the big, well lighted office. I was beginning to grasp
          the new Tesla principle. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Suppose now
          we reversed the operation", continued the inventor. "You have
          seen the disks acting as a pump. Suppose we had water, or air
          under pressure, or steam under pressure, or gas under
          pressure, and let it run into the case in which the disks are
          contained -- what would happen?" </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"The disks
          would revolve and any machinery attached to the shaft would be
          operated -- you would convert the pump into an engine", I
          suggested. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"That is
          exactly what would happen -- what does happen", replied Dr.
          Tesla. "It is an engine that does all that engineers have ever
          dreamed of an engine doing, and more. Down at the Waterside
          power station of the New York Edison Company, through their
          courtesy, I have had a number of such engines in operation. In
          one of them the disks are only nine inches in diameter and the
          whole working part is two inches thick. With steam as the
          propulsive fluid it develops 110-horse power, and could do
          twice as much." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"You have
          got what Professor Langley was trying to evolve for his flying
          machine -- an engine that will give a horse power for a pound
          of weight", I suggested. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><b>Ten Horse
            Power to the Pound. ~</b> </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"I have got
          more than that", replied Dr. Tesla. "I have an engine that
          will give ten horse power to the pound of weight. That is
          twenty-five times as powerful as the lightest weight engine in
          use today. The lightest gas engine used on aeroplanes weighs
          two and one-half pounds to the horse power. With two and
          one-half pounds of weight I can develop twenty-five horse
          power." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"That means
          the solution of the problem of flying", I suggested. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Yes, and
          many more", was the reply. "The applications of this
          principle, both for imparting power to fluids, as in pumps,
          and for deriving power from fluids, as in turbine, are
          boundless. It costs almost nothing to make, there is nothing
          about it to get out of order, it is reversible -- simply have
          two ports for the gas or steam, to enter by, one on each side,
          and let it into one side or other. There are no blades or
          vanes to get out of order -- the steam turbine is a delicate
          thing." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">I remembered
          the bushels of broken blades that were gathered out of the
          turbine casings of the first turbine equipped steamship to
          cross the ocean, and realized the importance of this phase of
          the new engine. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Then, too",
          Dr. Tesla went on, "there are no delicate adjustments to be
          made. The distance between the disks is not a matter of
          microscopic accuracy and there is no necessity for minute
          clearances between the disks and the case. All one needs is
          some disks mounted on a shaft, spaced a little distance apart
          and cased so that a fluid can enter at one point and go out at
          another. If the fluid enters at the centre and goes out at the
          periphery it is a pump. If it enters at the periphery and goes
          out at the center it is a motor. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Coupling
          these engines in series, one can do away with gearing in
          machinery. Factories can be equipped without shafting. The
          motor is especially adapted to automobiles, for it will run on
          gas explosions as well as on steam. The gas or steam can be
          let into a dozen ports all around the rim of the case if
          desired. It is possible to run it as a gas engine with a
          continuous flow of gas, gasoline and air being mixed and the
          continuous combustion causing expansion and pressure to
          operate the motor. The expansive power of steam, as well as
          its propulsive power, can be utilized as in a turbine or a
          reciprocating engine. By permitting the propelling fluid to
          move along the lines of least resistance a considerably larger
          proportion of the available power is utilized. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"As an air
          compressor it is highly efficient. There is a large engine of
          this type now in practical operation as an air compressor and
          giving remarkable service. Refrigeration on a scale hitherto
          never attempted will be practical, through the use of this
          engine in compressing air, and the manufacture of liquid air
          commercially is now entirely feasible. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"With a
          thousand horse power engine, weighing only one hundred pounds,
          imagine the possibilities in automobiles, locomotives and
          steamships. In the space now occupied by the engines of the
          Lusitania twenty-five times her 80,000 horse power could be
          developed, were it possible to provide boiler capacity
          sufficient to furnish the necessary steam." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"And it
          makes the aeroplane practical", I suggested. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Not the
          aeroplane, the flying machine", responded Dr. Tesla. "Now you
          have struck the point in which I am most deeply interested --
          the object toward which I have been devoting my energies for
          more than twenty years -- the dream of my life. It was in
          seeking the means of making the perfect flying machine that I
          developed this engine. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Twenty
          years ago I believed that I would be the first man to fly;
          that I was on the track of accomplishing what no one else was
          anywhere near reaching. I was working entirely in electricity
          then and did not realize that the gasoline engine was
          approaching a perfection that was going to make the aeroplane
          feasible. There is nothing new about the aeroplane but its
          engine, you know. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"What I was
          working on twenty years ago was the wireless transmission of
          electric power. My idea was a flying machine propelled by an
          electric motor, with power supplied from stations on the
          earth. I have not accomplished this as yet, but am confident
          that I will in time. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"When I
          found that I had been anticipated as to the flying machine, by
          men working in a different field, I began to study the problem
          from other angles, to regard it as a mechanical rather than an
          electrical problem. I felt certain there must be some means of
          obtaining power that was better than any now in use. And by
          vigorous use of my gray matter for a number of years, I
          grasped the possibilities of the principle of the viscosity
          and adhesion of fluids and conceived the mechanism of my
          engine. Now that I have it, my next step will be the perfect
          flying machine." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"An
          aeroplane driven by your engine?", I asked. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Not at
          all", said Dr. Tesla. "The aeroplane is fatally defective. It
          is merely a toy -- a sporting play-thing. It can never become
          commercially practical. It has fatal defects. One is the fact
          that when it encounters a downward current of air it is
          helpless. The 'hole in the air' of which aviators speak is
          simply a downward current, and unless the aeroplane is high
          enough above the earth to move laterally but can do nothing
          but fall. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"There is no
          way of detecting these downward currents, no way of avoiding
          them, and therefore the aeroplane must always be subject to
          chance and its operator to the risk of fatal accident.
          Sportsmen will always take these chances, but as a business
          proposition the risk is too great. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"The flying
          machine of the future -- my flying machine -- will be heavier
          than air, but it will not be an aeroplane. It will have no
          wings. It will be substantial, solid, stable. You cannot have
          a stable airplane. The gyroscope can never be successfully
          applied to the airplane, for it would give a stability that
          would result in the machine being torn to pieces by the wind,
          just as the unprotected aeroplane on the ground is torn to
          pieces by a high wind. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"My flying
          machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see
          it on the ground and you would never guess that it was a
          flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through
          the air in any direction with perfect safety, higher speeds
          than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and
          oblivious of 'holes in the air' or downward currents. It will
          ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain absolutely
          stationary in the air, even in a wind, for great length of
          time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate
          devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive
          mechanical action." </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"You will
          get stability through gyroscopes?", I asked. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Through
          gyroscopic action of my engine, assisted by some devices I am
          not yet prepared to talk about", he replied. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Powerful
          air currents that may be deflected at will, if produced by
          engines and compressors sufficiently light and powerful, might
          lift a heavy body off the ground and propel it through the
          air", I ventured, wondering if I had grasped the inventor's
          secret. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Dr. Tesla
          smiled an inscrutable smile. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"All I have
          to say on that point is that my airship will have neither gas
          bag, wings nor propellers", he said. "It is the child of my
          dreams, the product of years of intense and painful toil and
          research. I am not going to talk about it any further. But
          whatever my airship may be, here at least is an engine that
          will do things that no other engine ever has done, and that is
          something tangible."</p>

          <center><b><font size="+1">"From the Complex to the Simple"</font></b></center>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A marked
            step was taken in the simplification of prime movers when
            Watt's cumbersome beam engine, with its ingenious but
            elaborate parallel motion, gave way to the present standard
            reciprocating type, with only piston rod, crosshead and
            connecting rod interposed between piston and crank. An even
            greater advance toward ideal simplicity occurred when, after
            years of effort by inventors to produce a practicle rotary,
            Parsons brought out his compact, though costly, turbine, in
            which the energy of the steam is developed on a zig-zag path
            through multitudinous rows of fixed and moving blades. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">And now
            comes Mr. Tesla with a motor which bids fair to carry the
            steam engine another long step toward the ideally simple
            prime mover -- a motor in which the fixed and revolving
            blades of the turbine give place to a set of steel disks of
            simple and cheap construction. If the flow of steam in
            spiral curves between the adjoining faces of flat disks is
            an efficient method of developing the energy of the steam,
            the prime mover would certainly appear to have been at last
            reduced to its simplest terms. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
            further development of the unique turbine which we describe
            elsewhere will be followed with close attention by the
            technical world. The results attained with this small
            high-pressure unit are certainly flattering, and give reason
            to believe that the addition of a low pressure turbine and a
            condenser would make this type of turbine as highly
            efficient as it is simple and cheap in construction and
            maintenance.</p>

          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It will
            interest the readers of the Scientific American to that
            Nikola Tesla, whose reputation must, naturally, stand upon
            the contribution he made to electrical engineering when the
            art was yet in its comparative infancy, is by training and
            choice a mechanical engineer, with a strong leaning to that
            branch of it which is covered by the term "steam
            engineering". For several years past he has devoted much of
            his attention to improvements in thermo-dynamic conversion,
            and the result of his theories and practical experiments is
            to be found in an entirely new form of prime movers shown in
            operation at the waterside station of the New York Edison
            Company, who kindly placed the facilities of their great
            plant at his disposal for carrying on experimental work. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">By the
            courtesy of the inventor, we are enabled to publish the
            accompanying views, representing the testing plant at the
            Waterside station, which are the first photographs of this
            interesting motor that have yet been made public. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The basic
            principle which determined Tesla's investigations was the
            well-known fact that when a fluid (steam, gas or water) is
            used as a vehicle of energy, the highest possible economy
            can be obtained only when the changes in velocity and
            direction of the movement of the fluid are made as gradual
            and easy as possible. In the present forms of turbines in
            which the energy is transmitted by pressure, reaction or
            impact, as in the De Laval, Parsons, and Curtiss types, more
            or less sudden changes both of speed and direction are
            involved, with consequent shocks, vibration and destructive
            eddies. Furthermore, the introduction of pistons, blades,
            buckets, and intercepting devices of this general class,
            into the path of the fluid involves much delicate and
            difficult mechanical construction which adds greatly to the
            cost both of production and maintenance. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
            desiderata in an ideal turbine group themselves under the
            heads of the theoretical and the mechanical. The
            theoretically perfect turbine would be one in which the
            fluid was so controlled from the inlet to the exhaust that
            its energy was delivered to the driving shaft with the least
            possible losses due to the mechanical means employed. The
            mechanically perfect turbine would be one which combined
            simplicity and cheapness of construction, durability, ease
            and rapidity of repairs, and a small ratio of weight and
            space occupied to the power delivered on the shaft. Mr.
            Tesla maintains that in the turbine which forms the subject
            of this article, he has carried the steam and gas motor a
            long step forward toward the maximum attainable efficiency,
            both theoretical and mechanical. That these claims are well
            founded is shown by the fact that in the plant at the Edison
            station, he is securing an output of 200 horse-power from a
            single-stage steam turbine with atmospheric exhaust,
            weighing less than 2 pounds per horse-power, which is
            contained within a space measuring 2 feet by 3 feet, by 2
            feet in height, and which accomplishes these results with a
            thermal fall of only 130 BTU, that is, about one-third of
            the total drop available. Furthermore, considered from the
            mechanical standpoint, the turbine is astonishingly simple
            and economical in construction, and by the very nature of
            its construction, should prove to possess such a durability
            and freedom from wear and breakdown as to place it, in these
            respects, far in advance of any type of steam or gas motor
            of the present day. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Briefly
            stated, Tesla's steam motor consists of a set of flat steel
            disks mounted on a shaft and rotating within a casing, the
            steam entering with high velocity at the periphery of the
            disks, flowing between them in free spiral paths, and
            finally escaping through exhaust ports at their center.
            Instead of developing the energy of the steam by pressure,
            reaction, or impact, on a series of blades or vanes, Tesla
            depends upon the fluid properties of adhesion and viscosity
            -- the attraction of the steam to the faces of the disks and
            the resistance of its particles to molecular separation
            combining in transmitting the velocity energy of the motive
            fluid to the plates and the shaft. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">By
            reference to the accompanying photographs and line drawings,
            it will be seen that the turbine has a rotor A which in the
            present case consists of 25 flat steel disks, one
            thirty-second of an inch in thickness, of hardened and
            carefully tempered steel. The rotor as assembled is 3 1/2
            inches wide on the face, by 18 inches in diameter, and when
            the turbine is running at its maximum working velocity, the
            material is never under a tensile stress exceeding 50,000
            pounds per square inch. The rotor is mounted in a casing D,
            which is provided with two inlet nozzles, B for use in
            running direct and B' for reversing. Openings C are cut out
            at the central portion of the disks and these communicate
            directly with exhaust ports formed in the side of the
            casing. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In
            operation, the steam, or gas, as the case may be is directed
            on the periphery of the disks through the nozzle B (which
            may be diverging, straight or converging), where more or
            less of its expansive energy is converted into velocity
            energy. When the machine is at rest, the radial and
            tangential forces due to the pressure and velocity of the
            steam cause it to travel in a rather short curved path
            toward the central exhaust opening, as indicated by the full
            black line in the accompanying diagram; but as the disks
            commence to rotate and their speed increases, the steam
            travels in spiral paths the length of which increases until,
            as in the case of the present turbine, the particles of the
            fluid complete a number of turns around the shaft before
            reaching the exhaust, covering in the meantime a lineal path
            some 12 to 16 feet in length. During its progress from inlet
            to exhaust, the velocity and pressure of the steam are
            reduced until it leaves the exhaust at 1 or 2 pounds gage
            pressure. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
            resistance to the passage of the steam or gas between
            adjoining plates is approximately proportionate to the
            square of the relative speed, which is at a maximum toward
            the center of the disks and is equal to the tangential
            velocity of the steam. Hence the resistance to radial escape
            is very great, being furthermore enhanced by the centrifugal
            force acting outwardly. One of the most desirable elements
            in a perfected turbine is that of reversibility, and we are
            all familiar with the many and frequently cumbersome means
            which have been employed to secure this end. It will be seen
            that this turbine is admirably adapted for reversing, since
            this effect can be secured by merely closing the right-hand
            valve and opening that on the left. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It is
            evident that the principles of this turbine are equally
            applicable, by slight modifications of design, for its use
            as a pump, and we present a photograph of a demonstration
            model which is in operation in Mr. Tesla's office. This
            little pump, driven by an electric motor of 1/12
            horse-power, delivers 40 gallons per minute against a head
            of 9 feet. The discharge pipe leads up to a horizontal tube
            provided with a wire mesh for screening the water and
            checking the eddies. The water falls through a slot in the
            bottomof this tube and after passing below a baffle plate
            flows in a steady stream about 3/4 inch thick by 18 inches
            in width, to a trough from which it returns to the pump.
            Pumps of this character show an efficiency favorably
            comparing with that of centrifugal pumps and they have the
            advantage that great heads are obtainable economically in a
            single stage. The runner is mounted in a two-part volute
            casing and except for the fact that the place of the
            buckets, vanes, etc., of the ordinary centrifugal pump is
            taken by a set of disks, the construction is generally
            similar to that of pumps of the standard kind. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In
            conclusion, it should be noted that although the
            experimental plant at the Waterside station develops 200
            horse-power with 125 pounds at the supply pipe and free
            exhaust, it could show an output of 300 horse-power with the
            full pressure of the Edison supply circuit. Furthermore, Mr.
            Tesla states that if it were compounded and the exhaust were
            led to a low pressure unit, carrying about three times the
            number of disks contained in the high pressure element, with
            connection to a condenser affording 28-1/2 to 29 inches of
            vacuum, the results obtained in the present high-pressure
            machine indicate that the compound unit would give an output
            of 600 horse-power, without great increase of dimensions.
            This estimate is conservative. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
            testing plant consists of two identical turbines connected
            by a carefully calibrated torsion spring, the machine to the
            left being the driving element, the other the brake. In the
            brake element, the steam is delivered to the blades in a
            direction opposite to that of the rotation of the disks.
            Fastened to the shaft of the brake turbine is a hollow
            pulley provided with two diametrically opposite narrow
            slots, and an incandescent lamp placed inside close to the
            rim. As the pulley rotates, two flashes of light pass out of
            the same, and by means of reflecting mirrors and lenses,
            they are carried around the plant and fall upon two rotating
            glass mirrors placed back to back on the shaft of the
            driving turbine so that the center line of the silver
            coatings coincides with the axis of the shaft. The mirrors
            are so set that when there is no torsion on the spring, the
            light beams produce a luminous spot stationary at the zero
            of the scale. But as soon as load is put on, the beam is
            deflected through an angle which indicates directly the
            torsion. The scale and spring are so proportioned and
            adjusted that the horse-power can be read directly from the
            deflections noted. The indications of this device are very
            accurate and have shown that when the turbine is running at
            9,000 revolutions under an inlet pressure of 125 pounds to
            the square inch, and with free exhaust, 200 brake
            horse-power are developed. The consumption under these
            conditions of maximum output is 38 pounds of saturated steam
            per horse-power per hour -- a very high efficiency when we
            consider that the heat-drop, measured by thermometers, is
            only 130 BTU, and that the energy transformation is effected
            in one stage. Since about three times this number of heat
            units are available in a modern plant with super-heat and
            high vacuum, the above means a consumption of less than 12
            pounds per horse-power hour in such turbines adapted to take
            up the full drop. Under certain conditions, however, very
            high thermal efficiencies have been obtained which
            demonstrate that in large machines based on this principle,
            in which a very small slip can be secured, the steam
            consumption will be much lower and should, Mr. Tesla states,
            approximate the theoretical minimum, thus resulting in
            nearly frictionless turbine transmitting almost the entire
            expansive energy of the steam to the shaft.</p>

          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Engineers
            and men of science throughout the world are awaiting with
            unusual interest the completion of tests of a new steam
            turbine designed by Nikola Tesla, which preliminary
            experiments indicate will give enormous power from a
            comparatively small and extremely lightweight engine. Ten
            horsepower to a pound of weight has already been developed
            with the engines that have been tested and enthusiasts who
            have witnessed the work of the turbine declare the perfect
            rotor has at last been found. To what extent this is true,
            time and the construction of larger units than have yet been
            used must prove. At present, while the practical
            experimental stage has not yet been passed, the entire
            engineering world is profoundly interested in the work that
            has been done, and awaits future development with much
            concern. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Operation
            of the Tesla engine depends upon two well-known properties
            of fluids: adhesion -- the tendency, for example, of a
            certain amount of water to cling to a smooth metal surface,
            even when the bulk of the water has been shaken off; and
            viscosity, the resistance of fluids to molecular separation,
            the tendency of one drop, in a mass of fluid, to drag
            adjoining drops with it, if set in motion. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In its
            simplest form, the new idea takes the shape of the
            inventor's little "air-diffuser". This consists of half a
            dozen very thin steel disks, some 9 or 10 in. in diameter,
            set horizontally, about 1/8 in. apart, on the upright shaft
            of a small, horizontal electric motor, the center of each
            disk being cut away in a 3-in. circle. With current switched
            into the motor, the disks revolve, and instantly strong
            suction can be felt by the hand held several inches above
            the axis, while a powerful current of air is blown from the
            spaces between the disks. The air, in short, is being sucked
            into the central opening and hurled out at the periphery.
            Consider now that disks and shaft have been inclosed in an
            air-tight case, with an inlet at the axis and an outlet at
            one point of the periphery; we have an air pump, a Tesla
            blower, one of which, now in operation, is delivering 10,000
            cu. ft. of air per minute. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Suppose
            again that water, instead of air, be the fluid admitted.
            Entering the cut-away space at the centers of the disks, the
            adhesion of the metal drags it, in a widening spiral, toward
            the spinning circumferences, there to hurl it away in a
            tangential direction; and since the water must now leave the
            case by its one outlet, we have the Tesla pump, on rather
            new lines. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Assume
            that the pumping process is to be reversed, that the disks,
            instead of being turned by an outside force, are to produce
            power themselves, that steam under pressure has been
            substituted for the water. The steam, admitted to the case,
            strikes the edges of the disks and takes the path of least
            resistance between them, a narrowing spiral toward the
            outlet through their centers. The disks themselves are
            dragged around, the shaft is turned and power is being
            generated in an entirely new fashion. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Working
            under the best conditions -- in the experimental laboratory
            a single disk of 9 3/4 in. diameter, with a center outlet of
            3 5/8 in., will develop 5 hp. Without nearly approaching the
            limit of strain of the materials, the pressure could be
            increased so that the velocity of rotation would be doubled
            and the power quadrupled; so that with a single steel plate,
            1/32 in. in thickness, weighing about 3/8 lb., and
            delivering 20 hp, we have a possible 53 hp. to 1 lb. of
            actually working material. Or a more concrete example can be
            found in a double Tesla turbine, built for practical service
            and nearly completed. In this there are two sets of disks,
            arranged to revolve in opposite directions and each set
            developing 200 hp. </p>
          <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A little
            model pump in which five disks, 3 in. in diameter, contained
            in the lower front, circular case, throw 40 gal. a minute
            when the little electric motor is started up. The water
            flows out of a slit at the bottom of the upper pipe and
            flows back to the lower tank as seen in the foreground. This
            model illustrates one point astonishingly: the power can be
            shut off when the pump is in full operation and everything
            stops instantly without the slightest jar. With the power
            switched on suddenly, the full flow is resumed so quickly
            that the interval between the click of the switch and the
            full stream of water is too small to be determined with an
            ordinary watch. </p>

        </center>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Be it known
          that I, Nikola Tesla, and engineer residing at the Waldorf
          Astoria, corner Fifth Avenue and Thirty Fourth Street, in the
          Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, United
          States of America, having invented certain new and useful
          improvements in fluid propulsion, do hereby declare the
          following is a full, clear and exact description of the same.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the
          practical application of mechanical power based on the use of
          a fluid as vehicle of energy it has been demonstrated that, in
          order to attain the highest economy, the changes in velocity
          and direction of movement of the fluid should be as gradual as
          possible. In the present forms of such apparatus more or less
          sudden changes, shocks and vibrations are unavoidable. Besides
          the employment of the usual devices for imparting to vanes and
          blades, necessarily introduce numerous defects and limitations
          and adds to the complication, cost of production and
          maintenance of the machine. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The object
          of my invention is to overcome these deficiencies and to
          effect the transmission and transformation of mechanical
          energy through the agency of fluids in a more perfect manner,
          and by means simpler and more economical than those heretofore
          employed. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">I accomplish
          this by causing the propelled or propelling fluid to move in
          natural paths or stream lines of least resistance, free from
          constraint and disturbance such as occasioned by vanes or
          kindred devices, and to change its velocity and direction of
          movement by imperceptible degrees, thus avoiding the losses
          due to sudden variations while the fluid is receiving or
          imparting energy. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It is well
          know that a fluid possesses among others, two salient
          properties: adhesion and viscosity. Owing to these a body
          propelled through such a medium encounters a peculiar
          impediment known as "lateral" or "skin resistance", which is
          two-fold: one arising from the shock of the fluid against the
          asperities of the solid substance, the other from internal
          forces opposing molecular separation. As an inevitable
          consequence a certain amount of the fluid is dragged along by
          the moving body. Conversely, if the body were placed in a
          fluid in motion, for the same reasons, it is impelled in the
          direction of the movement. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">These
          effects, in themselves, are of daily observation, but I
          believe that I am the first to apply them in a practical and
          economical matter of fluid propulsion. The nature of my
          discovery and the principles of construction of the apparatus,
          which I have designed for carrying it out, I shall now proceed
          to describe by reference to the accompanying drawings which
          illustrate an operative and efficient embodiment of the same.
        </p>

          Figures 3 and 4 represent, respectively, in corresponding
          views, a rotary engine or turbine, both machines being
          constructed and adapted to be operated in accordance with my
          invention. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In these
          drawings the device illustrated contains a runner composed of
          a plurality of flat rigid disks 1 of a suitable diameter,
          keyed to a shaft 2, and held in a position by a threaded nut
          3, a shoulder 4 and washers 5 of the requisite thickness. Each
          disk has a number of central openings 6, the solid portions
          between which form spokes 7, preferably curved, as shown, for
          the purpose of reducing the loss of energy due to the impact
          of the fluid. The runner is mounted in a two-part volute
          casing 8 having stuffing boxes 9 and inlets 10 leading to its
          central portion. In addition a gradually widening and rounded
          outlet 11 is provided formed with a flange, for connection to
          a pipe as usual. The casing 8 rests upon a base 12 shown only
          in part and supporting the bearings for the shaft 2, which
          being of ordinary construction, are omitted from the drawings.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">An
          understanding of the principle embodied in this device will be
          gained from the following description of its mode of
          operation. Power being applied to the shaft and the runner set
          in rotation in the direction of the solid arrow, the fluid by
          reason of its properties of adherence and viscosity, upon
          entering through the inlets 10 and coming in contact with the
          disks 1 is taken hold of by the same and subjected to two
          forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation,
          and the other radiates outward. The combined effect of the
          tangential and centrifugal forces is to propel the fluid with
          continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path until it
          reaches the outlet 11 from which it is ejected. This spiral
          movement, free and undisturbed and essentially dependent on
          these properties of the fluid, permitting it to adjust itself
          to natural paths or streamlines and to change its velocity and
          direction by insensible degrees, is characteristic of this
          method of propulsion and advantageous in its application.
          While traversing the chamber enclosing the runner, the
          particles of the fluid may complete one or more turns, or but
          part of one turn. In any given case their path can be closely
          calculated and graphically represented, but fairly accurate
          estimates of turns can be obtained simply by determining the
          number of revolutions required to renew the fluid passing
          through the chamber and multiplying it by the ratio between
          the mean speed of the fluid and that of the disks. I have
          found that the quantity of fluid propelled in this manner is,
          other conditions being equal, approximately proportionate to
          the active surface of the runner and to its effective speed.
          For this reason, their performance of such machines augments
          at an exceedingly high rate with the increase of their size
          and speed of revolution. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          dimensions of the device as a whole, and the spacing of the
          disks in any given machine will be determined by the
          conditions and requirements of special cases. It may be stated
          that the intervening distance should be the greater, the
          larger the diameter of the disks, the longer the spiral path
          of the fluid and the greater its viscosity. In general, the
          spacing should be such that the entire mass of the fluid,
          before leaving the runner, is accelerated to a nearly uniform
          velocity, not much below that of the periphery of the disks
          under normal working conditions and almost equal to it when
          the outlet is closed and the particles move in concentric
          circles. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It may also
          be pointed out that such a pump can be made without openings
          and spokes in the runner, as by using one or more solid disks,
          each in its own casing, in which form the machine will be
          eminently adapted for sewage, dredging and the like, when the
          water is charged with foreign bodies and spokes or vanes
          especially objectionable. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Another
          application of this principle which I have discovered to be
          not only feasible, buy thoroughly practicable and efficient,
          is the utilization of machines such as above described for the
          compression or rarefaction of air, or gases in general. In
          such cases it will be found that most of the general
          considerations obtaining in the case of liquids, properly
          interpreted, hold true. When, irrespective of the character of
          the fluid, considerable pressure are desired, staging or
          compounding may be resorted to in the usual way, the
          individual runners being, preferably, mounted on the same
          shaft. It should be added that the same end may be attained
          with one single runner by suitable deflection of the fluid
          through rotational or stationary passages. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          principles underlying the invention are capable of embodiment
          also in that field of mechanical engineering which is
          concerned in the use of fluids as motive agents, for while in
          some respects the actions in the latter case are directly
          opposite to those met with in the propulsion of fluids, the
          fundamental laws applicable in the two case are the same. In
          other words, the operation described above is reversible, for,
          if water or air, under pressure, be admitted to the opening 11
          the runner is set in rotation in the direction of the dotted
          arrow by reason of the peculiar properties of the fluid,
          which, traveling in a spiral path, and with continuously
          diminishing velocity, reaches the orifices 6 and 10 through
          which it is discharged. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">When
          apparatus of the general character described is employed for
          the transmission of power, however, certain departures from
          similarity between transmitter and receiver may be necessary
          for securing the best results. I have, therefore, included
          that part of my invention which is directly applicable to the
          use of fluids as motive agents in a separate application filed
          January 17, 1911, Serial No. 603,049. It may be here pointed
          out, however, as is evident from the above considerations,
          that when transmitting power from one shaft to another by such
          machines, any desired ratio between the speeds of rotation may
          be obtained by proper selection of the diameters of the disks,
          or, by suitably staging the transmitter, the receiver, or
          both. But it may be pointed out that in one respect, at least,
          the two machines are essentially different </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the pump,
          the radial or static pressure, due to centrifugal force, is
          added to the tangential or dynamic, thus increasing the
          effective head and assisting in the expulsion of the fluid. In
          the motor, on the contrary, the first named pressure being
          opposed to that of supply reduces the effective head and the
          velocity of radial flow towards the center. Again, in the
          propelled machine, a great torque is always desirable, this
          calling for an increased number of disks and smaller distance
          of separation, while in the propelling machine, for numerous
          economic reasons, the rotary effect should be the smallest and
          the speed the greatest practicable. Many other considerations,
          the design and construction, but the preceding is thought to
          contain all necessary information in this regard. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It will be
          understood that the principles of construction and operation
          above generally set forth, are capable of embodiment in
          machines of the most widely different forms, and adapted for
          the greatest variety of purposes. In my present application, I
          have sought to describe and explain only the general and
          typical applications of the principle, which I believe I am
          the first to realize and turn to useful account.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Be it known
          that I, Nikola Tesla, a citizen of the United States, residing
          at New York, in the county and State of New York, have
          invented certain new and useful Improvements in Rotary Engines
          and Turbines, of which the following is a full, clear, and
          exact description. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the
          practical application of mechanical power, based on the use of
          fluid as the vehicle of energy, it has been demonstrated that,
          in order to attain the highest economy, the changes in the
          velocity and direction of movement of the fluid should be as
          gradual as possible. In the forms of apparatus heretofore
          devised or proposed, more or less sudden changes, shocks, and
          vibration are unavoidable. Besides, the employment of the
          usual deices for imparting to, or deriving energy from a
          fluid, such as pistons, paddles, vanes, and blades,
          necessarily introduces numerous defects and limitations and
          adds to the complication, cost of production and maintenance
          of the machines. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The object
          of my invention is to overcome these deficiencies and to
          effect the transmission and transformation of mechanical
          energy through the agency of fluids in a more perfect manner
          and by means simpler and more economical than those heretofore
          employed. I accomplish this by causing the propelling fluid to
          move in natural paths or stream lines of least resistance,
          free from constraint and disturbance such as occasioned by
          vanes or kindred devices, and to change its velocity and
          direction of movement by imperceptible degrees, thus avoiding
          the losses due to sudden variation while the fluid is
          imparting energy. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It is well
          known that a fluid possesses, among others, two salient
          properties, adhesion and viscosity. Owing to these a solid
          body propelled through such a medium encounters a peculiar
          impediment known as "lateral" or skin resistance, which is
          twofold, one arising from the shock of the fluid against the
          asperities of the solid substance, the other from internal
          forces opposing molecular separation. As an inevitable
          consequence a certain amount of the fluid is dragged along by
          the moving body. Conversely, if the body be placed in a fluid
          in motion, for the same reasons, it is impelled in the
          direction of movement. These effects, in themselves, are of
          daily observation, but I believe that I am the first to apply
          them in a practical and economical manner in the propulsion of
          fluids or in their use as motive agents. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In an
          application filed by me October 21st, 1909, Serial Number
          523,832 of which this case is a division, I have illustrated
          the principles underlying my discovery as embodied in
          apparatus designed for the propulsion of fluids. The same
          principles, however, are capable of embodiment also in that
          field of mechanical engineering which is concerned in the use
          of fluids as motive agents, for while in certain respects the
          operations in the latter case are directly opposite to those
          met with in the propulsion of fluids, and the means employed
          may differ in some features, the fundamental laws applicable
          in the two cases are the same. In other words, the operation
          is reversible, for if water or air under pressure be admitted
          to the opening constituting the outlet of a pump or blower as
          described, the runner is set in rotation by reason of the
          peculiar properties of the fluid which, in its movement
          through the device, imparts its energy thereto. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The present
          application, which is a division of that referred to, is
          specially intended to describe and claim my dsicovery above
          set forth, so far as it bears on the use of fluids as motive
          agents, as distinguished from the applications of the same to
          the propulsion or compression of fluids. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the
          drawings, therefore, I have illustrated only the form of
          apparatus designed for the thermo-dynamic conversion of
          energy, a field in which the applications of the principle
          have the greatest practical value. </p>

        </center>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          apparatus comprises a runner composed of a plurality of flat
          rigid disks 13 of suitable diameter, keyed to a shaft 16, and
          held in position thereon by a threaded nut 11, a shoulder 12,
          and intermediate washers 17. The disks have openings 14,
          adjacent to the shaft and spokes 15, which may be
          substantially straight. For the sake of clearness, but a few
          disks, with comparatively wide intervening spaces, are
          illustrated. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The runner
          is mounted in a casing comprising two end castings 19, which
          contain the bearings for the shaft 16, indicated but not shown
          in detail; stuffing boxes 21 and outlets 20. The end castings
          are united by a central ring 22, which is bored out to a
          circle of slightly larger diameter than that of the disks, and
          has flanged extensions 23, and inlets 24, into which finished
          ports or nozzles 25 are inserted. Circular grooves 26 and
          labyrinth packing 27 are provided on the sides of the runner.
          Supply pipes 28, with valves 29, are connected to the flanged
          extensions of the central ring, one of the valves being
          normally closed. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">For a more
          ready and complete understanding of the principle of operation
          it is of advantage to consider first the actions that take
          place when the device is used for the propulsion of fluids for
          which purpose let it be assumed that power is applied to the
          shaft and the runner set in rotation say in a clockwise
          direction. Neglecting, for the moment, those features of
          construction that make for or against the efficiency of the
          device as a pump, as distinguished from a motor, a fluid, by
          reason of its properties of adherence and viscosity, upon
          entering through the inlets 20, and coming in contact with the
          disks 13, is taken hold of by the latter and subjected to two
          forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation,
          and the other radially outward. The combined effect of these
          tangential and centrifugal forces is to propel the fluid with
          continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path until it
          reaches a suitable peripheral outlet from which it is ejected.
          This spiral movement, free and undisturbed and essentially
          dependant on the properties of the fluid, permitting it to
          adjust itself to natural paths or stream lines and to change
          its velocity and direction by insensible degrees, is a
          characteristic and essential feature of this principle of
          operation. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">While
          traversing the chamber inclosing the runner, the particles of
          the fluid may complete one or more turns, or but a part of one
          turn, the path followed being capable of close calculation and
          graphic representation, but fairly accurate estimates of turns
          can be obtained simply by determining the number of
          revolutions required to renew the fluid passing through the
          chamber and multiplying it by the ratio between the mean speed
          of the fluid and that of the disks. I have found that the
          quantity of fluid propelled in this manner is, other
          conditions being equal, approximately proportionate to the
          active surface of the runner and to its effective speed. For
          this reason, the performance of such machines augments at an
          exceedingly high rate with the increase of their size and
          speed of revolution. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          dimensions of the device as a whole, and the spacing of the
          disks in any given machine will be determined by the
          conditions and requirements of special cases. It may be stated
          that the intervening distance should be the greater, the
          larger the diameter of the disks, the longer the spiral path
          of the fluid and the greater its viscosity. In general, the
          spacing should be such that the entire mass of the fluid,
          before leaving the runner, is accelerated to a nearly uniform
          velocity, not much below that of the periphery of the disks
          under normal working conditions, and almost equal to it when
          the outlet is closed and the particles move in concentric
          circles. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Considering
          now the converse of the above described operation and assuming
          that fluid under pressure be allowed to pass through the valve
          at the side of the solid arrow, the runner will be set in
          rotation in a clockwise direction, the fluid traveling in a
          spiral path and with continuously diminishing velocity until
          it reaches the orifices 14 and 20, through which it is
          discharged. If the runner be allowed to turn freely, in nearly
          frictionless bearings, its rim will attain a speed closely
          approximating the maximum of that of the adjacent fluid and
          the spiral path of the particles will be comparatively long,
          consisting of many almost circular turns. If load is put on
          and the runner slowed down, the motion of the fluid is
          retarded, the turns are reduced, and the path is shortened. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Owing to a
          number of causes affecting the performance, it is difficult to
          frame a precise rule which would be generally applicable, but
          it may be stated that within certain limits, and other
          conditions being the same, the torque is directly
          proportionate to the square of the velocity of the fluid
          relatively to the runner, and to the effective area of the
          disks, and inversely, to the distance separating them. The
          machine will, generally, perform its maximum work when the
          effective speed of the runner is one-half that of the fluid;
          but to attain the highest economy, the relative speed or slip,
          for any given performance, should be as small as possible.
          This condition may be to any desired degree approximated by
          increasing the active area of and reducing the space between
          the disks. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">When
          apparatus of the kind described is employed for the
          transmission of power certain departures from similarity
          between transmitter and receiver are necessary for securing
          the best results. It is evident that when transmitting power
          from one shaft to another by such machines, any desired ratio
          between the speeds of rotation may be obtained by a proper
          selection of the diameters of the disks, or by suitably
          staging the transmitter, the receiver, or both. But it may be
          pointed out that in one respect, at least, the two machines
          are essentially different. In the pump, the radial or static
          pressure, due to centrifugal force, is added to the tangential
          or dynamic, thus increasing the effective head and assisting
          in the expulsion of the fluid. In the motor, on the contrary,
          the first named pressure, being opposed to that of supply,
          reduces the effective head and the velocity of radial flow
          toward the center. Again, in the propelled machine a great
          torque is always desirable, this calling for an increased
          number of disks and smaller distance of separation, while in
          the propelling machine, for numerous economic reasons, the
          rotary effort should be the smallest and the speed the
          greatest practicable. Many other considerations, which will
          naturally suggest themselves, may affect the design and
          construction, but the preceding is thought to contain all
          necessary information in this regard. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In order to
          bring out a distinctive feature, assume, in the first place,
          that the motive medium is admitted to the disk chamber through
          a port, that is a channel which it traverses with nearly
          uniform velocity. In this case, the machine will operate as a
          rotary engine, the fluid continuously expanding on its
          tortuous path to the central outlet. The expansion takes place
          chiefly along the spiral path, for the spread inward is
          opposed by the centrifugal force due to the velocity of the
          whirl and by the great resistance to radial exhaust. It is to
          be observed that the resistance to the passage of the fluid
          between the plates is, approximately, proportionate to the
          square of the relative speed, which is maximum in the
          direction toward the center and equal to the full tangential
          velocity of the fluid. The path of least resistance,
          necessarily taken in obedience to a universal law of motion
          is, virtually, also that of least relative velocity. Next,
          assume that the fluid is admitted to the disk chamber not
          through a port, but a diverging nozzle, a device converting
          wholly or in part, the expansive into velocity-energy. The
          machine will then work rather like a turbine, absorbing the
          energy of kinetic momentum of the particles as they whirl,
          with continuously decreasing speed, to the exhaust. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The above
          description of the operation, I may add, is suggested by
          experience and observation, and is advanced merely for the
          purpose of explanation. The undeniable fact is that the
          machine does operate, both expansively and impulsively. When
          the expansion in the nozzles is complete, or nearly so, the
          fluid pressure in the peripheral clearance space is small; as
          the nozzle is made less divergent and its section enlarged,
          the pressure rises, finally approximating that of the supply.
          But the transition from purely impulsive to expansive action
          may not be continuous throughout, on account of critical
          states and conditions and comparatively great variations of
          pressure may be caused by small changes of nozzle velocity. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the
          preceding it has been assumed that the pressure of supply is
          constant or continuous, but it will be understood that the
          operation will be, essentially the same if the pressure be
          fluctuating or intermittent, as that due to explosions
          occurring in more or less rapid succession. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A very
          desirable feature, characteristic of machines constructed and
          operated in accordance with this invention, is their
          capability of reversal of rotation. Fig 1, while illustrative
          of a special case, may be regarded as typical in this respect.
          If the right had valve be shut off and the fluid is rotated in
          the direction of the dotted arrow, the operation, and also the
          performance remaining the same as before, the central ring
          being bored to a circle with this purpose in view. The same
          result may be obtained in many other ways by specially
          designed valves, ports, or nozzles for reversing the flow, in
          the description of which is omitted here in the interest of
          simplicity and clearness. For the same reasons but one
          operative port or nozzle is illustrated which might be adapted
          to a volute but does not fit best a circular bore. It will be
          understood that a number of suitable inlets may be provided
          around the periphery of the runner to improve the action and
          that the construction of the machine may be modified in many
          ways. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Still
          another valuable and probably as unique quality of such motors
          or prime movers may be described. By proper construction and
          observance of working conditions the centrifugal pressure,
          opposing the passage of the fluid, may, as already indicated,
          be made nearly equal to the pressure of supply when the
          machine is running idle. If the inlet section be large, small
          changes in the speed of revolution will produce great
          differences in flow which are further enhanced by the
          concomitant variations in the length of the spiral path. A
          self regulating machine is thus obtained bearing a striking
          resemblance to a direct-current electric motor in this respect
          that, with great differences of impressed pressure in a wide
          open channel the flow of the fluid through the same is
          prevented by virtue of rotation. Since the centrifugal head
          increases as the square of the revolutions, or even more
          rapidly, and with modern high grade steel great peripheral
          velocities are practical, it is possible to attain that
          condition in a single stage machine, more readily if the
          runner be of large diameter. Obviously this problem is
          facilitated by compounding, as will be understood by those
          skilled in the art. Irrespective of its bearing on economy,
          this dependency which is, to a degree, common to motors of the
          above description, is of special advantage in the operation of
          large units, as it affords a safeguard against running away
          and destruction. Besides these, such a prime mover possesses
          many other advantages, both constructive and operative. It is
          simple, light, and compact, subject to but little wear, cheap
          and exceptionally easy to manufacture as small clearances and
          accurate milling work are not essential to good performance.
          In operation it is reliable, there being no valves, sliding
          contacts or troublesome varies. It is almost free of windage,
          largely independent of nozzle efficiency and suitable for high
          as well as for low fluid velocities and speeds of revolution.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It will be
          understood that the principles of construction and operation
          above generally set forth, are capable of embodiment in
          machines of the most widely different forms, and adapted for
          the greatest variety of purposes. In my present specification
          I have sought to describe and explain only the general and
          typical applications of the principle which I believe I am the
          first to realize and turn to useful account. </p>

        </center>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Be it known
          that I, Nikola Tesla, have invented certain new and useful
          Improvements in Valvular Conduits, of which the following is a
          full, clear and exact description. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In most of
          the machinery universally employed for the development,
          transmission and transformation of mechanical energy, fluid
          impulses are made to pass, more or less freely, through
          suitable channels or conduits in one direction while their
          return is effectively checked or entirely prevented. This
          function is generally performed by devices designated as
          valves, comprising carefully fitted members the precise
          relative movements of which are essential to the efficient and
          reliable operation of the apparatus. The necessity of, and
          absolute dependence on these, limits the machine in many
          respects, detracting from its practical value and adding
          greatly to the cost of manufacture and maintenance. As a rule
          the valve is a delicate contrivance, very liable to wear and
          get out of order and thereby imperil ponderous, complex and
          costly mechanisms and, moreover, it fails to meet the
          requirements when the impulses are extremely sudden or rapid
          in succession and the fluid is highly heated or corrosive. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Though these
          and other correlated facts were known to the very earliest
          pioneers in the science and art of mechanics, no remedy has as
          yet been found or proposed to date so far as I am aware and I
          believe that I am the first to discover or invent any means,
          which permit the performance of the above function without the
          use of moving parts, and which permit the performance of the
          above function without the use of moving parts, and which it
          is the object of this application to describe. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Briefly
          expressed, the advance I have achieved consists in the
          employment of a peculiar channel or conduit characterized by
          valvular action. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          invention can be embodied in many constructions greatly varied
          in detail, but for the explanation of the underlying principle
          it may be broadly stated that the interior of the conduit is
          provided with enlargements, recesses, projections, baffles or
          buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance to the
          passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface
          friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow
          in the opposite sense by reason of the more or less sudden
          expansions, contractions, deflections, reversals of direction,
          stops and starts and attendant rapidly succeeding
          transformations of the pressure and velocity energies. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">For the full
          and complete disclosure of the device and of its mode of
          action reference is made to the accompanying drawings in
          which: -- </p>

        </center>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Referring to
          Figure 1, 1 is a casing of metal or other suitable material
          which may be cast, milled or pressed from sheet in the desired
          form. From its side walls extend alternatively projections
          terminating in buckets 2 which, to facilitate manufacture are
          congruent and spaced at equal distances, but need not be. In
          addition to these there are independent partitions 3 which are
          deemed of advantage and the purpose of which will be made
          clear. Nipples 4 and 5, one at each end, are provided for pipe
          connection. The bottom is solid and the upper or open side is
          closed by a fitting plate 6 as shown in Figure 2. When desired
          any number of such pieces may be joined in series, thus making
          up a valvular conduit of such length as the circumstances may
          require. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In
          elucidation of the mode of operation let it be assumed that
          the medium under pressure be admitted at 5. Evidently, its
          approximate path will be as indicated by the dotted line 7,
          which is nearly straight, that is to say, if the channel be of
          adequate cross-section, the fluid will encounter a very small
          resistance and pass through freely and undisturbed, at least
          to a degree. Not so if the entrance be at the opposite end 4.
          In this case the flow will not be smooth and continuous, but
          intermittent, the fluid being quickly deflected and reversed
          in direction, set in swirling motion, brought to rest and
          again accelerated, these processes following one another in
          rapid succession. The partitions 3 serve to direct the stream
          upon the buckets and to intensify the actions causing violent
          surges and eddies which interfere very materially with the
          flow through the conduit. It will be readily observed that the
          resistance offered to the passage of the medium will be
          considerable even if it be under constant pressure, but the
          impediments will be of full effect only when it is supplied in
          pulses and, more especially, when the same are extremely
          sudden and of high frequency. In order to bring the fluid
          masses to rest and to high velocity in short intervals of time
          energy must be furnished at a rate which is unattainable, the
          result being that the impulse cannot penetrate very far before
          it subsides and gives rise to movement in the opposite
          direction. The device not only acts as a hinderment to the
          bodily return of particles but also, in a measure, as a check
          to the propagation of a disturbance through the medium. Its
          efficacy is chiefly determined; first, by the magnitude of the
          ratio of the two resistances offered to disturbed and
          undisturbed flow, respectively, in the directions from 4 to 5
          and from 5 to 4, in each individual element of the conduit;
          second, by the number of complete cycles of action taking
          place in a given length of the valvular channel and third, by
          the character of the impulses themselves. A fair idea may be
          gained from simple theoretical considerations. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Examining
          more closely the mode of operation it will be seen that, in
          passing from one to the next bucket, in the direction of
          disturbed flow, the fluid undergoes two complete reversals or
          deflections through 180° while it suffers only two small
          deviation from about 10° to 20° when moving in the opposite
          sense. In each case the loss of head will be proportionate to
          a hydraulic coefficient dependent on the angle of deflection
          from which it follows that, for the same velocity, the ratio
          of the two resistances will be as that of the two
          coefficients. The theoretical value of this ratio may be 200
          or more, but it must be taken as appreciable less although
          surface friction too is greater in the direction of disturbed
          flow. In order to keep it as large as possible, sharp bends
          should be avoided, for these will add to both resistance and
          reduce the efficiency. Whenever practicable, the piece should
          be straight; the next best is the circular form. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">That the
          peculiar function of such a conduit is enhanced by increasing
          the number of bucket or elements and, consequently, cyclic
          processes in a given length is an obvious conclusion, but
          there is no direct proportionality, because the successive
          actions diminish in intensity. Definite limits, however, are
          set constructively and otherwise to the number of elements per
          unit length of the channel, and the most economical design can
          only be evolved through long experience. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Quite apart
          from any mechanical features of the device the character of
          the impulses has a decided influence on its performance and
          the best results will be secured, when there are produced at
          4, sudden variations of pressure in relatively long intervals,
          while a constant pressure is maintained at 5. Such is the case
          in one of its most valuable industrial applications which will
          be specifically described. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In order to
          conduce to a better understanding, reference may first be made
          to Figure 3 which illustrates another special use and in which
          8 is a piston fixed to a shaft 9 and fitting freely in a
          cylinder 10. The latter is closed at both ends by flanged
          heads 11 and 12 having sleeves or stuffing boxes 13 and 14 for
          the shaft. Connection between the two compartments, 15 and 16,
          of the cylinder is established through a valvular conduit and
          each of the heads is similarly equipped. For the sake of
          simplicity these devices are diagrammatically shown, the solid
          arrows indicating the direction of undisturbed flow. An
          extension of the shaft 9 carries a second piston 17 accurately
          ground to and sliding easily in a cylinder 18 closed at the
          ends by plates and sleeves as usual. Both piston and cylinder
          are provided with inlet and outlet ports marked, respectively,
          19 and 20. This arrangement is familiar, being representative
          of a prime mover of my invention, termed "mechanical
          oscillator", with which it is practicable to vibrate a system
          of considerable weight many thousand times per minute. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Suppose now
          that such rapid oscillations are imparted by this or other
          means to the piston 8. Bearing in mind the preceeding, the
          operation of the apparatus will be understood at a glance.
          While moving in the direction of the solid arrow, from 12 to
          11, the piston 8 will compress the air or other medium in the
          compartment 16 and expel it from the same, respectively, as
          closed and open valves. During the movement of the piston in
          the opposite direction, from 11 to12, the medium which has
          meanwhile filled the chamber 15 will be transferred to
          compartment 16, egress being prevented by the device in head
          12 and that in the piston allowing free passage. These
          processes will be repeated in very quick succession. If the
          nipples 4 and 5 are put in communication with independent
          reservoirs, the oscillations of the piston 8 will result in a
          compression of air at 4 and rarefaction of the same at 5.
          Obviously, the Valvular channels being turned the other way,
          as indicated by dotted lines in the lower part of the figure,
          the opposite will take place. The devices in the piston have
          been shown merely by way of suggestion and can be dispensed
          with. Each of the chambers 15 and 16 being connected to two
          conduits as illustrated, the vibrations of a solid piston as 8
          will have the same effect and the machine will then be a
          double acting pump or compressor. It is likewise unessential
          that the medium be admitted to the cylinder through such
          devices for in certain instances ports, alternately closed and
          opened by the piston, may serve the purpose. As a matter of
          course, this novel method of propelling fluids can be extended
          to multistage working in which case a number of pistons will
          be employed, preferably on the same shaft and of different
          diameters in conformity with well established principles of
          mechanical design. In this way any desired ratio of
          compression or degree of rarefaction may be attained. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Figure 4
          exemplifies a particularly valuable application of the
          invention to which reference has been made above. The drawing
          shows in vertical cross section a turbine which may be of any
          type but is in this instance one invented and described by me
          and supposed to be familiar to engineers. Suffice it to state
          that the rotor 21 of the same is composed of flat plates which
          are set in motion through the adhesive and viscous action of
          the working fluid, entering the system tangentially at the
          periphery and leaving it at the center. Such a machine is a
          thermodynamic transformer of an activity surpassing by far
          that of any other prime mover, it being demonstrated in
          practice that each single disk of the rotor is capable of
          performing as much work as a whole bucketwheel. Besides, a
          number of other advantages, equally important, make it
          especially adapted for operation as an internal combustion
          motor. This may be done in many ways, but the simplest and
          most direct plan of which I am aware is the one illustrated
          here. Referring again to the drawing, the upper part of the
          turbine casing 22 has bolted to it a separate casing 23, the
          central cavity 24 of which forms the combustion chamber. To
          prevent injusry through excessive heating a jacket 25 may be
          used, or else water injected, and when these means are
          objectionable recourse may be had to air cooling, this all the
          more rapidly as very high temperatures are practicable. The
          top of casting 23 is closed by a plate 20 with a sparking or
          hot wire plug 27 and in its sides are screwed two Valvular
          conduits communicating with the central chamber 24. One of
          these is, normally, open to the atmosphere while the other
          connects to a source of fuel supply as a gas main 28. The
          bottom of the combustion chamber terminates in a suitable
          nozzle 29 which consists of separate pieces of heat resisting
          material. To regulate the influx of the explosion constituents
          and secure the proper mixture of air and gas conduits are
          equipped, respectively, with valves 30and 31. The exhaust
          openings 82 of the rotor should be in communication with a
          ventilator, preferably carried on the same shaft and of any
          suitable construction. Its use, however, while advantageous,
          is not indispensable, the suction produced by the turbine
          rotor itself being, in some cases at least, sufficient to
          insure proper working. This detail is omitted from the drawing
          as unessential to the understanding. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">But a few
          words will be needed to make clear the mode of operation. The
          air valve 30 being open, and sparking established across
          terminals 27, the gas is turned on slowly until the mixture in
          the chamber 24 reaches the critical state and is ignited. Both
          the conduits behaving, with respect to efflux, as closed
          valves, the products of combustion rush out through the nozzle
          29 acquiring still greater velocity by expansion and,
          imparting their momentum to the rotor 21, start it from rest.
          Upon the subsidence of the explosion the pressure in the
          chamber sinks below the atmospheric owing to the pumping
          action of the rotor or ventilator and new air and gas is
          permitted to enter, cleaning the cavity and channels and
          making up a fresh mixture which is detonated as before, and so
          on, the successive impulses of the working fluid producing an
          almost continuous rotary effort. After a short lapse of time
          the chamber becomes heated to such a degree that the ignition
          device may be shut off without disturbing the established
          regime. This manner of starting the turbine involves the
          employment of an unduly large combustion chamber which is not
          commendable from the economic point of view, for not only does
          it entail increased heat losses but the explosions cannot be
          made to follow one another with such rapidity as would be
          desirable to insure the best Valvular action. When the chamber
          is small an auxiliary means for starting, as compressed air,
          may be resorted to and a very quick succession of explosions
          can then be obtained. The frequency will be the greater the
          stronger the suction, and may, under certain circumstances,
          reach hundreds and even thousands per second. It scarcely need
          be stated that instead of one several explosion chambers may
          be used for cooling purposes and also to increase the number
          of active impulses and the output of the machine. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Apparatus as
          illustrated in Figure 4 presents the advantage of extreme
          simplicity, cheapness and reliability, there being no
          compressor, buckets or troublesome valve mechanism. It also
          permits, with the addition of certain well-known accessories,
          the use of any king of fuel and thus meets the pressing
          necessity of a self-contained, powerful, light and compact
          internal combustion motor for general work. When the
          attainment of the highest efficiency is the chief object, as
          in machines of large size, the explosive constituents will be
          supplied under high pressure and provision made of maintaining
          a vacuum at the exhaust. Such arrangements are quite familiar
          and lend themselves so easily to this improvement that an
          enlargement on this subject is deemed unnecessary. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
          foregoing description will readily suggest to experts
          modifications, both as regards construction and application of
          the device and I do not wish to limit myself in these
          respects. The broad underlying idea of the invention is to
          permit the free passage of a fluid through a channel in the
          direction of the flow and to prevent its return through
          friction and mass resistance, thus enabling the performance of
          valve functions without any moving parts and thereby extending
          the scope and usefulness of an immense variety of mechanical
          appliances. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">I do not
          claim the methods of and apparatus for the propulsion of
          fluids and thermodynamic transformation of energy herein
          disclosed, as these will be made subjects of separate
          applications. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">I am aware
          that asymmetrical conduits have been constructed and their use
          proposed in connection with engines, but these have no
          similarity wither in their construction or manner of
          employment with my Valvular conduit. They were incapable of
          acting as valves proper, for the liquid was merely arrested in
          pockets and deflected through 90°, this result having at best
          only 25% of the efficiency attained in the construction herein
          described. In the conduit I have designed the fluid, as stated
          above, is deflected in each cycle through 360°, and a
          coefficient approximating 200 can be obtained so that the
          device acts a s a slightly leaking valve, and for that reason
          the term "Valvular" has been given to it in contrast to
          asymmetrical conduits, as heretofore proposed, which are not
          Valvular in action, but merely asymmetrical as to resistance.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Furthermore,
          the conduits heretofore constructed were intended to be used
          in connection with slowly reciprocating machines, in which
          case enormous conduit-length would be necessary, all this
          rendering them devoid of practical value. By the use of an
          effective Valvular conduit, as herein described, and the
          employment of pulses of very high frequency, I am able to
          condense my apparatus and secure such perfect action as to
          dispense successfully with valves in numerous forms of
          reciprocating and rotary engines. </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The high
          efficiency of the device, irrespective of the character of the
          pulses, is due to two causes: first, rapid reversal of
          direction of flow and, second, great relative velocity of the
          colliding fluid columns, As will be readily seen each bucket
          causes a deviation through an angle of 180°, and another
          change of 180 degrees occurs in each of the spaces between
          adjacent buckets. That is to say, from the time the fluid
          enters or leaves on of the recesses to its passage into, or
          exit from, the one following a complete cycle, or deflection
          through 360° is effected. Observe now that the velocity is but
          slightly reduced in the reversal so that the incoming and
          deflected fluid columns meet with a relative speed, twice that
          of the flow, and the energy of their impact is four times
          greater than with a deflection of only 90° , as might be
          obtained with pockets such as have been employed in
          asymmetrical conduits for various purposes. The fact is,
          however, that in these such deflection is not secured, the
          pockets remaining filled with comparatively quiescent fluid
          and the latter following a winding path of least resistance
          between the obstacles interposed. In such conduits the action
          cannot be characterized as Valvular because some of the fluid
          can pass almost unimpeded in a direction opposite to the
          normal flow. In my construction, as above indicated, the
          resistance in the reverse may be 200 times that in the normal
          direction. Owing to this a comparatively very small number of
          buckets or elements is required for checking the fluid. To
          give a concrete idea, suppose that the leak from the first
          element is represented by the fraction 1/X, then after the <i>n</i>th






          bucket is traversed, only a quantity (1/X)<sup>n</sup> will
          escape and it is evident that X need not be a large number to
          secure a nearly perfect Valvular action. </p>

          is: -- [Claims not included here]</p>
