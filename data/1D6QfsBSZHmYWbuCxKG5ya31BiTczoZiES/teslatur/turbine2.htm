      <p>I, Nikola Tesla, Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, citizen of
        United States of America, of No. 8, West 40th Street, New York,
        NY, USA, do hereby declare the nature of this invention and in
        what manner the same is to be performed, to be particularly
        described and ascertained in and by the following statement: </p>
      <p>In the development of power by thermodynamic prime movers, as
        steam engines and turbines, a low back pressure is essential to
        good economy, the performance of the machine being increased
        from fifty to one hundred per cent, by reducing the absolute
        pressure in the exhaust space from fifteen to about one pound
        per square inch. Turbines are particularly susceptible to such
        improvement and in their use for operation of power plants and
        manufacturing establishments the attainment and steady
        maintenance of high vacua has assumed great importance, every
        effort being made to better the conditions in this respect. The
        gain effected by this means is, in a large measure, dependent on
        the initial pressure, characteristics of the prime mover,
        temperature of the cooling medium, cost of the condensing
        apparatus and many other things which are all well-known to five
        to six per cent of fuel for each addition inch of vacuum is
        often closely approximated in modern installations, but the
        economic advantages are appreciably lessened when higher vacua
        are applied to existing machines purposely designed to operate
        with lower ones. More especially is this true of a turbine in
        which the reduction of back pressure merely increase the
        velocity of exit of the vapors without materially augmenting the
        speed of their impact against the vanes, buckets, or equivalent
        organs, when the loss of kinetic energy in the exhaust may
        offset a considerable portion of the useful work. In such cases
        some constructional changes in the turbine and auxiliaries may
        have to be made in order to secure the results here contemplated
        but the additional capital used for this purpose will be
        profitably invested. Summing up the situation it may be
        generally stated that a more or less substantial reduction of
        fuel cost can be made in most of the existing power plants by
        the adoption of proper pumping apparatus and establishment of
        working conditions nearly corresponding to those of an ideal
        condenser. </p>
      <p>The chief difficulties which have thus far retard advancement
        in this direction are encountered in the enormous volumes of the
        air and vapor at very low pressure as well as unavoidable leaks
        in the condenser, pipe joints, valves, glands and stuffing
        boxes. At present exhaustion is usually accomplished by
        reciprocating pumps and these, on account of the necessarily low
        speed of the pistons are large and, moreover, incapable of
        satisfactory performance in the presence of big leaks. As a
        direct result of this the condensing plant is both bulky and
        expensive and, worse still, its size and cost increase entirely
        in disproportion to the results attained. To illustrate -- the
        outlay involved in the installment of condensing apparatus for a
        twenty-eight inch vacuum is more than double that required for a
        vacuum of twenty-six inches and these draw-backs are still more
        emphasize with the further reduction of the back pressure.
        Rotary pumps and jets of water and steam are also used in the
        production of vacua, but without marked qualitative advantages.
      </p>
      <p>I have achieved better success in departing from the customary
        method of removing the air and entrained steam from the
        condenser by bodily carriers as jets, reciprocating pistons or
        rotating vanes, and availing myself of the properties of
        adhesion and viscosity which, according to experimental evidence
        are retained by the gases and vapors even at very high degrees
        of attenuation. This new process is rendered practicable through
        a pump, the underlying principle of which is fully explained in
        my British Patent 24,001 of 1910, but which is modified as
        hereinafter described and when run at the very great peripheral
        speed of which an unloaded system is capable, exhibits two
        remarkable and valuable properties. One of these is to expel the
        rarefied fluids at such an immense rate that a hole of some size
        can be drilled in the condenser without much effect on the
        vacuum gauge. The other is to draw out the fluids until the
        exhaustion is almost complete. A machine of this kind,
        constructed in stages, is alone sufficient for the production of
        extremely high vacua and I believe this quality to be very
        valuable inasmuch as it is not possessed to such a degree by
        other types of commercial pumps, which have come to my
        knowledge. I have also found that inserting my pump between the
        condenser and a "dry air" or other pump produces a very
        effective combination. This combination is especially
        advantageous from the practical point of view as good results
        can be secured with a single stage and the installment of my
        device calls for but a slight change in the steam plant. The
        benefits derived are twofold; a higher vacuum is attained and,
        what is perhaps more important, the frequent and unavoidable
        impairments of the same, which seriously affect the economy, are
        virtually eliminated. My pump makes possible the maintenance of
        high vacua even when the percentage of air or other fluids
        carried with the steam is very great and on this account should
        prove particularly useful in the operation of mixed fluid
        turbines. </p>
      <p>My invention will be more fully understood by reference to the
        accompanying drawing in which <b>Figure 1</b> shows a
        multi-stage pump of this kind in sectional views, and </p>

        double-acting reciprocating pump. </p>

        <p><img src="vacuum2.jpg" height="299" width="560"></p>
      </center>
      In the first figure, 1, 2, etc., are rotors each of which, as 1,
      comprises a number of relatively thin disks 3,3, etc., separated
      by star-washers 4,4, etc., and held together by rigid endplates 5
      and 6 on a sleeve 7 which is fitted and keyed to a shaft 8,
      rotatably supported in bearings 9,9. The rotors are contained in
      separate chambers of a common structure 10, which surrounds them
      and is made up of parts held together by flange connections.
      Beginning with the fist stage at 1, the rotors diminish in width,
      each following being made narrower than the preceding, for obvious
      economic reasons. All the thin discs, as 3,3, etc., and left-hand
      endplates, as 5, are provided with the usual central openings, but
      the right-hand end plates, as 6, are blank. The individual
      chambers, containing the rotors, communicate with each other
      through channels, as 11, extending from the peripheral region of
      one to the central part of the next, so that the fluids aspired at
      the intakes 12, 12 are compelled to pass through whole series of
      rotors and are finally ejected at the flanged opening 13 of the
      last chamber. In order to reduce leakage along the shaft,
      close-fitting joints or locks, as 14, are employed which may be of
      ordinary construction and need not be dwelled upon specifically.
      The number of stages will depend on the peripheral velocity and
      the degree of exhaustion, which it is desired to secure, and in
      extreme cases a number of separate structures, with intermediate
      bearings for the shaft, may have to be provided.&nbsp; When found
      preferable the pump may be of the double-flow type, when there
      will be no appreciable side thrust, otherwise provision for taking
      it up should be made.
      <p>The modifications in details of construction, to which
        reference has been made, consist in the employment of smaller
        spaces between the discs than has hitherto been the case, and of
        close side-clearances. To give a practical example, I may state
        that spaces of 3/64 of an inch will be effective in the
        production of very high vacua with discs of, say, 24 inches in
        diameter. I also make all discs tapering, when necessary, in
        order to operate safely at an extremely high peripheral velocity
        which is very desirable since it reflects both on the size of
        the machine and its effectiveness. </p>
      <p>The arrangement represented diagrammatically in Fig. 2 is
        especially suitable and advantageous in connection with existing
        steam plants operating with high vacuum and permits the carrying
        out of my improvements in a simple manner and at comparatively
        small cost. In this case my pump, which may have but one rotor
        of the above description, is connected with its intake 12,
        through a pipe 15, to the top of a condenser 16, and with its
        discharge opening 13, by pipe 17, to the suction duct of a
        reciprocating dry air pump 18. It goes without saying that in
        actual practice connections 15 and 17 will be short mains of
        very large section as the volume of fluids to be pumped may be
        enormous. </p>
      <p>The operation will be readily understood from the foregoing.
        The intakes 12 being joined by an air-tight connection to the
        vessel to be exhausted and the system of discs run at very high
        peripheral velocity the fluids, by reason of their properties of
        viscosity and adhesion, are drawn out of the vessel until the
        degree of rarefaction is attained for which the apparatus has
        been designed. In their passage through the series of rotors the
        fluids are compressed by stages and ejected through the opening
        13 at a volume greatly reduced. The vacuum produced by this
        means may be extremely high because of the apparently unique
        properties of the device pointed out before and as the fluids,
        irrespective of their density, are sucked out at an excessive
        speed, leaks through the glands, stuffing boxes and connections
        are of but slight effect. </p>
      <p>In the arrangement shown in Fig. 2 my pump serves to evacuate
        the condenser much more effectively and by compressing the
        fluids at the intake of the reciprocating pump improves the
        performance of the same. The installment of the devise in
        existing plants does not call for extensive alterations in the
        same and will result in a notable saving of fuel. My pump may
        also be advantageously employed in place of a steam jet in
        conjunction with a small condenser in which case it will be of
        insignificant dimensions and economical in steam consumption. </p>

      <p>I, Nikola Tesla, Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, citizen of
        the United States of America, of 8, West 40th Street, New York
        City, U.S.A., do hereby declare the nature of this invention to
        be as follows: </p>
      <p>In a British Patent, Number 24,001 of 1910, I have described a
        bladeless turbine having a rotor consisting of discs with
        openings in the central portions and separating star-washers,
        these parts when assembled being riveted together into a single,
        solid structure and keyed to the shaft. </p>
      <p>This form of rotor operates satisfactorily but in long
        experience certain improvements in its construction have been
        found desirable and these constitute my present invention. </p>
      <p>In the new design I employ two heavier end-plates, which are
        machined tapering toward the periphery for the purpose of
        reducing the maximum centrifugal stress as much as practicable.
      </p>
      <p>The inside discs, of relatively thin material, are rolled,
        forged or ground tapering in like manner and with the same
        object in view, but this may not always be necessary and plates,
        made of sheet metal of substantially uniform thickness as
        furnished by the mills, can be employed. Each of the thick as
        well as thin plates is provided with exhaust openings, leaving a
        solid central portion like the hub and spokes of a wheel.
        Star-washers of similar configuration serve the purpose of
        keeping the discs apart in the center and for the peripheral
        spacing the thin plates have small holes drilled in them on a
        circle, or circles, of suitable diameter, and in these are
        driven tight-fitting studs which are upset at both ends by a
        special tool so that they will project beyond the metal on each
        side a trifle more than the thickness of the star-washers. When
        the plates are put together the separating studs do not come in
        line but are straddled in order to give opportunity for slight
        yielding, thereby eliminating constructional difficulties which
        might be caused by unevenness or other mechanical imperfections.
        Thus the rotor can be finished closely to predetermined overall
        dimensions and will run true on the outside even if the thin
        inside plates should vary a little in thickness or be slightly
        warped. To simplify this arrangement I provide only every second
        plate with studs, using plain ones between. Furthermore, with
        the object of cheapening the manufacture I dispense altogether
        with the former, accomplishing the spacing by means of small
        bosses or protuberances which are raised in the plates by blows
        or pressure and provide a die, practically reducing all the
        machine work on a thin plate to a single operation in a stamping
        press. The star-washers, while preferable, are not indispensable
        and may be replaced by round separating washers of a diameter
        about equal to that of the hub part of the discs. </p>
      <p>All the plates and washers are fitted on and keyed to a sleeve
        threaded at the ends and equipped with nuts and collars for
        drawing the thick end-plates together or, if desired, the
        collars may by simply forced onto it and the ends upset. The
        sleeve has a hole fitting snugly on the shaft and is fastened to
        the same as usual. </p>
      <p>This construction permits free expansion and contraction of
        each plate individually under the varying influence of heat and
        centrifugal force and possesses a number of other advantages
        which are of considerable practical moment. A larger active
        plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given
        width, this improving efficiency. Warping is virtually
        eliminated and smaller side clearances may be used which results
        in diminished leakage and friction losses. The rotor is better
        adapted for dynamic balancing and through rubbing friction
        resists disturbing influences thereby insuring quieter running.
        For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly
        joined it is safer against damage which might otherwise be
        caused by vibration or excessive speed. </p>

      <p>I, Nikola Tesla, Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, citizen of
        the United States of America, of No. 8, West 40th Street, New
        York, N.Y., U.S.A.; do hereby declare the nature of this
        invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, to be
        particularly described and ascertained in and by the following
        statement: </p>
      <p>The chief object of my improvements is to increase the
        efficiency of existing steam power plants and thermodynamic
        transformers operated therefrom, but they may also be applied
        with like effect apart from the present establishments and are
        intended for the broad purpose of producing motive power, more
        economically, through the medium of steam mixed with the heated
        products of combustion, while the apparatus is capable of
        actuation by steam alone. It is well known that notwithstanding
        the multiplication of hydro-electric and gas engine
        installations, most of the motive power is still derived from
        this agent, but only a relatively low fuel efficiency is secured
        owing to limitations inherent to the thermal process itself, as
        now carried out, and certain shortcomings of the present form of
        apparatus. These drawbacks have been largely overcome in the
        method I have devised, which is very economical, readily
        applicable to the plants now in operation without substantial
        modifications in them, and is rendered particularly advantageous
        through the instrumentality of a turbine or rotary engine
        described in my British Patent No. 24,001 of 1910 and
        improvements I have made in its construction since that time.
        This machine is capable of operating satisfactorily at very high
        temperature, with cheap fuel containing a large percentage of
        impurities, and without material impairment of efficiency as
        might be due to oxidation, roughening of the metal surfaces or
        similar deteriorating actions which seriously interfere with the
        working of other heat engines. </p>
      <p>In applying my invention to a steam power plant I use air,
        under a pressure about equal to that of the boiler, for burning
        gas, crude oil, colloidal fuel or powdered coal in a chamber or
        conduit, the products of combustion escaping from the same
        mixing with the steam on their way to the turbine being thus
        diluted and cooled to the desired temperature. The provisions to
        this end will greatly vary according to conditions. In central
        stations, factories, on shipboard and in many other places
        compressed air, as well as steam, is available and often, too,
        all the facilities for fuel storage and supply may be on hand.
        In such cases the benefits of my improvements will be readily
        derived with but little additional apparatus and at small cost.
        If the circumstances require, I provide an air and sometimes
        also a gas-compressor driven either directly from the shaft of
        the primemover or independently by electricity, steam or other
        motive agent. Generally these machines will be of the more
        efficient reciprocating kind, but rotary compressors or
        composite types may be employed to secure some advantage.
        Irrespective of specific arrangement, I effect the combustion
        and mixing while the fluids are in rapid motion in a conduit
        which is, preferably, in closed proximity to the turbine, thus
        disposing of most of the abovementioned difficulties previously
        encountered and at the same time considerably reducing the
        radiation and conduction losses which would be incurred in the
        passage through long pipes. To better insure the maintenance of
        standard working conditions, I may add to the equipment a device
        of the usual construction for equalizing the steam and air
        pressures. The quantity of steam is so regulated that the highly
        heated mixture, upon expansion through the nozzle, enters the
        turbine at a temperature which the machine can safely withstand.
        The elastic fluids, after traversing the rotor and giving up to
        the same a part of their kinetic energy, escape through the
        exhaust openings and may serve the further purpose of preheating
        the feedwater, fuel, and likewise the air when desired. If
        intensely preheated, the air and fuel will be conveyed to the
        combustion chamber or conduit separately, but in small
        installations it may be convenient to feed the fuel into the
        compressor or the air pipe thus bringing about a thorough
        mixture of the combustibles. When simplicity is of paramount
        importance, heaters may be resorted to for improving the
        economy, but in order to attain a still higher thermal
        efficiency I provide a boiler through which the working fluids,
        exhausted from the turbine, are circulated. The steam thus
        obtained from waste heat is fed through a suitable valve, into
        an inlet pipe whence it passes either separately or together
        with the mixed working fluid through the nozzle, first doing
        useful work and then adding to the waste heat of the exhaust.
        More fuel may now be gradually admitted to maintain in the inlet
        pipe the normal temperature, thus again increasing the heat in
        the exhaust and causing a more rapid generation of the steam,
        and so on, until finally a steady regime is established.
        However, if deemed of advantage under given operative
        conditions, the steam furnished by the plant may be reduced in
        quantity in approximately the same measure as that from the
        boiler is supplied. </p>
      <p>My invention will be more fully understood by reference to the
        accompanying drawings in which <b>Figure 1</b>, illustrates the
        general arrangement of the apparatus comprising the turbine, a
        compressor, a storage tank for the fuel, a boiler and the
        necessary pipe connections and controlling devices, and Figure 2
        a vertical cross-section of the main valve for admission of the
        steam and regulation of its flow. </p>

      <p>In the first named figure, 1 represents my turbine with its
        shaft flexibly coupled to a machine performing useful work, as
        dynamo 2. The general construction of the turbine is preferably
        as described in my British Patent No. 24,001 of 1910, two
        nozzles being provided, which are intended to operate in the
        same direction. The nozzles are contained in two diametrically
        opposite enlargements of the casing and communicate with inlet
        pipes 3 and 4 which are joined, through suitable valves 5 and 6,
        to the main steam admission and control valve 7, shown in
        section <b>Figure 2</b> and to be described in detail. </p>
      <p>The air compressor can be of any kind but is shown of the
        reciprocating high speed type, driven by an electric motor 8,
        and comprising two stages 9 and 10, with an intercooler 11. A
        pipe 12 carrying valve 13, connects the discharge duct of the
        compressor to flanged conduits 14 and 15 which are bolted to the
        inlet pipes 3 and 4 as indicated and equipped with means for
        ignition, as spark plugs 16 and 17. An extension 18 of pipe 12
        leads through a valve 19, to the top of the fuel tank 20 and
        serves the purpose of maintaining in the latter the required
        pressure. When the employment of an air reservoir is deemed
        preferable extension 18 will be put in communication with the
        same through valve 21. A filling pipe 22, armed with valve 23,
        is attached to the top of tank 20 while near to its bottom is
        joined a discharge pipe 24 provided with valve 25 leading
        through a needle valve 26 to an automatic control valve 27 which
        is connected by pipes 28 and 29 to the flanged conduits 14 and
        15. </p>
      <p>The main valve 7 is designed for control of the steam flow both
        by automatic means and independently of the same. Its
        construction is clearly indicated in Figure 2, representing a
        vertical cross-section. The device consists of a casting 30 with
        inlet ports 31 and outlets 32 and 33, which are joined by
        flanges to pipes 3 and 4. The open bottom of the casting is
        connected to a steam inlet pipe 34 while the top carries a
        throttle valve 35 for turning on and shutting off the steam.
        Below the seat of this valve the casting has a transversal bore,
        into which is freely fitted a hollow cylinder 36 with balanced
        intake and exhaust openings, the latter registering with outlets
        32 and 33 in the casting. The cylinder 36 is rigidly joined
        through a rod 37 with a hollow plunger 38 (Fig. 1) having
        diametrically opposite ports matching those in the stationary
        part of valve 27. </p>
      <p>The boiler 39, which may be of the vertical tubular type as
        illustrated, is connected through its headers 40 and 41 on the
        lower end to main 42 communicating with the exhaust opening 43
        of the turbine, and on the upper one to discharge conduit 44
        through which the hot fluids, after traversing the boiler tubes,
        escape into the atmosphere or are led to an economizer for
        preheating the feed-water or otherwise utilizing the waste heat.
        A conduit 45 joins the top of the boiler to inlet pipe 3 through
        a suitable valve 46 which may be operated either by hand or
        automatically. From the foregoing the operation will now be
        readily understood. At the start valve 46 being closed and 5 and
        6 open, steam from the plant is admitted through throttle and
        control valve 7 whence it passes into the inlet pipes 3 and 4
        and communicating nozzles from which it issues at high velocity
        setting the rotor in motion, the machine operating purely as a
        steam turbine. The spark plugs 16 and 17 are then brought into
        play and valves 13, 19 and 25 opened, the latter allowing the
        fuel to flow from the tank, chiefly under the action of gravity,
        to needle valve 26 which is gradually turned on. The fuel
        thereupon passes through the ports of hollow plunger 38 and
        pipes 28 and 29 into apparatus for mixing and combustion, the
        construction of which is clearly shown in the cross-section at
        the lower branch, it being understood that the arrangement on
        the upper branch is identical. As will be seen the conduit 15 is
        armed on one end with a spraying device and on the other with a
        funnel-shaped extension which is held tight between flanges and
        projects far into the steam inlet pipe 4. The fuel, atomized by
        the inrushing air, enters the combustion chamber formed by an
        enlargement in conduit 15, and is then ignited in the same, the
        products of combustion escaping into the inlet pipe 4 and mixing
        with the steam on their way to the nozzle. This kind of
        apparatus overcomes the difficulty heretofore encountered in
        attempts to effect combustion practically and will work
        satisfactorily even if there are considerable fluctuations in
        the steam and air pressures, as the faster moving fluid
        aspirates the slower one. It has been assumed that liquid fuel
        is used but powdered coal may also be employed in substantially
        the same manner with slight constructive modifications, the
        powder being conveyed to the combustion chamber either
        independently of, or with, the air. The quantity of the
        combustibles is so regulated by manipulation of valves 13 and 26
        (and also 5, 6 and throttle 7; if suitable) that the mixture,
        escaping from the nozzles, will be at a temperature considered
        safe for the operation of the turbine. To facilitate this any of
        the well known compound valves may be provided for the purpose
        of admitting the combustibles always in the required proportions
        irrespective of their total quantity. </p>
      <p>When the steam in boiler 39, raised by the exhaust mixture
        passing through the tubes, attains the required pressure, it is
        admitted through valve 46, conduit 3 and corresponding nozzle,
        to the rotor, adding kinetic energy to the same. Feed-water,
        preferable heated by the turbine exhaust, is supplied to the
        boiler in the same measure as steam is drawn off, any ordinary
        means to this end being employed. The automatic control of the
        flow of steam and fuel may be effected by any kind of speed
        governor operatively connected to rod 37 so that the supply is
        reduced as the speed increases. In addition to the means shown
        an air valve may be provided, actuated automatically by the
        governor either through rod 37 or otherwise. For further
        convenience and to enable the independent control of the air and
        fuel supply in the two branches, conduits 14, 15 and pipes 28,
        29 may be equipped with valves, indicated in Fig. 1, the
        numbering of which is deemed unnecessary. </p>
      <p>The amount of power obtainable from boiler 39 will vary
        according to conditions. Turbines as described in my said prior
        specification are capable of operating at a very high exhaust
        temperature and then the energy recovered from the waste heat in
        this manner may be a large fraction of the whole useful work. In
        such as case conduit 3, pipes 14 and 28 together with all their
        adjuncts, as illustrated can be omitted and the steam supplied
        directly to the nozzle through valve 46. Or these connections
        and adjuncts may be left undisturbed and a separate nozzle
        provided. In admitting the steam from the boiler to the turbine
        rotor through independent channels, the practical advantage is
        secured that the pressure may vary considerably without
        detracting much from the efficiency of the machine, which will
        be improved through preheating of the combustibles by any of the
        well-known means. </p>
      <p>This plan provides an efficient self-starting mixed-fluid
        turbine which may also be operated with steam alone, merely by
        shutting off the air and fuel supply, and is on this account
        very convenient. Minor departures from it, as may be dictated by
        the circumstances, will obviously suggest themselves, but if it
        is carried out on these general lines it will be found highly
        profitable to the owners of the steam plant while permitting the
        use of their old installation. However the best economic results
        in the development of power from steam by my invention will be
        obtained in plants especially adapted for the purpose. It should
        be added that this method can also be successfully applied to
        condensing plants operating with high vacuum. The production and
        maintenance of the latter will be materially facilitated by the
        employment of a pump as shown in my British patent before
        referred to. In such instances, owing to the very great
        expansion ratio, the exhaust mixture will be at a relatively low
        temperature and suitable for admission to the condenser. This
        will call for better fuel and special pumping facilities, but
        the economic results attained will fully justify the increased
        outlay. </p>
      <p>Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of
        my said invention and in what manner the same is to be
        performed, I declare that what I claim is: -- [Claims not

        <p><b>Nikola Tesla</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I, Nikola Tesla, do hereby declare the nature of this invention
        to be as follows: -- </p>
      <p>This improvement provides a very simple means for increasing
        the economy of steam turbines and is chiefly intended to be used
        in the operation of small units but may also be applied, with
        more or less success, to machines of considerable capacity, the
        saving effect depending largely on the conditions existing in
        the steamplants where it is introduced. The economic gain will
        be especially pronounced in factories and industrial
        establishments in which the steam pipes are long and serious
        loss is incurred through condensation and otherwise. The
        apparatus for carrying out the process is capable of slight
        modifications and can be employed in conjunction with different
        types of turbines, but is particularly suited to that described
        in y British Patent No. 24,001 of 1910, in which propulsion is
        effected by the adhesive and viscous action of the motive fluid.
        Irrespective of constructive features the general arrangement
        will be as follows: </p>
      <p>The steam from the boiler is led through a superheater to the
        turbine nozzle and the high velocity jet projected from it
        against the rotor creates a suction in the adjacent space which
        is connected to the superheater pipes or coils, thus causing a
        strong air current to pass through the same. The air first
        enters a chamber to which gas or other fuel is supplied and the
        products of combustion are aspired through the coils into the
        turbine, superheating the steam to the desired degree, also
        increasing the temperature of the steam through the turbine
        rotor and, incidentally, imparting to it some of their kinetic
        energy. All of these actions cooperate in raising the efficiency
        of the machine with the result of bringing about an important
        reduction of operative expense. </p>
      <p>To improve the performance of the apparatus I employ two
        concentric nozzles, steam being admitted to the turbine through
        one and the products of combustion through the other.
        Furthermore, in order to turn to good use the waste heat of the
        exhaust I attach to the latter an economizer for preheating the
        feedwater and fuel, thereby effecting additional savings. </p>
      <p>This invention dispenses with the compressor ordinarily
        required in connection with a gas turbine and will be found
        valuable on account of its extreme simplicity, low cost of
        installment and facilities it affords. </p>
      <p>The preferred form of apparatus for carrying out the process
        above described is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in
        which: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> is a side view in elevation, partly
        cross-sectioned, and </p>

        <p><img src="186084b.jpg" height="283" width="311"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Referring to the figures more specifically, 1 is the rotor and
        2,2 the enclosing casing of the turbine which is provided with
        two diametrically opposite enlargements 3,3 bored out and fitted
        with concentric conduits 4,4, and 5,5 for supplying the working
        fluids to the rotor. These are equipped with, or form part of,
        corresponding discharge nozzles 6,6 and 7,7. The superheater
        consists of a steam chamber 8 closed at the ends by plates 9 and
        10 and containing the coiled pipe 11, the ends of which are led
        out, one being connected to a combustion chamber 12 and the
        other to an outlet pipe 13 with branches 14 and 15 leading to
        the inner supply channel 16, 16. Steam inlet and outlet pipes,
        respectively, 17 and 18, are provided, the latter with channels
        21, 21 of the supply part. Suitable steam, air and gas inlet
        valves, respectively marked 22, 23 and 24 may be employed for
        controlling and regulating the supply of the working fluids to
        the turbine. All the supply channels should be of a section
        sufficiently large so that the velocities of the fluids through
        them will be small as compared with those attained in the
        nozzles. </p>
      <p>The operation will now be readily understood. Valves 23 and 24
        being closed, the steam admitted by valve 22 passes through
        inlet pipe 17, chamber 8, outlet 18, branches 19 and 20, spaces
        21, 21 and nozzles 6, 6, setting the turbine rotor in motion
        thus operating the machine as a simple steam turbine subject to
        the usual limitations in economic performance. The inlet valve
        23 is now opened permitting the atmospheric air to be drawn in
        through coil 11, pipe 13, branches 14 and 15, channels 16, 16
        and nozzles 7, 7 to the rotor. Power gas or other fuel is then
        admitted through valve 24 and upon being ignited in the
        combustion chamber 12 the products pass through in like manner,
        assisted by their initial velocity. As a result of this action,
        coiled pipe 11 is heated to a high temperature and superheats
        the steam in chamber 8 and also in the supply channels and
        nozzles, thus adding very materially to the available energy of
        the steam, at the same time increasing the efficiency of
        thermodynamic transformation. The products of combustion
        themselves, impinging against the rotor, contribute usefully
        some of their kinetic energy. The economic gain effected in this
        simple manner will be all the more pronounced the poorer the
        initial quality of the steam and the higher the pressure supply.
        However, low-pressure steam, as that exhausted from turbines or
        reciprocating engines, may likewise be economically utilized by
        this process and means, especially if provision is made for
        maintaining a vacuum at the exhaust end of the turbine. </p>
      <p>The apparatus described is capable of minor modifications. For
        instance, the combustibles may be admitted to the rotor through
        the outer channels and steam through the inner ones. Again, the
        nozzles instead of being coaxial, as shown, may be otherwise
        constructed and disposed, or single nozzles may be used in their
        place and the mixture of steam and gases effected before
        admission to them. However, this can be more or less completely
        accomplished with coaxial nozzles, as illustrated, merely by
        shortening one of them. As to the superheater it may be of
        widely varied design and incorporated with the turbine casing
        for the purpose of saving energy, weight and space. Departures
        may also be made in the design of the combustion chamber to suit
        the fuel employed and the necessary adjuncts for carburetion and
        ignition will be provided, all of which, being well-known, are
        omitted from the drawing for the sake of clearness. Obviously,
        the process can be applied with more or less success in the
        transformation of the heat energy of elastic fluids other than
        steam. </p>
      <p>This invention provides a self-starting, compact and efficient
        mixed-fluid turbine and will be found valuable on account of its
        extreme simplicity, low cost of installment and the facilities
        it affords. </p>

        my said invention and in what manner the same is to be

        <p><b>Nikola Tesla</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I, Nikola Tesla, do hereby declare the nature of this invention
        and in what manner the same is to be performed, to be
        particularly described and ascertained in and by the following
        statement: -- </p>
      <p>In the operation of machinery the accurate balancing of the
        rotating parts is of great economic importance as vast sums of
        money are annually expended on account of deficiencies in this
        respect resulting in loss of power, undue wear and tear,
        interruption of service and accidents of a more or less serious
        nature. </p>
      <p>Prior to the development of modern high speed apparatus static
        balancing was depended upon entirely and even now this is
        frequently the case. The steadily increasing tendency in the
        direction of high speed brought on the necessity of dynamic
        balancing and various forms of apparatus for this purpose were
        devised. </p>
      <p>The process I have invented enables this to be done quickly and
        with a high degree of accuracy and, briefly stated, consists of
        rotating the body to be balanced, yieldably supported, at a
        suitable speed and removing excess material from its heavier
        side by abrasion, until the desired degree of perfection of
        balance is attained. </p>
      <p>As means to this end I may employ a grinding wheel, a
        sand-blast or jet of other abrasive substance. It might be
        naturally inferred that the contact of an emery or carborundum
        wheel with a rapidly whirling machine part would be productive
        of dangerous shocks and vibrations, and also that grinding at
        speeds much higher than the usual could now be satisfactorily
        accomplished. But although these theoretical assumptions appear
        sound, I have encountered no difficulties of this kind and have
        performed the operation with the greatest facility and success.
        This I attribute to the inertia and momentum of the spinning
        body which makes it insensitive to such asynchronous
        disturbances as the wheel might produce. However, in certain
        cases it may be more convenient or preferable to effect the
        removal of the excess material by a high velocity jet of
        abrasive material by a high velocity jet of abrasive substance
        applied tangentially to the part to be balanced. In order to
        attain the best results it is essential that the latter, when
        rotated, shall be capable of an appreciable displacement of its
        center of gravity from the axis of symmetry. This is
        accomplished by supporting it on a shaft of suitable
        flexibility, or, if its own shaft is not sufficiently flexible,
        in bearings yieldably mounted. It is furthermore of great
        importance, in order to avoid vibrations which would interfere
        with the proper application of the process, that the speed at
        which the grinding is effected should bear a definite relation
        to the critical, corresponding to the fundamental natural
        vibration, and the following rule should be observed: If the
        system is run in two bearings the grinding wheel should be an
        odd multiple or submultiple of the critical. If, on the other
        hand, the system is supported on one side only, the speed should
        be an even multiple or submultiple of the critical. </p>
      <p>When the structure is revolving at the proper speed I bring the
        abrasive wheel into operative contact with it at a peripheral or
        other suitable region and grind off material. As the action
        continues, the flexure of the shaft diminishes until, finally,
        its center of symmetry coincides with the center of gravity of
        the system, or nearly so. This can be noted in many cases by a
        competent operator without the use of a special device, but
        suitable visible or audible means may be employed for the
        purpose. </p>
      <p>Preliminary to the application of the process it is advisable
        to run the part at a very low speed and true it with the wheel.
        If there exists appreciable flexure of the shaft when the system
        rests horizontally, the grinding may be done in a vertical
        position when it is in static balance. A part to be run on a
        stiff shaft may be mounted on another of suitable flexibility;
        and as there exist limitations in the accuracy of fitting a
        cylindrical sleeve, I may employ a tapering one to secure
        greater precision. However, satisfactory results can generally
        be obtained in arming the rigid shaft with flexible extensions
        or holding it in bearings suitable supported. In all cases it is
        desirable to flood the latter with lubricant of considerable
        viscosity. When balancing parts to be run at a high temperature
        they may be inclosed in a casing in which approximately the same
        temperature is maintained, an opening being provided for the
        introduction of the abrasive wheel or jet. </p>
      <p>My invention will be clearly understood by reference to the
        accompanying drawings illustrating a form of apparatus I have
        devised for the quick and convenient balancing of such bodies as
        rotors of my steam and gas turbines. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> shows the general arrangement of the component
        parts comprising, a casing with an opening on one side, lathe
        mechanism for feeding the wheel, a tachometer enabling
        instantaneous readings of the speed to be taken, an instrument
        for continuous visual indication of the degree of accuracy
        attained and a preheater of the elastic medium such as
        compressed air used in the operation; </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> represents a section through the casing in the
        plane of a rotor disc, exposing said opening and also the
        turbine nozzle; </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> is a view of the essential parts of the
        balance-indicating instrument and, </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> illustrates the manner in which a jet of
        abrasive substance is applied when carrying out my process. </p>
      <p>Calling attention specifically to the first names 1 is a
        casing, enclosing an air- or steam-driven rotor to be balanced,
        and shown as open at 2 for the purpose of permitting the wheel 3
        to be brought into operative contact with the surfaces to be
        ground. Any suitable drive may be employed but I ordinarily
        resort to the electric, mounting the wheel directly on the shaft
        of a motor 4 fixed to a lathe carriage 5 which slides on rails
        6, 6 and is provided with means 7 and 8 for feeding the wheel,
        respectively, along the axis of the motor shaft and at right
        angles to the same. </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 2 the casing is split horizontally on the
        centerline in two castings 9 and 10, carefully planed so as to
        insure their coming into the same position whenever put
        together, lateral displacement being prevented by dowel-pins 11,
        11 (Figure 1) which are driven tight either in casting 9 or 10.
        These are enlarged and bred out on one side and into the hole is
        snugly fitted a hollow cylinder 13 with nozzle 14 and intake
        opening 15 directly connected to the supply line 16 provided
        with a suitable control valve. The opening at 2 for the entrance
        of wheel 3 is shown as a simple opening through the casing, but
        in certain cases I introduce the wheel through an enlargement
        shown in Figure 2 on the right side, which is often convenient
        when balancing a rotor in its own casing. </p>
      <p>Referring again to Figure 1 the bearings 17 and 18 are also
        divided horizontally in the plane of the casing joint and their
        upper and lower parts may be integral with the corresponding
        casting 9 and 10 for the purpose of saving labor and time. The
        lower parts of the bearings are equipped with oil supply and
        discharge pipes 19 and 20.The supply pipe 16 is shown as
        connected to a coil 21 of a heater 22 which is equipped with a
        valve for controlling the flow of the heating medium and may be
        of any known construction. Q worm drive 23 is provided on one
        end of the rotor shaft for operating the tachometer 24 through a
        flexible connection. This device may be of any make but I find
        it advantageous to use the air friction type. On the other end
        of the shaft is mounted the balance indicator 25 (shown in
        detail Figure 3) consisting of a member 26 with a pointer 27 on
        the top and an adjustable mounted weight 28 on the bottom. This
        member is supported on the outer race 29 of a ball-bearing 30,
        the inner one 31 being fixed to the shaft, and is thus capable
        of oscillation. The rotary effort necessary to produce a given
        deflection of the same being determined by the position of the
        weight. A graduated scale 32 is attached to the stationary part
        of the instrument which is placed conveniently for observation
        by the operator. </p>
      <p>Substantially the same apparatus, with the exception of wheel
        3, may be employed in connection with the device
        diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 4,in which a suitable
        fixture 32 projects a jet 33 of abrasive substance tangentially
        upon the body 34 to be balanced which is supported on a flexible
        shaft 35. In this case of course the fixture is mounted on
        carriage 5 to enable feeding in two directions. </p>
      <p>Substantially the same apparatus, with the exception of wheel
        3, may be employed in connection with the device
        diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 4, in which a suitable
        fixture 32 projects a jet 33 of abrasive substance tangentially
        upon the body34 to be balanced which is supported on a flexible
        shaft 35. In this case of course the fixture is mounted on
        carriage 5 to enable feeding in two directions. </p>
      <p>The balancing is done as follows: The rotor being in position
        for grinding the casting 9 and covers of bearing 17 and 18 are
        put in place, lubricant forced through pipes 19 and 20 and a
        motive fluid as compressed air, admitted to nozzle 14, its
        quantity and temperature being regulated, respectively, by
        valves on supply pipe 16 and heater 22. The fluid, in traversing
        the rotor and exhausting through the lower casing imparts motion
        to the former and brings it up to the desired speed, ascertained
        by reading of tachometer 24. The abrasive wheel 3 is now fed
        across the rotor and the indication of the balancing instrument
        on the graduated scale noted. At the start the deflection of the
        pointer is likely to be considerable due to the fact that any,
        however slight vibration of the shaft, increases greatly the
        pressure on the balls and consequently the torque of the
        instrument. As the balance improved the deflection diminishes
        until finally the pointer reaches the zero of the scale
        indicating that the desired degree of perfection of balance has
        been attained. As a crucial test the operator may then run the
        rotor at about the critical speed. This should cause no
        appreciable vibration or effect on the balance indicator which,
        instead of carrying a weight, may be equipped with a spring for
        producing the required pressure on the ball-bearing and opposing
        the torsion. </p>
      <p>When bodies not adapted for rotation in the manner shown are to
        be balanced, they will be driven independently by belt,
        electricity or other means, care being taken that no disturbing
        vibration from them is transmitted to the apparatus. In order to
        preserve intact the peripheral boundary, if this is essential, I
        grind the material off from some other place and when desirable,
        I make a special provision to this end in the design and
        construction of the part. </p>
      <p>I have found my process very valuable in the balancing of
        high-speed steam and gas turbine rotors but I have used it
        successfully in a great variety of cases and do not limit its
        application to any kind of apparatus. </p>
      <p>Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of
        my said invention and in what manner the same is to be
        performed, I declare that what I claim is: -- [ Claims not
