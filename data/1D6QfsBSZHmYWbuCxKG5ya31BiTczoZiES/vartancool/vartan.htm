          A reverse microwave has been created which can chill any drink

          The invention of the microwave revolutionised cooking but now
          a 'reverse-microwave' does the opposite, it can chill a drink
          in 45 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Up until now there has not been a gadget available to cool
          items without a long wait.<br>
          <br>
          A new system can cool drinks, including wine bottles and fizzy
          drink cans, from room temperature to four degrees in a matter
          of seconds.<br>
          <br>
          The unit can cool drinks in all types of containers to
          different temperatures without disturbing the carbonation.<br>
          <br>
          The technology, which has been developed with the help of
          research funding from the EU, works on the basis of a cooling
          vortex which spins the drink round.<br>
          <br>
          It uses a stop start rotational sequence to create what is
          known as a Rankine vortex - which is a collapsed vortex in a
          viscous fluid.<br>
          <br>
          This enables the drinks to mix without fizzing.<br>
          <br>
          The beverage is rotated at speed around twin axes in water to
          keep it in its original state while quickly bringing down its
          temperature.<br>
          <br>
          V-Tex, which invented the technology, say that the process
          requires more than 80 per cent less energy than many standard
          drinks chillers. <br>

          Many previous efforts have been made to achieve rapid drinks
          cooling on demand. The problem has always been the time it
          takes to effectively cool the liquid. If the cooling is very
          fast then the outer layers of liquid freeze before the inner
          liquid is cooled. This creates “slushing” which is
          unacceptable to consumers. The way to avoid slushing is to
          agitate the liquid, however, when this is done to carbonated
          drinks it causes ?zzing when the drink is opened. <br>
          <br>
          The team found that by rotating the beverage at a certain
          speed to create a Rankine&nbsp;vortex the carbonated liquid
          could be mixed without disruption to the bubbles of carbon
          dioxide. The team also discovered that by simply rotating the
          beverage the vortex behaved like a solid, with the outer
          liquid cooling faster than the inner liquid. Tests showed that
          cooling rates could be improved by collapsing the vortex and
          then recreating it; this was achieved by a stop start
          rotational sequence. This pulsed rotation is the essence of
          the first patent filed by Enviro-Cool (UK) Limited. <br>
          <br>
          Further tests revealed that it was possible to interrupt the
          vortex without stopping the rotation. This was achieved by
          rotating the beverage around twin axes. Cooling rates improved
          even further with this method, and a second patent was filed
          by Enviro-Cool (UK) Limited to cover this process. <br>
          <br>
          Regent and Pera Technology built three prototypes to
          demonstrate the proof of concept.<br>

        <div align="left"><b>IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO COOLING</b><br>
          <b>WO2011012902</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          The present disclosure relates to improvements in or relating
          to cooling, in particular for cooling beverages in containers
          such as cans or bottles. A cooling apparatus has a cavity for
          receipt of a product to be cooled; rotation means to rotate a
          product received in the cavity and cooling liquid supply means
          to provide a cooling liquid to the cavity. The rotation means
          is adapted to rotate the product at a rotational speed of 90
          revolutions per minute or more and is also adapted to provide
          a pulsed or non-continuous rotation for a predetermined
          period.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to improvements in or relating
          to cooling. In catering, retail and entertainment sectors,
          various forms of vending devices are used in order to keep
          products chilled. For cold beverages these devices form two
          typical groups - commercial drinks refrigerators and cold
          beverage vending machines. Both types of device are
          essentially large glass-fronted refrigerators having hinged or
          sliding doors in the case of the first group (for manual
          dispensing) or a dispensing mechanism in the case of the
          second. They pre-cool and store drinks ready for purchase. In
          many cases, the drinks are maintained at low temperatures for
          long periods before they are eventually purchased. As a
          result, considerable energy is used, potentially
          unnecessarily. Compounding the problem, both types of device
          operate inefficiently. In use, drinks refrigerators of the
          first group suffer substantial loss of cold air every time the
          large door is opened. Vending machines must provide easy
          passage to the vending tray where the item is collected by the
          user, resulting in poor sealing. Refrigeration systems
          generally have a requirement to be exercised through
          background running cycles to maintain efficiency, but this
          uses additional energy not directly contributing to chilling
          the contents.<br>
          <br>
          It is also known for many beverage retailers to stock
          beverages in open-fronted refrigerated cabinets for ease of
          access and visibility of product. These cabinets obviously
          suffer even greater energy wastage. The net result is high
          levels of wasted electrical energy used in keeping drinks in a
          long-term cold state in readiness for purchasing, regardless
          of whenever that might occur.<br>
          <br>
          Energy wastage is not confined to corporate sites hosting
          vending machines. Many small corner shops, petrol stations and
          cafe outlets host drinks chilling cabinets. For these
          operators, electrical energy costs will represent a high
          proportion of their operational overhead. Energy wastage is
          not the only issue. Since refrigeration systems generate heat,
          often the wasted heat energy by-product from the refrigeration
          system causes unwanted warming of the localised area around
          the machines. This creates an inconsistency in which users
          must drink their satisfactorily chilled drinks in
          unsatisfactorily warm areas.<br>
          <br>
          Speed of cooling is also an issue, particularly in
          establishments having a high turnover of beverages, such as at
          special events - concerts, sporting eventings and so on.
          Often, at the start of the event, drinks are adequately cooled
          by having been refrigerated for several hours. However, once
          the event is under way, the volume of drinks being sold
          exceeds the capacity of the refrigerators to chill further
          drinks. Drinks must then be sold only partially chilled or not
          chilled at all.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention seeks to address these problems by
          providing an apparatus that allows cooling of beverages on
          demand. The apparatus can be a stand-alone device or may be
          incorporated into a vending machine.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention provides a cooling apparatus comprising
          a cavity for receipt of a product to be cooled. The apparatus
          comprises rotation means to rotate a product received in the
          cavity and cooling liquid supply means to provide a cooling
          liquid to the cavity. The rotation means is adapted to rotate
          the product at a rotational speed of 90 revolutions per minute
          or more and is further adapted to provide a pulsed or non-
          continuous rotation for a predetermined period.<br>

          In certain embodiments, the apparatus comprises a plurality of
          cavities as defined above. In typical embodiments, the
          apparatus is incorporated in a vending apparatus and the

          means for storing a product or range of products and selection
          means for selecting a product from the storage means for

          present invention will now be described in further detail, by
          way of example only.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 1 to 4 graphically show the results of cooling trials
          with a first embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the
          present invention.<br>
          <br>
          In discussing the present invention, a brief review of current
          methods for selectively cooling beverages on a container-by-
          container basis will be helpful. A typical 330ml aluminium can
          containing a beverage can be cooled in a refrigerator set at a
          typical operating temperature of around 4 to 5[deg.]C from an
          ambient temperature of 25[deg.]C to a comfortable drinking
          temperature of 6[deg.]C in approximately four hours or so. In
          a freezer, the period is reduced to around 50 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          Peltier coolers are available and are based on the physics of
          the Peltier effect, which occurs when a current is passed
          through two dissimilar metals coupled in a face-to- face
          arrangement. One of the metals will heat up and the other will
          cool down. The cold side in contact with the cooling chamber
          of the can reduces the can temperature. Peltier coolers are
          already extremely popular in high-end computer cooling systems
          and scientific CCD imaging systems. They have been applied to
          portable cool boxes and in-vehicle refrigerators, where a
          compressor would be too noisy or bulky. A cooling cycle time
          for a standard can is in excess of 30 to 45 minutes. In
          addition, because the Peltier element is typically located
          adjacent the concave base of the can, the can is cooled very
          unevenly. As a result these devices are only really suitable
          for maintaining the temperature of a pre-chilled drink.<br>
          <br>
          Gel-based cooling jackets, may, depending on their size, cool
          a can or bottle in under 15 minutes. These work by
          encapsulating a high concentration of sodium-based
          phase-change material into a sleeve, designed to fit closely
          around the can. This sleeve must then be cooled in a freezer
          and then re-cooled after each use.<br>
          <br>
          The current state of the art methodology for cooling bottles
          and cans is considered to be the Cooper cooler. The unit
          slowly rotates a beverage container horizontally, whilst
          covering or immersing the container in ice-cold water. From a
          25[deg.]C starting temperature a bottle may be cooled to
          11&lt;0&gt;C in 3.5 minutes and to 6[deg.]C in 6 minutes. In
          addition, the unit requires a substantial supply of ice cubes
          to chill adequately. This technology is not sufficiently fast
          for commercial applications, it requires a large number of ice
          cubes and results in damage to the branding labels on the
          bottle.<br>
          <br>
          Within a carbonated drink, carbon dioxide is dissolved in the
          liquid under pressure (Henry's Law). When the pressure is
          reduced (upon opening), the liquid becomes less capable of
          holding carbon dioxide (CO2), and so the CO2 will come out of
          solution. All carbonated drinks therefore effervesce (fizz)
          upon opening as the internal pressure of their container is
          reduced. Whether they fizz over (liquid comes out of the
          container explosively) depends on how quickly CO2 comes out of
          solution. Effervescence is enhanced by the availability of
          nucleation sites in the container which act as foci for the
          formation of bubbles.<br>
          <br>
          We have determined that a carbonated drink will not effervesce
          excessively up when rotated at high speeds because nucleation
          does not occur. In comparison, when a carbonated drink is
          shaken, the air pocket above the beverage is broken up into a
          large number of small pockets dispersed throughout the
          beverage which then act as nucleation sites when the can is
          opened. The CO2 then expands rapidly, carrying the liquid out
          of the can. However, when a beverage is only rotated, the air
          pocket stays substantially intact. There are few, if any,
          nucleation sites dispersed throughout the liquid, and the slow
          decarbonation takes place. We have developed an apparatus
          comprising a cavity for receipt of a can or other container
          for a beverage to be cooled. The cavity includes a
          motor-driven turntable to allow the can to be rotated at speed
          and also includes a clamp to hold the can in position on the
          turntable whilst permitting rotation. The apparatus also
          includes supply means for a cooling liquid. In its crudest
          form, the cooling liquid is simply poured into the cavity and
          then removed at the end of the cooling process. In preferred
          embodiments, a flow of cooling liquid through the apparatus is
          provided. In trials, we investigated the effects of spray
          cooling and liquid flow cooling on a can surface. These trials
          showed that liquid flow cooling provided better results. Spray
          cooling technology did not efficiently cool the central point
          of the can, providing only the external impression of a cold
          can but not a sufficiently cooled drink. We then conducted a
          series of trials investigating the optimal methodology of
          agitating a can at different speeds seeking to avoid fizzing.
          These experiments showed that a can may be rotated at 360rpm
          for over 5 minutes without fizzing. Axial agitation motions
          resulted on a non even mix or violent fizzing actions. To
          further develop the concept, a sealed can cooling rig was
          manufactured to use a salt water solution which is chilled
          down to approximately -16[deg.]C, in a cooling tank with a
          rotating agitator to reduce salt solidification. A diaphragm
          pump was used to fill the cooling vessel, at a rate of up to 5
          litres/min. The cooling vessel has been designed to accept a
          standard can, which may be rotated up to 12Hz / 720rpm. The
          flow rate of the pump and rotational speed of the can are
          controllable. The real-time cooling rates of the drink were
          recorded.<br>
          <br>
          We have determined that, during rotation of a can, a forced
          vortex develops, the depth of which inside the can is
          dependent upon the speed of rotation. Forced convection takes
          place and creates artificially-induced convection currents
          inside the can. When the rotation is then stopped, a free or
          collapsing vortex forms and natural convection takes place,
          promoting mixing of the contents of the can but without
          incorporation of air bubbles which might lead to nucleation
          and excessive effervescing. However, in a static can without
          this collapsing vortex, cooler beverages being denser, sinks
          to the base of the can. Mixing of the can contents is very
          poor leading to poor thermal uniformity, and also leading, in
          many cases, to ice formation or "slushing".<br>
          <br>
          We conducted a range of trials to assess the success of
          various rotational speeds in producing a uniformly cooled
          beverage. The following experiments help illustrate the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Comparative Test</b><br>
          <br>
          Initially, we conducted a trial without any rotational
          agitation of the can. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <b>Table 1</b><br>
        <br>

        <br>
        As can be seen, from an ambient temperature of 20-22&lt;0&gt;C.
        The contents of the base of the can are satisfactorily cooled to
        a desirable temperature, but there is minimal cooling of the top
        of the can, giving a wide temperature range throughout the can
        and poor average cooling.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Experimental Tests</b><br>
        <br>
        In the first group of tests, we sought to examine the effect of
        the speed of rotation on the cooling results. The results are
        shown in Figure 1 in which the temperature scale represents the
        average temperature of the contents of the can. It will be seen
        that improved results are obtained at higher rotation speeds,
        with more rapid cooling being achieved at 360rpm (Test 3)
        compared with at 180rpm (Test 2) or at 90rpm (Test 1). In these
        trials, it was noted that, as would be expected, pre-chilling of
        the cooler cavity had a substantial effect on successful
        chilling of the can contents. It was also noted that, at 180rpm,
        there remained a 6&lt;0&gt;C difference between the temperatures
        at the top and the base of the can.<br>
        <br>
        We then set out to investigate whether intermittent rotation had
        a better effect on cooling than continuous rotation. It will be
        appreciated that intermittent rotation allows the vortex to
        collapse several times during the cooling process and so might
        be expected to promote more even temperature distribution. The
        results are shown in Figure 2 and illustrate that more rapid
        cooling was achieved with intermittent cooling. We then
        conducted further trials, varying the number of spins per
        cooling cycle. The results are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen
        that rotation at higher speeds and with a higher number of
        pauses in rotation produces a steeper cooling gradient.<br>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> Based on the above results, further trials
          were conducted at 360rpm with rotation for 10 seconds followed
          by a 20 second pause to show the effect over time on can
          temperature. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Table 2</b><br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><img alt="" src="wot2.jpg" height="230"
            width="605"><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          These results show that optimum cooling, in terms of achieving
          a beverage cooled uniformly to the desired temperature in the
          range of 6&lt;0&gt;C, is achievable with three cycles, over 90
          seconds. It was noted that the cooling liquid (4 litres) rose
          in temperature by 1.5[deg.]C for each trial. Figure 4 shows
          the averaged results of a large series of these trials with
          cans at initial temperatures of 24[deg.]C. We have calculated
          that the total energy required to cool a can from an ambient
          temperature of about 24[deg.]C to about 6&lt;0&gt;C is around
          6 joules; according to the following calculations: <br>

          The following set out the principle advantages of the
          apparatus of the present invention over the state of the art
          cooling methodologies: 1. Rotating the can at an optimal speed
          to improve forced convection;<br>
          <br>
          2. Generating a free (decaying) vortex within the can to
          promote natural cooling convection; and 3. Combining a series
          of forced and free (decaying) vortexes to cool a beverage
          rapidly, with an evenly distributed temperature. In preferred
          embodiments, the apparatus further comprises a sleeve into
          which the container to be cooled is filled, such as a rubber
          membrane, preferably a membrane including metallic particles
          to improve thermal conductivity. The inclusion of a
          closely-fitting membrane acts to reduce or prevent damage to
          labelling on the container, especially if paper labels are
          used.<br>
          <br>
          The full results data from Tests 1 to 7 are given in Table 3.<br>
          <br>
          For commercial uses, it is advantageous for the apparatus to
          include a plurality of cavities of the type described above
          for simultaneous chilling of several containers.<br>
          <br>
          In typical embodiments, the apparatus is incorporated in a
          vending apparatus and further comprises insertion and removal
          means for inserting the product to be cooled into the cavity
          and removing the cooled product therefrom.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the vending apparatus further comprises storage
          means for storing a product or range of products and selection
          means for selecting a product from the storage means for
          insertion into the cavity. The vending apparatus will
          typically also include payment collection apparatus such as a
          coin-operated mechanism or a card-reading apparatus for
          deducting a charge from a card.<br>
          <br>
          <b>TABLE 3</b><br>
          <br>
          Convective heat transfer is largely governed by the fluid flow
          regime within the boundary layer. Increasing the velocity
          gradient within the boundary layer will increase convective
          heat transfer. Whilst the Reynolds number is a key parameter
          governing whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent,
          it may transition due to surface texture or roughness and the
          local pressure gradient. The more complex motion of the
          container and coolant provided by this arrangement gives more
          degrees of freedom to control the thickness and velocity
          gradient within the boundary layer. This enables the apparatus
          to maximise convective heat transfer whilst eliminating
          slushing or ice formation that has hampered past attempts to
          achieve rapid cooling.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention also seeks to provide a vending machine
          incorporating the apparatus described above. In a conventional
          vending machine, the entire storage cavity must be insulated,
          but insulation for a cavity storing perhaps 400 cans can
          typically only be achieved using insulating foam or mats or
          other materials which trap air in order to prevent heat
          transmission. These materials are relatively inefficient
          thermal insulators.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to providing a vending machine which chills
          beverages exclusively on demand, the present invention
          provides a vending machine in which most cans or other
          beverage containers are storable at ambient temperature and
          only a small number, perhaps 16 or so, are storable at a
          reduced or drinking temperature.<br>
          As a result, the cavity in which the reduced temperature
          containers are stored can be insulated by more effective
          means, such as vacuum insulation panels. The cooling apparatus
          is provided between the ambient storage cavity and the chilled
          storage cavity.<br>
          <br>
          The use of two storage zones significantly reduces the overall
          energy consumption and will also reduce the power rating
          required for the rapid cooling apparatus.<br>
          Additional low level chilling to the chilled storage cavity
          can be provided to maintain the correct temperature, but the
          energy consumption to maintain the temperature in a small
          vacuum-insulated capacity cavity is substantially lower than
          in conventional machines. Table 4 compares the energy
          consumption of such a vending machine compared with a
          conventional machine in which all the cans are maintained at a
          chilled temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Table 4<br>
          <br>
          As can be seen the machine of the present invention will
          require 5OkJ to cool a can from ambient to drinking
          temperature (4-6&lt;0&gt;C). In a typical scenario
          approximately 30 cans are sold each day. Assuming that these
          are dispensed randomly over 24 hours additional cooling to
          compensate for thermal losses in the chilled storage cavity is
          estimated to be a maximum of 0.5 kWh per day. Hence, the total
          energy consumption (in this scenario is will be IkWh for
          cooling 30 cans which remains an 80% saving compared with
          conventional machines.<br>

          The present invention relates to improvements in or relating
          to cooling, in particular for cooling beverages in containers
          such as cans or bottles. We describe a cooling apparatus
          having a cavity for receipt of a product to be cooled;
          rotation means to rotate a product received in the cavity and
          cooling liquid supply means to provide a cooling liquid to the
          cavity. The rotation means is adapted to rotate the product at
          a rotational speed of 90 revolutions per minute or more and is
          also adapted to provide a pulsed or non-continuous rotation
          for a predetermined period.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to improvements in or
          relating to cooling.<br>
          <br>
          [0002] In catering, retail and entertainment sectors, various
          forms of vending devices are used in order to keep products
          chilled. For cold beverages these devices form two typical
          groups-commercial drinks refrigerators and cold beverage
          vending machines. Both types of device are essentially large
          glass-fronted refrigerators having hinged or sliding doors in
          the case of the first group (for manual dispensing) or a
          dispensing mechanism in the case of the second. They pre-cool
          and store drinks ready for purchase. In many cases, the drinks
          are maintained at low temperatures for long periods before
          they are eventually purchased. As a result, considerable
          energy is used, potentially unnecessarily. Compounding the
          problem, both types of device operate inefficiently. In use,
          drinks refrigerators of the first group suffer substantial
          loss of cold air every time the large door is opened. Vending
          machines must provide easy passage to the vending tray where
          the item is collected by the user, resulting in poor sealing.
          Refrigeration systems generally have a requirement to be
          exercised through background running cycles to maintain
          efficiency, but this uses additional energy not directly
          contributing to chilling the contents.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] It is also known for many beverage retailers to stock
          beverages in open-fronted refrigerated cabinets for ease of
          access and visibility of product. These cabinets obviously
          suffer even greater energy wastage.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The net result is high levels of wasted electrical
          energy used in keeping drinks in a long-term cold state in
          readiness for purchasing, regardless of whenever that might
          occur.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Energy wastage is not confined to corporate sites
          hosting vending machines. Many small corner shops, petrol
          stations and café outlets host drinks chilling cabinets. For
          these operators, electrical energy costs will represent a high
          proportion of their operational overhead. Energy wastage is
          not the only issue. Since refrigeration systems generate heat,
          often the wasted heat energy by-product from the refrigeration
          system causes unwanted warming of the localised area around
          the machines. This creates an inconsistency in which users
          must drink their satisfactorily chilled drinks in
          unsatisfactorily warm areas.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Speed of cooling is also an issue, particularly in
          establishments having a high turnover of beverages, such as at
          special events-concerts, sporting eventings and so on. Often,
          at the start of the event, drinks are adequately cooled by
          having been refrigerated for several hours. However, once the
          event is under way, the volume of drinks being sold exceeds
          the capacity of the refrigerators to chill further drinks
          Drinks must then be sold only partially chilled or not chilled
          at all.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The present invention seeks to address these problems
          by providing an apparatus that allows cooling of beverages on
          demand. The apparatus can be a stand-alone device or may be
          incorporated into a vending machine.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</b><br>

          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0026] In discussing the present invention, a brief review of
          current methods for selectively cooling beverages on a
          container-by-container basis will be helpful. A typical 330 ml
          aluminium can containing a beverage can be cooled in a
          refrigerator set at a typical operating temperature of around
          4 to 5[deg.] C. from an ambient temperature of 25[deg.] C. to
          a comfortable drinking temperature of 6[deg.] C. in
          approximately four hours or so. In a freezer, the period is
          reduced to around 50 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] Peltier coolers are available and are based on the
          physics of the Peltier effect, which occurs when a current is
          passed through two dissimilar metals coupled in a face-to-face
          arrangement. One of the metals will heat up and the other will
          cool down. The cold side in contact with the cooling chamber
          of the can reduces the can temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Peltier coolers are already extremely popular in
          high-end computer cooling systems and scientific CCD imaging
          systems. They have been applied to portable cool boxes and
          in-vehicle refrigerators, where a compressor would be too
          noisy or bulky. A cooling cycle time for a standard can is in
          excess of 30 to 45 minutes. In addition, because the Peltier
          element is typically located adjacent the concave base of the
          can, the can is cooled very unevenly. As a result these
          devices are only really suitable for maintaining the
          temperature of a pre-chilled drink<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Gel-based cooling jackets, may, depending on their
          size, cool a can or bottle in under 15 minutes. These work by
          encapsulating a high concentration of sodium-based
          phase-change material into a sleeve, designed to fit closely
          around the can. This sleeve must then be cooled in a freezer
          and then re-cooled after each use.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] The current state of the art methodology for cooling
          bottles and cans is considered to be the Cooper cooler. The
          unit slowly rotates a beverage container horizontally, whilst
          covering or immersing the container in ice-cold water. From a
          25[deg.] C. starting temperature a bottle may be cooled to
          11[deg.] C. in 3.5 minutes and to 6[deg.] C. in 6 minutes. In
          addition, the unit requires a substantial supply of ice cubes
          to chill adequately. This technology is not sufficiently fast
          for commercial applications, it requires a large number of ice
          cubes and results in damage to the branding labels on the
          bottle.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Within a carbonated drink, carbon dioxide is dissolved
          in the liquid under pressure (Henry's Law). When the pressure
          is reduced (upon opening), the liquid becomes less capable of
          holding carbon dioxide (CO2), and so the CO2 will come out of
          solution. All carbonated drinks therefore effervesce (fizz)
          upon opening as the internal pressure of their container is
          reduced. Whether they fizz over (liquid comes out of the
          container explosively) depends on how quickly CO2 comes out of
          solution. Effervescence is enhanced by the availability of
          nucleation sites in the container which act as foci for the
          formation of bubbles.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] We have determined that a carbonated drink will not
          effervesce excessively up when rotated at high speeds because
          nucleation does not occur. In comparison, when a carbonated
          drink is shaken, the air pocket above the beverage is broken
          up into a large number of small pockets dispersed throughout
          the beverage which then act as nucleation sites when the can
          is opened. The CO2 then expands rapidly, carrying the liquid
          out of the can. However, when a beverage is only rotated, the
          air pocket stays substantially intact. There are few, if any,
          nucleation sites dispersed throughout the liquid, and the slow
          decarbonation takes place.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] We have developed an apparatus comprising a cavity for
          receipt of a can or other container for a beverage to be
          cooled. The cavity includes a motor-driven turntable to allow
          the can to be rotated at speed and also includes a clamp to
          hold the can in position on the turntable whilst permitting
          rotation. The apparatus also includes supply means for a
          cooling liquid.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] In its crudest form, the cooling liquid is simply
          poured into the cavity and then removed at the end of the
          cooling process. In preferred embodiments, a flow of cooling
          liquid through the apparatus is provided.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] In trials, we investigated the effects of spray cooling
          and liquid flow cooling on a can surface. These trials showed
          that liquid flow cooling provided better results. Spray
          cooling technology did not efficiently cool the central point
          of the can, providing only the external impression of a cold
          can but not a sufficiently cooled drink.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] We then conducted a series of trials investigating the
          optimal methodology of agitating a can at different speeds
          seeking to avoid fizzing. These experiments showed that a can
          may be rotated at 360 rpm for over 5 minutes without fizzing.
          Axial agitation motions resulted on a non even mix or violent
          fizzing actions.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] To further develop the concept, a sealed can cooling
          rig was manufactured to use a salt water solution which is
          chilled down to approximately -16[deg.] C., in a cooling tank
          with a rotating agitator to reduce salt solidification. A
          diaphragm pump was used to fill the cooling vessel, at a rate
          of up to 5 litres/min The cooling vessel has been designed to
          accept a standard can, which may be rotated up to 12 Hz/720
          rpm. The flow rate of the pump and rotational speed of the can
          are controllable. The real-time cooling rates of the drink
          were recorded.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] We have determined that, during rotation of a can, a
          forced vortex develops, the depth of which inside the can is
          dependent upon the speed of rotation. Forced convection takes
          place and creates artificially-induced convection currents
          inside the can. When the rotation is then stopped, a free or
          collapsing vortex forms and natural convection takes place,
          promoting mixing of the contents of the can but without
          incorporation of air bubbles which might lead to nucleation
          and excessive effervescing.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] However, in a static can without this collapsing
          vortex, cooler beverages being denser, sinks to the base of
          the can. Mixing of the can contents is very poor leading to
          poor thermal uniformity, and also leading, in many cases, to
          ice formation or "slushing".<br>
          <br>
          [0040] We conducted a range of trials to assess the success of
          various rotational speeds in producing a uniformly cooled
          beverage. The following experiments help illustrate the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0041] Comparative Test</b><br>
          <br>
          [0042] Initially, we conducted a trial without any rotational
          agitation of the can. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          [0043] As can be seen, from an ambient temperature of
          20-22[deg.] C. The contents of the base of the can are
          satisfactorily cooled to a desirable temperature, but there is
          minimal cooling of the top of the can, giving a wide
          temperature range throughout the can and poor average cooling.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0044] Experimental Tests</b><br>
          <br>
          [0045] In the first group of tests, we sought to examine the
          effect of the speed of rotation on the cooling results. The
          results are shown in FIG. 1 in which the temperature scale
          represents the average temperature of the contents of the can.
          It will be seen that improved results are obtained at higher
          rotation speeds, with more rapid cooling being achieved at 360
          rpm (Test 3) compared with at 180 rpm (Test 2) or at 90 rpm
          (Test 1). In these trials, it was noted that, as would be
          expected, pre-chilling of the cooler cavity had a substantial
          effect on successful chilling of the can contents. It was also
          noted that, at 180 rpm, there remained a 6[deg.] C. difference
          between the temperatures at the top and the base of the can.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] We then set out to investigate whether intermittent
          rotation had a better effect on cooling than continuous
          rotation. It will be appreciated that intermittent rotation
          allows the vortex to collapse several times during the cooling
          process and so might be expected to promote more even
          temperature distribution. The results are shown in FIG. 2 and
          illustrate that more rapid cooling was achieved with
          intermittent cooling.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] We then conducted further trials, varying the number of
          spins per cooling cycle. The results are shown in FIG. 3. It
          can be seen that rotation at higher speeds and with a higher
          number of pauses in rotation produces a steeper cooling
          gradient.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Based on the above results, further trials were
          conducted at 360 rpm with rotation for 10 seconds followed by
          a 20 second pause to show the effect over time on can
          temperature. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

          [0049] These results show that optimum cooling, in terms of
          achieving a beverage cooled uniformly to the desired
          temperature in the range of 6[deg.] C., is achievable with
          three cycles, over 90 seconds. It was noted that the cooling
          liquid (4 litres) rose in temperature by 1.5[deg.] C. for each
          trial. FIG. 4 shows the averaged results of a large series of
          these trials with cans at initial temperatures of 24[deg.] C.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] We have calculated that the total energy required to
          cool a can from an ambient temperature of about 24[deg.] C. to
          about 6[deg.] C. is around 6 joules; according to the
          following calculations:<br>

          [0054] The following set out the principle advantages of the
          apparatus of the present invention over the state of the art
          cooling methodologies:<br>
          <br>
          1. Rotating the can at an optimal speed to improve forced
          convection;<br>
          2. Generating a free (decaying) vortex within the can to
          promote natural cooling convection; and<br>
          3. Combining a series of forced and free (decaying) vortexes
          to cool a beverage rapidly, with an evenly distributed
          temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0058] In preferred embodiments, the apparatus further
          comprises a sleeve into which the container to be cooled is
          filled, such as a rubber membrane, preferably a membrane
          including metallic particles to improve thermal conductivity.
          The inclusion of a closely-fitting membrane acts to reduce or
          prevent damage to labelling on the container, especially if
          paper labels are used.<br>
          <br>
          [0059] The full results data from Tests 1 to 7 are given in
          Table 3.<br>
          <br>
          [0060] For commercial uses, it is advantageous for the
          apparatus to include a plurality of cavities of the type
          described above for simultaneous chilling of several
          containers.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] In typical embodiments, the apparatus is incorporated
          in a vending apparatus and further comprises insertion and
          removal means for inserting the product to be cooled into the
          cavity and removing the cooled product therefrom.<br>
          <br>
          [0062] Preferably, the vending apparatus further comprises
          storage means for storing a product or range of products and
          selection means for selecting a product from the storage means
          for insertion into the cavity.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] The vending apparatus will typically also include
          payment collection apparatus such as a coin-operated mechanism
          or a card-reading apparatus for deducting a charge from a
          card.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0000] TABLE 3</b><br>
          <br>
          [0064] Convective heat transfer is largely governed by the
          fluid flow regime within the boundary layer. Increasing the
          velocity gradient within the boundary layer will increase
          convective heat transfer. Whilst the Reynolds number is a key
          parameter governing whether the boundary layer is laminar or
          turbulent, it may transition due to surface texture or
          roughness and the local pressure gradient. The more complex
          motion of the container and coolant provided by this
          arrangement gives more degrees of freedom to control the
          thickness and velocity gradient within the boundary layer.
          This enables the apparatus to maximise convective heat
          transfer whilst eliminating slushing or ice formation that has
          hampered past attempts to achieve rapid cooling.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The present invention also seeks to provide a vending
          machine incorporating the apparatus described above. In a
          conventional vending machine, the entire storage cavity must
          be insulated, but insulation for a cavity storing perhaps 400
          cans can typically only be achieved using insulating foam or
          mats or other materials which trap air in order to prevent
          heat transmission. These materials are relatively inefficient
          thermal insulators.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] In addition to providing a vending machine which chills
          beverages exclusively on demand, the present invention
          provides a vending machine in which most cans or other
          beverage containers are storable at ambient temperature and
          only a small number, perhaps 16 or so, are storable at a
          reduced or drinking temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] As a result, the cavity in which the reduced
          temperature containers are stored can be insulated by more
          effective means, such as vacuum insulation panels. The cooling
          apparatus is provided between the ambient storage cavity and
          the chilled storage cavity.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] The use of two storage zones significantly reduces the
          overall energy consumption and will also reduce the power
          rating required for the rapid cooling apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] Additional low level chilling to the chilled storage
          cavity can be provided to maintain the correct temperature,
          but the energy consumption to maintain the temperature in a
          small vacuum-insulated capacity cavity is substantially lower
          than in conventional machines. Table 4 compares the energy
          consumption of such a vending machine compared with a
          conventional machine in which all the cans are maintained at a
          chilled temperature.<br>

          [0070] As can be seen the machine of the present invention
          will require 50 kJ to cool a can from ambient to drinking
          temperature (4-6[deg.] C.). In a typical scenario
          approximately 30 cans are sold each day. Assuming that these
          are dispensed randomly over 24 hours additional cooling to
          compensate for thermal losses in the chilled storage cavity is
          estimated to be a maximum of 0.5 kWh per day. Hence, the total
          energy consumption (in this scenario is will be 1 kWh for
          cooling 30 cans which remains an 80% saving compared with
          conventional machines.<br>
