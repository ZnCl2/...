          <p><b><i>A promising device uses electric fields to destroy
                cancer cells in the brain.</i></b></p>
        </center>
        <p><b>By Katherine Bourzac</b> </p>
        <p>An Israeli company is conducting human tests for a device
          that uses weak electric fields to kill cancer cells but has no
          effect on normal cells. The device is in late-stage clinical
          trials in the United States and Europe for glioblastoma, a
          deadly brain cancer. It is also being tested in Europe for its
          effectiveness against breast cancer. In the lab and in animal
          testing, treatment with electric fields has killed cancer
          cells of every type tested. </p>
        <p>The electric-field therapy was developed by Yoram Palti, a
          physiologist at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology,
          in Haifa, who founded the company <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">NovoCure</span> to commercialize the treatment.
          Palti's electric fields cause dividing cancer cells to explode
          while having no significant impact on normal tissues. The
          range of electric fields generated by the device harms only
          dividing cells. And since normal cells divide at a much slower
          rate than cancer cells, the electric fields target cancer
          cells. "An Achilles' heel of cancer cells is that they have to
          divide," says Herbert Engelhard, chief of neuro-oncology in
          the department of neurosurgery at the University of Illinois,
          Chicago. </p>
        <p>Even after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery,
          about 85 to 90 percent of glioblastoma patients' cancer still
          progresses, and their survival rates are low, says Engelhard.
          He has about 10 glioblastoma patients enrolled in the trial,
          which is testing the unusual treatment in patients for whom
          all other approaches have failed. Engelhard says that the
          results are encouraging but that it's too early to comment on
          the treatment's efficacy. </p>
        <p>The electric fields' different effects on normal and dividing
          cells mostly have to do with geometry. A dividing cell has
          what Palti calls "an hourglass shape rather than a round
          shape." The electric field generated by the NovoCure device
          passes around and through round cells in a uniform fashion.
          But the narrow neck that pinches in at the center of a
          dividing cell acts like a lens, concentrating the electric
          field at this point. This non-uniform electric field wreaks
          havoc on dividing cells. The electric field tears apart
          important biological molecules, such as DNA and the structural
          proteins that pull the chromosomes into place during cell
          division. Dividing cells simply "disintegrate," says Palti. </p>
        <p>Palti, who for years has been studying the effect of electric
          fields on cancer and normal cells, says that he has verified
          this mechanism in computer models and experiments in the lab.
          "The physics are solid," says David Cohen, associate professor
          of radiology at Harvard Medical School. </p>
        <p>Patients in the glioblastoma clinical trial wear the device
          almost constantly, carrying necessary components in a
          briefcase. A wire emerging from the briefcase connects to
          adhesive electrodes covering the skull. Alternating electric
          fields pass through the scalp, into the skull, and on to the
          brain. The Food and Drug Administration approved the device
          for late-stage clinical trials for glioblastoma following
          promising results from a pilot study in 10 patients, one of
          whom had a complete recovery. </p>

        <p>An apparatus is provided for selectively destroying dividing
          cells in living tissue formed of dividing cells and
          non-dividing cells. The dividing cells contain polarizable
          intracellular members and during late anaphase or telophase,
          the dividing cells are connected to one another by a cleavage

          electrodes for subjecting the living tissue to electric field
          conditions sufficient to cause movement of the polarizable
          intracellular members toward the cleavage furrow in response
          to a non-homogeneous electric field being induced in the
          dividing cells. The non-homogeneous electric field produces an
          increased density electric field in the region of the cleavage
          furrow. The movement of the polarizable intracellular
          intracellular members towards the cleavage furrow causes the
          breakdown thereof which results in the destruction of the

        <p>Electric fields with certain characteristics have been shown
          to be effective at inhibiting the growth of cancer cells (and
          other rapidly dividing cells). However, when the cancer is
          located in a target region beneath the surface of a body, it
          can be difficult to deliver the beneficial fields to the
          target region. This difficulty can be surmounted by
          positioning a biocompatible field guide between the surface of
          the body and the target region, positioning electrodes on
          either side of the field guide, and applying an AC voltage
          with an appropriate frequency and amplitude between the
          electrodes. This arrangement causes the field guide to route
          the beneficial field to the target region. In an alternative
          embodiment, one of the electrodes is positioned directly on
          top of the field guide. </p>

          <b>2006-12-07</b> </p>
        <p>AC electric fields at certain frequencies and field strengths
          disrupt dividing cells, but leave undividing cells
          substantially unharmed. Since cancer cells divide much more
          often than normal cells, those AC fields have been shown to be
          effective at inhibiting tumor growth and shrinking tumors.
          Because certain body parts (e.g., the lungs and the liver) are
          at high risk for developing metastases in patients with some
          forms of cancer, treating those body parts with those AC
          fields can prevent metastases from growing in those body
          parts. This treatment may be used both after a metastasis has
          reached a detectable size and prophylactically (to prevent
          such metastases from ever reaching a detectable size in the
          first place). It may also be used to prevent cancer in people
          with a high probability of developing cancer (e.g., based on
          family history). </p>

        <p>Cells that are in the late anaphase or telophase stages of
          cell division are vulnerable to damage by AC electric fields
          that have specific frequency and field strength
          characteristics. The selective destruction of rapidly dividing
          cells can therefore be accomplished by imposing an AC electric
          field in a target region for extended periods of time. Some of
          the cells that divide while the field is applied will be
          damaged, but the cells that do not divide will not be harmed.
          This selectively damages rapidly dividing cells like tumor
          cells, but does not harm normal cells that are not dividing.
          Since the vulnerability of the dividing cells is strongly
          related to the alignment between the long axis of the dividing
          cells and the lines of force of the electric field, improved
          results are obtained when the field is sequentially imposed in
          different directions. The field may also be rotated through
          360 DEG by applying AC waveforms with different phases to the
          electrodes. </p>

        <p>As compared to conventional electrodes, the electrode
          configurations disclosed herein minimize irritation and damage
          to the skin when they are placed in contact with a patient's
          body over extended of time. The electrodes are formed from a
          conductive substrate coated with a thin dielectric material,
          and a plurality of open spaces pass through the electrodes.
          Those open spaces are distributed and sized to permit moisture
          on the surface of the patient's body to escape when the
          electrode is placed in contact with the patient's body. One
          intended use for the electrodes is for treating tumors by
          applying an AC electric field with specific frequency and
          field strength characteristics over an extended period of

        &nbsp;[0002] This invention concerns selective destruction of
        rapidly dividing cells in a localized area, and more
        particularly, selectively destroying dividing cells without
        destroying nearby non-dividing cells by applying an electric
        field with specific characteristics to a target area in a living
        patient. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND </span><br>
        <br>
        [0003] All living organisms proliferate by cell division,
        including cell cultures, microorganisms (such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, yeast, protozoa, and other single-celled organisms),
        fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Dividing cells of organisms can
        be destroyed, or their proliferation controlled, by methods that
        are based on the sensitivity of the dividing cells of these
        organisms to certain agents. For example, certain antibiotics
        stop the multiplication process of bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0004] The process of eukaryotic cell division is called
        "mitosis", which involves nice distinct phases (see Darnell et
        al. , Molecular Cell Biology, New York: Scientific American
        Books, 1986, p. 149). During interphase, the cell replicates
        chromosomal DNA, which begins condensing in early prophase. At
        this point, centrioles (each cell contains 2) begin moving
        towards opposite poles of the cell. In middle prophase, each
        chromosome is composed of duplicate chromatids. Microtubular
        spindles radiate from regions adjacent to the centrioles, which
        are closer to their poles. By late prophase, the centrioles have
        reached the poles, and some spindle fibers extend to the center
        of the cell, while others extend from the poles to the
        chromatids. The cells then move into metaphase, when the
        chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell and align in the
        equatorial plane. Next is early anaphase, during which time
        daughter chromatids separate from each other at the equator by
        moving along the spindle fibers toward a centromere at opposite
        poles. The cell begins to elongate along the axis of the pole;
        the pole-to-pole spindles also elongate. Late anaphase occurs
        when the daughter chromosomes (as they are now called) each
        reach their respective opposite poles. At this point,
        cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow begins to form at the
        equator of the cell. In other words, late anaphase is the point
        at which pinching the cell membrane begins. During telophase,
        cytokinesis is nearly complete and spindles disappear. Only a
        relatively narrow membrane connection joins the two cytoplasms.
        Finally, the membranes separate fully, cytokinesis is complete
        and the cell returns to interphase. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] In meiosis, the cell undergoes a second division,
        involving separation of sister chromosomes to opposite poles of
        the cell along spindle fibers, followed by formation of a
        cleavage furrow and cell division. However, this division is not
        preceded by chromosome replication, yielding a haploid germ
        cell. Bacteria also divide by chromosome replication, followed
        by cell separation. However, since the daughter chromosomes
        separate by attachment to membrane components; there is no
        visible apparatus that contributes to cell division as in
        eukaryotic cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0006] It is well known that tumors, particularly
        malignant or cancerous tumors, grow uncontrollably compared to
        normal tissue. Such expedited growth enables tumors to occupy an
        ever-increasing space and to damage or destroy tissue adjacent
        thereto. Furthermore, certain cancers are characterized by an
        ability to transmit cancerous "seeds", including single cells or
        small cell clusters (metastases), to new locations where the
        metastatic cancer cells grow into additional tumors.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0007] The rapid growth of tumors, in general, and
        malignant tumors in particular, as described above, is the
        result of relatively frequent cell division or multiplication of
        these cells compared to normal tissue cells. The distinguishably
        frequent cell division of cancer cells is the basis for the
        effectiveness of existing cancer treatments, e. g., irradiation
        therapy and the use of various chemo-therapeutic agents. Such
        treatments are based on the fact that cells undergoing division
        are more sensitive to radiation and chemo-therapeutic agents
        than non-dividing cells. Because tumors cells divide much more
        frequently than normal cells, it is possible, to a certain
        extent, to selectively damage or destroy tumor cells by
        radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The actual sensitivity of
        cells to radiation, therapeutic agents, etc. , is also dependent
        on specific characteristics of different types of normal or
        malignant cell types. Thus, unfortunately, the sensitivity of
        tumor cells is not sufficiently higher than that many types of
        normal tissues. This diminishes the ability to distinguish
        between tumor cells and normal cells, and therefore, existing
        cancer treatments typically cause significant damage to normal
        tissues, thus limiting the therapeutic effectiveness of such
        treatments. Furthermore, the inevitable damage to other tissue
        renders treatments very traumatic to the patients and, often,
        patients are unable to recover from a seemingly successful
        treatment. Also, certain types of tumors are not sensitive at
        all to existing methods of treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0008] There are also other methods for destroying cells
        that do not rely on radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone. For
        example, ultrasonic and electrical methods for destroying tumor
        cells can be used in addition to or instead of conventional
        treatments. Electric fields and currents have been used for
        medical purposes for many years. The most common is the
        generation of electric currents in a human or animal body by
        application of an electric field by means of a pair of
        conductive electrodes between which a potential difference is
        maintained. These electric currents are used either to exert
        their specific effects, i. e., to stimulate excitable tissue, or
        to generate heat by flowing in the body since it acts as a
        resistor. Examples of the first type of application include the
        following: cardiac defibrillators, peripheral nerve and muscle
        stimulators, brain stimulators, etc. Currents are used for
        heating, for example, in devices for tumor ablation, ablation of
        malfunctioning cardiac or brain tissue, cauterization,
        relaxation of muscle rheumatic pain and other pain, etc.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0009] Another use of electric fields for medical purposes
        involves the utilization of high frequency oscillating fields
        transmitted from a source that emits an electric wave, such as
        an RF wave or a microwave source that is directed at the part of
        the body that is of interest (i. e., target). In these
        instances, there is no electric energy conduction between the
        source and the body; but rather, the energy is transmitted to
        the body by radiation or induction. More specifically, the
        electric energy generated by the source reaches the vicinity of
        the body via a conductor and is transmitted from it through air
        or some other electric insulating material to the human body.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0010] In a conventional electrical method, electrical
        current is delivered to a region of the target tissue using
        electrodes that are placed in contact with the body of the
        patient. The applied electrical current destroys substantially
        all cells in the vicinity of the target tissue. Thus, this type
        of electrical method does not discriminate between different
        types of cells within the target tissue and results in the
        destruction of both tumor cells and normal cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0011] Electric fields that can be used in medical
        applications can thus be separated generally into two different
        modes. In the first mode, the electric fields are applied to the
        body or tissues by means of conducting electrodes. These
        electric fields can be separated into two types, namely (1)
        steady fields or fields that change at relatively slow rates,
        and alternating fields of low frequencies that induce
        corresponding electric currents in the body or tissues, and (2)
        high frequency alternating fields (above 1 MHz) applied to the
        body by means of the conducting electrodes. In the second mode,
        the electric fields are high frequency alternating fields
        applied to the body by means of insulated electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0012] The first type of electric field is used, for
        example, to stimulate nerves and muscles, pace the heart, etc.
        In fact, such fields are used in nature to propagate signals in
        nerve and muscle fibers, central nervous system (CNS), heart,
        etc. The recording of such natural fields is the basis for the
        ECG, EEG, EMG, ERG, etc. The field strength in these
        applications, assuming a medium of homogenous electric
        properties, is simply the voltage applied to the
        stimulating/recording electrodes divided by the distance between
        them. These currents can be calculated by Ohm's law and can have
        dangerous stimulatory effects on the heart and CNS and can
        result in potentially harmful ion concentration changes. Also,
        if the currents are strong enough, they can cause excessive
        heating in the tissues. This heating can be calculated by the
        power dissipated in the tissue (the product of the voltage and
        the current).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0013] When such electric fields and currents are
        alternating, their stimulatory power, on nerve, muscle, etc. ,
        is an inverse function of the frequency. At frequencies above
        1-10 KHz, the stimulation power of the fields approaches zero.
        This limitation is due to the fact that excitation induced by
        electric stimulation is normally mediated by membrane potential
        changes, the rate of which is limited by the RC properties (time
        constants on the order of 1 ms) of the membrane. [0014]
        Regardless of the frequency, when such current inducing fields
        are applied, they are associated with harmful side effects
        caused by currents. For example, one negative effect is the
        changes in ionic concentration in the various "compartments"
        within the system, and the harmful products of the electrolysis
        taking place at the electrodes, or the medium in which the
        tissues are imbedded. The changes in ion concentrations occur
        whenever the system includes two or more compartments between
        which the organism maintains ion concentration differences. For
        example, for most tissues, [Ca@] in the extracellular fluid is
        about 2#10-3 M, while in the cytoplasm of typical cells its
        concentration can be as low as 10-7 M. A current induced in such
        a system by a pair of electrodes, flows in part from the
        extracellular fluid into the cells and out again into the
        extracellular medium. About 2% of the current flowing into the
        cells is carried by the Ca@ ions. In contrast, because the
        concentration of intracellular Ca@ is much smaller, only a
        negligible fraction of the currents that exits the cells is
        carried by these ions. Thus, Ca++ ions accumulate in the cells
        such that their concentrations in the cells increases, while the
        concentration in the extracellular compartment may decrease.
        These effects are observed for both DC and alternating currents
        (AC). The rate of accumulation of the ions depends on the
        current intensity ion mobilities, membrane ion conductance, etc.
        An increase in [Ca++] is harmful to most cells and if
        sufficiently high will lead to the destruction of the cells.
        Similar considerations apply to other ions. In view of the above
        observations, long term current application to living organisms
        or tissues can result in significant damage. Another major
        problem that is associated with such electric fields, is due to
        the electrolysis process that takes place at the electrode
        surfaces. Here charges are transferred between the metal
        (electrons) and the electrolytic solution (ions) such that
        charged active radicals are formed. These can cause significant
        damage to organic molecules, especially macromolecules and thus
        damage the living cells and tissues. [0015] In contrast, when
        high frequency electric fields, above 1 MHz and usually in
        practice in the range of GHz, are induced in tissues by means of
        insulated electrodes, the situation is quite different. These
        type of fields generate only capacitive or displacement
        currents, rather than the conventional charge conducting
        currents. Under the effect of this type of field, living tissues
        behave mostly according to their dielectric properties rather
        than their electric conductive properties. Therefore, the
        dominant field effect is that due to dielectric losses and
        heating. Thus, it is widely accepted that in practice, the
        meaningful effects of such fields on living organisms, are only
        those due to their heating effects, i. e., due to dielectric
        losses.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] In <span style="font-weight: bold;">U. S. Pat. No.
          6,043,066 ('066) to Mangano</span>, a method and device are
        presented which enable discrete objects having a conducting
        inner core, surrounded by a dielectric membrane to be
        selectively inactivated by electric fields via irreversible
        breakdown of their dielectric membrane. One potential
        application for this is in the selection and purging of certain
        biological cells in a suspension. According to the '066 patent,
        an electric field is applied for targeting selected cells to
        cause breakdown of the dielectric membranes of these tumor
        cells, while purportedly not adversely affecting other desired
        subpopulations of cells. The cells are selected on the basis of
        intrinsic or induced differences in a characteristic <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">electroporation</span> threshold.
        The differences in this threshold can depend upon a number of
        parameters, including the difference in cell size. <br>
        <br>
        [0017] The method of the '066 patent is therefore based on the
        assumption that the electroporation threshold of tumor cells is
        sufficiently distinguishable from that of normal cells because
        of differences in cell size and differences in the dielectric
        properties of the cell membranes. Based upon this assumption,
        the larger size of many types of tumor cells makes these cells
        more susceptible to electroporation and thus, it may be possible
        to selectively damage only the larger tumor cell membranes by
        applying an appropriate electric field. One disadvantage of this
        method is that the ability to discriminate is highly dependent
        upon cell type, for example, the size difference between normal
        cells and tumor cells is significant only in certain types of
        cells. Another drawback of this method is that the voltages
        which are applied can damage some of the normal cells and may
        not damage all of the tumor cells because the differences in
        size and membrane dielectric properties are largely statistical
        and the actual cell geometries and dielectric properties can
        vary significantly. <br>
        <br>
        [0018] What is needed in the art and has heretofore not been
        available is an apparatus for destroying dividing cells, wherein
        the apparatus better discriminates between dividing cells,
        including single-celled organisms, and non-dividing cells and is
        capable of selectively destroying the dividing cells or
        organisms with substantially no effect on the non-dividing cells
        or organisms. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0019] While they are<span style="font-weight: bold;"> dividing,
          cells are vulnerable to damage by AC electric fields that have
          specific frequency and field strength characteristics</span>.
        The selective destruction of rapidly dividing cells can
        therefore be accomplished by imposing an AC electric field in a
        target region for extended periods of time. Some of the cells
        that divide while the field is applied will be damaged, but the
        cells that do not divide will not be harmed. This selectively
        damages rapidly dividing cells like tumor cells, but does not
        harm normal cells that are not dividing. Improved results may be
        achieved by using a field with two or more frequencies. <br>
        <br>
        [0020] A major use of the present apparatus is in the treatment
        of tumors by selective destruction of tumor cells with
        substantially no effect on normal tissue cells, and thus, the
        exemplary apparatus is described below in the context of
        selective destruction of tumor cells. It should be appreciated
        however, that for purpose of the following description, the term
        "cell" may also refer to a single-celled organism (eubacteria,
        bacteria, yeast, protozoa), multi- celled organisms (fungi,
        algae, mold), and plants as or parts thereof that are not
        normally classified as "cells". The exemplary apparatus enables
        selective destruction of cells undergoing division in a way that
        is more effective and more accurate (e. g., more adaptable to be
        aimed at specific targets) than existing methods. Further, the
        present apparatus causes minimal damage, if any, to normal
        tissue and, thus, reduces or eliminates many side-effects
        associated with existing selective destruction methods, such as
        radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The selective destruction of
        dividing cells using the present apparatus does not depend on
        the sensitivity of the cells to chemical agents or radiation.
        Instead, the selective destruction of dividing cells is based on
        distinguishable geometrical characteristics of cells undergoing
        division, in comparison to non-dividing cells, regardless of the
        cell geometry of the type of cells being treated. <br>
        <br>
        [0021] According to one exemplary embodiment, cell
        geometry-dependent selective destruction of living tissue is
        performed by inducing a non-homogenous electric field in the
        cells using an electronic apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0022] It has been observed by the present inventor that,
        while different cells in their non-dividing state may have
        different shapes, e. g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
        "pancake-like", etc. , the division process of practically all
        cells is characterized by development of a "cleavage furrow" in
        late anaphase and telophase. This cleavage furrow is a slow
        constriction of the cell membrane (between the two sets of
        daughter chromosomes) which appears microscopically as a growing
        cleft (e. g., a groove or notch) that gradually separates the
        cell into two new cells. During the division process, there is a
        transient period (telophase) during which the cell structure is
        basically that of two sub-cells interconnected by a narrow
        "bridge" formed of the cell material. The division process is
        completed when the "bridge" between the two sub-cells is broken.
        The selective destruction of tumor cells using the present
        electronic apparatus utilizes this unique geometrical feature of
        dividing cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0023] When a cell or a group of cells are under natural
        conditions or environment, i. e., part of a living tissue, they
        are disposed surrounded by a conductive environment consisting
        mostly of an electrolytic inter-cellular fluid and other cells
        that are composed mostly of an electrolytic intra-cellular
        liquid. When an electric field is induced in the living tissue,
        by applying an electric potential across the tissue, an electric
        field is formed in the tissue and the specific distribution and
        configuration of the electric field lines defines the direction
        of charge displacement, or paths of electric currents in the
        tissue, if currents are in fact induced in the tissue. The
        distribution and configuration of the electric field is
        dependent on various parameters of the tissue, including the
        geometry and the electric properties of the different tissue
        components, and the relative conductivities, capacities and
        dielectric constants (that may be frequency dependent) of the
        tissue components. <br>
        <br>
        [0024] The electric current flow pattern for cells undergoing
        division is very different and unique as compared to
        non-dividing cells. Such cells including first and second
        sub-cells, namely an "original" cell and a newly formed cell,
        that are connected by a cytoplasm "bridge" or "neck". The
        currents penetrate the first sub-cell through part of the
        membrane ("the current source pole") ; however, they do not exit
        the first sub-cell through a portion of its membrane closer to
        the opposite pole ("the current sink pole"). Instead, the lines
        of current flow converge at the neck or cytoplasm bridge,
        whereby the density of the current flow lines is greatly
        increased. A corresponding, "mirror image", process that takes
        place in the second sub-cell, whereby the current flow lines
        diverge to a lower density configuration as they depart from the
        bridge, and finally exit the second sub-cell from a part of its
        membrane closes to the current sink. <br>
        <br>
        [0025] When a polarizable object is placed in a non-uniform
        converging or diverging field, electric forces act on it and
        pull it towards the higher density electric field lines. In the
        case of dividing cell, electric forces are exerted in the
        direction of the cytoplasm bridge between the two cells. Since
        all intercellular organelles and macromolecules are polarizable,
        they are all forced towards the bridge between the two cells.
        The field polarity is irrelevant to the direction of the force
        and, therefore, an alternating electric having specific
        properties can be used to produce substantially the same effect.
        It will also be appreciated that the concentrated and
        inhomogeneous electric field present in or near the bridge or
        neck portion in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can lead to the disruption of structures
        associated with these members. <br>
        <br>
        [0026] The movement of the cellular organelles towards the
        bridge disrupts the cell structure and results in increased
        pressure in the vicinity of the connecting bridge membrane. This
        pressure of the organelles on the bridge membrane is expected to
        break the bridge membrane and, thus, it is expected that the
        dividing cell will "explode" in response to this pressure.<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> The ability to break the membrane
          and disrupt other cell structures can be enhanced by applying
          a pulsating alternating electric field that has a frequency
          from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz.</span> When this type of
        electric field is applied to the tissue, the forces exerted on
        the intercellular organelles have a "hammering" effect, whereby
        force pulses (or beats) are applied to the organelles numerous
        times per second, enhancing the movement of organelles of
        different sizes and masses towards the bridge (or neck) portion
        from both of the sub-cells, thereby increasing the probability
        of breaking the cell membrane at the bridge portion. The forces
        exerted on the intracellular organelles also affect the
        organelles themselves and may collapse or break the organelles.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0027] According to one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus for
        applying the electric field is an electronic apparatus that
        generates the desired electric signals in the shape of waveforms
        or trains of pulses. The electronic apparatus includes a
        generator that generates an alternating voltage waveform at
        frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz. The
        generator is operatively connected to conductive leads which are
        connected at their other ends to insulated conductors/electrodes
        (also referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold;">isolects</span>)
        that are activated by the generated waveforms. The insulated
        electrodes consist of a conductor in contact with a dielectric
        (insulating layer) that is in contact with the conductive
        tissue, thus forming a capacitor. The electric fields that are
        generated by the present apparatus can be applied in several
        different modes depending upon the precise treatment
        application. <br>
        <br>
        [0028] In one exemplary embodiment, the electric fields are
        applied by external insulated electrodes which are incorporated
        into an article of clothing and which are constructed so that
        the applied electric fields are of a local type that target a
        specific, localized area of tissue (e. g., a tumor). This
        embodiment is designed to treat tumors and lesions that are at
        or below the skin surface by wearing the article of clothing
        over the target tissue so that the electric fields generated by
        the insulated electrodes are directed at the tumors (lesions,
        etc.). <br>
        <br>
        [0029] According to another embodiment, the apparatus is used in
        an internal type application in that the insulated electrodes
        are in the form of a probe or catheter etc. , that enter the
        body through natural pathways, such as the urethra or vagina, or
        are configured to penetrate living tissue; until the insulated
        electrodes are positioned near the internal target area (e.g.,
        an internal tumor). <br>
        <br>
        [0030] Thus, the present apparatus utilizes electric fields that
        fall into a special intermediate category relative to previous
        high and low frequency applications in that the present electric
        fields are bio-effective fields that have no meaningful
        stimulatory effects and no thermal effects. Advantageously, when
        non-dividing cells are subjected to these electric fields, there
        is no effect on the cells; however, the situation is much
        different when dividing cells are subjected to the present
        electric fields. Thus, the present electronic apparatus and the
        generated electric fields target dividing cells, such as tumors
        or the like, and do not target non-dividing cells that is found
        around in healthy tissue surrounding the target area.
        Furthermore, since the present apparatus utilizes insulated
        electrodes, the above mentioned negative effects, obtained when
        conductive electrodes are used, i. e., ion concentration changes
        in the cells and the formation of harmful agents by
        electrolysis, do not occur with the present apparatus. This is
        because, in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place
        between the electrodes and the medium, and there is no charge
        flow in the medium where the currents are capacitive. <br>
        <br>
        [0031] It should be appreciated that the present electronic
        apparatus can also be used in applications other than treatment
        of tumors in the living body. In fact, the selective destruction
        utilizing the present apparatus can be used in conjunction with
        any organism that proliferates by division, for example, tissue
        cultures, microorganisms, such as bacteria, mycoplasma,
        protozoa, fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Such organisms divide
        by the formation of a groove or cleft as described above. As the
        groove or cleft deepens, a narrow bridge is formed between the
        two parts of the organism, similar to the bridge formed between
        the sub- cells of dividing animal cells. Since such organisms
        are covered by a membrane having a relatively low electric
        conductivity, similar to an animal cell membrane described
        above, the electric field lines in a dividing organism converge
        at the bridge connecting the two parts of the dividing organism.
        The converging field lines result in electric forces that
        displace polarizable elements and charges within the dividing
        organism. <br>
        <br>

        the present apparatus will become apparent from the following

          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <br>
          <br>
        </span>[0065] Reference is made to FIGS. 1A-1E which
        schematically illustrate various stages of a cell division
        process. FIG. 1A illustrates a cell 10 at its normal geometry,
        which can be generally spherical (as illustrated in the
        drawings), ellipsoidal, cylindrical, "pancake- like" or any
        other cell geometry, as is known in the art. FIGS. 1B-1D
        illustrate cell 10 during different stages of its division
        process, which results in the formation of two new cells 18 and
        20, shown in FIG. 1E. [0066] As shown in FIGS. 1B-1D, the
        division process of cell 10 is characterized by a slowly growing
        cleft 12 which gradually separates cell 10 into two units,
        namely sub-cells 14 and 16, which eventually evolve into new
        cells 18 and 20 (FIG. 1E). A shown specifically in FIG. 1D, the
        division process is characterized by a transient period during
        which the structure of cell 10 is basically that of the two
        sub-cells 14 and 16 interconnected by a narrow "bridge" 22
        containing cell material (cytoplasm surrounded by cell
        membrane). [0067] Reference is now made to FIGS. 2A and 2B,
        which schematically illustrate non-dividing cell 10 being
        subjected to an electric field produced by applying an
        alternating electric potential, at a relatively low frequency
        and at a relatively high frequency, respectively. Cell 10
        includes intracellular organelles, e. g., a nucleus 30.
        Alternating electric potential is applied across electrodes 28
        and 32 that can be attached externally to a patient at a
        predetermined region, e. g., in the vicinity of the tumor being
        treated. When cell 10 is under natural conditions, i. e., part
        of a living tissue, it is disposed in a conductive environment
        (hereinafter referred to as a "volume conductor") consisting
        mostly of electrolytic inter- cellular liquid. When an electric
        potential is applied across electrodes 28 and 32, some of the
        field lines of the resultant electric field (or the current
        induced in the tissue in response to the electric field)
        penetrate the cell 10, while the rest of the field lines (or
        induced current) flow in the surrounding medium. The specific
        distribution of the electric field lines, which is substantially
        consistent with the direction of current flow in this instance,
        depends on the geometry and the electric properties of the
        system components, e. g., the relative conductivities and
        dielectric constants of the system components, that can be
        frequency dependent. For low frequencies, e. g., frequencies
        lower than 10 KHz, the conductance properties of the components
        completely dominate the current flow and the field distribution,
        and the field distribution is generally as depicted in FIG. 2A.
        At higher frequencies, e. g., at frequencies of between 10 KHz
        and 1 MHz, the dielectric properties of the components becomes
        more significant and eventually dominate the field distribution,
        resulting in field distribution lines as depicted generally in
        FIG. 2B.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0068] For constant (i. e., DC) electric fields or
        relatively low frequency alternating electric fields, for
        example, frequencies under 10 KHz, the dielectric properties of
        the various components are not significant in determining and
        computing the field distribution. Therefore, as a first
        approximation, with regard to the electric field distribution,
        the system can be reasonably represented by the relative
        impedances of its various components. Using this approximation,
        the intercellular (i. e., extracellular) fluid and the
        intracellular fluid each has a relatively low impedance, while
        the cell membrane 11 has a relatively high impedance. Thus,
        under low frequency conditions, only a fraction of the electric
        field lines (or currents induced by the electric field)
        penetrate membrane 11 of the cell 10. At relatively high
        frequencies (e. g., 10 KHz-1 MHz), in contrast, the impedance of
        membrane 11 relative to the intercellular and intracellular
        fluids decreases, and thus, the fraction of currents penetrating
        the cells increases significantly. It should be noted that at
        very high frequencies, i. e., above 1 MHz, the membrane
        capacitance can short the membrane resistance and, therefore,
        the total membrane resistance can become negligible.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0069] In any of the embodiments described above, the
        electric field lines (or induced currents) penetrate cell 10
        from a portion of the membrane 11 closest to one of the
        electrodes generating the current, e. g., closest to positive
        electrode 28 (also referred to herein as "source"). The current
        flow pattern across cell 10 is generally uniform because, under
        the above approximation, the field induced inside the cell is
        substantially homogeneous. The currents exit cell 10 through a
        portion of membrane 11 closest to the opposite electrode, e.g.,
        negative electrode 32 (also referred to herein as "sink"). <br>
        <br>
        [0070] The distinction between field lines and current flow can
        depend on a number of factors, for example, on the frequency of
        the applied electric potential and on whether electrodes 28 and
        32 are electrically insulated. For insulated electrodes applying
        a DC or low frequency alternating voltage, there is practically
        no current flow along the lines of the electric field. At higher
        frequencies, the displacement currents are induced in the tissue
        due to charging and discharging of the electrode insulation and
        the cell membranes (which act as capacitors to a certain
        extent), and such currents follow the lines of the electric
        field. Fields generated by non-insulated electrodes, in
        contrast, always generate some form of current flow,
        specifically, DC or low frequency alternating fields generate
        conductive current flow along the field lines, and high
        frequency alternating fields generate both conduction and
        displacement currents along the field lines. It should be
        appreciated, however, that movement of polarizable intracellular
        organelles according to the present invention (as described
        below) is not dependent on actual flow of current and,
        therefore, both insulated and non-insulated electrodes can be
        used efficiently. Advantages of insulated electrodes include
        lower power consumption, less heating of the treated regions,
        and improved patient safety. <br>
        <br>
        [0071] According to one exemplary embodiment of the present
        invention, the electric fields that are used are alternating
        fields having frequencies that are in the range from about 50
        KHz to about 500 KHz, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">preferably



          from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz</span>. For ease of
        discussion, these type of electric fields are also referred to
        below as "<span style="font-weight: bold;">TC fields</span>",
        which is an abbreviation of "Tumor Curing electric fields",
        since these electric fields fall into an intermediate category
        (between high and low frequency ranges) that have bio-effective
        field properties while having no meaningful stimulatory and
        thermal effects. These frequencies are sufficiently low so that
        the system behavior is determined by the system's Ohmic
        (conductive) properties but sufficiently high enough not to have
        any stimulation effect on excitable tissues. Such a system
        consists of two types of elements, namely, the intercellular, or
        extracellular fluid, or medium and the individual cells.<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> The intercellular fluid is mostly
          an electrolyte with a specific resistance of about 40-100
          Ohm*cm</span>. As mentioned above, the cells are characterized
        by three elements, namely (1) a thin, highly electric resistive
        membrane that coats the cell; (2) internal cytoplasm that is
        mostly an electrolyte that contains numerous macromolecules and
        micro-organelles, including the nucleus; and (3) membranes,
        similar in their electric properties to the cell membrane, cover
        the micro-organelles. <br>
        <br>
        [0072] When this type of system is subjected to the present<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> TC fields (e. g., alternating
          electric fields in the frequency range of 100 KHz-300 KHz) </span>most









        of the lines of the electric field and currents tend away from
        the cells because of the high resistive cell membrane and
        therefore the lines remain in the extracellular conductive
        medium. In the above recited frequency range,<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> the actual fraction of electric
          field or currents that penetrates the cells is a strong
          function of the frequency. </span><br>
        <br>
        [0073] FIG. 2 schematically depicts the resulting field
        distribution in the system. As illustrated, the lines of force,
        which also depict the lines of potential current flow across the
        cell volume mostly in parallel with the undistorted lines of
        force (the main direction of the electric field). In other
        words, the field inside the cells is mostly homogeneous. In
        practice, the fraction of the field or current that penetrates
        the cells is determined by the cell membrane impedance value
        relative to that of the extracellular fluid. Since the
        equivalent electric circuit of the cell membrane is that of a
        resistor and capacitor in parallel, the impedance is a function
        of the frequency. The higher the frequency, the lower the
        impedance, the larger the fraction of penetrating current and
        the smaller the field distortion (Rotshenker S. &amp; Y. Palti,
        Changes infraction of current penetrating an axon as a function
        of duration of stimulating pulse, J. Theor. Biol. 41; 401-407
        (1973). <br>
        <br>
        [0074] As previously mentioned, when cells are subjected to
        relatively weak electric fields and currents that alternate at
        high frequencies, such as the present TC fields having a
        frequency in the range of 50 KHz-500 KHz, they have no effect on
        the non-dividing cells. While the present TC fields have no
        detectable effect on such systems, the situation becomes
        different in the presence of dividing cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0075] Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A-3C which schematically
        illustrate the electric current flow pattern in cell 10 during
        its division process, under the influence of alternating fields
        (TC fields) in the frequency range from about 100 KHz to about
        300 KHz in accordance with one exemplary embodiment. The field
        lines or induced currents penetrate cell 10 through a part of
        the membrane of sub-cell 16 closer to electrode 28. However,
        they do not exit through the cytoplasm bridge 22 that connects
        sub-cell 16 with the newly formed yet still attached sub-cell
        14, or through a part of the membrane in the vicinity of the
        bridge 22. Instead, the electric field or current flow
        lines--that are relatively widely separated in sub- cell
        16--converge as they approach bridge 22 (also referred to as
        "neck" 22) and, thus, the current/field line density within neck
        22 is increased dramatically. A "mirror image" process takes
        place in sub-cell 14, whereby the converging field lines in
        bridge 22 diverge as they approach the exit region of sub-cell
        14. <br>
        <br>
        [0076] It should be appreciated by persons skilled in the art
        that homogeneous electric fields do not exert a force on
        electrically neutral objects, i. e., objects having
        substantially zero net charge, although such objects can become
        polarized. However, under a non-uniform, converging electric
        field, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3C, electric forces are exerted on
        polarized objects, moving them in the direction of the higher
        density electric field lines. It will be appreciated that the
        concentrated electric field that is present in the neck or
        bridge area in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can disrupt structures that are associated
        therewith. One will understand that similar net forces act on
        charges in an alternating field, again in the direction of the
        field of higher intensity. <br>
        <br>
        [0077] In the configuration of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the direction of
        movement of polarized and charged objects is towards the higher
        density electric field lines, i. e., towards the cytoplasm
        bridge 22 between sub-cells 14 and 16. It is known in the art
        that all intracellular organelles, for example, nuclei 24 and 26
        of sub-cells 14 and 16, respectively, are polarizable and, thus,
        such intracellular organelles are electrically forced in the
        direction of the bridge 22. Since the movement is always from
        lower density currents to the higher density currents,
        regardless of the field polarity, the forces applied by the
        alternating electric field to organelles, such as nuclei 24 and
        26, are always in the direction of bridge 22. A comprehensive
        description of such forces and the resulting movement of
        macromolecules of intracellular organelles, a phenomenon
        referred to as "dielectrophoresis" is described extensively in
        literature, e. g., in C. L. Asbury &amp; G. van den Engh,
        Biophys. J. 74, 1024-1030, 1998, the disclosure of which is
        hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. <br>
        <br>
        [0078] The movement of the organelles 24 and 26 towards the
        bridge 22 disrupts the structure of the dividing cell, change
        the concentration of the various cell constituents and,
        eventually, the pressure of the converging organelles on bridge
        membrane 22 results in the breakage of cell membrane 11 at the
        vicinity of the bridge 22, as shown schematically in FIG. 3C.
        The ability to break membrane 11 at bridge 22 and to otherwise
        disrupt the cell structure and organization can be enhanced by
        applying a pulsating AC electric field, rather than a steady AC
        field. When a pulsating field is applied, the forces acting on
        organelles 24 and 26 have a "hammering" effect, whereby pulsed
        forces beat on the intracellular organelles towards the neck 22
        from both sub-cells 14 and 16, thereby increasing the
        probability of breaking cell membrane 11 in the vicinity of neck
        22. <br>
        <br>
        [0079] A very important element, which is very susceptible to
        the special fields that develop within the dividing cells is the
        microtubule spindle that plays a major role in the division
        process. In FIG. 4, a dividing cell 10 is illustrated, at an
        earlier stage as compared to FIGS. 3A and 3B, under the
        influence of external TC fields (e. g., alternating fields in
        the frequency range of about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz),
        generally indicated as lines 100, with a corresponding spindle
        mechanism generally indicated at 120. The lines 120 are
        microtubules that are known to have a very strong dipole moment.
        This strong polarization makes the tubules, as well as other
        polar macromolecules and especially those that have a specific
        orientation within the cells or its surrounding, susceptible to
        electric fields. Their positive charges are located at the two
        centrioles while two sets of negative poles are at the center of
        the dividing cell and the other pair is at the points of
        attachment of the microtubules to the cell membrane, generally
        indicated at 130. This structure forms sets of double dipoles
        and therefore they are susceptible to fields of different
        directions. It will be understood that the effect of the TC
        fields on the dipoles does not depend on the formation of the
        bridge (neck) and thus, the dipoles are influenced by the TC
        fields prior to the formation of the bridge (neck). <br>
        <br>
        [0080] Since the present apparatus (as will be described in
        greater detail below) utilizes insulated electrodes, the
        above-mentioned negative effects obtained when conductive
        electrodes are used, i. e., ion concentration changes in the
        cells and the formation of harmful agents by electrolysis, do
        not occur when the present apparatus is used. This is because,
        in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place between
        the electrodes and the medium and there is no charge flow in the
        medium where the currents are capacitive, i. e., are expressed
        only as rotation of charges, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0081] Turning now to FIG. 5, the TC fields described above that
        have been found to advantageously destroy tumor cells are
        generated by an electronic apparatus 200. FIG. 5 is a simple
        schematic diagram of the electronic apparatus 200 illustrating
        the major components thereof. The electronic apparatus 200
        generates the desired electric signals (TC signals) in the shape
        of waveforms or trains of pulses. The apparatus 200 includes a
        generator 210 and a pair of conductive leads 220 that are
        attached at one end thereof to the generator 210. The opposite
        ends of the leads 220 are connected to insulated conductors 230
        that are activated by the electric signals (e. g., waveforms).
        The insulated conductors 230 are also referred to hereinafter as
        isolects 230. Optionally and according to another exemplary
        embodiment, the apparatus 200 includes a temperature sensor 240
        and a control box 250 which are both added to control the
        amplitude of the electric field generated so as not to generate
        excessive heating in the area that is treated. <br>
        <br>
        [0082] The generator 210 generates an alternating voltage
        waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz (preferably from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz) (i. e.,
        the TC fields). The required voltages are such that the electric
        field intensity in the tissue to be treated is in the range of
        about 0.1 V/cm to about 10 V/cm. To achieve this field, the
        actual potential difference between the two conductors in the
        isolects 230 is determined by the relative impedances of the
        system components, as described below. <br>
        <br>
        [0083] When the control box 250 is included, it controls the
        output of the generator 210 so that it will remain constant at
        the value preset by the user or the control box 250 sets the
        output at the maximal value that does not cause excessive
        heating, or the control box 250 issues a warning or the like
        when the temperature (sensed by temperature sensor 240) exceeds
        a preset limit.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0084] The leads 220 are standard isolated conductors with
        a flexible metal shield, preferably grounded so that it prevents
        the spread of the electric field generated by the leads 220. The
        isolects 230 have specific shapes and positioning so as to
        generate an electric field of the desired configuration,
        direction and intensity at the target volume and only there so
        as to focus the treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0085] The specifications of the apparatus 200 as a whole and
        its individual components are largely influenced by the fact
        that at the frequency of the present TC fields (50 KHz-500 KHz),
        living systems behave according to their "Ohmic", rather than
        their dielectric properties. The only elements in the apparatus
        200 that behave differently are the insulators of the isolects
        230 (see FIGS. 7-9). The isolects 200 consist of a conductor in
        contact with a dielectric that is in contact with the conductive
        tissue thus forming a capacitor.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0086] The details of the construction of the isolects 230
        is based on their electric behavior that can be understood from
        their simplified electric circuit when in contact with tissue as
        generally illustrated in FIG. 6. In the illustrated arrangement,
        the potential drop or the electric field distribution between
        the different components is determined by their relative
        electric impedance, i. e., the fraction of the field on each
        component is given by the value of its impedance divided by the
        total circuit impedance. For example, the potential drop on
        element A VA=A/(A+B+C+D+E). Thus, for DC or low frequency AC,
        practically all the potential drop is on the capacitor (that
        acts as an insulator). For relatively very high frequencies, the
        capacitor practically is a short and therefore, practically all
        the field is distributed in the tissues. At the frequencies of
        the present TC fields (e. g., 50 KHz to 500 KHz), which are
        intermediate frequencies, the impedance of the capacitance of
        the capacitors is dominant and determines the field
        distribution. Therefore, in order to increase the effective
        voltage drop across the tissues (field intensity), the impedance
        of the capacitors is to be decreased (i. e., increase their
        capacitance). This can be achieved by increasing the effective
        area of the "plates" of the capacitor, decrease the thickness of
        the dielectric or use a dielectric with high dielectric
        constant. <br>
        <br>
        [0087] In order to optimize the field distribution, the isolects
        230 are configured differently depending upon the application in
        which the isolects 230 are to be used. There are two principle
        modes for applying the present electric fields (TC fields).
        First, the TC fields can be applied by external isolects and
        second, the TC fields can be applied by internal isolects.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0088] Electric fields (TC fields) that are applied by
        external isolects can be of a local type or widely distributed
        type. The first type includes, for example, the treatment of
        skin tumors and treatment of lesions close to the skin surface.
        FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary embodiment where the isolects
        230 are incorporated in a skin patch 300. The skin patch 300 can
        be a self-adhesive flexible patch with one or more pairs of
        isolects 230. The patch 300 includes internal insulation 310
        (formed of a dielectric material) and the external insulation
        260 and is applied to skin surface 301 that contains a tumor 303
        either on the skin surface 301 or slightly below the skin
        surface 301. Tissue is generally indicated at 305. To prevent
        the potential drop across the internal insulation 310 to
        dominate the system, the internal insulation 310 must have a
        relatively high capacity. This can be achieved by a large
        surface area; however, this may not be desired as it will result
        in the spread of the field over a large area (e. g., an area
        larger than required to treat the tumor). Alternatively, the
        internal insulation 310 can be made very thin and/or the
        internal insulation 310 can be of a high dielectric constant. As
        the skin resistance between the electrodes (labeled as A and E
        in FIG. 6) is normally significantly higher than that of the
        tissue (labeled as C in FIG. 6) underneath it (1-10 K# vs. 0.1-1
        K#), most of the potential drop beyond the isolects occurs
        there. To accommodate for these impedances (Z), the
        characteristics of the internal insulation 310 (labeled as B and
        D in FIG. 6) should be such that they have impedance preferably
        under 100 K# at the frequencies of the present TC fields (e. g.,
        50 KHz to 500 KHz). For example, if it is desired for the
        impedance to be about 10 K Ohms or less, such that over 1% of
        the applied voltage falls on the tissues, for isolects with a
        surface area of 10 mm, at frequencies of 200 KHz, the capacity
        should be on the order of 10-10 F. , which means that using
        standard insulations with a dielectric constant of 2-3, the
        thickness of the insulating layer 310 should be about 50-100
        microns. An internal field 10 times stronger would be obtained
        with insulators with a dielectric constant of about 20-50. <br>
        <br>
        [0089] Using an insulating material with a high dielectric
        constant increases the capacitance of the electrodes, which
        results in a reduction of the electrodes' impedance to the AC
        signal that is applied by the generator 1 (shown in FIG. 5).
        Because the electrodes A, E are wired in series with the target
        tissue C, as shown in FIG. 6, this reduction in impedance
        reduces the voltage drop in the electrodes, so that a larger
        portion of the applied AC voltage appears across the tissue C.
        Since a larger portion of the voltage appears across the tissue,
        the voltage that is being applied by the generator 1 can be
        advantageously lowered for a given field strength in the tissue.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0090] The desired field strength in the tissue being treated is
        preferably between about 0.1 V/cm and about 10 V/cm, and more
        preferably between about 2 V/cm and 3 V/cm or between about 1
        V/cm and about 5 V/cm. If the dielectric constant used in the
        electrode is sufficiently high, the impedance of the electrodes
        A, E drops down to the same order of magnitude as the series
        combination of the skin and tissue B, C, D. One example of a
        suitable material with an extremely high dielectric constant is
        CaCu3Ti4O12, which has a dielectric constant of about 11,000
        (measured at 100 kHz). When the dielectric constant is this
        high, useful fields can be obtained using a generator voltage
        that is on the order of a few tens of Volts. <br>
        <br>
        [0091] Since the thin insulating layer can be very vulnerable,
        etc. , the insulation can be replaced by very high dielectric
        constant insulating materials, such as titanium dioxide (e. g.,
        rutile), the dielectric constant can reach values of about 200.
        There a number of different materials that are suitable for use
        in the intended application and have high dielectric constants.
        For example, some materials include: lithium niobate (LiNb03),
        which is a ferroelectric crystal and has a number of
        applications in optical, pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices;
        yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is a ferromagnetic crystal and
        magneto- optical devices, e. g., optical isolator can be
        realized from this material; barium titanate (BaTi03) is a
        ferromagnetic crystal with a large electro-optic effect;
        potassium tantalate (KTa03) which is a dielectric crystal
        (ferroelectric at low temperature) and has very low microwave
        loss and tunability of dielectric constant at low temperature;
        and lithium tantalate (LiTa03) which is a ferroelectric crystal
        with similar properties as lithium niobate and has utility in
        electro-optical, pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices.
        Insulator ceramics with high dielectric constants may also be
        used, such as a ceramic made of a combination of Lead Magnesium
        Niobate and Lead Titanate. It will be understood that the
        aforementioned exemplary materials can be used in combination
        with the present device where it is desired to use a material
        having a high dielectric constant. <br>
        <br>
        [0092] One must also consider another factor that affects the
        effective capacity of the isolects 230, namely the presence of
        air between the isolects 230 and the skin. Such presence, which
        is not easy to prevent, introduces a layer of an insulator with
        a dielectric constant of 1.0, a factor that significantly lowers
        the effective capacity of the isolects 230 and neutralizes the
        advantages of the titanium dioxide (rutile), etc. To overcome
        this problem, the isolects 230 can be shaped so as to conform
        with the body structure and/or (2) an intervening filler 270 (as
        illustrated in FIG. 10C), such as a gel, that has high
        conductance and a high effective dielectric constant, can be
        added to the structure. The shaping can be pre-structured (see
        FIG. 10A) or the system can be made sufficiently flexible so
        that shaping of the isolects 230 is readily achievable. The gel
        can be contained in place by having an elevated rim as depicted
        in FIGS. 10C and 10C'. The gel can be made of hydrogels,
        gelatins, agar, etc. , and can have salts dissolved in it to
        increase its conductivity. FIGS. 10A-10C' illustrate various
        exemplary configurations for the isolects 230. The exact
        thickness of the gel is not important so long as it is of
        sufficient thickness that the gel layer does not dry out during
        the treatment. In one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of the
        gel is about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm. Preferably, the gel has high
        conductivity, is tacky, and is biocompatible for extended
        periods of time. One suitable gel is AG603 Hydrogel, which is
        available from AmGel Technologies, 1667 S. Mission Road,
        Fallbrook, CA 92028-4115, USA.<br>

        &nbsp;[0093] In order to achieve the desirable features of the
        isolects 230, the dielectric coating of each should be very
        thin, for example from between 1-50 microns. Since the coating
        is so thin, the isolects 230 can easily be damaged mechanically
        or undergo dielectric breakdown. This problem can be overcome by
        adding a protective feature to the isolect's structure so as to
        provide desired protection from such damage. For example, the
        isolect 230 can be coated, for example, with a relatively loose
        net 340 that prevents access to the surface but has only a minor
        effect on the effective surface area of the isolect 230 (i. e.,
        the capacity of the isolects 230 (cross section presented in
        FIG. 12B). The loose net 340 does not effect the capacity and
        ensures good contact with the skin, etc. The loose net 340 can
        be formed of a number of different materials; however, in one
        exemplary embodiment, the net 340 is formed of nylon, polyester,
        cotton, etc. Alternatively, a very thin conductive coating 350
        can be applied to the dielectric portion (insulating layer) of
        the isolect 230. One exemplary conductive coating is formed of a
        metal and more particularly of gold. The thickness of the
        coating 350 depends upon the particular application and also on
        the type of material used to form the coating 350; however, when
        gold is used, the coating has a thickness from about 0.1 micron
        to about 0.1 mm. Furthermore, the rim illustrated in FIG. 10 can
        also provide some mechanical protection. <br>
        <br>
        [0094] However, the capacity is not the only factor to be
        considered. The following two factors also influence how the
        isolects 230 are constructed. The dielectric strength of the
        internal insulating layer 310 and the dielectric losses that
        occur when it is subjected to the TC field, i. e., the amount of
        heat generated. The dielectric strength of the internal
        insulation 310 determines at what field intensity the insulation
        will be "shorted" and cease to act as an intact insulation.
        Typically, insulators, such as plastics, have dielectric
        strength values of about 100V per micron or more. As a high
        dielectric constant reduces the field within the internal
        insulator 310, a combination of a high dielectric constant and a
        high dielectric strength gives a significant advantage. This can
        be achieved by using a single material that has the desired
        properties or it can be achieved by a double layer with the
        correct parameters and thickness. In addition, to further
        decreasing the possibility that the insulating layer 310 will
        fail, all sharp edges of the insulating layer 310 should be
        eliminated as by rounding the comers, etc., as illustrated in
        FIG. 10D using conventional techniques. <br>
        <br>
        [0095] FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a second type of treatment using
        the isolects 230, namely electric field generation by internal
        isolects 230. A body to which the isolects 230 are implanted is
        generally indicated at 311 and includes a skin surface 313 and a
        tumor 315. In this embodiment, the isolects 230 can have the
        shape of plates, wires or other shapes that can be inserted
        subcutaneously or a deeper location within the body 311 so as to
        generate an appropriate field at the target area (tumor 315). <br>
        <br>
        [0096] It will also be appreciated that the mode of isolects
        application is not restricted to the above descriptions. In the
        case of tumors in internal organs, for example, liver, lung,
        etc. , the distance between each member of the pair of isolects
        230 can be large. The pairs can even by positioned opposite
        sides of a torso 410, as illustrated in FIG. 11. The arrangement
        of the isolects 230 in FIG. 11 is particularly useful for
        treating a tumor 415 associated with lung cancer or
        gastro-intestinal tumors. In this embodiment, the electric
        fields (TC fields) spread in a wide fraction of the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0097] In order to avoid overheating of the treated tissues, a
        selection of materials and field parameters is needed. The
        isolects insulating material should have minimal dielectric
        losses at the frequency ranges to be used during the treatment
        process. This factor can be taken into consideration when
        choosing the particular frequencies for the treatment. The
        direct heating of the tissues will most likely be dominated by
        the heating due to current flow (given by the I*R product). In
        addition, the isolect (insulated electrode) 230 and its
        surroundings should be made of materials that facilitate heat
        losses and its general structure should also facilitate head
        losses, i. e., minimal structures that block heat dissipation to
        the surroundings (air) as well as high heat conductivity. Using
        larger electrodes also minimizes the local sensation of heating,
        since it spreads the energy that is being transferred into the
        patient over a larger surface area. Preferably, the heating is
        minimized to the point where the patient's skin temperature
        never exceeds about 39 C. <br>
        <br>
        [0098] Another way to reduce heating is to apply the field to
        the tissue being treated intermittently, by applying a field
        with a duty cycle between about 20% and about 50% instead of
        using a continuous field. For example, to achieve a duty cycle
        of 33%, the field would be repetitively switched on for one
        second, then switched off for two seconds. Preliminary
        experiments have shown that the efficacy of treatment using a
        field with a 33% duty cycle is roughly the same as for a field
        with a duty cycle of 100%. In alternative embodiments, the field
        could be switched on for one hour then switched off for one hour
        to achieve a duty cycle of 50%. Of course, switching at a rate
        of once per hour would not help minimize short-term heating. On
        the other hand, it could provide the patient with a welcome
        break from treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0099] The effectiveness of the treatment can be enhanced by an
        arrangement of isolects 230 that focuses the field at the
        desired target while leaving other sensitive areas in low field
        density (i. e., protected areas). The proper placement of the
        isolects 230 over the body can be maintained using any number of
        different techniques, including using a suitable piece of
        clothing that keeps the isolects at the appropriate positions.
        FIG. 13 illustrates such an arrangement in which an area labeled
        as "P" represents a protected area. The lines of field force do
        not penetrate this protected area and the field there is much
        smaller than near the isolects 230 where target areas can be
        located and treated well. In contrast, the field intensity near
        the four poles is very high. <br>
        <br>
        [00100] The following Example serves to illustrate an exemplary
        application of the present apparatus and application of TC
        fields; however, this Example is not limiting and does not limit
        the scope of the present invention in any way. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [00101] To demonstrate the effectiveness of electric fields
        having the above described properties (e. g., frequencies
        between 50 KHz and 500 KHz) in destroying tumor cells, the
        electric fields were applied to treat mice with malignant
        melanoma tumors. Two pairs of isolects 230 were positioned over
        a corresponding pair of malignant melanomas. Only one pair was
        connected to the generator 210 and 200 KHz alternating electric
        fields (TC fields) were applied to the tumor for a period of 6
        days. One melanoma tumor was not treated so as to permit a
        comparison between the treated tumor and the non-treated tumor.
        After treatment for 6 days, the pigmented melanoma tumor
        remained clearly visible in the non-treated side of the mouse,
        while, in contrast, no tumor is seen on the treated side of the
        mouse. The only areas that were visible discemable on the skin
        were the marks that represented the points of insertion of the
        isolects 230. The fact that the tumor was eliminated at the
        treated side was further demonstrated by cutting and inversing
        the skin so that its inside face was exposed. Such a procedure
        indicated that the tumor has been substantially, if not
        completely, eliminated on the treated side of the mouse. The
        success of the treatment was also further verified by
        histopathological examination. <br>
        <br>
        [00102] The present inventor has thus uncovered that electric
        fields having particular properties can be used to destroy
        dividing cells or tumors when the electric fields are applied to
        using an electronic device. More specifically, these electric
        fields fall into a special intermediate category, namely
        bio-effective fields that have no meaningful stimulatory and no
        thermal effects, and therefore overcome the disadvantages that
        were associated with the application of conventional electric
        fields to a body. It will also be appreciated that the present
        apparatus can further include a device for rotating the TC field
        relative to the living tissue. For example and according to one
        embodiment, the alternating electric potential applies to the
        tissue being treated is rotated relative to the tissue using
        conventional devices, such as a mechanical device that upon
        activation, rotates various components of the present system. <br>
        <br>
        [00103] Moreover and according to yet another embodiment, the TC
        fields are applied to different pairs of the insulated
        electrodes 230 in a consecutive manner. In other words, the
        generator 210 and the control system thereof can be arranged so
        that signals are sent at periodic intervals to select pairs of
        insulated electrodes 230, thereby causing the generation of the
        TC fields of different directions by these insulated electrodes
        230. Because the signals are sent at select times from the
        generator to the insulated electrodes 230, the TC fields of
        changing directions are generated consecutively by different
        insulated electrodes 230. This arrangement has a number of
        advantages and is provided in view of the fact that the TC
        fields have maximal effect when they are parallel to the axis of
        cell division. Since the orientation of cell division is in most
        cases random, only a fraction of the dividing cells are affected
        by any given field. Thus, using fields of two or more
        orientations increases the effectiveness since it increases the
        chances that more dividing cells are affected by a given TC
        field. <br>
        <br>
        [00104] In vitro experiments have shown that the electric field
        has the maximum killing effect when the lines of force of the
        field are oriented generally parallel to the long axis of the
        hourglass-shaped cell during mitosis (as shown in FIGS. 3A-3C).
        In one experiment, a much higher proportion of the damaged cells
        had their axis of division oriented along the field: 56% of the
        cells oriented at or near 0 with respect to the field were
        damaged, versus an average of 15% of cells damaged for cells
        with their long axis oriented at more than 22 with respect to
        the field. <br>
        <br>
        [00105] The inventor has recognized that applying the field in
        different directions sequentially will increase the overall
        killing power, because the field orientation that is most
        effectively in killing dividing cells will be applied to a
        larger population of the dividing cells. A number of examples
        for applying the field in different directions are discussed
        below. <br>
        <br>
        [00106] FIGS. 27A, 27B, and 27C show a set of 6 electrodes
        E1-E6, and how the direction of the field through the target
        tissue 1510 can be changed by applying the AC signal from the
        generator 1 (shown in FIG. 1) across different pairs of
        electrodes. For example, if the AC signal is applied across
        electrodes El and E4, the field lines F would be vertical (as
        shown in FIG. 27A), and if the signal is applied across
        electrodes E2 and E5, or across electrodes E3 and E6, the field
        lines F would be diagonal (as shown in FIGS. 27B and 27C,
        respectively). Additional field directions can be obtained by
        applying the AC signal across other pairs of electrodes. For
        example, a roughly horizontal field could be obtained by
        applying the signal across electrodes E2 and E6. <br>
        <br>
        [00107] In one embodiment, the AC signal is applied between the
        various pairs of electrodes sequentially. An example of this
        arrangement is to apply the AC signal across electrodes E1 and
        E4 for one second, then apply the AC signal across electrodes E2
        and E5 for one second, and then apply the AC signal across
        electrodes E3 and E6 for one second. This three-part sequence is
        then repeated for the desired period of treatment. Because the
        efficacy in cell-destruction is strongly dependant on the cell's
        orientation, cycling the field between the different directions
        increases the chance that the field will be oriented in a
        direction that favors cell destruction at least part of the
        time. <br>
        <br>
        [00108] Of course, the 6 electrode configuration shown in FIGS.
        27A-C is just one of many possible arrangement of multiple
        electrodes, and many other configurations of three or more
        electrodes could be used based on the same principles. <br>
        <br>
        [00109] Application of the field in different directions
        sequentially is not limited to two dimensional embodiments, and
        FIG. 28 shows how the sequential application of signals across
        different sets of electrodes can be extended to three
        dimensions. A first array of electrodes Al-A9 is arranged around
        body part 1500, and a last array of electrodes N1-N9 is arranged
        around the body part 1500 a distance W away from the first
        array. Additional arrays of electrodes may optionally be added
        between the first array and the last array, but these additional
        arrays are not illustrated for clarity (so as not to obscure the
        electrodes A5- A9 and B5-B8 on the back of the body part 1500).
        <br>
        <br>
        [00110] As in the FIG. 27 embodiment, the direction of the field
        through the target tissue can be changed by applying the AC
        signal from the generator 1 (shown in FIG. 1) across different
        pairs of electrodes. For example, applying the AC signal between
        electrodes A2 and A7 would result in a field in a front-to-back
        direction between those two electrodes, and applying the AC
        signal between electrodes A5 and A9 would result in a roughly
        vertical field between those two electrodes. Similarly, applying
        the AC signal across electrodes A2 and N7 would generate
        diagonal field lines in one direction through the body part
        1500, and applying the AC signal across electrodes A2 and B7
        would generate diagonal field lines in another direction through
        the body part.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00111] Using a three-dimensional array of electrodes also
        makes it possible to energize multiple pairs of electrodes
        simultaneously to induce fields in the desired directions. For
        example, if suitable switching is provided so that electrodes A2
        through N2 are all connected to one terminal of the generator,
        and so that electrodes A7 through N7 are all connected to the
        other terminal of the generator, the resulting field would be a
        sheet that extends in a front-to-back direction for the entire
        width W. After the front-to-back field is maintained for a
        suitable duration (e. g., one second), the switching system (not
        shown) is reconfigured to connect electrodes A3 through N3 to
        one terminal of the generator, and electrodes A8 through N8 to
        the other terminal of the generator. This results in a sheet-
        shaped field that is rotated about the Z axis by about 40 with
        respect to the initial field direction. After the field is
        maintained in this direction for a suitable duration (e. g., one
        second), the next set of electrodes is activated to rotate the
        field an additional 40 to its next position. This continues
        until the field returns to its initial position, at which point
        the whole process is repeated. <br>
        <br>
        [00112] Optionally, the rotating sheet-shaped field may be added
        (sequentially in time) to the diagonal fields described above,
        to better target cells that are oriented along those diagonal
        axes. <br>
        <br>
        [00113] Because the electric field is a vector, the signals may
        optionally be applied to combinations of electrodes
        simultaneously in order to form a desired resultant vector. For
        example, a field that is rotated about the X axis by 20 with
        respect to the initial position can be obtained by switching
        electrodes A2 through N2 and A3 through N3 all to one terminal
        of the generator, and switching electrodes A7 through N7 and A8
        through N8 all to the other terminal of the generator. Applying
        the signals to other combinations of electrodes will result in
        fields in other directions, as will be appreciated by persons
        skilled in the relevant arts. If appropriate computer control of
        the voltages is implemented, the field's direction can even be
        swept through space in a continuous (i. e., smooth) manner, as
        opposed to the stepwise manner described above. <br>
        <br>
        [00114] FIGS. 29A and 29B depict the results of in vitro
        experiments that show how the killing power of the applied field
        against dividing cells is a function of the field strength. In
        the FIG. 29A experiment, B16F1 melanoma cells were subjected to
        a 100 kHz AC field at different field strengths, for a period of
        24 hours at each strength. In the FIG. 29B experiment, F-98
        glioma cells were subjected to a 200 kHz AC field at different
        field strengths, for a period of 24 hours at each strength. In
        both of these figures, the strength of the field (EF) is
        measured in Volts per cm. The magnitude of the killing effect is
        expressed in terms of TER, which is which is the ratio of the
        decrease in the growth rate of treated cells (GRT) compared with
        the growth rate of control cells (GRc). EMI29.1 The experimental
        results show that the inhibitory effect of the applied field on
        proliferation increases with intensity in both the melanoma and
        the glioma cells. Complete proliferation arrest (TER = 1) is
        seen at 1.35 and 2.25 V/cm in melanoma and glioma cells,
        respectively.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00115] FIGS. 30A and 30B depict the results of in vitro
        experiments that show how the killing power of the applied field
        is a function of the frequency of the field. In the experiments,
        B16F1 melanoma cells (FIG. 30A) and F-98 glioma cells (FIG. 30B)
        were subjected to fields with different frequencies, for a
        period of 24 hours at each frequency. FIGS. 30A and 30B show the
        change in the growth rate, normalized to the field intensity
        (TER/EF). Data are shown as mean + SE. In FIG. 30A, a window
        effect is seen with maximal inhibition at 120 kHz in melanoma
        cells. In FIG. 30B, two peaks are seen at 170 and 250 kHz. Thus,
        if only one frequency is available during an entire course of
        treatment, a field with a frequency of about 120 kHz would be
        appropriate for destroying melanoma cells, and a field with a
        frequency on the order of 200 kHz would be appropriate for
        destroying glioma cells. <br>
        <br>
        [00116] Not all the cells of any given type will have the exact
        same size. Instead, the cells will have a distribution of sizes,
        with some cells being smaller and some cells being larger. It is
        believed that the best frequency for damaging a particular cell
        is related to the physical characteristics (e. g., the size) of
        that particular cell. Thus, to best damage a population of cells
        with a distribution of sizes, it can be advantageous to apply a
        distribution of different frequencies to the population, where
        the selection of frequencies is optimized based on the expected
        size distribution of the target cells. For example, the data on
        FIG. 30B indicates that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> using
          two frequencies of 170 kHz and 250 kHz to destroy a population
          of glioma cells would be more effective than using a single
          frequency of 200 kHz.</span><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00117] Note that the optimal field strengths and
        frequencies discussed herein were obtained based on in vitro
        experiments, and that the corresponding parameters for in vivo
        applications may be obtained by performing similar experiments
        in vivo. It is possible that relevant characteristics of the
        cell itself (such as size and/or shape) or interactions with the
        cell's surroundings may result in a different set of optimal
        frequencies and/or field strengths for in vivo applications.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00118] When more than one frequency is used, the various
        frequencies may be applied sequentially in time. For example, in
        the case of glioma, field frequencies of 100, 150,170, 200, 250,
        and 300 kHz may be applied during the first, second, third,
        fourth, fifth, and sixth minutes of treatment, respectively.
        That cycle of frequencies would then repeat during each
        successive six minutes of treatment. Alternatively, the
        frequency of the field may be swept in a stepless manner from
        100 to 300 kHz.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00119] Optionally, this frequency cycling may be combined
        with the directional cycling described above. FIG. 31A is an
        example of such a combination using three directions (D1, D2,
        and D3) and three frequencies (F1, F2, and F3). Of course, the
        same scheme can be extended to any other number of directions
        and/or frequencies. FIG. 31B is an example of such a combination
        using three directions (D1, D2, and D3), sweeping the frequency
        from 100 kHz to 300 kHz.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Note</span>
        that the break in the time axis between tl and t2 provides the
        needed time for the sweeping frequency to rise to just under 300
        kHz. The frequency sweeping (or stepping) may be synchronized
        with directional changes, as shown in FIG. 31A. Alternatively,
        the frequency sweeping (or stepping) may be asynchronous with
        respect to the directional changes, as shown in FIG. 31B.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00120] In an alternative embodiment, a signal that
        contains two or more frequencies components simultaneously (e.
        g., 170 kHz and 250 kHz) is applied to the electrodes to treat a
        populations of cells that have a distribution of sizes. The
        various signals will add by superposition to create a field that
        includes all of the applied frequency components.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00121] Turning now to FIG. 14 in which an article of
        clothing 500 according to one exemplary embodiment is
        illustrated. More specifically, the article of clothing 500 is
        in the form of a hat or cap or other type of clothing designed
        for placement on a head of a person. For purposes of
        illustration, a head 502 is shown with the hat 500 being placed
        thereon and against a skin surface 504 of the head 502. An
        intra-cranial tumor or the like 510 is shown as being formed
        within the head 502 underneath the skin surface 504 thereof. The
        hat 500 is therefore intended for placement on the head 502 of a
        person who has a tumor 510 or the like.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00122] Unlike the various embodiments illustrated in
        FIGS. 1-13 where the insulated electrodes 230 are arranged in a
        more or less planar arrangement since they are placed either on
        a skin surface or embedded within the body underneath it, the
        insulated electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically
        contoured and arranged for a specific application. The treatment
        of intra-cranial tumors or other lesions or the like typically
        requires a treatment that is of a relatively long duration, e.
        g., days to weeks, and therefore, it is desirable to provide as
        much comfort as possible to the patient. The hat 500 is
        specifically designed to provide comfort during the lengthy
        treatment process while not jeopardizing the effectiveness of
        the treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00123] According to one exemplary embodiment, the hat 500
        includes a predetermined number of insulated electrodes 230 that
        are preferably positioned so as to produce the optimal TC fields
        at the location of the tumor 510. The lines of force of the TC
        field are generally indicated at 520. As can be seen in FIG. 14,
        the tumor 510 is positioned within these lines of force 520. As
        will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are positioned within the hat 500 such that a
        portion or surface thereof is free to contact the skin surface
        504 of the head 502. In other words, when the patient wears the
        hat 500, the insulated electrodes 230 are placed in contact with
        the skin surface 504 of the head 502 in positions that are
        selected so that the TC fields generated thereby are focused at
        the tumor 510 while leaving surrounding areas in low density.
        Typically, hair on the head 502 is shaved in selected areas to
        permit better contact between the insulated electrodes 230 and
        the skin surface 504; however, this is not critical.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00124] The hat 500 preferably includes a mechanism 530
        that applies a force to the insulated electrodes 230 so that
        they are pressed against the skin surface 502. For example, the
        mechanism 530 can be of a biasing type that applies a biasing
        force to the insulated electrodes 230 to cause the insulated
        electrodes 230 to be directed outwardly away from the hat 500.
        Thus, when the patient places the hat 500 on his/her head 502,
        the insulated electrodes 230 are pressed against the skin
        surface 504 by the mechanism 530. The mechanism 530 can slightly
        recoil to provide a comfortable fit between the insulated
        electrodes 230 and the head 502. In one exemplary embodiment,
        the mechanism 530 is a spring based device that is disposed
        within the hat 500 and has one section that is coupled to and
        applies a force against the insulated electrodes 230.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00125] As with the prior embodiments, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are coupled to the generator 210 by means of
        conductors 220. The generator 210 can be either disposed within
        the hat 500 itself so as to provide a compact, self-sufficient,
        independent system or the generator 210 can be disposed external
        to the hat 500 with the conductors 220 exiting the hat 500
        through openings or the like and then running to the generator
        210. When the generator 210 is disposed external to the hat 500,
        it will be appreciated that the generator 210 can be located in
        any number of different locations, some of which are in close
        proximity to the hat 500 itself, while others can be further
        away from the hat 500. For example, the generator 210 can be
        disposed within a carrying bag or the like (e. g., a bag that
        extends around the patient's waist) which is worn by the patient
        or it can be strapped to an extremity or around the torso of the
        patient. The generator 210 can also be disposed in a protective
        case that is secured to or carried by another article of
        clothing that is worn by the patient. For example, the
        protective case can be inserted into a pocket of a sweater, etc.
        FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment where the generator 210 is
        incorporated directly into the hat 500.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00126] Turning now to FIGS. 15 and 16, in one exemplary
        embodiment, a number of insulated electrodes 230 along with the
        mechanism 530 are preferably formed as an independent unit,
        generally indicated at 540, that can be inserted into the hat
        500 and electrically connected to the generator (not shown) via
        the conductors (not shown). By providing these members in the
        form of an independent unit, the patient can easily insert
        and/or remove the units 540 from the hat 500 when they may need
        cleaning, servicing and/or replacement. <br>
        <br>
        [00127] In this embodiment, the hat 500 is constructed to
        include select areas 550 that are formed in the hat 500 to
        receive and hold the units 540. For example and as illustrated
        in FIG. 15, each area 550 is in the form of an opening (pore)
        that is formed within the hat 500. The unit 540 has a body 542
        and includes the mechanism 530 and one or more insulated
        electrodes 230. The mechanism 530 is arranged within the unit
        540 so that a portion thereof (e. g., one end thereof) is in
        contact with a face of each insulated electrode 230 such that
        the mechanism 530 applies a biasing force against the face of
        the insulated electrode 230. Once the unit 540 is received
        within the opening 550, it can be securely retained therein
        using any number of conventional techniques, including the use
        of an adhesive material or by using mechanical means. For
        example, the hat 500 can include pivotable clip members that
        pivot between an open position in which the opening 550 is free
        and a closed position in which the pivotable clip members engage
        portions (e. g., peripheral edges) of the insulated electrodes
        to retain and hold the insulated electrodes 230 in place. To
        remove the insulated electrodes 230, the pivotable clip members
        are moved to the open position. In the embodiment illustrated in
        FIG. 16, the insulated electrodes 230 are retained within the
        openings 550 by an adhesive element 560 which in one embodiment
        is a two sided self-adhesive rim member that extends around the
        periphery of the insulated electrode 230. In other words, a
        protective cover of one side of the adhesive rim 560 is removed
        and it is applied around the periphery of the exposed face of
        the insulated electrode 230, thereby securely attaching the
        adhesive rim 560 to the hat 500 and then the other side of the
        adhesive rim 560 is removed for application to the skin surface
        504 in desired locations for positioning and securing the
        insulated electrode 230 to the head 502 with the tumor being
        positioned relative thereto for optimization of the TC fields.
        Since one side of the adhesive rim 560 is in contact with and
        secured to the skin surface 540, this is why it is desirable for
        the head 502 to be shaved so that the adhesive rim 560 can be
        placed flushly against the skin surface 540. <br>
        <br>
        [00128] The adhesive rim 560 is designed to securely attach the
        unit 540 within the opening 550 in a manner that permits the
        unit 540 to be easily removed from the hat 500 when necessary
        and then replaced with another unit 540 or with the same unit
        540. As previously mentioned, the unit 540 includes the biasing
        mechanism 530 for pressing the insulated electrode 230 against
        the skin surface 504 when the hat 500 is worn. The unit 540 can
        be constructed so that side opposite the insulated electrode 230
        is a support surface formed of a rigid material, such as
        plastic, so that the biasing mechanism 530 (e. g., a spring) can
        be compressed therewith under the application of force and when
        the spring 530 is in a relaxed state, the spring 530 remains in
        contact with the support surface and the applies a biasing force
        at its other end against the insulated electrode 230. The
        biasing mechanism 530 (e. g., spring) preferably has a contour
        corresponding to the skin surface 504 so that the insulated
        electrode 230 has a force applied thereto to permit the
        insulated electrode 230 to have a contour complementary to the
        skin surface 504, thereby permitting the two to seat flushly
        against one another. While the mechanism 530 can be a spring,
        there are a number of other embodiments that can be used instead
        of a spring. For example, the mechanism 530 can be in the form
        of an elastic material, such as a foam rubber, a foam plastic,
        or a layer containing air bubbles, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [00129] The unit 540 has an electric connector 570 that can be
        hooked up to a corresponding electric connector, such as a
        conductor 220, that is disposed within the hat 500. The
        conductor 220 connects at one end to the unit 540 and at the
        other end is connected to the generator 210. The generator 210
        can be incorporated directly into the hat 500 or the generator
        210 can be positioned separately (remotely) on the patient or on
        a bedside support, etc. [00130] As previously discussed, a
        coupling agent, such as a conductive gel, is preferably used to
        ensure that an effective conductive environment is provided
        between the insulated electrode 230 and the skin surface 504.
        Suitable gel materials have been disclosed hereinbefore in the
        discussion of earlier embodiments. The coupling agent is
        disposed on the insulated electrode 230 and preferably, a
        uniform layer of the agent is provided along the surface of the
        electrode 230. One of the reasons that the units 540 need
        replacement at periodic times is that the coupling agent needs
        to be replaced and/or replenished. In other words, after a
        predetermined time period or after a number of uses, the patient
        removes the units 540 so that the coupling agent can be applied
        again to the electrode 230.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00131] FIGS. 17 and 18 illustrate another article of
        clothing which has the insulated electrodes 230 incorporated as
        part thereof. More specifically, a bra or the like 700 is
        illustrated and includes a body that is formed of a traditional
        bra material, generally indicated at 705, to provide shape,
        support and comfort to the wearer. The bra 700 also includes a
        fabric support layer 710 on one side thereof. The support layer
        710 is preferably formed of a suitable fabric material that is
        constructed to provide necessary and desired support to the bra
        700. <br>
        <br>
        [00132] Similar to the other embodiments, the bra 700 includes
        one or more insulated electrodes 230 disposed within the bra
        material 705. The one or more insulated electrodes are disposed
        along an inner surface of the bra 700 opposite the support 710
        and are intended to be placed proximate to a tumor or the like
        that is located within one breast or in the immediately
        surrounding area. As with the previous embodiment, the insulated
        electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically constructed
        and configured for application to a breast or the immediate
        area. Thus, the insulated electrodes 230 used in this
        application do not have a planar surface construction but rather
        have an arcuate shape that is complementary to the general
        curvature found in a typical breast. <br>
        <br>
        [00133] A lining 720 is disposed across the insulated electrodes
        230 so as to assist in retaining the insulated electrodes in
        their desired locations along the inner surface for placement
        against the breast itself. The lining 720 can be formed of any
        number of thin materials that are comfortable to wear against
        one's skin and in one exemplary embodiment, the lining 720 is
        formed of a fabric material. [00134] The bra 700 also preferably
        includes a biasing mechanism 800 as in some of the earlier
        embodiments. The biasing mechanism 800 is disposed within the
        bra material 705 and extends from the support 710 to the
        insulated electrode 230 and applies a biasing force to the
        insulated electrode 230 so that the electrode 230 is pressed
        against the breast. This ensures that the insulated electrode
        230 remains in contact with the skin surface as opposed to
        lifting away from the skin surface, thereby creating a gap that
        results in a less effective treatment since the gap diminishes
        the efficiency of the TC fields. The biasing mechanism 800 can
        be in the form of a spring arrangement or it can be an elastic
        material that applies the desired biasing force to the insulated
        electrodes 230 so as to press the insulated electrodes 230 into
        the breast. In the relaxed position, the biasing mechanism 800
        applies a force against the insulated electrodes 230 and when
        the patient places the bra 700 on their body, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are placed against the breast which itself
        applies a force that counters the biasing force, thereby
        resulting in the insulated electrodes 230 being pressed against
        the patient's breast. In the exemplary embodiment that is
        illustrated, the biasing mechanism 800 is in the form of springs
        that are disposed within the bra material 705. <br>
        <br>
        [00135] A conductive gel 810 can be provided on the insulated
        electrode 230 between the electrode and the lining 720. The
        conductive gel layer 810 is formed of materials that have been
        previously described herein for performing the functions
        described above. <br>
        <br>
        [00136] An electric connector 820 is provided as part of the
        insulated electrode 230 and electrically connects to the
        conductor 220 at one end thereof, with the other end of the
        conductor 220 being electrically connected to the generator 210.
        In this embodiment, the conductor 220 runs within the bra
        material 705 to a location where an opening is formed in the bra
        700. The conductor 220 extends through this opening and is
        routed to the generator 210, which in this embodiment is
        disposed in a location remote from the bra 700. It will also be
        appreciated that the generator 210 can be disposed within the
        bra 700 itself in another embodiment. For example, the bra 700
        can have a compartment formed therein which is configured to
        receive and hold the generator 210 in place as the patient wears
        the bra 700. In this arrangement, the compartment can be covered
        with a releasable strap that can open and close to permit the
        generator 210 to be inserted therein or removed therefrom. The
        strap can be formed of the same material that is used to
        construct the bra 700 or it can be formed of some other type of
        material. The strap can be releasably attached to the
        surrounding bra body by fastening means, such as a hook and loop
        material, thereby permitting the patient to easily open the
        compartment by separating the hook and loop elements to gain
        access to the compartment for either inserting or removing the
        generator 210.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00137] The generator 210 also has a connector 211 for
        electrical connection to the conductor 220 and this permits the
        generator 210 to be electrically connected to the insulated
        electrodes 230<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00138] As with the other embodiments, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are arranged in the bra 700 to focus the electric
        field (TC fields) on the desired target (e. g., a tumor). It
        will be appreciated that the location of the insulated
        electrodes 230 within the bra 700 will vary depending upon the
        location of the tumor. In other words, after the tumor has been
        located, the physician will then devise an arrangement of
        insulated electrodes 230 and the bra 700 is constructed in view
        of this arrangement so as to optimize the effects of the TC
        fields on the target area (tumor). The number and position of
        the insulated electrodes 230 will therefore depend upon the
        precise location of the tumor or other target area that is being
        treated. Because the location of the insulated electrodes 230 on
        the bra 700 can vary depending upon the precise application, the
        exact size and shape of the insulated electrodes 230 can
        likewise vary. For example, if the insulated electrodes 230 are
        placed on the bottom section of the bra 700 as opposed to a more
        central location, the insulated electrodes 230 will have
        different shapes since the shape of the breast (as well as the
        bra) differs in these areas.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00139] FIG. 19 illustrates yet another embodiment in
        which the insulated electrodes 230 are in the form of internal
        electrodes that are incorporated into in the form of a probe or
        catheter 600 that is configured to enter the body through a
        natural pathway, such as the urethra, vagina, etc. In this
        embodiment, the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed on an
        outer surface of the probe 600 and along a length thereof. The
        conductors 220 are electrically connected to the electrodes 230
        and run within the body of the probe 600 to the generator 210
        which can be disposed within the probe body or the generator 210
        can be disposed independent of the probe 600 in a remote
        location, such as on the patient or at some other location close
        to the patient.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00140] Alternatively, the probe 600 can be configured to
        penetrate the skin surface or other tissues to reach an internal
        target that lies within the body. For example, the probe 600 can
        penetrate the skin surface and then be positioned adjacent to or
        proximate to a tumor that is located within the body.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00141] In these embodiments, the probe 600 is inserted
        through the natural pathway and then is positioned in a desired
        location so that the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed near
        the target area (i. e., the tumor). The generator 210 is then
        activated to cause the insulated electrodes 230 to generate the
        TC fields which are applied to the tumor for a predetermined
        length of time. It will be appreciated that the illustrated
        probe 600 is merely exemplary in nature and that the probe 600
        can have other shapes and configurations so long as they can
        perform the intended function. Preferably, the conductors (e.
        g., wires) leading from the insulated electrodes 230 to the
        generator 210 are twisted or shielded so as not to generate a
        field along the shaft.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00142] It will further be appreciated that the probes can
        contain only one insulated electrode while the other can be
        positioned on the body surface. This external electrode should
        be larger or consist of numerous electrodes so as to result in
        low lines of force-current density so as not to affect the
        untreated areas. In fact, the placing of electrodes should be
        designed to minimize the field at potentially sensitive areas.
        Optionally, the external electrodes may be held against the skin
        surface by a vacuum force (e.g., suction).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00143] FIG. 20 illustrates yet another embodiment in
        which a high standing collar member 900 (or necklace type
        structure) can be used to treat thyroid, parathyroid, laryngeal
        lesions, etc. FIG. 20 illustrates the collar member 900 in an
        unwrapped, substantially flat condition. In this embodiment, the
        insulated electrodes 230 are incorporated into a body 910 of the
        collar member 900 and are configured for placement against a
        neck area of the wearer. The insulated electrodes 230 are
        coupled to the generator 210 according to any of the manner
        described hereinbefore and it will be appreciated that the
        generator 210 can be disposed within the body 910 or it can be
        disposed in a location external to the body 910. The collar body
        910 can be formed of any number of materials that are
        traditionally used to form collars 900 that are disposed around
        a person's neck. As such, the collar 900 preferably includes a
        means 920 for adjusting the collar 900 relative to the neck. For
        example, complementary fasteners (hook and loop fasteners,
        buttons, etc. ) can be disposed on ends of the collar 900 to
        permit adjustment of the collar diameter.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00144] Thus, the construction of the present devices are
        particularly well suited for applications where the devices are
        incorporated into articles of clothing to permit the patient to
        easily wear a traditional article of clothing while at the same
        time the patient undergoes treatment. In other words, an extra
        level of comfort can be provided to the patient and the
        effectiveness of the treatment can be increased by incorporating
        some or all of the device components into the article of
        clothing. The precise article of clothing that the components
        are incorporated into will obviously vary depending upon the
        target area of the living tissue where tumor, lesion or the like
        exists. For example, if the target area is in the testicle area
        of a male patient, then an article of clothing in the form of a
        sock-like structure or wrap can be provided and is configured to
        be worn around the testicle area of the patient in such a manner
        that the insulated electrodes thereof are positioned relative to
        the tumor such that the TC fields are directed at the target
        tissue. The precise nature or form of the article of clothing
        can vary greatly since the device components can be incorporated
        into most types of articles of clothing and therefore, can be
        used to treat any number of different areas of the patient's
        body where a condition may be present.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00145] Now turning to FIGS. 21-22 in which another aspect
        of the present device is shown. In FIG. 21, a body 1000, such as
        any number of parts of a human or animal body, is illustrated.
        As in the previous embodiments, two or more insulated electrodes
        230 are disposed in proximity to the body 1000 for treatment of
        a tumor or the like (not shown) using TC fields, as has been
        previously described in great detail in the above discussion of
        other embodiments. The insulated electrode 230 has a conductive
        component and has external insulation 260 that surrounds the
        conductive component thereof. Each insulated electrode 230 is
        preferably connected to a generator (not shown) by the lead 220.
        Between each insulated electrode 220 and the body 1000, a
        conductive filler material (e. g., conductive gel member 270) is
        disposed. The insulated electrodes 230 are spaced apart from one
        another and when the generator is actuated, the insulated
        electrodes 230 generate the TC fields that have been previously
        described in great detail. The lines of the electric field (TC
        field) are generally illustrated at 1010. As shown, the electric
        field lines 1010 extend between the insulated electrodes 230 and
        through the conductive gel member 270. <br>
        <br>
        [00146] Over time or as a result of some type of event, the
        external insulation 260 of the insulated electrode 230 can begin
        to breakdown at any given location thereof. For purpose of
        illustration only, FIG. 22 illustrates that the external
        insulation 260 of one of the insulated electrodes 230 has
        experienced a breakdown 1020 at a face thereof which is adjacent
        the conductive gel member 270. It will be appreciated that the
        breakdown 1020 of the external insulation 260 results in the
        formation of a strong current flow-current density at this point
        (i. e., at the breakdown 1020). The increased current density is
        depicted by the increased number of electric field lines 1010
        and the relative positioning and distance between adjacent
        electric field lines 1010. One of the side effects of the
        occurrence of breakdown 1020 is that current exists at this
        point which will generate heat and may burn the tissues/skin
        which have a resistance. In FIG. 22, an overheated area 1030 is
        illustrated and is a region or area of the tissues/skin where an
        increased current density exits due to the breakdown 1020 in the
        external insulation 260. A patient can experience discomfort and
        pain in this area 1030 due to the strong current that exists in
        the area and the increased heat and possible burning sensation
        that exist in area 1030.<br>
        <br>
        [00147] FIG. 23 illustrates yet another embodiment in which a
        further application of the insulated electrodes 230 is shown. In
        this embodiment, the conductive gel member 270 that is disposed
        between the insulated electrode 230 and the body 1000 includes a
        conductor 1100 that is floating in that the gel material forming
        the member 270 completely surrounds the conductor 1100. In one
        exemplary embodiment, the conductor 1100 is a thin metal sheet
        plate that is disposed within the conductor 1100. As will be
        appreciated,,if a conductor, such as the plate 1100, is placed
        in a homogeneous electric field, normal to the lines of the
        electric field, the conductor 1100 practically has no effect on
        the field (except that the two opposing faces of the conductor
        1100 are equipotential and the corresponding equipotentials are
        slightly shifted). Conversely, if the conductor 1100 is disposed
        parallel to the electric field, there is a significant
        distortion of the electric field. The area in the immediate
        proximity of the conductor 1100 is not equipotential, in
        contrast to the situation where there is no conductor 1100
        present. When the conductor 1100 is disposed within the gel
        member 270, the conductor 1100 will typically not effect the
        electric field (TC field) for the reasons discussed above,
        namely that the conductor 1100 is normal to the lines of the
        electric field.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00148] If there is a breakdown of the external insulation
        260 of the insulated electrode 230, there is a strong current
        flow-current density at the point of breakdown as previously
        discussed; however, the presence of the conductor 1100 causes
        the current to spread throughout the conductor 1100 and then
        exit from the whole surface of the conductor 1100 so that the
        current reaches the body 1000 with a current density that is
        neither high nor low. Thus, the current that reaches the skin
        will not cause discomfort to the patient even when there has
        been a breakdown in the insulation 260 of the insulated
        electrode 230. It is important that the conductor 1100 is not
        grounded as this would cause it to abolish the electric field
        beyond it. Thus, the conductor 1100 is "floating" within the gel
        member 270.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00149] If the conductor 1100 is introduced into the body
        tissues 1000 and is not disposed parallel to the electric field,
        the conductor 1100 will cause distortion of the electric field.
        The distortion can cause spreading of the lines of force (low
        field density-intensity) or concentration of the lines of field
        (higher density) of the electric field, according to the
        particular geometries of the insert and its surroundings, and
        thus, the conductor 1100 can exhibit, for example, a screening
        effect. Thus, for example, if the conductor 1100 completely
        encircles an organ 1101, the electric field in the organ itself
        will be zero since this type of arrangement is a Faraday cage.
        However, because it is impractical for a conductor to be
        disposed completely around an organ, a conductive net or similar
        structure can be used to cover, completely or partially, the
        organ, thereby resulting in the electric field in the organ
        itself being zero or about zero. For example, a net can be made
        of a number of conductive wires that are arranged relative to
        one another to form the net or a set of wires can be arranged to
        substantially encircle or otherwise cover the organ 1101.
        Conversely, an organ 1103 to be treated (the target organ) is
        not covered with a member having a Faraday cage effect but
        rather is disposed in the electric field 1010 (TC fields).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00150] FIG. 24 illustrates an embodiment where the
        conductor 1100 is disposed within the body (i. e., under the
        skin) and it is located near a target (e. g., a target organ).
        By placing the conductor 1100 near the target, high field
        density (of the TC fields) is realized at the target. At the
        same time, another nearby organ can be protected by disposing
        the above described protective conductive net or the like around
        this nearby organ so as to protect this organ from the fields.
        By positioning the conductor 1100 in close proximity to the
        target, a high field density condition can be provided near or
        at the target. In other words, the conductor 1100 permits the TC
        fields to be focused at a particular area (i. e., a target).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00151] It will also be appreciated that in the embodiment
        of FIG. 24, the gel members 260 can each include a conductor as
        described with reference to FIG. 23. In such an arrangement, the
        conductor in the gel member 260 protects the skin surface
        (tissues) from any side effects that may be realized if a
        breakdown in the insulation of the insulated electrode 230
        occurs. At the same time, the conductor 1100 creates a high
        field density near the target. <br>
        <br>
        [00152] There are a number of different ways to tailor the field
        density of the electric field by constructing the electrodes
        differently and/or by strategically placing the electrodes
        relative to one another. For example, in FIG. 25, a first
        insulated electrode 1200 and a second insulated electrode 1210
        are provided and are disposed about a body 1300. Each insulated
        electrode includes a conductor that is preferably surrounded by
        an insulating material, thus the term "insulated electrode".
        Between each of the first and second electrodes 1200, 1210 and
        the body 1300, the conductive gel member 270 is provided.
        Electric field lines are generally indicated at 1220 for this
        type of arrangement. In this embodiment, the first insulated
        electrode 1200 has dimensions that are significantly greater
        than the dimensions of the second insulated electrode 1210 (the
        conductive gel member for the second insulated electrode 1210
        will likewise be smaller).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00153] By varying the dimensions of the insulated
        electrodes, the pattern of the electric field lines 1220 is
        varied. More specifically, the electric field tapers inwardly
        toward the second insulated electrode 1210 due to the smaller
        dimensions of the second insulated electrode 1210. An area of
        high field density, generally indicated at 1230, forms near the
        interface between the gel member 270 associated with the second
        insulated electrode 1210 and the skin surface. The various
        components of the system are manipulated so that the tumor
        within the skin or on the skin is within this high field density
        so that the area to be treated (the target) is exposed to
        electric field lines of a higher field density.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[00154] FIG. 26 also illustrates a tapering TC field when
        a conductor 1400 (e.g., a conductive plate) is disposed in each
        of the conductive gel members 270. In this embodiment, the size
        of the gel members 270 and the size of the conductors 1400 are
        the same or about the same despite the differences in the sizes
        of the insulated electrodes 1200, 1210. The conductors 1400
        again can be characterized as "floating plates" since each
        conductor 1400 is surrounded by the material that forms the gel
        member 270. As shown in FIG. 26, the placement of one conductor
        1400 near the insulated electrode 1210 that is smaller than the
        other insulated electrode 1200 and is also smaller than the
        conductor 1400 itself and the other insulated electrode 1200 is
        disposed at a distance therefrom, the one conductor 1400 causes
        a decrease in the field density in the tissues disposed between
        the one conductor 1400 and the other insulated electrode 1200.
        The decrease in the field density is generally indicated at
        1410. At the same time, a very inhomogeneous tapering field,
        generally indicated at 1420, changing from very low density to
        very high density is formed between the one conductor 1400 and
        the insulated electrode 1210. One benefit of this exemplary
        configuration is that it permits the size of the insulated
        electrode to be reduced without causing an increase in the
        nearby field density. This can be important since electrodes
        that having very high dielectric constant insulation can be very
        expensive. Some insulated electrodes, for example, can cost
        $500.00 or more; and further, the price is sensitive to the
        particular area of treatment. Thus, a reduction in the size of
        the insulated electrodes directly leads to a reduction in cost.
        [00155] As used herein, the term "tumor" refers to a malignant
        tissue comprising transformed cells that grow uncontrollably.
        Tumors include leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas, plasmacytomas,
        and the like; and solid tumors. Examples of solid tumors that
        can be treated according to the invention include sarcomas and
        carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma,
        myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma,
        chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma,
        lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's
        tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma,
        pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate
        cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma,
        adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland
        carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas,
        cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma,
        renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma,
        choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor,
        cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell
        lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma,
        astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma,
        pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma,
        oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and
        retinoblastoma. Because each of these tumors undergoes rapid
        growth, any one can be treated in accordance with the invention.
        The invention is particularly advantageous for treating brain
        tumors, which are difficult to treat with surgery and radiation,
        and often inaccessible to chemotherapy or gene therapies. In
        addition, the present invention is suitable for use in treating
        skin and breast tumors because of the ease of localized
        treatment provided by the present invention. [00156] In
        addition, the present invention can control uncontrolled growth
        associated with non-malignant or pre-malignant conditions, and
        other disorders involving inappropriate cell or tissue growth by
        application of an electric field in accordance with the
        invention to the tissue undergoing inappropriate growth. For
        example, it is contemplated that the invention is useful for the
        treatment of arteriovenous (AV) malformations, particularly in
        intracranial sites. The invention may also be used to treat
        psoriasis, a dermatologic condition that is characterized by
        inflammation and vascular proliferation; and benign prostatic
        hypertrophy, a condition associated with inflammation and
        possibly vascular proliferation. Treatment of other
        hyperproliferative disorders is also contemplated. [00157]
        Furthermore, undesirable fibroblast and endothelial cell
        proliferation associated with wound healing, leading to scar and
        keloid formation after surgery or injury, and restenosis after
        angioplasty or placement of coronary stents can be inhibited by
        application of an electric field in accordance with the present
        invention. The non-invasive nature of this invention makes it
        particularly desirable for these types of conditions,
        particularly to prevent development of internal scars and
        adhesions, or to inhibit restenosis of coronary, carotid, and
        other important arteries. [00158] In addition to treating tumors
        that have already been detected, the above- described
        embodiments may also be used prophylactically to prevent tumors
        from ever reaching a detectable size in the first place. For
        example, the bra embodiment described above in connection with
        FIGS. 17 and 18 may be worn by a woman for an 8 hour session
        every day for a week, with the week-long course of treatment
        being repeated every few months to kill any cells that have
        become cancerous and started to proliferate. This mode of usage
        is particularly appropriate for people who are at high risk for
        a particular type of cancer (e. g., women with a strong history
        of breast cancer in their families, or people who have survived
        a bout of cancer and are at risk of a relapse). The course of
        prophylactic treatment may be tailored based on the type of
        cancer being targeted and/or to suit the convenience of the
        patient. For example, undergoing a four 16 hour sessions during
        the week of treatment may be more convenient for some patients
        than seven 8 hour session, and may be equally effective. [00159]
        Thus, the present invention provides an effective, simple method
        of selectively destroying dividing cells, e. g., tumor cells and
        parasitic organisms, while non-dividing cells or organisms are
        left affected by application of the method on living tissue
        containing both types of cells or organisms. Thus, unlike many
        of the conventional methods, the present invention does not
        damage the normal cells or organisms. In addition, the present
        invention does not discriminate based upon cell type (e. g.,
        cells having differing sizes) and therefore may be used to treat
        any number of types of sizes having a wide spectrum of
        characteristics, including varying dimensions. [00160] While the
        invention has been particularly shown and described with
        reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be
        understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in
        form and details can be made without departing from the spirit
        and scope of the invention. == <br>

        [0001] <br>
        <br>
        This invention concerns selective destruction of rapidly
        dividing cells, and more particularly, to an apparatus for
        selectively destroying dividing cells by applying an electric
        field having certain prescribed characteristics. <br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND <br>
        <br>
        [0002] All living organisms proliferate by cell division,
        including cell cultures, microorganisms (such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, yeast, protozoa, and other single-celled organisms),
        fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Dividing cells of organisms can
        be destroyed, or their proliferation controlled, by methods that
        are based on the sensitivity of the dividing cells of these
        organisms to certain agents. For example, certain antibiotics
        stop the multiplication process of bacteria. <br>
        <br>
        [0003] The process of eukaryotic cell division is called
        "mitosis", which involves nice distinct phases (see Darnell et
        al., Molecular Cell Biology, New York: Scientific American
        Books, 1986, p. 149). During interphase, the cell replicates
        chromosomal DNA, which begins condensing in early prophase. At
        this point, centrioles (each cell contains 2) begin moving
        towards opposite poles of the cell. In middle prophase, each
        chromosome is composed of duplicate chromatids. Microtubular
        spindles radiate from regions adjacent to the centrioles, which
        are closer to their poles. By late prophase, the centrioles have
        reached the poles, and some spindle fibers extend to the center
        of the cell, while others extend from the poles to the
        chromatids. The cells then move into metaphase, when the
        chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell and align in the
        equatorial plane. Next is early anaphase, during which time
        daughter chromatids separate from each other at the equator by
        moving along the spindle fibers toward a centromere at opposite
        poles. The cell begins to elongate along the axis of the pole;
        the pole-to-pole spindles also elongate. Late anaphase occurs
        when the daughter chromosomes (as they are not called) each
        reach their respective opposite poles. At this point,
        cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow begins to form at the
        equator of the cell. In other words, late anaphase is the point
        at which pinching the cell membrane begins. During telophase,
        cytokinesis is nearly complete and spindles disappear. Only a
        relatively narrow membrane connection joins the two cytoplasms.
        Finally, the membranes separate fully, cytokinesis is complete
        and the cell returns to interphase. <br>
        <br>
        [0004] In meisosis, the cell undergoes a second division,
        involving separation of sister chromosomes to opposite poles of
        the cell along spindle fibers, followed by formation of a
        cleavage furrow and cell division. However, this division is not
        preceded by chromosome replication, yielding a haploid germ
        cell. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] Bacteria also divide by chromosome replication, followed
        by cell separation. However, since the daughter chromosomes
        separate by attachment to membrane components; there is no
        visible apparatus that contributes to cell division as in
        eukaryotic cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0006] It is well known that tumors, particularly malignant or
        cancerous tumors, grow uncontrollably compared to normal tissue.
        Such expedited growth enables tumors to occupy an
        ever-increasing space and to damage or destroy tissue adjacent
        thereto. Furthermore, certain cancers are characterized by an
        ability to transmit cancerous "seeds", including single cells or
        small cell clusters (metastasises), to new locations where the
        messastatic cancer cells grow into additional tumors. <br>
        <br>
        [0007] The rapid growth of tumors, in general, and malignant
        tumors in particular, as described above, is the result of
        relatively frequent cell division or multiplication of these
        cells compared to normal tissue cells. The distinguishably
        frequent cell division of cancer cells is the basis for the
        effectiveness of existing cancer treatments, e.g., irradiation
        therapy and the use of various chemo-therapeutic agents. Such
        treatments are based on the fact that cells undergoing division
        are more sensitive to radiation and chemo-therapeutic agents
        than non-dividing cells. Because tumors cells divide much more
        frequently than normal cells, it is possible, to a certain
        extent, to selectively damage or destroy tumor cells by
        radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The actual sensitivity of
        cells to radiation, therapeutic agents, etc., is also dependent
        on specific characteristics of different types of normal or
        malignant cell types. Thus, unfortunately, the sensitivity of
        tumor cells is not sufficiently higher than that many types of
        normal tissues. This diminishes the ability to distinguish
        between tumor cells and normal cells, and therefore, existing
        cancer treatments typically cause significant damage to normal
        tissues, thus limiting the therapeutic effectiveness of such
        treatments. Furthermore, the inevitable damage to other tissue
        renders treatments very traumatic to the patients and, often,
        patients are unable to recover from a seemingly successful
        treatment. Also, certain types of tumors are not sensitive at
        all to existing methods of treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0008] There are also other methods for destroying cells that do
        not rely on radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone. For
        example, ultrasonic and electrical methods for destroying tumor
        cells can be used in addition to or instead of conventional
        treatments. Electric fields and currents have been used for
        medical purposes for many years. The most common is the
        generation of electric currents in a human or animal body by
        application of an electric field by means of a pair of
        conductive electrodes between which a potential difference is
        maintained. These electric currents are used either to exert
        their specific effects, i.e., to stimulate excitable tissue, or
        to generate heat by flowing in the body since it acts as a
        resistor. Examples of the first type of application include the
        following: cardiac defibrillators, peripheral nerve and muscle
        stimulators, brain stimulators, etc. Currents are used for
        heating, for example, in devices for tumor ablation, ablation of
        malfunctioning cardiac or brain tissue, cauterization,
        relaxation of muscle rheumatic pain and other pain, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0009] Another use of electric fields for medical purposes
        involves the utilization of high frequency oscillating fields
        transmitted from a source that emits an electric wave, such as
        an RF wave or a microwave source that is directed at the part of
        the body that is of interest (i.e., target). In these instances,
        there is no electric energy conduction between the source and
        the body; but rather, the energy is transmitted to the body by
        radiation or induction. More specifically, the electric energy
        generated by the source reaches the vicinity of the body via a
        conductor and is transmitted from it through air or some other
        electric insulating material to the human body. <br>
        <br>
        [0010] In a conventional electrical method, electrical current
        is delivered to a region of the target tissue using electrodes
        that are placed in contact with the body of the patient. The
        applied electrical current destroys substantially all cells in
        the vicinity of the target tissue. Thus, this type of electrical
        method does not discriminate between different types of cells
        within the target tissue and results in the destruction of both
        tumor cells and normal cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0011] Electric fields that can be used in medical applications
        can thus be separated generally into two different modes. In the
        first mode, the electric fields are applied to the body or
        tissues by means of conducting electrodes. These electric fields
        can be separated into two types, namely (1) steady fields or
        fields that change at relatively slow rates, and alternating
        fields of low frequencies that induce corresponding electric
        currents in the body or tissues, and (2) high frequency
        alternating fields (above 1 MHz) applied to the body by means of
        the conducting electrodes. In the second mode, the electric
        fields are high frequency alternating fields applied to the body
        by means of insulated electrodes. <br>
        <br>
        [0012] The first type of electric field is used, for example, to
        stimulate nerves and muscles, pace the heart, etc. In fact, such
        fields are used in nature to propagate signals in nerve and
        muscle fibers, central nervous system (CNS), heart, etc. The
        recording of such natural fields is the basis for the ECG, EEG,
        EMG, ERG, etc. The field strength in these applications,
        assuming a medium of homogenous electric properties, is simply
        the voltage applied to the stimulating/recording electrodes
        divided by the distance between them. These currents can be
        calculated by Ohm's law and can have dangerous stimulatory
        effects on the heart and CNS and can result in potentially
        harmful ion concentration changes. Also, if the currents are
        strong enough, they can cause excessive heating in the tissues.
        This heating can be calculated by the power dissipated in the
        tissue (the product of the voltage and the current). <br>
        <br>
        [0013] When such electric fields and currents are alternating,
        their stimulatory power, on nerve, muscle, etc., is an inverse
        function of the frequency. At frequencies above 1-10 KHz, the
        stimulation power of the fields approaches zero. This limitation
        is due to the fact that excitation induced by electric
        stimulation is normally mediated by membrane potential changes,
        the rate of which is limited by the RC properties (time
        constants on the order of 1 ms) of the membrane. [0014]
        Regardless of the frequency, when such current inducing fields
        are applied, they are associated with harmful side effects
        caused by currents. For example, one negative effect is the
        changes in ionic concentration in the various "compartments"
        within the system, and the harmful products of the electrolysis
        taking place at the electrodes, or the medium in which the
        tissues are imbedded. The changes in ion concentrations occur
        whenever the system includes two or more compartments between
        which the organism maintains ion concentration differences. For
        example, for most tissues, [Ca&lt;++&gt;] in the extracellular
        fluid is about 2*10&lt;-3 &gt;M, while in the cytoplasm of
        typical cells its concentration can be as low as 10&lt;-7 &gt;M.
        A current induced in such a system by a pair of electrodes,
        flows in part from the extracellular fluid into the cells and
        out again into the extracellular medium. About 2% of the current
        flowing into the cells is carried by the Ca&lt;++&gt; ions. In
        contrast, because the concentration of intracellular
        Ca&lt;++&gt; is much smaller, only a negligible fraction of the
        currents that exits the cells is carried by these ions. Thus,
        Ca&lt;++&gt; ions accumulate in the cells such that their
        concentrations in the cells increases, while the concentration
        in the extracellular compartment may decrease. These effects are
        observed for both DC and alternating currents (AC). The rate of
        accumulation of the ions depends on the current intensity ion
        mobilities, membrane ion conductance, etc. An increase in
        [Ca&lt;++&gt;] is harmful to most cells and if sufficiently high
        will lead to the destruction of the cells. Similar
        considerations apply to other ions. In view of the above
        observations, long term current application to living organisms
        or tissues can result in significant damage. Another major
        problem that is associated with such electric fields, is due to
        the electrolysis process that takes place at the electrode
        surfaces. Here charges are transferred between the metal
        (electrons) and the electrolytic solution (ions) such that
        charged active radicals are formed. These can cause significant
        damage to organic molecules, especially macromolecules and thus
        damage the living cells and tissues. <br>
        <br>
        [0015] In contrast, when high frequency electric fields, above 1
        MHz and usually in practice in the range of GHz, are induced in
        tissues usually by means of insulated electrodes or transmission
        of e.m. waves, the situation is quite different. These type of
        fields generate only capacitive or displacement currents, rather
        than the conventional charge conducting currents. Under the
        effect of this type of field, living tissues behave mostly
        according to their dielectric properties rather than their
        electric conductive properties. Therefore, the dominant field
        effect is that due to dielectric losses and heating. Thus, it is
        widely accepted that in practice, the meaningful effects of such
        fields on living organisms, are only those due to their heating
        effects, i.e., due to dielectric losses. <br>
        <br>
        [0016] In U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,066 ('066) to Mangano, a method
        and device are presented which enable discrete objects having a
        conducting inner core, surrounded by a dielectric membrane to be
        selectively inactivated by electric fields via irreversible
        breakdown of their dielectric membrane. One potential
        application for this is in the selection and purging of certain
        biological cells in a suspension. According to the '066 patent,
        an electric field is applied for targeting selected cells to
        cause breakdown of the dielectric membranes of these tumor
        cells, while purportedly not adversely affecting other desired
        subpopulations of cells. The cells are selected on the basis of
        intrinsic or induced differences in a characteristic
        electroporation threshold. The differences in this threshold can
        depend upon a number of parameters, including the difference in
        cell size. <br>
        <br>
        [0017] The method of the '066 patent is therefore based on the
        assumption that the electroporation threshold of tumor cells is
        sufficiently distinguishable from that of normal cells because
        of differences in cell size and differences in the dielectric
        properties of the cell membranes. Based upon this assumption,
        the larger size of many types of tumor cells makes these cells
        more susceptible to electroporation and thus, it may be possible
        to selectively damage only the larger tumor cell membranes by
        applying an appropriate electric field. One disadvantage of this
        method is that the ability to discriminate is highly dependent
        upon cell type, for example, the size difference between normal
        cells and tumor cells is significant only in certain types of
        cells. Another drawback of this method is that the voltages
        which are applied can damage some of the normal cells and may
        not damage all of the tumor cells because the differences in
        size and membrane dielectric properties are largely statistical
        and the actual cell geometries and dielectric properties can
        vary significantly. <br>
        <br>
        [0018] What is needed in the art and has heretofore not been
        available is an apparatus for killing dividing cells, wherein
        the apparatus better discriminates between dividing cells,
        including single-celled organisms, and non-dividing cells and is
        capable of selectively destroying the dividing cells or
        organisms with substantially no affect on the non-dividing cells
        or organisms. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY </span><br>
        <br>
        [0019] An apparatus for use in a number of different
        applications for selectively destroying cells undergoing growth
        and division is provided. This includes, cell, particularly
        tumor cells, in living tissue and single-celled organisms. The
        apparatus can be incorporated into a number of different
        configurations (e.g., as a skin patch or embedded internally
        within the body) to eliminate or control the growth of such
        living tissue or organisms. <br>
        <br>
        [0020] A major use of the present apparatus is in the treatment
        of tumors by selective destruction of tumor cells with
        substantially no affect on normal tissue cells, and thus, the
        exemplary apparatus is described below in the context of
        selective destruction of tumor cells. It should be appreciated
        however, that for purpose of the following description, the term
        "cell" may also refer to a single-celled organism (eubacteria,
        bacteria, yeast, protozoa), multi-celled organisms (fungi,
        algae, mold), and plants as or parts thereof that are not
        normally classified as "cells". The exemplary apparatus enables
        selective destruction of cells undergoing division in a way that
        is more effective and more accurate (e.g., more adaptable to be
        aimed at specific targets) than existing methods. Further, the
        present apparatus causes minimal damage, if any, to normal
        tissue and, thus, reduces or eliminates many side-effects
        associated with existing selective destruction methods, such as
        radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The selective destruction of
        dividing cells using the present apparatus does not depend on
        the sensitivity of the cells to chemical agents or radiation.
        Instead, the selective destruction of dividing cells is based on
        distinguishable geometrical and structural characteristics of
        cells undergoing division, in comparison to non-dividing cells,
        regardless of the cell geometry of the type of cells being
        treated. <br>
        <br>
        [0021] According to one exemplary embodiment, cell
        geometry-dependent selective destruction of living tissue is
        performed by inducing a non-homogenous electric field in the
        cells using an electronic apparatus. <br>
        <br>
        [0022] It has been observed by the present inventor that, while
        different cells in their non-dividing state may have different
        shapes, e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
        "pancake-like", etc., the division process of practically all
        cells is characterized by development of a "cleavage furrow" in
        late anaphase and telophase. This cleavage furrow is a slow
        constriction of the cell membrane (between the two sets of
        daughter chromosomes) which appears microscopically as a growing
        cleft (e.g., a groove or notch) that gradually separates the
        cell into two new cells. During the division process, there is a
        transient period (telophase) during which the cell structure is
        basically that of two sub-cells interconnected by a narrow
        "bridge" formed of the cell material. The division process is
        completed when the "bridge" between the two sub-cells is broken.
        The selective destruction of tumor cells using the present
        electronic apparatus utilizes this unique geometrical feature of
        dividing cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0023] When a cell or a group of cells are under natural
        conditions or environment, i.e., part of a living tissue, they
        are disposed surrounded by a conductive environment consisting
        mostly of an electrolytic inter-cellular fluid and other cells
        that are composed mostly of an electrolytic intra-cellular
        liquid. When an electric field is induced in the living tissue,
        by applying an electric potential across the tissue, an electric
        field is formed in the tissue and the specific distribution and
        configuration of the electric field lines defines the paths of
        electric currents in the tissue, if currents are in fact induced
        in the tissue. The distribution and configuration of the
        electric field is dependent on various parameters of the tissue,
        including the geometry and the electric properties of the
        different tissue components, and the relative conductivities,
        capacities and dielectric constants (that may be frequency
        dependent) of the tissue components. <br>
        <br>
        [0024] The electric current flow pattern for cells undergoing
        division is very different and unique as compared to
        non-dividing cells. Such cells including first and second
        sub-cells, namely an "original" cell and a newly formed cell,
        that are connected by a cytoplasm "bridge" or "neck". The
        currents penetrate the first sub-cell through part of the
        membrane ("the current source pole"); however, they do not exit
        the first sub-cell through a portion of its membrane closer to
        the opposite pole ("the current sink pole"). Instead, the lines
        of current flow converge at the neck or cytoplasm bridge,
        whereby the density of the current flow lines is greatly
        increased. A corresponding, "mirror image", process that takes
        place in the second sub-cell, whereby the current flow lines
        diverge to a lower density configuration as they depart from the
        bridge, and finally exit the second sub-cell from a part of its
        membrane closes to the current sink. <br>
        <br>
        [0025] When a polar or a polarizable object is placed in a
        non-uniform converging or diverging field, electric forces act
        on it and pull it towards the higher density electric field
        lines. In the case of dividing cell, electric forces are exerted
        in the direction of the cytoplasm bridge between the two cells.
        Since all intercellular organelles are polarizable, and most
        macromolecules are polar (have a dipole moment) they are all
        force towards the bridge between the two cells. The field
        polarity is irrelevant to the direction of the force and,
        therefore, an alternating electric having specific properties
        can be used to produce substantially the same effect. It will
        also be appreciated that the concentrated electric field present
        in or near the bridge or neck portion in itself exerts strong
        forces on charges and natural dipoles and can lead to the
        disruption of structures associated with these members. <br>
        <br>
        [0026] The movement of the cellular organelles towards the
        bridge disrupts the cell structure and results in increased
        pressure in the vicinity of the connecting bridge membrane. This
        pressure of the organelles on the bridge membrane is expected to
        break the bridge membrane and, thus, it is expected that the
        dividing cell will "explode" in response to this pressure. The
        ability to break the membrane and disrupt other cell structures
        can be enhanced by applying a pulsating alternating electric
        field that has a frequency from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz.
        When this type of electric field is applied to the tissue, the
        forces exerted on the intercellular organelles have a
        "hammering" effect, whereby force pulses (or beats) are applied
        to the organelles numerous times per second, enhancing the
        movement of organelles of different sizes and masses towards the
        bridge (or neck) portion from both of the sub-cells, thereby
        increasing the probability of breaking the cell membrane at the
        bridge portion. The forces exerted on the intracellular
        organelles also affect the organelles themselves and may
        collapse or break the organelles. <br>
        <br>
        [0027] According to one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus for
        applying the electric field is an electronic apparatus that
        generates the desired electric signals in the shape of waveforms
        or trains of pulses. The electronic apparatus includes a
        generator that generates an alternating voltage waveform at
        frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz. The
        generator is operatively connected to conductive leads which are
        connected at their other ends to insulated conductors/electrodes
        (also referred to as isolects) that are activated by the
        generated waveforms. The insulated electrodes consist of a
        conductor in contact with a dielectric (insulating layer) that
        is in contact with the conductive tissue, thus forming a
        capacitor. The electric fields that are generated by the present
        apparatus can be applied in several different modes depending
        upon the precise treatment application. <br>
        <br>
        [0028] In one exemplary embodiment, the electric fields are
        applied by external insulated electrodes which are constructed
        so that the applied electric fields can be of a local type or of
        a widely distributed type. This embodiment is designed to treat
        skin tumors and lesions that are close to the skin surface.
        According to this embodiment, the insulated electrodes can be
        incorporated into a skin patch that is applied to a skin
        surface. The skin patch can be a self-adhesive flexible patch
        and can include one or more pairs of the insulated electrodes. <br>
        <br>
        [0029] According to another embodiment, the apparatus is used in
        an internal type application in that the insulated electrodes
        are in the form of plates, wires, etc., that are inserted
        subcutaneously or deeper within the body so as to generate an
        electric field having the above desired properties at a target
        area (e.g., a tumor). <br>
        <br>
        [0030] Thus, the present apparatus utilizes electric fields that
        fall into a special intermediate category relative to previous
        high and low frequency applications in that the present electric
        fields are bio-effective fields that have no meaningful
        stimulatory effects and no thermal effects. Advantageously, when
        non-dividing cells are subjected to these electric fields, there
        is no effect on the cells; however, the situation is much
        different when dividing cells are subjected to the present
        electric fields. Thus, the present electronic apparatus and the
        generated electric fields target dividing cells, such as tumors
        or the like, and do not target non-dividing cells that is found
        around in healthy tissue surrounding the target area.
        Furthermore, since the present apparatus utilizes insulated
        electrodes, the above mentioned negative effects, obtained when
        conductive electrodes are used, i.e., ion concentration changes
        in the cells and the formation of harmful agents by
        electrolysis, do not occur with the present apparatus. This is
        because, in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place
        between the electrodes and the medium, and there is no charge
        flow in the medium where the currents are capacitive. <br>
        <br>
        [0031] It should be appreciated that the present electronic
        apparatus can also be used in applications other than treatment
        of tumors in the living body. In fact, the selective destruction
        utilizing the present apparatus can be used in conjunction with
        any organism that proliferates division and multiplication, for
        example, tissue cultures, microorganisms, such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, protozoa, fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Such
        organisms divide by the formation of a groove or cleft as
        described above. As the groove or cleft deepens, a narrow bridge
        is formed between the two parts of the organism, similar to the
        bridge formed between the sub-cells of dividing animal cells.
        Since such organisms are covered by a membrane having a
        relatively low electric conductivity, similar to an animal cell
        membrane described above, the electric field lines in a dividing
        organism converge at the bridge connecting the two parts of the
        dividing organism. The converging field lines result in electric
        forces that displace polarizable elements within the dividing
        organism. <br>

          PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </span><br>
        <br>
        [0046] Reference is made to FIGS. 1A-1E which schematically
        illustrate various stages of a cell division process. FIG. 1A
        illustrates a cell 10 at its normal geometry, which can be
        generally spherical (as illustrated in the drawings),
        ellipsoidal, cylindrical, "pancake-like" or any other cell
        geometry, as is known in the art. FIGS. 1B-1D illustrate cell 10
        during different stages of its division process, which results
        in the formation of two new cells 18 and 20, shown in FIG. 1E. <br>
        <br>
        [0047] As shown in FIGS. 1B-1D, the division process of cell 10
        is characterized by a slowly growing cleft 12 which gradually
        separates cell 10 into two units, namely sub-cells 14 and 16,
        which eventually evolve into new cells 18 and 20 (FIG. 1E). A
        shown specifically in FIG. 1D, the division process is
        characterized by a transient period during which the structure
        of cell 10 is basically that of the two sub-cells 14 and 16
        interconnected by a narrow "bridge" 22 containing cell material
        (cytoplasm surrounded by cell membrane). [0048] Reference is now
        made to FIGS. 2A and 2B, which schematically illustrate
        non-dividing cell 10 being subjected to an electric field
        produced by applying an alternating electric potential, at a
        relatively low frequency and at a relatively high frequency,
        respectively. Cell 10 includes intracellular organelles, e.g., a
        nucleus 30. Alternating electric potential is applied across
        electrodes 28 and 32 that can be attached externally to a
        patient at a predetermined region, e.g., in the vicinity of the
        tumor being treated. When cell 10 is under natural conditions,
        i.e., part of a living tissue, it is disposed in a conductive
        environment (hereinafter referred to as a "volume conductor")
        consisting mostly of electrolytic inter-cellular liquid. When an
        electric potential is applied across electrodes 28 and 32, some
        of the field lines of the resultant electric field (or the
        current induced in the tissue in response to the electric field)
        penetrate the cell 10, while the rest of the field lines (or
        induced current) flow in the surrounding medium. The specific
        distribution of the electric field lines, which is substantially
        consistent with the direction of current flow in this instance,
        depends on the geometry and the electric properties of the
        system components, e.g., the relative conductivities and
        dielectric constants of the system components, that can be
        frequency dependent. For low frequencies, e.g., frequencies
        lower than 10 KHz, the conductance properties of the components
        completely dominate the current flow and the field distribution,
        and the field distribution is generally as depicted in FIG. 2A.
        At higher frequencies, e.g., at frequencies of between 10 KHz
        and 1 MHz, the dielectric properties of the components becomes
        more significant and eventually dominate the field distribution,
        resulting in field distribution lines as depicted generally in
        FIG. 2B. <br>
        <br>
        [0049] For constant (i.e., DC) electric fields or relatively low
        frequency alternating electric fields, for example, frequencies
        under 10 KHz, the dielectric properties of the various
        components are not significant in determining and computing the
        field distribution. Therefore, as a first approximation, with
        regard to the electric field distribution, the system can be
        reasonably represented by the relative impedances of its various
        components. Using this approximation, the intercellular (i.e.,
        extracellular) fluid and the intracellular fluid each has a
        relatively low impedance, while the cell membrane 11 has a
        relatively high impedance. Thus, under low frequency conditions,
        only a fraction of the electric field lines (or currents induced
        by the electric field) penetrate membrane 11 of the cell 10. At
        relatively high frequencies (e.g., 10 KHz-1 MHz), in contrast,
        the impedance of membrane 11 relative to the intercellular and
        intracellular fluids decreases, and thus, the fraction of
        currents penetrating the cells increases significantly. It
        should be noted that at very high frequencies, i.e., above 1
        MHz, the membrane capacitance can short the membrane resistance
        and, therefore, the total membrane resistance can become
        negligible. <br>
        <br>
        [0050] In any of the embodiments described above, the electric
        field lines (or induced currents) penetrate cell 10 from a
        portion of the membrane 11 closest to one of the electrodes
        generating the current, e.g., closest to positive electrode 28
        (also referred to herein as "source"). The current flow pattern
        across cell 10 is generally uniform because, under the above
        approximation, the field induced inside the cell is
        substantially homogeneous. The currents exit cell 10 through a
        portion of membrane 11 closest to the opposite electrode, e.g.,
        negative electrode 32 (also referred to herein as "sink"). <br>
        <br>
        [0051] The distinction between field lines and current flow can
        depend on a number of factors, for example, on the frequency of
        the applied electric potential and on whether electrodes 28 and
        32 are electrically insulated. For insulated electrodes applying
        a DC or low frequency alternating voltage, there is practically
        no current flow along the lines of the electric field. At higher
        frequencies, the displacement currents are induced in the tissue
        due to charging and discharging of the electrode insulation and
        the cell membranes (which act as capacitors to a certain
        extent), and such currents follow the lines of the electric
        field. Fields generated by non-insulated electrodes, in
        contrast, always generate some form of current flow,
        specifically, DC or low frequency alternating fields generate
        conductive current flow along the field lines, and high
        frequency alternating fields generate both conduction and
        displacement currents along the field lines. It should be
        appreciated, however, that movement of polarizable intracellular
        organelles according to the present invention (as described
        below) is not dependent on actual flow of current and,
        therefore, both insulated and non-insulated electrodes can be
        used efficiently. Several advantages of insulated electrodes are
        that they have lower power consumption and cause less heating of
        the treated regions. <br>
        <br>
        [0052] According to one exemplary embodiment of the present
        invention, the electric fields that are used are alternating
        fields having frequencies that are in the range from about 50
        KHz to about 500 KHz, and preferably from about 100 KHz to about
        300 KHz. For ease of discussion, these type of electric fields
        are also referred to below as "TC fields", which is an
        abbreviation of "Tumor Curing electric fields", since these
        electric fields fall into an intermediate category (between high
        and low frequency ranges) that have bio-effective field
        properties while having no meaningful stimulatory and thermal
        effects. These frequencies are sufficiently low so that the
        system behavior is determined by the system's Ohmic (conductive)
        properties but sufficiently high enough not to have any
        stimulation effect on excitable tissues. Such a system consists
        of two types of elements, namely, the intercellular, or
        extracellular fluid, or medium and the individual cells. The
        intercellular fluid is mostly an electrolyte with a specific
        resistance of about 40-100 Ohm*cm. As mentioned above, the cells
        are characterized by three elements, namely (1) a thin, highly
        electric resistive membrane that coats the cell; (2) internal
        cytoplasm that is mostly an electrolyte that contains numerous
        macromolecules and micro-organelles, including the nucleus; and
        (3) membranes, similar in their electric properties to the cell
        membrane, cover the micro-organelles. <br>
        <br>
        [0053] When this type of system is subjected to the present TC
        fields (e.g., alternating electric fields in the frequency range
        of 100 KHz-300 KHz) most of the lines of the electric field and
        currents tend away from the cells because of the high resistive
        cell membrane and therefore the lines remain in the
        extracellular conductive medium. In the above recited frequency
        range, the actual fraction of electric field or currents that
        penetrates the cells is a strong function of the frequency. <br>
        <br>
        [0054] FIG. 3 schematically depicts the resulting field
        distribution in the system. As illustrated, the lines of force,
        which also depict the lines of potential current flow across the
        cell volume mostly in parallel with the undistorted lines of
        force (the main direction of the electric field). In other
        words, the field inside the cells is mostly homogeneous. In
        practice, the fraction of the field or current that penetrates
        the cells is determined by the cell membrane impedance value
        relative to that of the extracellular fluid. Since the
        equivalent electric circuit of the cell membrane is that of a
        resistor and capacitor in parallel, the impedance is a function
        of the frequency. The higher the frequency, the lower the
        impedance, the larger the fraction of penetrating current and
        the smaller the field distortion. <br>
        <br>
        [0055] As previously mentioned, when cells are subjected to
        relatively weak electric fields and currents that alternate at
        high frequencies, such as the present TC fields having a
        frequency in the range of 50 KHz-500 KHz, they have no effect on
        the non-dividing cells. While the present TC fields have no
        detectable effect on such systems, the situation becomes
        different in the presence of dividing cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0056] Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A-3C which schematically
        illustrate the electric current flow pattern in cell 10 during
        its division process, under the influence of alternating fields
        (TC fields) in the frequency range from about 100 KHz to about
        300 KHz in accordance with one exemplary embodiment. The field
        lines or induced currents penetrate cell 10 through a part of
        the membrane of sub-cell 16 closer to electrode 28. However,
        they do not exit through the cytoplasm bridge 22 that connects
        sub-cell 16 with the newly formed yet still attached sub-cell
        14, or through a part of the membrane in the vicinity of the
        bridge 22. Instead, the electric field or current flow
        lines-that are relatively widely separated in sub-cell
        16-converge as they approach bridge 22 (also referred to as
        "neck" 22) and, thus, the current/field line density within neck
        22 is increased dramatically. A "mirror image" process takes
        place in sub-cell 14, whereby the converging field lines in
        bridge 22 diverge as they approach the exit region of sub-cell
        14. <br>
        <br>
        [0057] It should be appreciated by persons skilled in the art
        that homogeneous electric fields do not exert a force on
        electrically neutral objects, i.e., objects having substantially
        zero net charge, although such objects can become polarized.
        However, under a non-uniform, converging electric field, as
        shown in FIGS. 3A-3C, electric forces are exerted on polarized
        objects, moving them in the direction of the higher density
        electric field lines. It will be appreciated that the
        concentrated electric field that is present in the neck or
        bridge area in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can disrupt structures that are associated
        therewith. <br>
        <br>
        [0058] In the configuration of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the direction of
        movement of polarized objects is towards the higher density
        electric field lines, i.e., towards the cytoplasm bridge 22
        between sub-cells 14 and 16. It is known in the art that all
        intracellular organelles, for example, nuclei 24 and 26 of
        sub-cells 14 and 16, respectively, are polarizable and, thus,
        such intracellular organelles are electrically forced in the
        direction of the bridge 22. Since the movement is always from
        lower density currents to the higher density currents,
        regardless of the field polarity, the forces applied by the
        alternating electric field to organelles, such as nuclei 24 and
        26, are always in the direction of bridge 22. A comprehensive
        description of such forces and the resulting movement of
        macromolecules of intracellular organelles, a phenomenon
        referred to as "dielectrophoresis" is described extensively in
        literature, e.g., in C. L. Asbury &amp; G. van den Engh,
        Biophys. J. 74, 1024-1030, 1998, the disclosure of which is
        hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. <br>
        <br>
        [0059] The movement of the organelles 24 and 26 towards the
        bridge 22 disrupts the structure of the dividing cell and,
        eventually, the pressure of the converging organelles on bridge
        membrane 22 results in the breakage of cell membrane 11 at the
        vicinity of the bridge 22, as shown schematically in FIG. 3C.
        The ability to break membrane 11 at bridge 22 and to otherwise
        disrupt the cell structure and organization can be enhanced by
        applying a pulsating AC electric field, rather than a steady AC
        field. When a pulsating field is applied, the forces acting on
        organelles 24 and 26 have a "hammering" effect, whereby pulsed
        forces beat on the intracellular organelles towards the neck 22
        from both sub-cells 14 and 16, thereby increasing the
        probability of breaking cell membrane 11 in the vicinity of neck
        22. <br>
        <br>
        [0060] A very important element, which is very susceptible to
        the special fields that develop within the dividing cells is the
        microtubule spindle that plays a major role in the division
        process. In FIG. 4, a dividing cell 10 is illustrated, at an
        earlier stage as compared to FIGS. 3A and 3B, under the
        influence of external TC fields (e.g., alternating fields in the
        frequency range of about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz), generally
        indicated as lines 100, with a corresponding spindle mechanism
        generally indicated at 120. The lines 120 are microtubules that
        are known to have a very strong dipole moment. This strong
        polarization makes the tubules susceptible to electric fields.
        Their positive charges are located at the two centrioles while
        two sets of negative poles are at the center of the dividing
        cell and the other pair is at the points of attachment of the
        microtubules to the cell membrane, generally indicated at 130.
        This structure forms sets of double dipoles and therefore they
        are susceptible to fields of different directions. It will be
        understood that the effect of the TC fields on the dipoles does
        not depend on the formation of the bridge (neck) and thus, the
        dipoles are influenced by the TC fields prior to the formation
        of the bridge (neck). <br>
        <br>
        [0061] Since the present apparatus (as will be described in
        greater detail below) utilizes insulated electrodes, the
        above-mentioned negative effects obtained when conductive
        electrodes are used, i.e., ion concentration changes in the
        cells and the formation of harmful agents by electrolysis, do
        not occur when the present apparatus is used. This is because,
        in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place between
        the electrodes and the medium and there is no charge flow in the
        medium where the currents are capacitive, i.e., are expressed
        only as rotation of charges, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0062] Turning now to FIG. 5, the TC fields described above that
        have been found to advantageously destroy tumor cells are
        generated by an electronic apparatus 200. FIG. 5 is a simple
        schematic diagram of the electronic apparatus 200 illustrating
        the major components thereof. The electronic apparatus 200
        generates the desired electric signals (TC signals) in the shape
        of waveforms or trains of pulses. The apparatus 200 includes a
        generator 210 and a pair of conductive leads 220 that are
        attached at one end thereof to the generator 210. The opposite
        ends of the leads 220 are connected to insulated conductors 230
        that are activated by the electric signals (e.g., waveforns).
        The insulated conductors 230 are also referred to hereinafter as
        isolects 230. Optionally and according to another exemplary
        embodiment, the apparatus 200 includes a temperature sensor 240
        and a control box 250 which are both added to control the
        amplitude of the electric field generated so as not to generate
        excessive heating in the area that is treated.<br>
        <br>
        [0063] The generator 210 generates an alternating voltage
        waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz (preferably from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz) (i.e.,
        the TC fields). <span style="font-weight: bold;">The required
          voltages are such that the electric field intensity in the
          tissue to be treated is in the range of about 0.1 V/cm to
          about 10 V/cm.</span> To achieve this field, the actual
        potential difference between the two conductors in the isolects
        230 is determined by the relative impedances of the system
        components, as described below. <br>
        <br>
        [0064] When the control box 250 is included, it controls the
        output of the generator 210 so that it will remain constant at
        the value preset by the user or the control box 250 sets the
        output at the maximal value that does not cause excessive
        heating, or the control box 250 issues a warning or the like
        when the temperature (sensed by temperature sensor 240) exceeds
        a preset limit. <br>
        <br>
        [0065] The leads 220 are standard isolated conductors with a
        flexible metal shield, preferably grounded so that it prevents
        the spread of the electric field generated by the leads 220. The
        isolects 230 have specific shapes and positioning so as to
        generate an electric field of the desired configuration,
        direction and intensity at the target volume and only there so
        as to focus the treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0066] The specifications of the apparatus 200 as a whole and
        its individual components are largely influenced by the fact
        that at the frequency of the present TC fields (50 KHz-500 KHz),
        living systems behave according to their "Ohmic", rather than
        their dielectric properties. The only elements in the apparatus
        200 that behave differently are the insulators of the isolects
        230 (see FIGS. 7-9). The isolects 200 consist of a conductor in
        contact with a dielectric that is in contact with the conductive
        tissue thus forming a capacitor. <br>
        <br>
        [0067] The details of the construction of the isolects 230 is
        based on their electric behavior that can be understood from
        their simplified electric circuit when in contact with tissue as
        generally illustrated in FIG. 6. In the illustrated arrangement,
        the electric field distribution between the different components
        is determined by their relative electric impedance, i.e., the
        fraction of the field on each component is given by the value of
        its impedance divided by the total circuit impedance. For
        example, the potential drop on element [Delta]VA=A/(A+B+C+D+E).
        Thus, for DC or low frequency AC, practically all the potential
        drop is on the capacitor (that acts as an insulator). For
        relatively very high frequencies, the capacitor practically is a
        short and therefore, practically all the field is distributed in
        the tissues. At the frequencies of the present TC fields (e.g.,
        50 KHz to 500 KHz), which are intermediate frequencies, the
        impedance of the capacitance of the capacitors is dominant and
        determines the field distribution. Therefore, in order to
        increase the effective voltage drop across the tissues (field
        intensity), the impedance of the capacitors is to be decreased
        (i.e., increase their capacitance). This can be achieved by
        increasing the effective area of the "plates" of the capacitor,
        decrease the thickness of the dielectric or use a dielectric
        with high dielectric constant. There a number of different
        materials that are suitable for use in the intended application
        and have high dielectric constants. For example, some materials
        include: lithium nibate (LiNbO3), which is a ferroelectric
        crystal and has a number of applications in optical,
        pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices; yittrium iron garnet
        (YIG) is a ferrimagnetic crystal and magneto-optical devices,
        e.g., optical isolator can be realized from this material;
        barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a ferromagnetic crystal with a large
        electro-optic effect; potassium tantalate (kTaO3) which is a
        dielectric crystal (ferroelectric at low temperature) and has
        very low microwave loss and tunability of dielectric constant at
        low temperature; and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) which is a
        ferroelectric crystal with similar properties as lithium niobate
        and has utility in electro-optical, pyroelectric and
        piezoelectric devices. It will be understood that the
        aforementioned exemplary materials can be used in combination
        with the present device where it is desired to use a material
        having a high dielectric constant. <br>
        <br>
        [0068] In order to optimize the field distribution, the isolects
        230 are configured differently depending upon the application in
        which the isolects 230 are to be used. There are two principle
        modes for applying the present electric fields (TC fields).
        First, the TC fields can be applied by external isolects and
        second, the TC fields can be applied by internal isolects. <br>
        <br>
        [0069] Electric fields (TC fields) that are applied by external
        isolects can be of a local type or widely distributed type. The
        first type includes, for example, the treatment of skin tumors
        and treatment of lesions close to the skin surface. FIG. 7
        illustrates an exemplary embodiment where the isolects 230 are
        incorporated in a skin patch 300. The skin patch 300 can be a
        self-adhesive flexible patch with one or more pairs of isolects
        230. The patch 300 includes internal insulation 310 (formed of a
        dielectric material) and the external insulation 260 and is
        applied to skin surface 301 that contains a tumor 303 either on
        the skin surface 301 or slightly below the skin surface 301.
        Tissue is generally indicated at 305. To prevent the potential
        drop across the internal insulation 310 to dominate the system,
        the internal insulation 310 must have a relatively high
        capacity. This can be achieved by a large surface area; however,
        this may not be desired as it will result in the spread of the
        field over a large area (e.g., an area larger than required to
        treat the tumor). Alternatively, the internal insulation 310 can
        be made very thin and/or the internal insulation 310 can be of a
        high dielectric constant. As the skin resistance between the
        electrodes (labeled as A and E in FIG. 6) is normally
        significantly higher than that of the tissue (labeled as C in
        FIG. 6) underneath it (1-10 K[Omega] vs. 0.1-1 K[Omega]), most
        of the potential drop beyond the isolects occurs there. To
        accommodate for these impedances (Z), the characteristics of the
        internal insulation 310 (labeled as B and D in FIG. 6) should be
        such that they have impedance preferably under 100 K[Omega] at
        the frequencies of the present TC fields (e.g., 50 KHz to 500
        KHz). For example, if it is desired for the impedance to be
        about 10K Ohms, such that over 1% of the applied voltage falls
        on the tissues, for isolects with a surface area of 10
        mm&lt;2&gt;, at frequencies of 200 KHz, the capacity should be
        on the order of 10&lt;-10 &gt;F, which means that using standard
        insulations with a dielectric constant of 2-3, the thickness of
        the insulating layer 310 should be about 50-100 microns. An
        internal field 10 times stronger would be obtained with
        insulators with a dielectric constant of about 20-50. [0070]
        Since the insulating layer can be very vulnerable, etc., the
        insulation can be replaced by very high dielectric constant
        insulating materials, such as titanium dioxide (e.g., rutil),
        the dielectric constant can reach values of about 200. One must
        also consider another factor that effects the effective capacity
        of the isolects 230, namely the presence of air between the
        isolects 230 and the skin. Such presence, which is not easy to
        prevent, introduces a layer of an insulator with a dielectric
        constant of 1.0, a factor that significantly lowers the
        effective capacity of the isolects 230 and neutralizes the
        advantages of the titanium dioxide (routil), etc. To overcome
        this problem, the isolects 230 can be shaped so as to conform
        with the body structure and/or (2) an intervening filler 270 (as
        illustrated in FIG. 1C), such as a gel, that has high
        conductance and a dielectric constant, can be added to the
        structure. The shaping can be pre-structured (see FIG. 10A) or
        the system can be made sufficiently flexible so that shaping of
        the isolects 230 is readily achievable. The gel can be contained
        in place by having an elevated rim as depicted in FIG. 10C. The
        gel can be made of gelatins, agar, etc., and can have salts
        dissolved in it to increase its conductivity. FIGS. 10A-10C
        illustrate various exemplary configurations for the isolects
        230. The exact thickness of the gel is not important so long as
        it is of sufficient thickness that the gel layer does not dry
        out during the treatment. In one exemplary embodiment, the
        thickness of the gel is about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm. <br>
        <br>
        [0071] In order to achieve the desirable features of the
        isolects 230, the dielectric coating of each should be very
        thin, for example from between 1-50 microns. Since the coating
        is so thin, the isolects 230 can easily be damaged mechanically.
        This problem can be overcome by adding a protective feature to
        the isolect's structure so as to provide desired protection from
        such damage. For example, the isolect 230 can be coated, for
        example, with a relatively loose net 340 that prevents access to
        the surface but has only a minor effect on the effective surface
        area of the isolect 230 (i.e., the capacity of the isolects 230
        (cross section presented in FIG. 12B). The loose net 340 does
        not effect the capacity and ensures good contact with the skin,
        etc. The loose net 340 can be formed of a number of different
        materials; however, in one exemplary embodiment, the net 340 is
        formed of nylon, polyester, cotton, etc. Alternatively, a very
        thin conductive coating 350 can be applied to the dielectric
        portion (insulating layer) of the isolect 230. One exemplary
        conductive coating is formed of a metal and more particularly of
        gold. The thickness of the coating 350 depends upon the
        particular application and also on the type of material used to
        form the coating 350; however, when gold is used, the coating
        has a thickness from about 0.1 micron to about 0.1 mm.
        Furthermore, the rim illustrated in FIG. 10 can also provide
        some mechanical protection. <br>
        <br>
        [0072] However, the capacity is not the only factor to be
        considered. The following two factors also influence how the
        isolects 230 are constructed. The dielectric strength of the
        internal insulating layer 310 and the dielectric losses that
        occur when it is subjected to the TC field, i.e., the amount of
        heat generated. The dielectric strength of the internal
        insulation 310 determines at what field intensity the insulation
        will be "shorted" and cease to act as an intact insulation.
        Typically, insulators, such as plastics, have dielectric
        strength values of about 100V per micron or more. As a high
        dielectric constant reduces the field within the internal
        insulator 310, a combination of a high dielectric constant and a
        high dielectric strength gives a significant advantage. This can
        be achieved by using a single material that has the desired
        properties or it can be achieved by a double layer with the
        correct parameters and thickness. In addition, to further
        decreasing the possibility that the insulating layer 310 will
        fail, all sharp edges of the insulating layer 310 should be
        eliminated as by rounding the corners, etc., as illustrated in
        FIG. 10D using conventional techniques. <br>
        <br>
        [0073] FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a second type of treatment using
        the isolects 230, namely electric field generation by internal
        isolects 230. A body to which the isolects 230 are implanted is
        generally indicated at 311 and includes a skin surface 313 and a
        tumor 315. In this embodiment, the isolects 230 can have the
        shape of plates, wires or other shapes that can be inserted
        subcutaneously or a deeper location within the body 311 so as to
        generate an appropriate field at the target area (tumor 315).<br>
        <br>
        [0074] It will also be appreciated that the mode of isolects
        application is not restricted to the above descriptions. In the
        case of tumors in internal organs, for example, liver, lung,
        etc., the distance between each member of the pair of isolects
        230 can be large. The pairs can even by positioned opposite
        sides of a torso 410, as illustrated in FIG. 11. The arrangement
        of the isolects 230 in FIG. 11 is particularly useful for
        treating a tumor 415 associated with lung cancer. In this
        embodiment, the electric fields (TC fields) spread in a wide
        fraction of the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0075] In order to avoid overheating of the treated tissues, a
        selection of materials and field parameters is needed. The
        isolects insulating material should have minimal dielectric
        losses at the frequency ranges to be used during the treatment
        process. This factor can be taken into consideration when
        choosing the particular frequencies for the treatment. The
        direct heating of the tissues will most likely be dominated by
        the heating due to current flow (given by the I*R product). <br>
        <br>
        [0076] The effectiveness of the treatment can be enhanced by an
        arrangement of isolects 230 that focuses the field at the
        desired target while leaving other sensitive areas in low field
        density (i.e., protected areas). The proper placement of the
        isolects 230 over the body can be maintained using any number of
        different techniques, including using a suitable piece of
        clothing that keeps the isolects at the appropriate positions.
        FIG. 13 illustrates such an arrangement in which an area labeled
        as "P" represents a protected area. The lines of field force do
        not penetrate this protected area and the field there is much
        smaller than near the isolects 230 where target areas can be
        located and treated well. In contrast, the field intensity near
        the four poles is very high. <br>
        <br>
        [0077] The following Example serves to illustrate an exemplary
        application of the present apparatus and application of TC
        fields; however, this Example is not limiting and does not limit
        the scope of the present invention in any way. <br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> EXAMPLE </span><br>
        <br>
        [0078] To demonstrate the effectiveness of electric fields
        having the above described properties (e.g., frequencies between
        50 KHz and 500 KHz) in destroying tumor cells, the electric
        fields were applied to treat mice with malignant melanoma
        tumors. Two pairs of isolects 230 were positioned over a
        corresponding pair of malignant melanomas. Only one pair was
        connected to the generator 210 and 200 KHz alternating electric
        fields (TC fields) were applied to the tumor for a period of 6
        days. One melanoma tumor was not treated so as to permit a
        comparison between the treated tumor and the non-treated tumor.
        After treatment for 6 days, the pigmented melanoma tumor
        remained clearly visible in the non-treated side of the mouse,
        while, in contrast, no tumor is seen on the treated side of the
        mouse. The only areas that were visible discernable on the skin
        were the marks that represented the points of insertion of the
        isolects 230. The fact that the tumor was eliminated at the
        treated side was further demonstrated by cutting and inversing
        the skin so that its inside face was exposed. Such a procedure
        indicated that the tumor has been substantially, if not
        completely, eliminated on the treated side of the mouse. The
        success of the treatment was also further verified by
        pathhistological examination. <br>
        <br>
        [0079] The present inventor has thus uncovered that electric
        fields having particular properties can be used to destroy
        dividing cells or tumors when the electric fields are applied to
        using an electronic device. More specifically, these electric
        fields fall into a special intermediate category, namely
        bio-effective fields that have no meaningful stimulatory and no
        thermal effects, and therefore overcome the disadvantages that
        were associated with the application of conventional electric
        fields to a body. It will also be appreciated that the present
        apparatus can further include a device for rotating the TC field
        relative to the living tissue. For example and according to one
        embodiment, the alternating electric potential applies to the
        tissue being treated is rotated relative to the tissue using
        conventional devices, such as a mechanical device that upon
        activation, rotates various components of the present system. <br>
        <br>
        [0080] While the invention has been particularly shown and
        described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it
        will be understood by those skilled in the art that various
        changes in form and details can be made without departing from
        the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

        <br>
        [0016] [0010] Since electric fields sum as vectors, two or more
        fields with different directions cannot be applied
        simultaneously at a given location. Instead, the different field
        directions must be applied sequentially, by applying a first
        field in one direction for a certain period of time tl, and then
        applying a second field in another direction for a period t2.
        During t2 the first field is not active and during tl the second
        field is inactive. When this cycle is repeated over and over,
        the result is that sequential field pulses of changing
        directions are applied in a cyclic manner. [0017]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0011] The inventor has determined that that the
        effectiveness of TTFields for destroying proliferating cells in
        tissue culture as well as malignant tumors in experimental
        animals is dependent on the rate of switching between the
        various directions of which the fields are applied. In a set of
        experiments, TTFields were applied to the tissue cultures or
        experimental animals by means of two pairs 11, 12 of insulated
        electrodes that alternately apply TTFields 15, 16 normal to each
        other, shown schematically in FIG. 1. The waveforms applied were
        100 - 200 kHz alternating fields modulated to stay On and Off
        for half cycle durations ranging from 10 ms to 1000 ms. [0018]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0012] FIG. 2 shows two examples of waveforms that are
        suitable for modulating the AC signals that were applied between
        the electrodes: a first pair A of 50% duty cycle waveforms 21,
        22 time shifted with respect to each other such that one is on
        when the other is off, and a second pair B of 50% duty cycle
        waveforms 23, 24 that is similar to the first set of waveforms,
        but switched at twice the frequency. Note that each set of
        waveforms consists of two 50% duty cycle square waves that are
        shifted in phase by one half cycle with respect to each other.
        [0019]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0013] FIG. 3 depicts the results of one set of
        experiments by plotting the changes in growth rate of a glioma
        cell culture (F98) treated with 200 kHz alternating electric
        field waveforms switched between two directions at different
        switching rates. Experimental data was also obtained for the
        case where the field was applied continuously in one direction
        only. (Note that the control baseline of 100% is for the case
        when no field was applied.) The data shows that some switching
        frequencies are more effective than others for reducing the
        proliferation of glioma tumor cells in culture. The highest
        effectiveness was found when the half cycle duration was 50 ms
        (with a similar Off duration) waveform. However, the
        effectiveness differences in the range of 250 ms to 50 ms were
        small. Within this range, the cell proliferation rate is reduced
        to about half of what it is when either a continuous field was
        applied, or when a 1000 ms half cycle duration waveform is used.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0014] FIG. 4 is a graph of tumor volume vs. time for a set of
        experiment, and it shows the effect of 200 kHz TTFields on Vx2
        carcinoma growth in vivo, when the fields were applied in two
        different directions at different switching rates. In the
        experiment, tumors from the carcinoma line Vx2 were inoculated
        under the kidney capsule in rabbits. As expected, the tumor size
        increases with time during the 4 week follow up period in the
        control, non-treated, group of rabbits (curve 31). The growth
        rate was slower when the fields were applied in different
        directions with a switch in direction every 1000 ms (curve 32);
        and the growth rate was even slower when the field's direction
        was switched every 250 ms (curve 33) or every 50 ms (curve 34).
        Thus, we see that the effectiveness of the treatment is
        significantly higher for waveform having half duty cycle
        durations of between 50 and 250 ms, as compared with 1000 ms
        half cycles. [0020]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0015] Based on the above, the following approach is
        recommended for tumor treatment with TTFields: Treatment should
        be carried out with at least two field directions, such that
        each pair of electrodes is activated for On periods of a
        duration that is preferably between 50 and 250 ms, interposed by
        Off periods of a similar duration. The TTFields basic
        alternation frequency (which corresponds to the carrier
        frequency in an amplitude modulation system) should preferably
        be in the range of 50 - 500 kHz, and more preferably in the
        range of 100- 200 kHz. The field intensity is preferably at
        least 1 V/cm, and more preferably between 1 and lO V/cm. [0021]
        <br>
        <br>
        [0016] FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a system for generating the
        TTFields in different directions by driving a first electrode
        pair 11 and a second electrode pair 12 that are positioned about
        a target. An AC signal generator 41 generates a sinusoid,
        preferably between 100 - 200 kHz, and a square wave generator 43
        generates a square wave that resembles the wave 21 shown in FIG.
        2. Preferably the output of the square wave is high between 50
        and 250 ms and low for an equal amount of time in every cycle,
        although duty cycles that deviate from 50% may also be used. An
        inverter 44 inverts this square wave, thereby providing the
        second wave 22 shown in FIG 2. The amplifiers 42 amplify the
        sinusoid when their control input is in one state, and shut off
        when their control input is in the other state. Since the
        control input for the two amplifiers are out of phase, the
        amplifiers will alternately drive either the first electrode
        pair 11 or the second electrode pair 12 to generate either the
        first field 15 or the second field 16 in the target region. Of
        course, persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that
        a wide variety of other circuits may be used to alternately
        drive either the first or second pair of electrodes. For
        example, a suitable switching circuit may provided to route the
        output of a single amplifier to either the first or second pair
        of electrodes in an alternating manner, with the switching
        controlled by a single square wave. [0022]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0017] As explained in patent 6,868,289, insulated
        electrodes are preferred for in vivo applications. Preferably,
        care should be taken to avoid overheating of the tissues by the
        capacitive currents and dielectric losses in the insulated
        electrodes. It is also preferable to avoid the generation of
        spikes during the switching process. This can be done, for
        example, by carrying out the switching itself while the AC
        signal is turned off and immediately afterwards turning the
        signal on. The rate of turning the field on t3 and off t4 should
        preferably be done at a rate that is slow relative to the
        reciprocal of the field frequency (i.e., the period t5), and
        fast relative to the half cycle duration tl, t2, as seen in FIG.
        6 for waveform 61. An example of a suitable turn-on rate t3 and
        turn-on rate t4 is to reach 90% of the steady-state values
        within about 1 - 5 ms. Circuitry for implementing this slow turn
        on may be implemented using a variety of approaches that will be
        apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts, such as using
        a slow-rising control signal to drive an accurate AM modulator,
        or by driving a gain control of the amplifier with a square wave
        and interposing a low pass filter in series with the gain
        control input. [0023]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0018] While examples of the invention are described above
        in the context of F98 glioma and Vx2 carcinoma, the switching
        rate may be optimized for other cancers or other rapidly
        proliferating cells by running experiments to determine the best
        switching rate, and subsequently using that switching rate to
        treat the problem in future cases.<br>

        &nbsp;TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] This invention concerns selective
        destruction of rapidly dividing cells in a localized area, and
        more particularly, selectively destroying dividing cells without
        destroying nearby non-dividing cells by applying an electric
        field with specific characteristics to a target area in a living
        patient. <br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> BACKGROUND</span><br>
        <br>
        0003] All living organisms proliferate by cell division,
        including cell cultures, microorganisms (such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, yeast, protozoa, and other single-celled organisms),
        fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Dividing cells of organisms can
        be destroyed, or their proliferation controlled, by methods that
        are based on the sensitivity of the dividing cells of these
        organisms to certain agents. For example, certain antibiotics
        stop the multiplication process of bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0004] The process of eukaryotic cell division is called
        "mitosis", which involves nice distinct phases (see Darnell et
        al., Molecular Cell Biology, New York: Scientific American
        Books, 1986, p. 149). During interphase, the cell replicates
        chromosomal DNA, which begins condensing in early prophase. At
        this point, centrioles (each cell contains 2) begin moving
        towards opposite poles of the cell. In middle prophase, each
        chromosome is composed of duplicate chromatids. Microtubular
        spindles radiate from regions adjacent to the centrioles, which
        are closer to their poles. By late prophase, the centrioles have
        reached the poles, and some spindle fibers extend to the center
        of the cell, while others extend from the poles to the
        chromatids. The cells then move into metaphase, when the
        chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell and align in the
        equatorial plane. Next is early anaphase, during which time
        daughter chromatids separate from each other at the equator by
        moving along the spindle fibers toward a centromere at opposite
        poles. The cell begins to elongate along the axis of the pole;
        the pole-to-pole spindles also elongate. Late anaphase occurs
        when the daughter chromosomes (as they are now called) each
        reach their respective opposite poles. At this point,
        cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow begins to form at the
        equator of the cell. In other words, late anaphase is the point
        at which pinching the cell membrane begins. During telophase,
        cytokinesis is nearly complete and spindles disappear. Only a
        relatively narrow membrane connection joins the two cytoplasms.
        Finally, the membranes separate fully, cytokinesis is complete
        and the cell returns to interphase. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] In meiosis, the cell undergoes a second division,
        involving separation of sister chromosomes to opposite poles of
        the cell along spindle fibers, followed by formation of a
        cleavage furrow and cell division. However, this division is not
        preceded by chromosome replication, yielding a haploid germ
        cell. Bacteria also divide by chromosome replication, followed
        by cell separation. However, since the daughter chromosomes
        separate by attachment to membrane components; there is no
        visible apparatus that contributes to cell division as in
        eukaryotic cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0006] It is well known that tumors, particularly
        malignant or cancerous tumors, grow uncontrollably compared to
        normal tissue. Such expedited growth enables tumors to occupy an
        ever-increasing space and to damage or destroy tissue adjacent
        thereto. Furthermore, certain cancers are characterized by an
        ability to transmit cancerous "seeds", including single cells or
        small cell clusters (metastases), to new locations where the
        metastatic cancer cells grow into additional tumors.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0007] The rapid growth of tumors, in general, and
        malignant tumors in particular, as described above, is the
        result of relatively frequent cell division or multiplication of
        these cells compared to normal tissue cells. The distinguishably
        frequent cell division of cancer cells is the basis for the
        effectiveness of existing cancer treatments, e.g., irradiation
        therapy and the use of various chemo-therapeutic agents. Such
        treatments are based on the fact that cells undergoing division
        are more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents than
        non-dividing cells. Because tumors cells divide much more
        frequently than normal cells, it is possible, to a certain
        extent, to selectively damage or destroy tumor cells by
        radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The actual sensitivity of
        cells to radiation, therapeutic agents, etc., is also dependent
        on specific characteristics of different types of normal or
        malignant cell types. Thus, unfortunately, the sensitivity of
        tumor cells is not sufficiently higher than that many types of
        normal tissues. This diminishes the ability to distinguish
        between tumor cells and normal cells, and therefore, existing
        cancer treatments typically cause significant damage to normal
        tissues, thus limiting the therapeutic effectiveness of such
        treatments. Furthermore, the inevitable damage to other tissue
        renders treatments very traumatic to the patients and, often,
        patients are unable to recover from a seemingly successful
        treatment. Also, certain types of tumors are not sensitive at
        all to existing methods of treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0008] There are also other methods for destroying cells
        that do not rely on radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone. For
        example, ultrasonic and electrical methods for destroying tumor
        cells can be used in addition to or instead of conventional
        treatments. Electric fields and currents have been used for
        medical purposes for many years. The most common is the
        generation of electric currents in a human or animal body by
        application of an electric field by means of a pair of
        conductive electrodes between which a potential difference is
        maintained. These electric currents are used either to exert
        their specific effects, i.e., to stimulate excitable tissue, or
        to generate heat by flowing in the body since it acts as a
        resistor. Examples of the first type of application include the
        following: cardiac defibrillators, peripheral nerve and muscle
        stimulators, brain stimulators, etc. Currents are used for
        heating, for example, in devices for tumor ablation, ablation of
        malfunctioning cardiac or brain tissue, cauterization,
        relaxation of muscle rheumatic pain and other pain, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0009] Another use of electric fields for medical purposes
        involves the utilization of high frequency oscillating fields
        transmitted from a source that emits an electric wave, such as
        an RF wave or a microwave source that is directed at the part of
        the body that is of interest (i.e., target). In these instances,
        there is no electric energy conduction between the source and
        the body; but rather, the energy is transmitted to the body by
        radiation or induction. More specifically, the electric energy
        generated by the source reaches the vicinity of the body via a
        conductor and is transmitted from it through air or some other
        electric insulating material to the human body.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0010] In a conventional electrical method, electrical
        current is delivered to a region of the target tissue using
        electrodes that are placed in contact with the body of the
        patient. The applied electrical current destroys substantially
        all cells in the vicinity of the target tissue. Thus, this type
        of electrical method does not discriminate between different
        types of cells within the target tissue and results in the
        destruction of both tumor cells and normal cells.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] Electric fields that can be used in medical applications
        can thus be separated generally into two different modes. In the
        first mode, the electric fields are applied to the body or
        tissues by means of conducting electrodes. These electric fields
        can be separated into two types, namely (1) steady fields or
        fields that change at relatively slow rates, and alternating
        fields of low frequencies that induce corresponding electric
        currents in the body or tissues, and (2) high frequency
        alternating fields (above 1 MHz) applied to the body by means of
        the conducting electrodes. In the second mode, the electric
        fields are high frequency alternating fields applied to the body
        by means of insulated electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0012] The first type of electric field is used, for
        example, to stimulate nerves and muscles, pace the heart, etc.
        In fact, such fields are used in nature to propagate signals in
        nerve and muscle fibers, central nervous system (CNS), heart,
        etc. The recording of such natural fields is the basis for the
        ECG, EEG, EMG, ERG, etc. The field strength in these
        applications, assuming a medium of homogenous electric
        properties, is simply the voltage applied to the
        stimulating/recording electrodes divided by the distance between
        them. These currents can be calculated by Ohm's law and can have
        dangerous stimulatory effects on the heart and CNS and can
        result in potentially harmful ion concentration changes. Also,
        if the currents are strong enough, they can cause excessive
        heating in the tissues. This heating can be calculated by the
        power dissipated in the tissue (the product of the voltage and
        the current). <br>
        <br>
        [0013] When such electric fields and currents are alternating,
        their stimulatory power, on nerve, muscle, etc., is an inverse
        function of the frequency. At frequencies above 1-10 KHz, the
        stimulation power of the fields approaches zero. This limitation
        is due to the fact that excitation induced by electric
        stimulation is normally mediated by membrane potential changes,
        the rate of which is limited by the RC properties (time
        constants on the order of 1 ms) of the membrane.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0014] Regardless of the frequency, when such current
        inducing fields are applied, they are associated with harmful
        side effects caused by currents. For example, one negative
        effect is the changes in ionic concentration in the various
        "compartments" within the system, and the harmful products of
        the electrolysis taking place at the electrodes, or the medium
        in which the tissues are imbedded. The changes in ion
        concentrations occur whenever the system includes two or more
        compartments between which the organism maintains ion
        concentration differences. For example, for most tissues,
        [Ca&lt;++&gt; ] in the extracellular fluid is about 2*10&lt;-3
        &gt; M, while in the cytoplasm of typical cells its
        concentration can be as low as 10&lt;-7 &gt; M. A current
        induced in such a system by a pair of electrodes, flows in part
        from the extracellular fluid into the cells and out again into
        the extracellular medium. About 2% of the current flowing into
        the cells is carried by the Ca&lt;++&gt; ions. In contrast,
        because the concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;++&gt; is much
        smaller, only a negligible fraction of the currents that exits
        the cells is carried by these ions. Thus, Ca&lt;++&gt; ions
        accumulate in the cells such that their concentrations in the
        cells increases, while the concentration in the extracellular
        compartment may decrease. These effects are observed for both DC
        and alternating currents (AC). The rate of accumulation of the
        ions depends on the current intensity ion mobilities, membrane
        ion conductance, etc. An increase in [Ca&lt;++&gt; ] is harmful
        to most cells and if sufficiently high will lead to the
        destruction of the cells. Similar considerations apply to other
        ions. In view of the above observations, long term current
        application to living organisms or tissues can result in
        significant damage. Another major problem that is associated
        with such electric fields, is due to the electrolysis process
        that takes place at the electrode surfaces. Here charges are
        transferred between the metal (electrons) and the electrolytic
        solution (ions) such that charged active radicals are formed.
        These can cause significant damage to organic molecules,
        especially macromolecules and thus damage the living cells and
        tissues.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0015] In contrast, when high frequency electric fields,
        above 1 MHz and usually in practice in the range of GHz, are
        induced in tissues by means of insulated electrodes, the
        situation is quite different. These type of fields generate only
        capacitive or displacement currents, rather than the
        conventional charge conducting currents. Under the effect of
        this type of field, living tissues behave mostly according to
        their dielectric properties rather than their electric
        conductive properties. Therefore, the dominant field effect is
        that due to dielectric losses and heating. Thus, it is widely
        accepted that in practice, the meaningful effects of such fields
        on living organisms, are only those due to their heating
        effects, i.e., due to dielectric losses.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0016] In U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,066 ('066) to Mangano, a
        method and device are presented which enable discrete objects
        having a conducting inner core, surrounded by a dielectric
        membrane to be selectively inactivated by electric fields via
        irreversible breakdown of their dielectric membrane. One
        potential application for this is in the selection and purging
        of certain biological cells in a suspension. According to the
        '066 patent, an electric field is applied for targeting selected
        cells to cause breakdown of the dielectric membranes of these
        tumor cells, while purportedly not adversely affecting other
        desired subpopulations of cells. The cells are selected on the
        basis of intrinsic or induced differences in a characteristic
        electroporation threshold. The differences in this threshold can
        depend upon a number of parameters, including the difference in
        cell size.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0017] The method of the '066 patent is therefore based on
        the assumption that the electroporation threshold of tumor cells
        is sufficiently distinguishable from that of normal cells
        because of differences in cell size and differences in the
        dielectric properties of the cell membranes. Based upon this
        assumption, the larger size of many types of tumor cells makes
        these cells more susceptible to electroporation and thus, it may
        be possible to selectively damage only the larger tumor cell
        membranes by applying an appropriate electric field. One
        disadvantage of this method is that the ability to discriminate
        is highly dependent upon cell type, for example, the size
        difference between normal cells and tumor cells is significant
        only in certain types of cells. Another drawback of this method
        is that the voltages which are applied can damage some of the
        normal cells and may not damage all of the tumor cells because
        the differences in size and membrane dielectric properties are
        largely statistical and the actual cell geometries and
        dielectric properties can vary significantly.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0018] What is needed in the art and has heretofore not
        been available is an apparatus for destroying dividing cells,
        wherein the apparatus better discriminates between dividing
        cells, including single-celled organisms, and non-dividing cells
        and is capable of selectively destroying the dividing cells or
        organisms with substantially no effect on the non-dividing cells
        or organisms. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0019] While they are dividing, cells are vulnerable to
        damage by AC electric fields that have specific frequency and
        field strength characteristics. The selective destruction of
        rapidly dividing cells can therefore be accomplished by imposing
        an AC electric field in a target region for extended periods of
        time. Some of the cells that divide while the field is applied
        will be damaged, but the cells that do not divide will not be
        harmed. This selectively damages rapidly dividing cells like
        tumor cells, but does not harm normal cells that are not
        dividing. Since the vulnerability of the dividing cells is
        strongly related to the alignment between the long axis of the
        dividing cells and the lines of force of the electric field,
        improved results are obtained by sequentially imposing the field
        in different directions. <br>
        <br>
        [0020] A major use of the present apparatus is in the treatment
        of tumors by selective destruction of tumor cells with
        substantially no effect on normal tissue cells, and thus, the
        exemplary apparatus is described below in the context of
        selective destruction of tumor cells. It should be appreciated
        however, that for purpose of the following description, the term
        "cell" may also refer to a single-celled organism (eubacteria,
        bacteria, yeast, protozoa), multi-celled organisms (fungi,
        algae, mold), and plants as or parts thereof that are not
        normally classified as "cells". The exemplary apparatus enables
        selective destruction of cells undergoing division in a way that
        is more effective and more accurate (e.g., more adaptable to be
        aimed at specific targets) than existing methods. Further, the
        present apparatus causes minimal damage, if any, to normal
        tissue and, thus, reduces or eliminates many side-effects
        associated with existing selective destruction methods, such as
        radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The selective destruction of
        dividing cells using the present apparatus does not depend on
        the sensitivity of the cells to chemical agents or radiation.
        Instead, the selective destruction of dividing cells is based on
        distinguishable geometrical characteristics of cells undergoing
        division, in comparison to non-dividing cells, regardless of the
        cell geometry of the type of cells being treated.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0021] According to one exemplary embodiment, cell
        geometry-dependent selective destruction of living tissue is
        performed by inducing a non-homogenous electric field in the
        cells using an electronic apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0022] It has been observed by the present inventor that,
        while different cells in their non-dividing state may have
        different shapes, e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
        "pancake-like", etc., the division process of practically all
        cells is characterized by development of a "cleavage furrow" in
        late anaphase and telophase. This cleavage furrow is a slow
        constriction of the cell membrane (between the two sets of
        daughter chromosomes) which appears microscopically as a growing
        cleft (e.g., a groove or notch) that gradually separates the
        cell into two new cells. During the division process, there is a
        transient period (telophase) during which the cell structure is
        basically that of two sub-cells interconnected by a narrow
        "bridge" formed of the cell material. The division process is
        completed when the "bridge" between the two sub-cells is broken.
        The selective destruction of tumor cells using the present
        electronic apparatus utilizes this unique geometrical feature of
        dividing cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0023] When a cell or a group of cells are under natural
        conditions or environment, i.e., part of a living tissue, they
        are disposed surrounded by a conductive environment consisting
        mostly of an electrolytic inter-cellular fluid and other cells
        that are composed mostly of an electrolytic intra-cellular
        liquid. When an electric field is induced in the living tissue,
        by applying an electric potential across the tissue, an electric
        field is formed in the tissue and the specific distribution and
        configuration of the electric field lines defines the direction
        of charge displacement, or paths of electric currents in the
        tissue, if currents are in fact induced in the tissue. The
        distribution and configuration of the electric field is
        dependent on various parameters of the tissue, including the
        geometry and the electric properties of the different tissue
        components, and the relative conductivities, capacities and
        dielectric constants (that may be frequency dependent) of the
        tissue components.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0024] The electric current flow pattern for cells
        undergoing division is very different and unique as compared to
        non-dividing cells. Such cells including first and second
        sub-cells, namely an "original" cell and a newly formed cell,
        that are connected by a cytoplasm "bridge" or "neck". The
        currents penetrate the first sub-cell through part of the
        membrane ("the current source pole"); however, they do not exit
        the first sub-cell through a portion of its membrane closer to
        the opposite pole ("the current sink pole"). Instead, the lines
        of current flow converge at the neck or cytoplasm bridge,
        whereby the density of the current flow lines is greatly
        increased. A corresponding, "mirror image", process that takes
        place in the second sub-cell, whereby the current flow lines
        diverge to a lower density configuration as they depart from the
        bridge, and finally exit the second sub-cell from a part of its
        membrane closes to the current sink.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0025] When a polarizable object is placed in a
        non-uniform converging or diverging field, electric forces act
        on it and pull it towards the higher density electric field
        lines. In the case of dividing cell, electric forces are exerted
        in the direction of the cytoplasm bridge between the two cells.
        Since all intercellular organelles and macromolecules are
        polarizable, they are all force towards the bridge between the
        two cells. The field polarity is irrelevant to the direction of
        the force and, therefore, an alternating electric having
        specific properties can be used to produce substantially the
        same effect. It will also be appreciated that the concentrated
        and inhomogeneous electric field present in or near the bridge
        or neck portion in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can lead to the disruption of structures
        associated with these members. <br>
        <br>
        [0026] The movement of the cellular organelles towards the
        bridge disrupts the cell structure and results in increased
        pressure in the vicinity of the connecting bridge membrane. This
        pressure of the organelles on the bridge membrane is expected to
        break the bridge membrane and, thus, it is expected that the
        dividing cell will "explode" in response to this pressure. The
        ability to break the membrane and disrupt other cell structures
        can be enhanced by applying a pulsating alternating electric
        field that has a frequency from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz.
        When this type of electric field is applied to the tissue, the
        forces exerted on the intercellular organelles have a
        "hammering" effect, whereby force pulses (or beats) are applied
        to the organelles numerous times per second, enhancing the
        movement of organelles of different sizes and masses towards the
        bridge (or neck) portion from both of the sub-cells, thereby
        increasing the probability of breaking the cell membrane at the
        bridge portion. The forces exerted on the intracellular
        organelles also affect the organelles themselves and may
        collapse or break the organelles.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0027] According to one exemplary embodiment, the
        apparatus for applying the electric field is an electronic
        apparatus that generates the desired electric signals in the
        shape of waveforms or trains of pulses. The electronic apparatus
        includes a generator that generates an alternating voltage
        waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz. The generator is operatively connected to conductive
        leads which are connected at their other ends to insulated
        conductors/electrodes (also referred to as isolects) that are
        activated by the generated waveforms. The insulated electrodes
        consist of a conductor in contact with a dielectric (insulating
        layer) that is in contact with the conductive tissue, thus
        forming a capacitor. The electric fields that are generated by
        the present apparatus can be applied in several different modes
        depending upon the precise treatment application.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0028] In one exemplary embodiment, the electric fields
        are applied by external insulated electrodes which are
        incorporated into an article of clothing and which are
        constructed so that the applied electric fields are of a local
        type that target a specific, localized area of tissue (e.g., a
        tumor). This embodiment is designed to treat tumors and lesions
        that are at or below the skin surface by wearing the article of
        clothing over the target tissue so that the electric fields
        generated by the insulated electrodes are directed at the tumors
        (lesions, etc.). <br>
        <br>
        [0029] According to another embodiment, the apparatus is used in
        an internal type application in that the insulated electrodes
        are in the form of a probe or catheter etc., that enter the body
        through natural pathways, such as the urethra or vagina, or are
        configured to penetrate living tissue, until the insulated
        electrodes are positioned near the internal target area (e.g.,
        an internal tumor).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0030] Thus, the present apparatus utilizes electric
        fields that fall into a special intermediate category relative
        to previous high and low frequency applications in that the
        present electric fields are bio-effective fields that have no
        meaningful stimulatory effects and no thermal effects.
        Advantageously, when non-dividing cells are subjected to these
        electric fields, there is no effect on the cells; however, the
        situation is much different when dividing cells are subjected to
        the present electric fields. Thus, the present electronic
        apparatus and the generated electric fields target dividing
        cells, such as tumors or the like, and do not target
        non-dividing cells that is found around in healthy tissue
        surrounding the target area. Furthermore, since the present
        apparatus utilizes insulated electrodes, the above mentioned
        negative effects, obtained when conductive electrodes are used,
        i.e., ion concentration changes in the cells and the formation
        of harmful agents by electrolysis, do not occur with the present
        apparatus. This is because, in general, no actual transfer of
        charges takes place between the electrodes and the medium, and
        there is no charge flow in the medium where the currents are
        capacitive.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0031] It should be appreciated that the present
        electronic apparatus can also be used in applications other than
        treatment of tumors in the living body. In fact, the selective
        destruction utilizing the present apparatus can be used in
        conjunction with any organism that proliferates by division, for
        example, tissue cultures, microorganisms, such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, protozoa, fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Such
        organisms divide by the formation of a groove or cleft as
        described above. As the groove or cleft deepens, a narrow bridge
        is formed between the two parts of the organism, similar to the
        bridge formed between the sub-cells of dividing animal cells.
        Since such organisms are covered by a membrane having a
        relatively low electric conductivity, similar to an animal cell
        membrane described above, the electric field lines in a dividing
        organism converge at the bridge connecting the two parts of the
        dividing organism. The converging field lines result in electric
        forces that displace polarizable elements and charges within the
        dividing organism.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0032] The above, and other objects, features and
        advantages of the present apparatus will become apparent from
        the following description read in conjunction with the
        accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals
        designate the same elements.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
          PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0065] Reference is made to FIGS. 1A-1E which
        schematically illustrate various stages of a cell division
        process. FIG. 1A illustrates a cell 10 at its normal geometry,
        which can be generally spherical (as illustrated in the
        drawings), ellipsoidal, cylindrical, "pancake-like" or any other
        cell geometry, as is known in the art. FIGS. 1B-1D illustrate
        cell 10 during different stages of its division process, which
        results in the formation of two new cells 18 and 20, shown in
        FIG. 1E.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0066] As shown in FIGS. 1B-1D, the division process of
        cell 10 is characterized by a slowly growing cleft 12 which
        gradually separates cell 10 into two units, namely sub-cells 14
        and 16, which eventually evolve into new cells 18 and 20 (FIG.
        1E). A shown specifically in FIG. 1D, the division process is
        characterized by a transient period during which the structure
        of cell 10 is basically that of the two sub-cells 14 and 16
        interconnected by a narrow "bridge" 22 containing cell material
        (cytoplasm surrounded by cell membrane).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0067] Reference is now made to FIGS. 2A and 2B, which
        schematically illustrate non-dividing cell 10 being subjected to
        an electric field produced by applying an alternating electric
        potential, at a relatively low frequency and at a relatively
        high frequency, respectively. Cell 10 includes intracellular
        organelles, e.g., a nucleus 30. Alternating electric potential
        is applied across electrodes 28 and 32 that can be attached
        externally to a patient at a predetermined region, e.g., in the
        vicinity of the tumor being treated. When cell 10 is under
        natural conditions, i.e., part of a living tissue, it is
        disposed in a conductive environment (hereinafter referred to as
        a "volume conductor") consisting mostly of electrolytic
        inter-cellular liquid. When an electric potential is applied
        across electrodes 28 and 32, some of the field lines of the
        resultant electric field (or the current induced in the tissue
        in response to the electric field) penetrate the cell 10, while
        the rest of the field lines (or induced current) flow in the
        surrounding medium. The specific distribution of the electric
        field lines, which is substantially consistent with the
        direction of current flow in this instance, depends on the
        geometry and the electric properties of the system components,
        e.g., the relative conductivities and dielectric constants of
        the system components, that can be frequency dependent. For low
        frequencies, e.g., frequencies lower than 10 KHz, the
        conductance properties of the components completely dominate the
        current flow and the field distribution, and the field
        distribution is generally as depicted in FIG. 2A. At higher
        frequencies, e.g., at frequencies of between 10 KHz and 1 MHz,
        the dielectric properties of the components becomes more
        significant and eventually dominate the field distribution,
        resulting in field distribution lines as depicted generally in
        FIG. 2B.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0068] For constant (i.e., DC) electric fields or
        relatively low frequency alternating electric fields, for
        example, frequencies under 10 KHz, the dielectric properties of
        the various components are not significant in determining and
        computing the field distribution. Therefore, as a first
        approximation, with regard to the electric field distribution,
        the system can be reasonably represented by the relative
        impedances of its various components. Using this approximation,
        the intercellular (i.e., extracellular) fluid and the
        intracellular fluid each has a relatively low impedance, while
        the cell membrane 11 has a relatively high impedance. Thus,
        under low frequency conditions, only a fraction of the electric
        field lines (or currents induced by the electric field)
        penetrate membrane 11 of the cell 10. At relatively high
        frequencies (e.g., 10 KHz-1 MHz), in contrast, the impedance of
        membrane 11 relative to the intercellular and intracellular
        fluids decreases, and thus, the fraction of currents penetrating
        the cells increases significantly. It should be noted that at
        very high frequencies, i.e., above 1 MHz, the membrane
        capacitance can short the membrane resistance and, therefore,
        the total membrane resistance can become negligible.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0069] In any of the embodiments described above, the
        electric field lines (or induced currents) penetrate cell 10
        from a portion of the membrane 11 closest to one of the
        electrodes generating the current, e.g., closest to positive
        electrode 28 (also referred to herein as "source"). The current
        flow pattern across cell 10 is generally uniform because, under
        the above approximation, the field induced inside the cell is
        substantially homogeneous. The currents exit cell 10 through a
        portion of membrane 11 closest to the opposite electrode, e.g.,
        negative electrode 32 (also referred to herein as "sink"). <br>
        <br>
        [0070] The distinction between field lines and current flow can
        depend on a number of factors, for example, on the frequency of
        the applied electric potential and on whether electrodes 28 and
        32 are electrically insulated. For insulated electrodes applying
        a DC or low frequency alternating voltage, there is practically
        no current flow along the lines of the electric field. At higher
        frequencies, the displacement currents are induced in the tissue
        due to charging and discharging of the electrode insulation and
        the cell membranes (which act as capacitors to a certain
        extent), and such currents follow the lines of the electric
        field. Fields generated by non-insulated electrodes, in
        contrast, always generate some form of current flow,
        specifically, DC or low frequency alternating fields generate
        conductive current flow along the field lines, and high
        frequency alternating fields generate both conduction and
        displacement currents along the field lines. It should be
        appreciated, however, that movement of polarizable intracellular
        organelles according to the present invention (as described
        below) is not dependent on actual flow of current and,
        therefore, both insulated and non-insulated electrodes can be
        used efficiently. Advantages of insulated electrodes include
        lower power consumption, less heating of the treated regions,
        and improved patient safety. <br>
        <br>
        [0071] According to one exemplary embodiment of the present
        invention, the electric fields that are used are alternating
        fields having frequencies that are in the range from about 50
        KHz to about 500 KHz, and preferably from about 100 KHz to about
        300 KHz. For ease of discussion, these type of electric fields
        are also referred to below as "TC fields", which is an
        abbreviation of "Tumor Curing electric fields", since these
        electric fields fall into an intermediate category (between high
        and low frequency ranges) that have bio-effective field
        properties while having no meaningful stimulatory and thermal
        effects. These frequencies are sufficiently low so that the
        system behavior is determined by the system's Ohmic (conductive)
        properties but sufficiently high enough not to have any
        stimulation effect on excitable tissues. Such a system consists
        of two types of elements, namely, the intercellular, or
        extracellular fluid, or medium and the individual cells. The
        intercellular fluid is mostly an electrolyte with a specific
        resistance of about 40-100 Ohm*cm. As mentioned above, the cells
        are characterized by three elements, namely (1) a thin, highly
        electric resistive membrane that coats the cell; (2) internal
        cytoplasm that is mostly an electrolyte that contains numerous
        macromolecules and micro-organelles, including the nucleus; and
        (3) membranes, similar in their electric properties to the cell
        membrane, cover the micro-organelles. <br>
        <br>
        [0072] When this type of system is subjected to the present TC
        fields (e.g., alternating electric fields in the frequency range
        of 100 KHz-300 KHz) most of the lines of the electric field and
        currents tend away from the cells because of the high resistive
        cell membrane and therefore the lines remain in the
        extracellular conductive medium. In the above recited frequency
        range, the actual fraction of electric field or currents that
        penetrates the cells is a strong function of the frequency. <br>
        <br>
        [0073] FIG. 2 schematically depicts the resulting field
        distribution in the system. As illustrated, the lines of force,
        which also depict the lines of potential current flow across the
        cell volume mostly in parallel with the undistorted lines of
        force (the main direction of the electric field). In other
        words, the field inside the cells is mostly homogeneous. In
        practice, the fraction of the field or current that penetrates
        the cells is determined by the cell membrane impedance value
        relative to that of the extracellular fluid. Since the
        equivalent electric circuit of the cell membrane is that of a
        resistor and capacitor in parallel, the impedance is a function
        of the frequency. The higher the frequency, the lower the
        impedance, the larger the fraction of penetrating current and
        the smaller the field distortion (Rotshenker S. &amp; Y. Palti,
        Changes in fraction of current penetrating an axon as a function
        of duration of stimulating pulse, J. Theor. Biol. 41; 401-407
        (1973).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0074] As previously mentioned, when cells are subjected
        to relatively weak electric fields and currents that alternate
        at high frequencies, such as the present TC fields having a
        frequency in the range of 50 KHz-500 KHz, they have no effect on
        the non-dividing cells. While the present TC fields have no
        detectable effect on such systems, the situation becomes
        different in the presence of dividing cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0075] Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A-3C which
        schematically illustrate the electric current flow pattern in
        cell 10 during its division process, under the influence of
        alternating fields (TC fields) in the frequency range from about
        100 KHz to about 300 KHz in accordance with one exemplary
        embodiment. The field lines or induced currents penetrate cell
        10 through a part of the membrane of sub-cell 16 closer to
        electrode 28. However, they do not exit through the cytoplasm
        bridge 22 that connects sub-cell 16 with the newly formed yet
        still attached sub-cell 14, or through a part of the membrane in
        the vicinity of the bridge 22. Instead, the electric field or
        current flow lines-that are relatively widely separated in
        sub-cell 16-converge as they approach bridge 22 (also referred
        to as "neck" 22) and, thus, the current/field line density
        within neck 22 is increased dramatically. A "mirror image"
        process takes place in sub-cell 14, whereby the converging field
        lines in bridge 22 diverge as they approach the exit region of
        sub-cell 14. <br>
        <br>
        [0076] It should be appreciated by persons skilled in the art
        that homogeneous electric fields do not exert a force on
        electrically neutral objects, i.e., objects having substantially
        zero net charge, although such objects can become polarized.
        However, under a non-uniform, converging electric field, as
        shown in FIGS. 3A-3C, electric forces are exerted on polarized
        objects, moving them in the direction of the higher density
        electric field lines. It will be appreciated that the
        concentrated electric field that is present in the neck or
        bridge area in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can disrupt structures that are associated
        therewith. One will understand that similar net forces act on
        charges in an alternating field, again in the direction of the
        field of higher intensity.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0077] In the configuration of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the
        direction of movement of polarized and charged objects is
        towards the higher density electric field lines, i.e., towards
        the cytoplasm bridge 22 between sub-cells 14 and 16. It is known
        in the art that all intracellular organelles, for example,
        nuclei 24 and 26 of sub-cells 14 and 16, respectively, are
        polarizable and, thus, such intracellular organelles are
        electrically forced in the direction of the bridge 22. Since the
        movement is always from lower density currents to the higher
        density currents, regardless of the field polarity, the forces
        applied by the alternating electric field to organelles, such as
        nuclei 24 and 26, are always in the direction of bridge 22. A
        comprehensive description of such forces and the resulting
        movement of macromolecules of intracellular organelles, a
        phenomenon referred to as "dielectrophoresis" is described
        extensively in literature, e.g., in C. L. Asbury &amp; G. van
        den Engh, Biophys. J. 74, 1024-1030, 1998, the disclosure of
        which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0078] The movement of the organelles 24 and 26 towards
        the bridge 22 disrupts the structure of the dividing cell,
        change the concentration of the various cell constituents and,
        eventually, the pressure of the converging organelles on bridge
        membrane 22 results in the breakage of cell membrane 11 at the
        vicinity of the bridge 22, as shown schematically in FIG. 3C.
        The ability to break membrane 11 at bridge 22 and to otherwise
        disrupt the cell structure and organization can be enhanced by
        applying a pulsating AC electric field, rather than a steady AC
        field. When a pulsating field is applied, the forces acting on
        organelles 24 and 26 have a "hammering" effect, whereby pulsed
        forces beat on the intracellular organelles towards the neck 22
        from both sub-cells 14 and 16, thereby increasing the
        probability of breaking cell membrane 11 in the vicinity of neck
        22.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0079] A very important element, which is very susceptible
        to the special fields that develop within the dividing cells is
        the microtubule spindle that plays a major role in the division
        process. In FIG. 4, a dividing cell 10 is illustrated, at an
        earlier stage as compared to FIGS. 3A and 3B, under the
        influence of external TC fields (e.g., alternating fields in the
        frequency range of about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz), generally
        indicated as lines 100, with a corresponding spindle mechanism
        generally indicated at 120. The lines 120 are microtubules that
        are known to have a very strong dipole moment. This strong
        polarization makes the tubules, as well as other polar
        macromolecules and especially those that have a specific
        orientation within the cells or its surrounding, susceptible to
        electric fields. Their positive charges are located at the two
        centrioles while two sets of negative poles are at the center of
        the dividing cell and the other pair is at the points of
        attachment of the microtubules to the cell membrane, generally
        indicated at 130. This structure forms sets of double dipoles
        and therefore they are susceptible to fields of different
        directions. It will be understood that the effect of the TC
        fields on the dipoles does not depend on the formation of the
        bridge (neck) and thus, the dipoles are influenced by the TC
        fields prior to the formation of the bridge (neck).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0080] Since the present apparatus (as will be described
        in greater detail below) utilizes insulated electrodes, the
        above-mentioned negative effects obtained when conductive
        electrodes are used, i.e., ion concentration changes in the
        cells and the formation of harmful agents by electrolysis, do
        not occur when the present apparatus is used. This is because,
        in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place between
        the electrodes and the medium and there is no charge flow in the
        medium where the currents are capacitive, i.e., are expressed
        only as rotation of charges, etc.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0081] Turning now to FIG. 5, the TC fields described
        above that have been found to advantageously destroy tumor cells
        are generated by an electronic apparatus 200. FIG. 5 is a simple
        schematic diagram of the electronic apparatus 200 illustrating
        the major components thereof. The electronic apparatus 200
        generates the desired electric signals (TC signals) in the shape
        of waveforms or trains of pulses. The apparatus 200 includes a
        generator 210 and a pair of conductive leads 220 that are
        attached at one end thereof to the generator 210. The opposite
        ends of the leads 220 are connected to insulated conductors 230
        that are activated by the electric signals (e.g., waveforms).
        The insulated conductors 230 are also referred to hereinafter as
        isolects 230. Optionally and according to another exemplary
        embodiment, the apparatus 200 includes a temperature sensor 240
        and a control box 250 which are both added to control the
        amplitude of the electric field generated so as not to generate
        excessive heating in the area that is treated.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0082] The generator 210 generates an alternating voltage
        waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz (preferably from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz) (i.e.,
        the TC fields). The required voltages are such that the electric
        field intensity in the tissue to be treated is in the range of
        about 0.1 V/cm to about 10 V/cm. To achieve this field, the
        actual potential difference between the two conductors in the
        isolects 230 is determined by the relative impedances of the
        system components, as described below.<br>
        <br>
        [0083] When the control box 250 is included, it controls the
        output of the generator 210 so that it will remain constant at
        the value preset by the user or the control box 250 sets the
        output at the maximal value that does not cause excessive
        heating, or the control box 250 issues a warning or the like
        when the temperature (sensed by temperature sensor 240) exceeds
        a preset limit. <br>
        <br>
        [0084] The leads 220 are standard isolated conductors with a
        flexible metal shield, preferably grounded so that it prevents
        the spread of the electric field generated by the leads 220. The
        isolects 230 have specific shapes and positioning so as to
        generate an electric field of the desired configuration,
        direction and intensity at the target volume and only there so
        as to focus the treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0085] The specifications of the apparatus 200 as a whole
        and its individual components are largely influenced by the fact
        that at the frequency of the present TC fields (50 KHz-500 KHz),
        living systems behave according to their "Ohmic", rather than
        their dielectric properties. The only elements in the apparatus
        200 that behave differently are the insulators of the isolects
        230 (see FIGS. 7-9). The isolects 200 consist of a conductor in
        contact with a dielectric that is in contact with the conductive
        tissue thus forming a capacitor.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0086] The details of the construction of the isolects 230
        is based on their electric behavior that can be understood from
        their simplified electric circuit when in contact with tissue as
        generally illustrated in FIG. 6. In the illustrated arrangement,
        the potential drop or the electric field distribution between
        the different components is determined by their relative
        electric impedance, i.e., the fraction of the field on each
        component is given by the value of its impedance divided by the
        total circuit impedance. For example, the potential drop on
        element [Delta]VA=A/(A+B+C+D+E). Thus, for DC or low frequency
        AC, practically all the potential drop is on the capacitor (that
        acts as an insulator). For relatively very high frequencies, the
        capacitor practically is a short and therefore, practically all
        the field is distributed in the tissues. At the frequencies of
        the present TC fields (e.g., 50 KHz to 500 KHz), which are
        intermediate frequencies, the impedance of the capacitance of
        the capacitors is dominant and determines the field
        distribution. Therefore, in order to increase the effective
        voltage drop across the tissues (field intensity), the impedance
        of the capacitors is to be decreased (i.e., increase their
        capacitance). This can be achieved by increasing the effective
        area of the "plates" of the capacitor, decrease the thickness of
        the dielectric or use a dielectric with high dielectric
        constant.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0087] In order to optimize the field distribution, the
        isolects 230 are configured differently depending upon the
        application in which the isolects 230 are to be used. There are
        two principle modes for applying the present electric fields (TC
        fields). First, the TC fields can be applied by external
        isolects and second, the TC fields can be applied by internal
        isolects.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0088] Electric fields (TC fields) that are applied by
        external isolects can be of a local type or widely distributed
        type. The first type includes, for example, the treatment of
        skin tumors and treatment of lesions close to the skin surface.
        FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary embodiment where the isolects
        230 are incorporated in a skin patch 300. The skin patch 300 can
        be a self-adhesive flexible patch with one or more pairs of
        isolects 230. The patch 300 includes internal insulation 310
        (formed of a dielectric material) and the external insulation
        260 and is applied to skin surface 301 that contains a tumor 303
        either on the skin surface 301 or slightly below the skin
        surface 301. Tissue is generally indicated at 305. To prevent
        the potential drop across the internal insulation 310 to
        dominate the system, the internal insulation 310 must have a
        relatively high capacity. This can be achieved by a large
        surface area; however, this may not be desired as it will result
        in the spread of the field over a large area (e.g., an area
        larger than required to treat the tumor). Alternatively, the
        internal insulation 310 can be made very thin and/or the
        internal insulation 310 can be of a high dielectric constant. As
        the skin resistance between the electrodes (labeled as A and E
        in FIG. 6) is normally significantly higher than that of the
        tissue (labeled as C in FIG. 6) underneath it (1-10 K[Omega] vs.
        0.1-1 K[Omega]), most of the potential drop beyond the isolects
        occurs there. To accommodate for these impedances (Z), the
        characteristics of the internal insulation 310 (labeled as B and
        D in FIG. 6) should be such that they have impedance preferably
        under 100 K[Omega] at the frequencies of the present TC fields
        (e.g., 50 KHz to 500 KHz). For example, if it is desired for the
        impedance to be about 10 K Ohms or less, such that over 1% of
        the applied voltage falls on the tissues, for isolects with a
        surface area of 10 mm&lt;2&gt; , at frequencies of 200 KHz, the
        capacity should be on the order of 10&lt;-10 &gt; F., which
        means that using standard insulations with a dielectric constant
        of 2-3, the thickness of the insulating layer 310 should be
        about 50-100 microns. An internal field 10 times stronger would
        be obtained with insulators with a dielectric constant of about
        20-50.<br>
        <br>
        [0089] Using an insulating material with a high dielectric
        constant increases the capacitance of the electrodes, which
        results in a reduction of the electrodes' impedance to the AC
        signal that is applied by the generator 1 (shown in FIG. 5).
        Because the electrodes A, E are wired in series with the target
        tissue C, as shown in FIG. 6, this reduction in impedance
        reduces the voltage drop in the electrodes, so that a larger
        portion of the applied AC voltage appears across the tissue C.
        Since a larger portion of the voltage appears across the tissue,
        the voltage that is being applied by the generator 1 can be
        advantageously lowered for a given field strength in the tissue.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0090] The desired field strength in the tissue being
        treated is preferably between about 0.1 V/cm and about 10 V/cm,
        and more preferably between about 2 V/cm and 3 V/cm or between
        about 1 V/cm and about 5 V/cm. If the dielectric constant used
        in the electrode is sufficiently high, the impedance of the
        electrodes A, E drops down to the same order of magnitude as the
        series combination of the skin and tissue B, C, D. One example
        of a suitable material with an extremely high dielectric
        constant is CaCu3Ti4O12, which has a dielectric constant of
        about 11,000 (measured at 100 kHz). When the dielectric constant
        is this high, useful fields can be obtained using a generator
        voltage that is on the order of a few tens of Volts.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0091] Since the thin insulating layer can be very
        vulnerable, etc., the insulation can be replaced by very high
        dielectric constant insulating materials, such as titanium
        dioxide (e.g., rutile), the dielectric constant can reach values
        of about 200. There a number of different materials that are
        suitable for use in the intended application and have high
        dielectric constants. For example, some materials include:
        lithium niobate (LiNbO3), which is a ferroelectric crystal and
        has a number of applications in optical, pyroelectric and
        piezoelectric devices; yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is a
        ferromagnetic crystal and magneto-optical devices, e.g., optical
        isolator can be realized from this material; barium titanate
        (BaTiO3) is a ferromagnetic crystal with a large electro-optic
        effect; potassium tantalate (KTaO3) which is a dielectric
        crystal (ferroelectric at low temperature) and has very low
        microwave loss and tunability of dielectric constant at low
        temperature; and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) which is a
        ferroelectric crystal with similar properties as lithium niobate
        and has utility in electro-optical, pyroelectric and
        piezoelectric devices. Insulator ceramics with high dielectric
        constants may also be used, such as a ceramic made of a
        combination of Lead Magnesium Niobate and Lead Titanate. It will
        be understood that the aforementioned exemplary materials can be
        used in combination with the present device where it is desired
        to use a material having a high dielectric constant.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0092] One must also consider another factor that affects
        the effective capacity of the isolects 230, namely the presence
        of air between the isolects 230 and the skin. Such presence,
        which is not easy to prevent, introduces a layer of an insulator
        with a dielectric constant of 1.0, a factor that significantly
        lowers the effective capacity of the isolects 230 and
        neutralizes the advantages of the titanium dioxide (rutile),
        etc. To overcome this problem, the isolects 230can be shaped so
        as to conform with the body structure and/or (2) an intervening
        filler 270 (as illustrated in FIG. 10C), such as a gel, that has
        high conductance and a high effective dielectric constant, can
        be added to the structure. The shaping can be pre-structured
        (see FIG. 10A) or the system can be made sufficiently flexible
        so that shaping of the isolects 230 is readily achievable. The
        gel can be contained in place by having an elevated rim as
        depicted in FIGS. 10C and 10C'. The gel can be made of
        hydrogels, gelatins, agar, etc., and can have salts dissolved in
        it to increase its conductivity. FIGS. 10A-10C' illustrate
        various exemplary configurations for the isolects 230. The exact
        thickness of the gel is not important so long as it is of
        sufficient thickness that the gel layer does not dry out during
        the treatment. In one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of the
        gel is about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm. Preferably, the gel has high
        conductivity, is tacky, and is biocompatible for extended
        periods of time. One suitable gel is AG603 Hydrogel, which is
        available from AmGel Technologies, 1667 S. Mission Road,
        Fallbrook, Calif. 92028-4115, USA. [0093] In order to achieve
        the desirable features of the isolects 230, the dielectric
        coating of each should be very thin, for example from between
        1-50 microns. Since the coating is so thin, the isolects 230 can
        easily be damaged mechanically or undergo dielectric breakdown.
        This problem can be overcome by adding a protective feature to
        the isolect's structure so as to provide desired protection from
        such damage. For example, the isolect 230 can be coated, for
        example, with a relatively loose net 340 that prevents access to
        the surface but has only a minor effect on the effective surface
        area of the isolect 230 (i.e., the capacity of the isolects 230
        (cross section presented in FIG. 12B). The loose net 340 does
        not effect the capacity and ensures good contact with the skin,
        etc. The loose net 340 can be formed of a number of different
        materials; however, in one exemplary embodiment, the net 340 is
        formed of nylon, polyester, cotton, etc. Alternatively, a very
        thin conductive coating 350 can be applied to the dielectric
        portion (insulating layer) of the isolect 230. One exemplary
        conductive coating is formed of a metal and more particularly of
        gold. The thickness of the coating 350 depends upon the
        particular application and also on the type of material used to
        form the coating 350; however, when gold is used, the coating
        has a thickness from about 0.1 micron to about 0.1 mm.
        Furthermore, the rim illustrated in FIG. 10 can also provide
        some mechanical protection.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0094] However, the capacity is not the only factor to be
        considered. The following two factors also influence how the
        isolects 230 are constructed. The dielectric strength of the
        internal insulating layer 310 and the dielectric losses that
        occur when it is subjected to the TC field, i.e., the amount of
        heat generated. The dielectric strength of the internal
        insulation 310 determines at what field intensity the insulation
        will be "shorted" and cease to act as an intact insulation.
        Typically, insulators, such as plastics, have dielectric
        strength values of about 100V per micron or more. As a high
        dielectric constant reduces the field within the internal
        insulator 310, a combination of a high dielectric constant and a
        high dielectric strength gives a significant advantage. This can
        be achieved by using a single material that has the desired
        properties or it can be achieved by a double layer with the
        correct parameters and thickness. In addition, to further
        decreasing the possibility that the insulating layer 310 will
        fail, all sharp edges of the insulating layer 310 should be
        eliminated as by rounding the corners, etc., as illustrated in
        FIG. 10D using conventional techniques.<br>
        <br>
        0095] FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a second type of treatment using
        the isolects 230, namely electric field generation by internal
        isolects 230. A body to which the isolects 230 are implanted is
        generally indicated at 311 and includes a skin surface 313 and a
        tumor 315. In this embodiment, the isolects 230 can have the
        shape of plates, wires or other shapes that can be inserted
        subcutaneously or a deeper location within the body 311 so as to
        generate an appropriate field at the target area (tumor 315).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0096] It will also be appreciated that the mode of
        isolects application is not restricted to the above
        descriptions. In the case of tumors in internal organs, for
        example, liver, lung, etc., the distance between each member of
        the pair of isolects 230 can be large. The pairs can even by
        positioned opposite sides of a torso 410, as illustrated in FIG.
        11. The arrangement of the isolects 230 in FIG. 11 is
        particularly useful for treating a tumor 415 associated with
        lung cancer or gastro-intestinal tumors. In this embodiment, the
        electric fields (TC fields) spread in a wide fraction of the
        body.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0097] In order to avoid overheating of the treated
        tissues, a selection of materials and field parameters is
        needed. The isolects insulating material should have minimal
        dielectric losses at the frequency ranges to be used during the
        treatment process. This factor can be taken into consideration
        when choosing the particular frequencies for the treatment. The
        direct heating of the tissues will most likely be dominated by
        the heating due to current flow (given by the I*R product). In
        addition, the isolect (insulated electrode) 230 and its
        surroundings should be made of materials that facilitate heat
        losses and its general structure should also facilitate head
        losses, i.e., minimal structures that block heat dissipation to
        the surroundings (air) as well as high heat conductivity. Using
        larger electrodes also minimizes the local sensation of heating,
        since it spreads the energy that is being transferred into the
        patient over a larger surface area. Preferably, the heating is
        minimized to the point where the patient's skin temperature
        never exceeds about 39[deg.] C. <br>
        <br>
        [0098] Another way to reduce heating is to apply the field to
        the tissue being treated intermittently, by applying a field
        with a duty cycle between about 20% and about 50% instead of
        using a continuous field. For example, to achieve a duty cycle
        of 33%, the field would be repetitively switched on for one
        second, then switched off for two seconds. Preliminary
        experiments have shown that the efficacy of treatment using a
        field with a 33% duty cycle is roughly the same as for a field
        with a duty cycle of 100%. In alternative embodiments, the field
        could be switched on for one hour then switched off for one hour
        to achieve a duty cycle of 50%. Of course, switching at a rate
        of once per hour would not help minimize short-term heating. On
        the other hand, it could provide the patient with a welcome
        break from treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0099] The effectiveness of the treatment can be enhanced
        by an arrangement of isolects 230 that focuses the field at the
        desired target while leaving other sensitive areas in low field
        density (i.e., protected areas). The proper placement of the
        isolects 230 over the body can be maintained using any number of
        different techniques, including using a suitable piece of
        clothing that keeps the isolects at the appropriate positions.
        FIG. 13 illustrates such an arrangement in which an area labeled
        as "P" represents a protected area. The lines of field force do
        not penetrate this protected area and the field there is much
        smaller than near the isolects 230 where target areas can be
        located and treated well. In contrast, the field intensity near
        the four poles is very high.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0100] The following Example serves to illustrate an
        exemplary application of the present apparatus and application
        of TC fields; however, this Example is not limiting and does not
        limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0101] To demonstrate the effectiveness of electric fields
        having the above described properties (e.g., frequencies between
        50 KHz and 500 KHz) in destroying tumor cells, the electric
        fields were applied to treat mice with malignant melanoma
        tumors. Two pairs of isolects 230 were positioned over a
        corresponding pair of malignant melanomas. Only one pair was
        connected to the generator 210 and 200 KHz alternating electric
        fields (TC fields) were applied to the tumor for a period of 6
        days. One melanoma tumor was not treated so as to permit a
        comparison between the treated tumor and the non-treated tumor.
        After treatment for 6 days, the pigmented melanoma tumor
        remained clearly visible in the non-treated side of the mouse,
        while, in contrast, no tumor is seen on the treated side of the
        mouse. The only areas that were visible discernable on the skin
        were the marks that represented the points of insertion of the
        isolects 230. The fact that the tumor was eliminated at the
        treated side was further demonstrated by cutting and inversing
        the skin so that its inside face was exposed. Such a procedure
        indicated that the tumor has been substantially, if not
        completely, eliminated on the treated side of the mouse. The
        success of the treatment was also further verified by
        histopathological examination.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0102] The present inventor has thus uncovered that
        electric fields having particular properties can be used to
        destroy dividing cells or tumors when the electric fields are
        applied to using an electronic device. More specifically, these
        electric fields fall into a special intermediate category,
        namely bio-effective fields that have no meaningful stimulatory
        and no thermal effects, and therefore overcome the disadvantages
        that were associated with the application of conventional
        electric fields to a body. It will also be appreciated that the
        present apparatus can further include a device for rotating the
        TC field relative to the living tissue. For example and
        according to one embodiment, the alternating electric potential
        applies to the tissue being treated is rotated relative to the
        tissue using conventional devices, such as a mechanical device
        that upon activation, rotates various components of the present
        system.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0103] Moreover and according to yet another embodiment,
        the TC fields are applied to different pairs of the insulated
        electrodes 230 in a consecutive manner. In other words, the
        generator 210 and the control system thereof can be arranged so
        that signals are sent at periodic intervals to select pairs of
        insulated electrodes 230, thereby causing the generation of the
        TC fields of different directions by these insulated electrodes
        230. Because the signals are sent at select times from the
        generator to the insulated electrodes 230, the TC fields of
        changing directions are generated consecutively by different
        insulated electrodes 230. This arrangement has a number of
        advantages and is provided in view of the fact that the TC
        fields have maximal effect when they are parallel to the axis of
        cell division. Since the orientation of cell division is in most
        cases random, only a fraction of the dividing cells are affected
        by any given field. Thus, using fields of two or more
        orientations increases the effectiveness since it increases the
        chances that more dividing cells are affected by a given TC
        field.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0104] In vitro experiments have shown that the electric
        field has the maximum killing effect when the lines of force of
        the field are oriented generally parallel to the long axis of
        the hourglass-shaped cell during mitosis (as shown in FIGS.
        3A-3C). In one experiment, a much higher proportion of the
        damaged cells had their axis of division oriented along the
        field: 56% of the cells oriented at or near 0[deg.] with respect
        to the field were damaged, versus an average of 15% of cells
        damaged for cells with their long axis oriented at more than
        22[deg.] with respect to the field.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0105] The inventor has recognized that applying the field
        in different directions sequentially will increase the overall
        killing power, because the field orientation that is most
        effectively in killing dividing cells will be applied to a
        larger population of the dividing cells. A number of examples
        for applying the field in different directions are discussed
        below.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0106] FIGS. 27A, 27B, and 27C show a set of 6 electrodes
        E1-E6, and how the direction of the field through the target
        tissue 1510 can be changed by applying the AC signal from the
        generator 1 (shown in FIG. 1) across different pairs of
        electrodes. For example, if the AC signal is applied across
        electrodes E1 and E4, the field lines F would be vertical (as
        shown in FIG. 27A), and if the signal is applied across
        electrodes E2 and E5, or across electrodes E3 and E6, the field
        lines F would be diagonal (as shown in FIGS. 27B and 27C,
        respectively). Additional field directions can be obtained by
        applying the AC signal across other pairs of electrodes. For
        example, a roughly horizontal field could be obtained by
        applying the signal across electrodes E2 and E6.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0107] In one embodiment, the AC signal is applied between
        the various pairs of electrodes sequentially. An example of this
        arrangement is to apply the AC signal across electrodes E1 and
        E4 for one second, then apply the AC signal across electrodes E2
        and E5 for one second, and then apply the AC signal across
        electrodes E3 and E6 for one second. This three-part sequence is
        then repeated for the desired period of treatment. Because the
        efficacy in cell-destruction is strongly dependant on the cell's
        orientation, cycling the field between the different directions
        increases the chance that the field will be oriented in a
        direction that favors cell destruction at least part of the
        time.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0108] Of course, the 6 electrode configuration shown in
        FIGS. 27A-C is just one of many possible arrangement of multiple
        electrodes, and many other configurations of three or more
        electrodes could be used based on the same principles.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0109] Application of the field in different directions
        sequentially is not limited to two dimensional embodiments, and
        FIG. 28 shows how the sequential application of signals across
        different sets of electrodes can be extended to three
        dimensions. A first array of electrodes A1-A9 is arranged around
        body part 1500, and a last array of electrodes N1-N9 is arranged
        around the body part 1500 a distance W away from the first
        array. Additional arrays of electrodes may optionally be added
        between the first array and the last array, but these additional
        arrays are not illustrated for clarity (so as not to obscure the
        electrodes A5-A9 and B5-B8 on the back of the body part 1500).
        [0110] As in the FIG. 27 embodiment, the direction of the field
        through the target tissue can be changed by applying the AC
        signal from the generator 1 (shown in FIG. 1) across different
        pairs of electrodes. For example, applying the AC signal between
        electrodes A2 and A7 would result in a field in a front-to-back
        direction between those two electrodes, and applying the AC
        signal between electrodes A5 and A9 would result in a roughly
        vertical field between those two electrodes. Similarly, applying
        the AC signal across electrodes A2 and N7 would generate
        diagonal field lines in one direction through the body part
        1500, and applying the AC signal across electrodes A2 and B7
        would generate diagonal field lines in another direction through
        the body part.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0111] Using a three-dimensional array of electrodes also
        makes it possible to energize multiple pairs of electrodes
        simultaneously to induce fields in the desired directions. For
        example, if suitable switching is provided so that electrodes A2
        through N2 are all connected to one terminal of the generator,
        and so that electrodes A7 through N7 are all connected to the
        other terminal of the generator, the resulting field would be a
        sheet that extends in a front-to-back direction for the entire
        width W. After the front-to-back field is maintained for a
        suitable duration (e.g., one second), the switching system (not
        shown) is reconfigured to connect electrodes A3 through N3 to
        one terminal of the generator, and electrodes A8 through N8 to
        the other terminal of the generator. This results in a
        sheet-shaped field that is rotated about the Z axis by about
        40[deg.] with respect to the initial field direction. After the
        field is maintained in this direction for a suitable duration
        (e.g., one second), the next set of electrodes is activated to
        rotate the field an additional 40[deg.] to its next position.
        This continues until the field returns to its initial position,
        at which point the whole process is repeated.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0112] Optionally, the rotating sheet-shaped field may be
        added (sequentially in time) to the diagonal fields described
        above, to better target cells that are oriented along those
        diagonal axes<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0113] Because the electric field is a vector, the signals
        may optionally be applied to combinations of electrodes
        simultaneously in order to form a desired resultant vector. For
        example, a field that is rotated about the X axis by 20[deg.]
        with respect to the initial position can be obtained by
        switching electrodes A2 through N2 and A3 through N3 all to one
        terminal of the generator, and switching electrodes A7 through
        N7 and A8 through N8 all to the other terminal of the generator.
        Applying the signals to other combinations of electrodes will
        result in fields in other directions, as will be appreciated by
        persons skilled in the relevant arts. If appropriate computer
        control of the voltages is implemented, the field's direction
        can even be swept through space in a continuous (i.e., smooth)
        manner, as opposed to the stepwise manner described above.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0114] FIGS. 29A and 29B depict the results of in vitro
        experiments that show how the killing power of the applied field
        against dividing cells is a function of the field strength. In
        the FIG. 29A experiment, B16F1 melanoma cells were subjected to
        a 100 kHz AC field at different field strengths, for a period of
        24 hours at each strength. In the FIG. 29B experiment, F-98
        glioma cells were subjected to a 200 kHz AC field at different
        field strengths, for a period of 24 hours at each strength. In
        both of these figures, the strength of the field (EF) is
        measured in Volts per cm. The magnitude of the killing effect is
        expressed in terms of TER, which is which is the ratio of the
        decrease in the growth rate of treated cells (GRT) compared with
        the growth rate of control cells (GRC). [mathematical formula -
        see original document] The experimental results show that the
        inhibitory effect of the applied field on proliferation
        increases with intensity in both the melanoma and the glioma
        cells. Complete proliferation arrest (TER=1) is seen at 1.35 and
        2.25 V/cm in melanoma and glioma cells, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0115] FIGS. 30A and 30B depict the results of in vitro
        experiments that show how the killing power of the applied field
        is a function of the frequency of the field. In the experiments,
        B16F1 melanoma cells (FIG. 30A) and F-98 glioma cells (FIG. 30B)
        were subjected to fields with different frequencies, for a
        period of 24 hours at each frequency. FIGS. 30A and 30B show the
        change in the growth rate, normalized to the field intensity
        (TER/EF). Data are shown as mean+SE. In FIG. 30A, a window
        effect is seen with maximal inhibition at 120 kHz in melanoma
        cells. In FIG. 30B, two peaks are seen at 170 and 250 kHz. Thus,
        if only one frequency is available during an entire course of
        treatment, a field with a frequency of about 120 kHz would be
        appropriate for destroying melanoma cells, and a field with a
        frequency on the order of 200 kHz would be appropriate for
        destroying glioma cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0116] Not all the cells of any given type will have the
        exact same size. Instead, the cells will have a distribution of
        sizes, with some cells being smaller and some cells being
        larger. It is believed that the best frequency for damaging a
        particular cell is related to the physical characteristics
        (e.g., the size) of that particular cell. Thus, to best damage a
        population of cells with a distribution of sizes, it can be
        advantageous to apply a distribution of different frequencies to
        the population, where the selection of frequencies is optimized
        based on the expected size distribution of the target cells. For
        example, the data on FIG. 30B indicates that using two
        frequencies of 170 kHz and 250 kHz to destroy a population of
        glioma cells would be more effective than using a single
        frequency of 200 kHz.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0117] Note that the optimal field strengths and
        frequencies discussed herein were obtained based on in vitro
        experiments, and that the corresponding parameters for in vivo
        applications may be obtained by performing similar experiments
        in vivo. It is possible that relevant characteristics of the
        cell itself (such as size and/or shape) or interactions with the
        cell's surroundings may result in a different set of optimal
        frequencies and/or field strengths for in vivo applications.
        [0118] When more than one frequency is used, the various
        frequencies may be applied sequentially in time. For example, in
        the case of glioma, field frequencies of 100, 150, 170, 200,
        250, and 300 kHz may be applied during the first, second, third,
        fourth, fifth, and sixth minutes of treatment, respectively.
        That cycle of frequencies would then repeat during each
        successive six minutes of treatment. Alternatively, the
        frequency of the field may be swept in a stepless manner from
        100 to 300 kHz.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0119] Optionally, this frequency cycling may be combined
        with the directional cycling described above. FIG. 31A is an
        example of such a combination using three directions (D1, D2,
        and D3) and three frequencies (F1, F2, and F3). Of course, the
        same scheme can be extended to any other number of directions
        and/or frequencies. FIG. 31B is an example of such a combination
        using three directions (D1, D2, and D3), sweeping the frequency
        from 100 kHz to 300 kHz. Note that the break in the time axis
        between t1 and t2 provides the needed time for the sweeping
        frequency to rise to just under 300 kHz. The frequency sweeping
        (or stepping) may be synchronized with directional changes, as
        shown in FIG. 31A. Alternatively, the frequency sweeping (or
        stepping) may be asynchronous with respect to the directional
        changes, as shown in FIG. 31B. [0120] In an alternative
        embodiment, a signal that contains two or more frequencies
        components simultaneously (e.g., 170 kHz and 250 kHz) is applied
        to the electrodes to treat a populations of cells that have a
        distribution of sizes. The various signals will add by
        superposition to create a field that includes all of the applied
        frequency components.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0121] Turning now to FIG. 14 in which an article of
        clothing 500 according to one exemplary embodiment is
        illustrated. More specifically, the article of clothing 500 is
        in the form of a hat or cap or other type of clothing designed
        for placement on a head of a person. For purposes of
        illustration, a head 502 is shown with the hat 500 being placed
        thereon and against a skin surface 504 of the head 502. An
        intra-cranial tumor or the like 510 is shown as being formed
        within the head 502 underneath the skin surface 504 thereof. The
        hat 500 is therefore intended for placement on the head 502 of a
        person who has a tumor 510 or the like.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0122] Unlike the various embodiments illustrated in FIGS.
        1-13 where the insulated electrodes 230 are arranged in a more
        or less planar arrangement since they are placed either on a
        skin surface or embedded within the body underneath it, the
        insulated electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically
        contoured and arranged for a specific application. The treatment
        of intra-cranial tumors or other lesions or the like typically
        requires a treatment that is of a relatively long duration,
        e.g., days to weeks, and therefore, it is desirable to provide
        as much comfort as possible to the patient. The hat 500 is
        specifically designed to provide comfort during the lengthy
        treatment process while not jeopardizing the effectiveness of
        the treatment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0123] According to one exemplary embodiment, the hat 500
        includes a predetermined number of insulated electrodes 230 that
        are preferably positioned so as to produce the optimal TC fields
        at the location of the tumor 510. The lines of force of the TC
        field are generally indicated at 520. As can be seen in FIG. 14,
        the tumor 510 is positioned within these lines of force 520. As
        will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are positioned within the hat 500 such that a
        portion or surface thereof is free to contact the skin surface
        504 of the head 502. In other words, when the patient wears the
        hat 500, the insulated electrodes 230 are placed in contact with
        the skin surface 504 of the head 502 in positions that are
        selected so that the TC fields generated thereby are focused at
        the tumor 510 while leaving surrounding areas in low density.
        Typically, hair on the head 502 is shaved in selected areas to
        permit better contact between the insulated electrodes 230 and
        the skin surface 504; however, this is not critical.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0124] The hat 500 preferably includes a mechanism 530
        that applies a force to the insulated electrodes 230 so that
        they are pressed against the skin surface 502. For example, the
        mechanism 530 can be of a biasing type that applies a biasing
        force to the insulated electrodes 230 to cause the insulated
        electrodes 230 to be directed outwardly away from the hat 500.
        Thus, when the patient places the hat 500 on his/her head 502,
        the insulated electrodes 230 are pressed against the skin
        surface 504 by the mechanism 530. The mechanism 530 can slightly
        recoil to provide a comfortable fit between the insulated
        electrodes 230 and the head 502. In one exemplary embodiment,
        the mechanism 530 is a spring based device that is disposed
        within the hat 500 and has one section that is coupled to and
        applies a force against the insulated electrodes 230.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0125] As with the prior embodiments, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are coupled to the generator 210 by means of
        conductors 220. The generator 210 can be either disposed within
        the hat 500 itself so as to provide a compact, self-sufficient,
        independent system or the generator 210 can be disposed external
        to the hat 500 with the conductors 220 exiting the hat 500
        through openings or the like and then running to the generator
        210. When the generator 210 is disposed external to the hat 500,
        it will be appreciated that the generator 210 can be located in
        any number of different locations, some of which are in close
        proximity to the hat 500 itself, while others can be further
        away from the hat 500. For example, the generator 210 can be
        disposed within a carrying bag or the like (e.g., a bag that
        extends around the patient's waist) which is worn by the patient
        or it can be strapped to an extremity or around the torso of the
        patient. The generator 210 can also be disposed in a protective
        case that is secured to or carried by another article of
        clothing that is worn by the patient. For example, the
        protective case can be inserted into a pocket of a sweater, etc.
        FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment where the generator 210 is
        incorporated directly into the hat 500.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0126] Turning now to FIGS. 15 and 16, in one exemplary
        embodiment, a number of insulated electrodes 230 along with the
        mechanism 530 are preferably formed as an independent unit,
        generally indicated at 540, that can be inserted into the hat
        500 and electrically connected to the generator (not shown) via
        the conductors (not shown). By providing these members in the
        form of an independent unit, the patient can easily insert
        and/or remove the units 540 from the hat 500 when they may need
        cleaning, servicing and/or replacement.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0127] In this embodiment, the hat 500 is constructed to
        include select areas 550 that are formed in the hat 500 to
        receive and hold the units 540. For example and as illustrated
        in FIG. 15, each area 550 is in the form of an opening (pore)
        that is formed within the hat 500. The unit 540 has a body 542
        and includes the mechanism 530 and one or more insulated
        electrodes 230. The mechanism 530 is arranged within the unit
        540 so that a portion thereof (e.g., one end thereof) is in
        contact with a face of each insulated electrode 230 such that
        the mechanism 530 applies a biasing force against the face of
        the insulated electrode 230. Once the unit 540 is received
        within the opening 550, it can be securely retained therein
        using any number of conventional techniques, including the use
        of an adhesive material or by using mechanical means. For
        example, the hat 500 can include pivotable clip members that
        pivot between an open position in which the opening 550 is free
        and a closed position in which the pivotable clip members engage
        portions (e.g., peripheral edges) of the insulated electrodes to
        retain and hold the insulated electrodes 230 in place. To remove
        the insulated electrodes 230, the pivotable clip members are
        moved to the open position. In the embodiment illustrated in
        FIG. 16, the insulated electrodes 230 are retained within the
        openings 550 by an adhesive element 560 which in one embodiment
        is a two sided self-adhesive rim member that extends around the
        periphery of the insulated electrode 230. In other words, a
        protective cover of one side of the adhesive rim 560 is removed
        and it is applied around the periphery of the exposed face of
        the insulated electrode 230, thereby securely attaching the
        adhesive rim 560 to the hat 500 and then the other side of the
        adhesive rim 560 is removed for application to the skin surface
        504 in desired locations for positioning and securing the
        insulated electrode 230 to the head 502 with the tumor being
        positioned relative thereto for optimization of the TC fields.
        Since one side of the adhesive rim 560 is in contact with and
        secured to the skin surface 540, this is why it is desirable for
        the head 502 to be shaved so that the adhesive rim 560 can be
        placed flushly against the skin surface 540.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0128] The adhesive rim 560 is designed to securely attach
        the unit 540 within the opening 550 in a manner that permits the
        unit 540 to be easily removed from the hat 500 when necessary
        and then replaced with another unit 540 or with the same unit
        540. As previously mentioned, the unit 540 includes the biasing
        mechanism 530 for pressing the insulated electrode 230 against
        the skin surface 504 when the hat 500 is worn. The unit 540 can
        be constructed so that side opposite the insulated electrode 230
        is a support surface formed of a rigid material, such as
        plastic, so that the biasing mechanism 530 (e.g., a spring) can
        be compressed therewith under the application of force and when
        the spring 530 is in a relaxed state, the spring 530 remains in
        contact with the support surface and the applies a biasing force
        at its other end against the insulated electrode 230. The
        biasing mechanism 530 (e.g., spring) preferably has a contour
        corresponding to the skin surface 504 so that the insulated
        electrode 230 has a force applied thereto to permit the
        insulated electrode 230 to have a contour complementary to the
        skin surface 504, thereby permitting the two to seat flushly
        against one another. While the mechanism 530 can be a spring,
        there are a number of other embodiments that can be used instead
        of a spring. For example, the mechanism 530 can be in the form
        of an elastic material, such as a foam rubber, a foam plastic,
        or a layer containing air bubbles, etc.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0129] The unit 540 has an electric connector 570 that can
        be hooked up to a corresponding electric connector, such as a
        conductor 220, that is disposed within the hat 500. The
        conductor 220 connects at one end to the unit 540 and at the
        other end is connected to the generator 210. The generator 210
        can be incorporated directly into the hat 500 or the generator
        210 can be positioned separately (remotely) on the patient or on
        a bedside support, etc.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0130] As previously discussed, a coupling agent, such as
        a conductive gel, is preferably used to ensure that an effective
        conductive environment is provided between the insulated
        electrode 230 and the skin surface 504. Suitable gel materials
        have been disclosed hereinbefore in the discussion of earlier
        embodiments. The coupling agent is disposed on the insulated
        electrode 230 and preferably, a uniform layer of the agent is
        provided along the surface of the electrode 230. One of the
        reasons that the units 540 need replacement at periodic times is
        that the coupling agent needs to be replaced and/or replenished.
        In other words, after a predetermined time period or after a
        number of uses, the patient removes the units 540 so that the
        coupling agent can be applied again to the electrode 230.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0131] FIGS. 17 and 18 illustrate another article of
        clothing which has the insulated electrodes 230 incorporated as
        part thereof. More specifically, a bra or the like 700 is
        illustrated and includes a body that is formed of a traditional
        bra material, generally indicated at 705, to provide shape,
        support and comfort to the wearer. The bra 700 also includes a
        fabric support layer 710 on one side thereof. The support layer
        710 is preferably formed of a suitable fabric material that is
        constructed to provide necessary and desired support to the bra
        700.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0132] Similar to the other embodiments, the bra 700
        includes one or more insulated electrodes 230 disposed within
        the bra material 705. The one or more insulated electrodes are
        disposed along an inner surface of the bra 700 opposite the
        support 710 and are intended to be placed proximate to a tumor
        or the like that is located within one breast or in the
        immediately surrounding area. As with the previous embodiment,
        the insulated electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically
        constructed and configured for application to a breast or the
        immediate area. Thus, the insulated electrodes 230 used in this
        application do not have a planar surface construction but rather
        have an arcuate shape that is complementary to the general
        curvature found in a typical breast.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0133] A lining 720 is disposed across the insulated
        electrodes 230 so as to assist in retaining the insulated
        electrodes in their desired locations along the inner surface
        for placement against the breast itself. The lining 720 can be
        formed of any number of thin materials that are comfortable to
        wear against one's skin and in one exemplary embodiment, the
        lining 720 is formed of a fabric material.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0134] The bra 700 also preferably includes a biasing
        mechanism 800 as in some of the earlier embodiments. The biasing
        mechanism 800 is disposed within the bra material 705 and
        extends from the support 710 to the insulated electrode 230 and
        applies a biasing force to the insulated electrode 230 so that
        the electrode 230 is pressed against the breast. This ensures
        that the insulated electrode 230 remains in contact with the
        skin surface as opposed to lifting away from the skin surface,
        thereby creating a gap that results in a less effective
        treatment since the gap diminishes the efficiency of the TC
        fields. The biasing mechanism 800 can be in the form of a spring
        arrangement or it can be an elastic material that applies the
        desired biasing force to the insulated electrodes 230 so as to
        press the insulated electrodes 230 into the breast. In the
        relaxed position, the biasing mechanism 800 applies a force
        against the insulated electrodes 230 and when the patient places
        the bra 700 on their body, the insulated electrodes 230 are
        placed against the breast which itself applies a force that
        counters the biasing force, thereby resulting in the insulated
        electrodes 230 being pressed against the patient's breast. In
        the exemplary embodiment that is illustrated, the biasing
        mechanism 800 is in the form of springs that are disposed within
        the bra material 705.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0135] A conductive gel 810 can be provided on the
        insulated electrode 230 between the electrode and the lining
        720. The conductive gel layer 810 is formed of materials that
        have been previously described herein for performing the
        functions described above.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0136] An electric connector 820 is provided as part of
        the insulated electrode 230 and electrically connects to the
        conductor 220 at one end thereof, with the other end of the
        conductor 220 being electrically connected to the generator 210.
        In this embodiment, the conductor 220 runs within the bra
        material 705 to a location where an opening is formed in the bra
        700. The conductor 220 extends through this opening and is
        routed to the generator 210, which in this embodiment is
        disposed in a location remote from the bra 700. It will also be
        appreciated that the generator 210 can be disposed within the
        bra 700 itself in another embodiment. For example, the bra 700
        can have a compartment formed therein which is configured to
        receive and hold the generator 210 in place as the patient wears
        the bra 700. In this arrangement, the compartment can be covered
        with a releasable strap that can open and close to permit the
        generator 210 to be inserted therein or removed therefrom. The
        strap can be formed of the same material that is used to
        construct the bra 700 or it can be formed of some other type of
        material. The strap can be releasably attached to the
        surrounding bra body by fastening means, such as a hook and loop
        material, thereby permitting the patient to easily open the
        compartment by separating the hook and loop elements to gain
        access to the compartment for either inserting or removing the
        generator 210.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0137] The generator 210 also has a connector 211 for
        electrical connection to the conductor 220 and this permits the
        generator 210 to be electrically connected to the insulated
        electrodes 230.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0138] As with the other embodiments, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are arranged in the bra 700 to focus the electric
        field (TC fields) on the desired target (e.g., a tumor). It will
        be appreciated that the location of the insulated electrodes 230
        within the bra 700 will vary depending upon the location of the
        tumor. In other words, after the tumor has been located, the
        physician will then devise an arrangement of insulated
        electrodes 230 and the bra 700 is constructed in view of this
        arrangement so as to optimize the effects of the TC fields on
        the target area (tumor). The number and position of the
        insulated electrodes 230 will therefore depend upon the precise
        location of the tumor or other target area that is being
        treated. Because the location of the insulated electrodes 230 on
        the bra 700 can vary depending upon the precise application, the
        exact size and shape of the insulated electrodes 230 can
        likewise vary. For example, if the insulated electrodes 230 are
        placed on the bottom section of the bra 700 as opposed to a more
        central location, the insulated electrodes 230 will have
        different shapes since the shape of the breast (as well as the
        bra) differs in these areas.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0139] FIG. 19 illustrates yet another embodiment in which
        the insulated electrodes 230 are in the form of internal
        electrodes that are incorporated into in the form of a probe or
        catheter 600 that is configured to enter the body through a
        natural pathway, such as the urethra, vagina, etc. In this
        embodiment, the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed on an
        outer surface of the probe 600 and along a length thereof. The
        conductors 220 are electrically connected to the electrodes 230
        and run within the body of the probe 600 to the generator 210
        which can be disposed within the probe body or the generator 210
        can be disposed independent of the probe 600 in a remote
        location, such as on the patient or at some other location close
        to the patient. <br>
        <br>
        [0140] Alternatively, the probe 600 can be configured to
        penetrate the skin surface or other tissues to reach an internal
        target that lies within the body. For example, the probe 600 can
        penetrate the skin surface and then be positioned adjacent to or
        proximate to a tumor that is located within the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0141] In these embodiments, the probe 600 is inserted through
        the natural pathway and then is positioned in a desired location
        so that the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed near the
        target area (i.e., the tumor). The generator 210 is then
        activated to cause the insulated electrodes 230 to generate the
        TC fields which are applied to the tumor for a predetermined
        length of time. It will be appreciated that the illustrated
        probe 600 is merely exemplary in nature and that the probe 600
        can have other shapes and configurations so long as they can
        perform the intended function. Preferably, the conductors (e.g.,
        wires) leading from the insulated electrodes 230 to the
        generator 210 are twisted or shielded so as not to generate a
        field along the shaft.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0142] It will further be appreciated that the probes can
        contain only one insulated electrode while the other can be
        positioned on the body surface. This external electrode should
        be larger or consist of numerous electrodes so as to result in
        low lines of force-current density so as not to affect the
        untreated areas. In fact, the placing of electrodes should be
        designed to minimize the field at potentially sensitive areas.
        Optionally, the external electrodes may be held against the skin
        surface by a vacuum force (e.g., suction).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0143] FIG. 20 illustrates yet another embodiment in which
        a high standing collar member 900 (or necklace type structure)
        can be used to treat thyroid, parathyroid, laryngeal lesions,
        etc. FIG. 20 illustrates the collar member 900 in an unwrapped,
        substantially flat condition. In this embodiment, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are incorporated into a body 910 of the collar
        member 900 and are configured for placement against a neck area
        of the wearer. The insulated electrodes 230 are coupled to the
        generator 210 according to any of the manner described
        hereinbefore and it will be appreciated that the generator 210
        can be disposed within the body 910 or it can be disposed in a
        location external to the body 910. The collar body 910 can be
        formed of any number of materials that are traditionally used to
        form collars 900 that are disposed around a person's neck. As
        such, the collar 900 preferably includes a means 920 for
        adjusting the collar 900 relative to the neck. For example,
        complementary fasteners (hook and loop fasteners, buttons, etc.)
        can be disposed on ends of the collar 900 to permit adjustment
        of the collar diameter.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0144] Thus, the construction of the present devices are
        particularly well suited for applications where the devices are
        incorporated into articles of clothing to permit the patient to
        easily wear a traditional article of clothing while at the same
        time the patient undergoes treatment. In other words, an extra
        level of comfort can be provided to the patient and the
        effectiveness of the treatment can be increased by incorporating
        some or all of the device components into the article of
        clothing. The precise article of clothing that the components
        are incorporated into will obviously vary depending upon the
        target area of the living tissue where tumor, lesion or the like
        exists. For example, if the target area is in the testicle area
        of a male patient, then an article of clothing in the form of a
        sock-like structure or wrap can be provided and is configured to
        be worn around the testicle area of the patient in such a manner
        that the insulated electrodes thereof are positioned relative to
        the tumor such that the TC fields are directed at the target
        tissue. The precise nature or form of the article of clothing
        can vary greatly since the device components can be incorporated
        into most types of articles of clothing and therefore, can be
        used to treat any number of different areas of the patient's
        body where a condition may be present.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0145] Now turning to FIGS. 21-22 in which another aspect
        of the present device is shown. In FIG. 21, a body 1000, such as
        any number of parts of a human or animal body, is illustrated.
        As in the previous embodiments, two or more insulated electrodes
        230 are disposed in proximity to the body 1000 for treatment of
        a tumor or the like (not shown) using TC fields, as has been
        previously described in great detail in the above discussion of
        other embodiments. The insulated electrode 230 has a conductive
        component and has external insulation 260 that surrounds the
        conductive component thereof. Each insulated electrode 230 is
        preferably connected to a generator (not shown) by the lead 220.
        Between each insulated electrode 220 and the body 1000, a
        conductive filler material (e.g., conductive gel member 270) is
        disposed. The insulated electrodes 230 are spaced apart from one
        another and when the generator is actuated, the insulated
        electrodes 230 generate the TC fields that have been previously
        described in great detail. The lines of the electric field (TC
        field) are generally illustrated at 1010. As shown, the electric
        field lines 1010 extend between the insulated electrodes 230 and
        through the conductive gel member 270.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0146] Over time or as a result of some type of event, the
        external insulation 260 of the insulated electrode 230 can begin
        to breakdown at any given location thereof. For purpose of
        illustration only, FIG. 22 illustrates that the external
        insulation 260 of one of the insulated electrodes 230 has
        experienced a breakdown 1020 at a face thereof which is adjacent
        the conductive gel member 270. It will be appreciated that the
        breakdown 1020 of the external insulation 260 results in the
        formation of a strong current flow-current density at this point
        (i.e., at the breakdown 1020). The increased current density is
        depicted by the increased number of electric field lines 1010
        and the relative positioning and distance between adjacent
        electric field lines 1010. One of the side effects of the
        occurrence of breakdown 1020 is that current exists at this
        point which will generate heat and may burn the tissues/skin
        which have a resistance. In FIG. 22, an overheated area 1030 is
        illustrated and is a region or area of the tissues/skin where an
        increased current density exits due to the breakdown 1020 in the
        external insulation 260. A patient can experience discomfort and
        pain in this area 1030 due to the strong current that exists in
        the area and the increased heat and possible burning sensation
        that exist in area 1030.<br>
        <br>
        [0147] FIG. 23 illustrates yet another embodiment in which a
        further application of the insulated electrodes 230 is shown. In
        this embodiment, the conductive gel member 270 that is disposed
        between the insulated electrode 230 and the body 1000 includes a
        conductor 1100 that is floating in that the gel material forming
        the member 270 completely surrounds the conductor 1100. In one
        exemplary embodiment, the conductor 1100 is a thin metal sheet
        plate that is disposed within the conductor 1100. As will be
        appreciated, if a conductor, such as the plate 1100, is placed
        in a homogeneous electric field, normal to the lines of the
        electric field, the conductor 1100 practically has no effect on
        the field (except that the two opposing faces of the conductor
        1100 are equipotential and the corresponding equipotentials are
        slightly shifted). Conversely, if the conductor 1100 is disposed
        parallel to the electric field, there is a significant
        distortion of the electric field. The area in the immediate
        proximity of the conductor 1100 is not equipotential, in
        contrast to the situation where there is no conductor 1100
        present. When the conductor 1100 is disposed within the gel
        member 270, the conductor 1100 will typically not effect the
        electric field (TC field) for the reasons discussed above,
        namely that the conductor 1100 is normal to the lines of the
        electric field.<br>
        <br>
        [0148] If there is a breakdown of the external insulation 260 of
        the insulated electrode 230, there is a strong current
        flow-current density at the point of breakdown as previously
        discussed; however, the presence of the conductor 1100 causes
        the current to spread throughout the conductor 1100 and then
        exit from the whole surface of the conductor 1100 so that the
        current reaches the body 1000 with a current density that is
        neither high nor low. Thus, the current that reaches the skin
        will not cause discomfort to the patient even when there has
        been a breakdown in the insulation 260 of the insulated
        electrode 230. It is important that the conductor 1100 is not
        grounded as this would cause it to abolish the electric field
        beyond it. Thus, the conductor 1100 is "floating" within the gel
        member 270.<br>
        <br>
        [0149] If the conductor 1100 is introduced into the body tissues
        1000 and is not disposed parallel to the electric field, the
        conductor 1100 will cause distortion of the electric field. The
        distortion can cause spreading of the lines of force (low field
        density-intensity) or concentration of the lines of field
        (higher density) of the electric field, according to the
        particular geometries of the insert and its surroundings, and
        thus, the conductor 1100 can exhibit, for example, a screening
        effect. Thus, for example, if the conductor 1100 completely
        encircles an organ 1101, the electric field in the organ itself
        will be zero since this type of arrangement is a Faraday cage.
        However, because it is impractical for a conductor to be
        disposed completely around an organ, a conductive net or similar
        structure can be used to cover, completely or partially, the
        organ, thereby resulting in the electric field in the organ
        itself being zero or about zero. For example, a net can be made
        of a number of conductive wires that are arranged relative to
        one another to form the net or a set of wires can be arranged to
        substantially encircle or otherwise cover the organ 1101.
        Conversely, an organ 1103 to be treated (the target organ) is
        not covered with a member having a Faraday cage effect but
        rather is disposed in the electric field 1010 (TC fields).<br>
        <br>
        [0150] FIG. 24 illustrates an embodiment where the conductor
        1100 is disposed within the body (i.e., under the skin) and it
        is located near a target (e.g., a target organ). By placing the
        conductor 1100 near the target, high field density (of the TC
        fields) is realized at the target. At the same time, another
        nearby organ can be protected by disposing the above described
        protective conductive net or the like around this nearby organ
        so as to protect this organ from the fields. By positioning the
        conductor 1100 in close proximity to the target, a high field
        density condition can be provided near or at the target. In
        other words, the conductor 1100 permits the TC fields to be
        focused at a particular area (i.e., a target).<br>
        <br>
        [0151] It will also be appreciated that in the embodiment of
        FIG. 24, the gel members 260 can each include a conductor as
        described with reference to FIG. 23. In such an arrangement, the
        conductor in the gel member 260 protects the skin surface
        (tissues) from any side effects that may be realized if a
        breakdown in the insulation of the insulated electrode 230
        occurs. At the same time, the conductor 1100 creates a high
        field density near the target. <br>
        <br>
        [0152] There are a number of different ways to tailor the field
        density of the electric field by constructing the electrodes
        differently and/or by strategically placing the electrodes
        relative to one another. For example, in FIG. 25, a first
        insulated electrode 1200 and a second insulated electrode 1210
        are provided and are disposed about a body 1300. Each insulated
        electrode includes a conductor that is preferably surrounded by
        an insulating material, thus the term "insulated electrode".
        Between each of the first and second electrodes 1200, 1210 and
        the body 1300, the conductive gel member 270 is provided.
        Electric field lines are generally indicated at 1220 for this
        type of arrangement. In this embodiment, the first insulated
        electrode 1200 has dimensions that are significantly greater
        than the dimensions of the second insulated electrode 1210 (the
        conductive gel member for the second insulated electrode 1210
        will likewise be smaller).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0153] By varying the dimensions of the insulated
        electrodes, the pattern of the electric field lines 1220 is
        varied. More specifically, the electric field tapers inwardly
        toward the second insulated electrode 1210 due to the smaller
        dimensions of the second insulated electrode 1210. An area of
        high field density, generally indicated at 1230, forms near the
        interface between the gel member 270 associated with the second
        insulated electrode 1210 and the skin surface. The various
        components of the system are manipulated so that the tumor
        within the skin or on the skin is within this high field density
        so that the area to be treated (the target) is exposed to
        electric field lines of a higher field density. <br>
        <br>
        [0154] FIG. 26 also illustrates a tapering TC field when a
        conductor 1400 (e.g., a conductive plate) is disposed in each of
        the conductive gel members 270. In this embodiment, the size of
        the gel members 270 and the size of the conductors 1400 are the
        same or about the same despite the differences in the sizes of
        the insulated electrodes 1200, 1210. The conductors 1400 again
        can be characterized as "floating plates" since each conductor
        1400 is surrounded by the material that forms the gel member
        270. As shown in FIG. 26, the placement of one conductor 1400
        near the insulated electrode 1210 that is smaller than the other
        insulated electrode 1200 and is also smaller than the conductor
        1400 itself and the other insulated electrode 1200 is disposed
        at a distance therefrom, the one conductor 1400 causes a
        decrease in the field density in the tissues disposed between
        the one conductor 1400 and the other insulated electrode 1200.
        The decrease in the field density is generally indicated at
        1410. At the same time, a very inhomogeneous tapering field,
        generally indicated at 1420, changing from very low density to
        very high density is formed between the one conductor 1400 and
        the insulated electrode 1210. One benefit of this exemplary
        configuration is that it permits the size of the insulated
        electrode to be reduced without causing an increase in the
        nearby field density. This can be important since electrodes
        that having very high dielectric constant insulation can be very
        expensive. Some insulated electrodes, for example, can cost
        $500.00 or more; and further, the price is sensitive to the
        particular area of treatment. Thus, a reduction in the size of
        the insulated electrodes directly leads to a reduction in cost.<br>
        <br>
        [0155] As used herein, the term "tumor" refers to a malignant
        tissue comprising transformed cells that grow uncontrollably.
        Tumors include leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas, plasmacytomas,
        and the like; and solid tumors. Examples of solid tumors that
        can be treated according to the invention include sarcomas and
        carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma,
        myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma,
        chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma,
        lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's
        tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma,
        pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate
        cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma,
        adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland
        carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas,
        cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma,
        renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma,
        choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor,
        cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell
        lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma,
        astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma,
        pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma,
        oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and
        retinoblastoma. Because each of these tumors undergoes rapid
        growth, any one can be treated in accordance with the invention.
        The invention is particularly advantageous for treating brain
        tumors, which are difficult to treat with surgery and radiation,
        and often inaccessible to chemotherapy or gene therapies. In
        addition, the present invention is suitable for use in treating
        skin and breast tumors because of the ease of localized
        treatment provided by the present invention.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0156] In addition, the present invention can control
        uncontrolled growth associated with non-malignant or
        pre-malignant conditions, and other disorders involving
        inappropriate cell or tissue growth by application of an
        electric field in accordance with the invention to the tissue
        undergoing inappropriate growth. For example, it is contemplated
        that the invention is useful for the treatment of arteriovenous
        (AV) malformations, particularly in intracranial sites. The
        invention may also be used to treat psoriasis, a dermatologic
        condition that is characterized by inflammation and vascular
        proliferation; and benign prostatic hypertrophy, a condition
        associated with inflammation and possibly vascular
        proliferation. Treatment of other hyperproliferative disorders
        is also contemplated.<br>
        <br>
        [0157] Furthermore, undesirable fibroblast and endothelial cell
        proliferation associated with wound healing, leading to scar and
        keloid formation after surgery or injury, and restenosis after
        angioplasty or placement of coronary stents can be inhibited by
        application of an electric field in accordance with the present
        invention. The non-invasive nature of this invention makes it
        particularly desirable for these types of conditions,
        particularly to prevent development of internal scars and
        adhesions, or to inhibit restenosis of coronary, carotid, and
        other important arteries.<br>
        <br>
        [0158] In addition to treating tumors that have already been
        detected, the above-described embodiments may also be used
        prophylactically to prevent tumors from ever reaching a
        detectable size in the first place. For example, the bra
        embodiment described above in connection with FIGS. 17 and 18
        may be worn by a woman for an 8 hour session every day for a
        week, with the week-long course of treatment being repeated
        every few months to kill any cells that have become cancerous
        and started to proliferate. This mode of usage is particularly
        appropriate for people who are at high risk for a particular
        type of cancer (e.g., women with a strong history of breast
        cancer in their families, or people who have survived a bout of
        cancer and are at risk of a relapse). The course of prophylactic
        treatment may be tailored based on the type of cancer being
        targeted and/or to suit the convenience of the patient. For
        example, undergoing a four 16 hour sessions during the week of
        treatment may be more convenient for some patients than seven 8
        hour session, and may be equally effective.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0159] Thus, the present invention provides an effective,
        simple method of selectively destroying dividing cells, e.g.,
        tumor cells and parasitic organisms, while non-dividing cells or
        organisms are left affected by application of the method on
        living tissue containing both types of cells or organisms. Thus,
        unlike many of the conventional methods, the present invention
        does not damage the normal cells or organisms. In addition, the
        present invention does not discriminate based upon cell type
        (e.g., cells having differing sizes) and therefore may be used
        to treat any number of types of sizes having a wide spectrum of
        characteristics, including varying dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        [0160] While the invention has been particularly shown and
        described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it
        will be understood by those skilled in the art that various
        changes in form and details can be made without departing from
        the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

        claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No.

        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0002] The present invention relates to the selective
        destruction of rapidly dividing cells in a localized area, and
        more particularly, to an apparatus and method for optimizing the
        selective destruction of dividing cells by calculating the
        spatial and temporal distribution of electric fields for optimal
        treatment of a specific patient with a specific tumor taking
        into account its location and characteristics. <br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
        <br>
        [0003] All living organisms proliferate by cell division,
        including cell cultures, microorganisms (such as bacteria,
        mycoplasma, yeast, protozoa, and other single-celled organisms),
        fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Dividing cells of organisms can
        be destroyed, or their proliferation controlled, by methods that
        are based on the sensitivity of the dividing cells of these
        organisms to certain agents. For example, certain antibiotics
        stop the multiplication process of bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The process of eukaryotic cell division is called
        "mitosis", which involves a number of distinct phases. During
        interphase, the cell replicates chromosomal DNA, which begins
        condensing in early prophase. At this point, centrioles (each
        cell contains 2) being moving towards opposite poles of the
        cell. In middle prophase, each chromosome is composed of
        duplicate chromatids. Microtubular spindles radiate from regions
        adjacent to the centrioles, which are closer to their poles. By
        late prophase, the centrioles have reached the poles, and some
        spindle fibers extend to the center of the cell, while others
        extend from the poles to the chromatids. The cells then move
        into metaphase, when the chromosomes move toward the equator of
        the cell and align in the equatorial plane. Next is early
        anaphase, during which time daughter chromatids separate from
        each other at the equator by moving along the spindle fibers
        toward a centromere at opposite poles. The cell begins to
        elongate along the axis of the pole; the pole-to-pole spindles
        elongate. Late anaphase occurs when the daughter chromosomes (as
        they are now called) each reach their respective opposite poles.
        At this point, cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow begins
        to form at the equator of the cell. In other words, late
        anaphase is the point at which pinching the cell membrane
        begins. During telophase, cytokinesis is nearly complete and
        spindles disappear. Only a relatively narrow membrane connection
        joins the two cytoplasms. Finally, the membranes separate fully,
        cytokinesis is complete and the cell returns to interphase. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] In meiosis, the cell undergoes a second division,
        involving separation of sister chromosomes to opposite poles of
        the cell along spindle fibers, followed by formation of a
        cleavage furrow and cell division. However, this division is not
        preceded by chromosome replication, yielding a haploid germ
        cell. <br>
        <br>
        [0006] It is known in the art that tumors, particularly
        malignant or cancerous tumors, grow very uncontrollably compared
        to normal tissue. Such expedited growth enables tumors to occupy
        an ever-increasing space and to damage or destroy tissue
        adjacent thereto. Furthermore, certain cancers are characterized
        by an ability to transmit cancerous "seeds", including single
        cells or small cell clusters (metastasises), to new locations
        where the metastatic cancer cells grow into additional tumors.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The rapid growth of tumors in general, and malignant
        tumors in particular, as described above, is the result of
        relatively frequent cell division or multiplication of these
        cells compared to normal tissue cells. The distinguishably
        frequent cell division of cancer cells is the basis for the
        effectiveness of existing cancer treatments, e.g., irradiation
        therapy and the use of various chemotherapeutic agents. Such
        treatments are based on the fact that cells undergoing division
        are more sensitive to radiation and chemo-therapeutic agents
        than non-dividing dells. Because tumor cells divide much more
        frequently than normal cells, it is possible, to a certain
        extent, to selectively damage or destroy tumor cells by
        radiation therapy and/or by chemotherapy. The actual sensitivity
        of cells to radiation, therapeutic agents, etc., is also
        dependent on specific characteristics of different types of
        normal or malignant cell type. Thus, unfortunately, the
        sensitivity of tumor cells is not sufficiently higher than that
        of many types of normal tissues. This diminishes the ability to
        distinguish between tumor cells and normal cells and, therefore,
        existing cancer treatments typically cause significant damage to
        normal tissues, thus limiting the therapeutic effectiveness of
        such treatments. Furthermore, the inevitable damage to other
        tissue renders treatments very traumatic to the patients and,
        often, patients are unable to recover from a seemingly
        successful treatment. Also, certain types of tumors are not
        sensitive at all to existing methods of treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0008] There are also other methods for destroying cells that do
        not rely on radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone. For
        example, ultrasonic and electrical methods for destroying tumor
        cells can be used in addition to or instead of conventional
        treatments. Electric fields and currents have been used for
        medical purposes for many years. The most common is the
        generation of electric currents in a human or animal body by
        application of an electric field by means of a pair of
        conductive electrodes between which a potential difference is
        maintained. These electric currents are used either to exert
        their specific effects, i.e., to stimulate excitable tissue, or
        to generate heat by flowing in the body since it acts as a
        resistor. Examples of the first type of application include the
        following: cardiac defibrillators, peripheral nerve and muscle
        stimulators, brain stimulators, etc. Currents are used for
        heating, for example, in devices for tumor ablation, ablation of
        malfunctioning cardiac or brain tissue, cauterization,
        relaxation of muscle rheumatic pain and other pain, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0009] Another use of electric fields for medical purposes
        involves the utilization of high frequency oscillating fields
        transmitted from a source that emits an electric wave, such as
        an RF wave or a microwave source that is directed at the part of
        the body that is of interest (i.e., target). In these instances,
        there is no electric energy conduction between the source and
        the body; but rather, the energy is transmitted to the body by
        radiation or induction. More specifically, the electric energy
        generated by the source reaches the vicinity of the body via a
        conductor and is transmitted from it through air or some other
        electric insulating material to the human body.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] In a conventional electrical method, electrical current
        is delivered to a region of the target tissue using electrodes
        that are placed in contact with the body of the patient. The
        applied electrical current destroys substantially all cells in
        the vicinity of the target tissue. Thus, this type of electrical
        method does not discriminate between different types of cells
        within the target tissue and results in the destruction of both
        tumor cells and normal cells. <br>
        <br>
        [0011] Electric fields that can be used in medical applications
        can thus be separated generally into two different modes. In the
        first mode, the electric fields are applied to the body or
        tissues by means of conducting electrodes. These electric fields
        can be separated into two types, namely (1) steady fields or
        fields that change at relatively slow rates, and alternating
        fields of low frequencies that induce corresponding electric
        currents in the body or tissues, and (2) high frequency
        alternating fields (above 1 MHz) applied to the body by means of
        the conducting electrodes. In the second mode, the electric
        fields are high frequency alternating fields applied to the body
        by means of insulated electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] The first type of electric field is used, for example, to
        stimulate nerves and muscles, pace the heart, etc. In fact, such
        fields are used in nature to propagate signals in nerve and
        muscle fibers, central nervous system (CNS), heart, etc. The
        recording of such natural fields is the basis for the ECG, EEG,
        EMG, ERG, etc. The field strength in these applications,
        assuming a medium of homogenous electric properties, is simply
        the voltage applied to the stimulating/recording electrodes
        divided by the distance between them. These currents can be
        calculated by Ohm's law and can have dangerous stimulatory
        effects on the heart and CNS and can result in potentially
        harmful ion concentration changes. Also, if the currents are
        strong enough, they can cause excessive heating in the tissues.
        This heating can be calculated by the power dissipated in the
        tissue (the product of the voltage and the current). <br>
        <br>
        [0013] When such electric fields and currents are alternating,
        their stimulatory power, on nerve, muscle, etc., is an inverse
        function of the frequency. At frequencies above 1-10 KHz, the
        stimulation power of the fields approaches zero. This limitation
        is due to the fact that excitation induced by electric
        stimulation is normally mediated by membrane potential changes,
        the rate of which is limited by the RC properties (time
        constants on the order of 1 ms) of the membrane.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] Regardless of the frequency, when such current inducing
        fields are applied, they are associated with harmful side
        effects caused by currents. For example, one negative effect is
        the changes in ionic concentration in the various "compartments"
        within the system, and the harmful products of the electrolysis
        taking place at the electrodes, or the medium in which the
        tissues are imbedded. The changes in ion concentrations occur
        whenever the system includes two or more compartments between
        which the organism maintains ion concentration differences. For
        example, for most tissues, [Ca&lt;++&gt; ] in the extracellular
        fluid is about 2*10&lt;-3 &gt; M, while in the cytoplasm of
        typical cells its concentration can be as low as 10&lt;-7 &gt;
        M. A current induced in such a system by a pair of electrodes,
        flows in part from the extracellular fluid into the cells and
        out again into the extracellular medium. About 2% of the current
        flowing into the cells is carried by the Ca&lt;++&gt; ions. In
        contrast, because the concentration of intracellular
        Ca&lt;++&gt; is much smaller, only a negligible fraction of the
        currents that exits the cells is carried by these ions. Thus,
        Ca&lt;++&gt; ions accumulate in the cells such that their
        concentrations in the cells increases, while the concentration
        in the extracellular compartment may decrease. These effects are
        observed for both DC and alternating currents (AC). The rate of
        accumulation of the ions depends on the current intensity ion
        mobilities, membrane ion conductance, etc. An increase in
        [Ca&lt;++&gt; ] is harmful to most cells and if sufficiently
        high will lead to the destruction of the cells. Similar
        considerations apply to other ions. In view of the above
        observations, long term current application to living organisms
        or tissues can result in significant damage. Another major
        problem that is associated with such electric fields, is due to
        the electrolysis process that takes place at the electrode
        surfaces. Here charges are transferred between the metal
        (electrons) and the electrolytic solution (ions) such that
        charged active radicals are formed. These can cause significant
        damage to organic molecules, especially macromolecules and thus
        damage the living cells and tissues.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] In contrast, when high frequency electric fields, above 1
        MHz and usually in practice in the range of GHz, are induced in
        tissues by means of insulated electrodes, the situation is quite
        different. These type of fields generate only capacitive or
        displacement currents, rather than the conventional charge
        conducting currents. Under the effect of this type of field,
        living tissues behave mostly according to their dielectric
        properties rather than their electric conductive properties.
        Therefore, the dominant field effect is that due to dielectric
        losses and heating. Thus, it is widely accepted that in
        practice, the meaningful effects of such fields on living
        organisms, are only those due to their heating effects, i.e.,
        due to dielectric losses. <br>
        <br>
        [0016] In U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,066 ('066) to Mangano, a method
        and device are presented which enable discrete objects having a
        conducting inner core, surrounded by a dielectric membrane to be
        selectively inactivated by electric fields via irreversible
        breakdown of their dielectric membrane. One potential
        application for this is in the selection and purging of certain
        biological cells in a suspension. According to this patent, an
        electric field is applied for targeting selected cells to cause
        breakdown of the dielectric membranes of these tumor cells,
        while purportedly not adversely affecting other desired
        subpopulations of cells. The cells are selected on the basis of
        intrinsic or induced differences in a characteristic
        electroporation threshold. The differences in this threshold can
        depend upon a number of parameters, including the difference in
        cell size. <br>
        <br>
        [0017] The method of the '066 patent is therefore based on the
        assumption that the electroporation threshold of tumor cells is
        sufficiently distinguishable from that of normal cells because
        of differences in cell size and differences in the dielectric
        properties of the cell membranes. Based upon this assumption,
        the larger size of many types of tumor cells makes these cells
        more susceptible to electroporation and thus, it may be possible
        to selectively damage only the larger tumor cell membranes by
        applying an appropriate electric field. One disadvantage of this
        method is that the ability to discriminate is highly dependent
        upon on cell type, for example, the size difference between
        normal cells and tumor cells is significant only in certain
        types of cells. Another drawback of this method is that the
        voltages which are applied may damage some of the normal cells
        and may not damage all of the tumor cells because the
        differences in size and membrane dielectric properties are
        largely statistical and the actual cell geometries and
        dielectric properties may vary significantly. [<br>

        0018] What is needed in the art and has heretofore not been
        available is an apparatus for destroying dividing cells, wherein
        the apparatus better discriminates between dividing cells,
        including single-celled organisms, and non-dividing cells and is
        capable of selectively destroying the dividing cells or
        organisms with substantially no affect on the non-dividing cells
        or organisms and which can be configured to adopt its
        characteristics and spatial distribution within the patient's
        body so as to optimally destroy a specific tumor or tumors in a
        patient. The data regarding the specific tumor can be provided
        by conventional techniques, such as CT, MRI, etc., imaging of
        the tumor and its surroundings, as well as other means for
        characterization of the tumors. <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        [0019] An apparatus and related method for use in a number of
        different applications for optimization of the selective
        electric fields in destroying cells undergoing growth and
        division are provided. This includes cell (particularly tumor
        cells) in living tissues and organisms or other complex
        structures. The apparatus and method are designed to compute the
        optimal spatial and temporal characteristics for combating tumor
        growth within a body on the basis of cytological (as provided by
        biopsies, etc.) and anatomical data (as provided by CT, MRI,
        PET, etc.), as well as the electric properties of the different
        elements. On the basis of this computation, the apparatus
        applies the fields that have maximal effect on the tumor and
        minimal effect on all other tissues by adjusting both the field
        generator output characteristics and by optimal positioning of
        the insulated electrodes or isolects on the patient's body. For
        example and as will be described in greater detail hereinafter,
        the isolects are directly applied to the patient or by means of
        probes or pieces of clothing that are worn over the tumor area.
        In either case, the apparatus can activate the selected set of
        electrodes (isolects) to achieve optimal effect. <br>
        <br>
        [0020] A major use of the method and apparatus of the present
        invention is in treatment of tumors by selective destruction of
        tumor cells with substantially no affect on normal tissue cells
        and, thus, the invention is described below in the context of
        selective destruction of tumor cells. It should be appreciated
        however that, for the purpose of the description that follows,
        the term "cell" may also refer to single-celled organisms
        (eubacteria, bacteria, yeast, protozoa), multi-celled organisms
        (fungi, algae, mold), and plants as or parts thereof that are
        not normally classified as "cells". The method of the present
        invention enables selective destruction of tumor cells, or other
        organisms, by selective destruction of cells undergoing division
        in a way that is more effective and more accurate (e.g., more
        adaptable to be aimed at specific targets) than existing
        methods. Further, the method of the present invention causes
        minimal damage, if any, to normal tissue and, thus, reduces or
        eliminates many side-effects associated with existing selective
        destruction methods, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
        The selective destruction of dividing cells in accordance with
        the method of the present invention does not depend on the
        sensitivity of the cells to chemical agents or radiation.
        Instead, the selective destruction of dividing cells is based on
        distinguishable geometrical characteristics of cells undergoing
        division, in comparison to non-dividing cells, regardless of the
        cell geometry of the type of cells being treated. As well as the
        electric properties of the special apparatus associated with
        cell division (microtubules, tubulin filaments, etc.). <br>
        <br>
        [0021] In an embodiment of the present invention, cell
        geometry-dependent selective destruction of living tissue is
        performed by inducing a non-homogenous electric field in the
        cells, as described below. <br>
        <br>
        [0022] It has been observed by the present inventor that, while
        different cells in their non-dividing state may have different
        shapes, e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
        "pancake-like", etc., the division process of practically all
        cells is characterized by development of a "cleavage furrow" in
        late anaphase and telophase. This cleavage furrow is a slow
        constriction of the cell membrane (between the two sets of
        daughter chromosomes) which appears microscopically as a growing
        cleft (e.g., a groove or notch) that gradually separates the
        cell into two new cells. During the division process, there is a
        transient period (telophase) during which the cell structure is
        basically that of two sub-cells interconnected by a narrow
        "bridge" formed of the cell material. The division process is
        completed when the "bridge" between the two sub-cells is broken.
        The selective destruction of tumor cells using the present
        electronic apparatus utilizes this unique geometrical feature of
        dividing cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0023] When a cell or a group of cells are under natural
        conditions or environment, i.e., part of a living tissue, they
        are disposed surrounded by a conductive environment consisting
        mostly of an electrolytic inter-cellular fluid and other cells
        that are composed mostly of an electrolytic intra-cellular
        liquid. When an electric field is induced in the living tissue,
        by applying an electric potential across the tissue, an electric
        field is formed in the tissue and the specific distribution and
        configuration of the electric field lines defines the direction
        of charge displacement, or paths of electric currents in the
        tissue, if currents are in fact induced in the tissue. The
        distribution and configuration of the electric field is
        dependent on various parameters of the tissue, including the
        geometry and the electric properties of the different tissue
        components, and the relative conductivities, capacities and
        dielectric constants (that may be frequency dependent) of the
        tissue components.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0024] The electric current flow pattern for cells
        undergoing division is very different and unique as compared to
        non-dividing cells. Such cells including first and second
        sub-cells, namely an "original" cell and a newly formed cell,
        that are connected by a cytoplasm "bridge" or "neck". The
        currents penetrate the first sub-cell through part of the
        membrane ("the current source pole"); however, they do not exit
        the first sub-cell through a portion of its membrane closer to
        the opposite pole ("the current sink pole"). Instead, the lines
        of current flow converge at the neck or cytoplasm bridge,
        whereby the density of the current flow lines is greatly
        increased. A corresponding, "mirror image", process that takes
        place in the second sub-cell, whereby the current flow lines
        diverge to a lower density configuration as they depart from the
        bridge, and finally exit the second sub-cell from a part of its
        membrane closes to the current sink.<br>
        <br>
        [0025] When a polarizable object is placed in a non-uniform
        converging or diverging field, electric forces act on it and
        pull it towards the higher density electric field lines. In the
        case of dividing cell, electric forces are exerted in the
        direction of the cytoplasm bridge between the two cells. Since
        all intercellular organelles and macromolecules are polarizable,
        they are all force towards the bridge between the two cells. The
        field polarity is irrelevant to the direction of the force and,
        therefore, an alternating electric having specific properties
        can be used to produce substantially the same effect. It will
        also be appreciated that the concentrated and inhomogeneous
        electric field present in or near the bridge or neck portion in
        itself exerts strong forces on charges and natural dipoles and
        can lead to the disruption of structures associated with these
        members. <br>
        <br>
        [0026] The movement of the cellular organelles towards the
        bridge disrupts the cell structure and results in increased
        pressure in the vicinity of the connecting bridge membrane. This
        pressure of the organelles on the bridge membrane is expected to
        break the bridge membrane and, thus, it is expected that the
        dividing cell will "explode" in response to this pressure. The
        ability to break the membrane and disrupt other cell structures
        can be enhanced by applying a pulsating alternating electric
        field that has a frequency from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz.
        When this type of electric field is applied to the tissue, the
        forces exerted on the intercellular organelles have a
        "hammering" effect, whereby force pulses (or beats) are applied
        to the organelles numerous times per second, enhancing the
        movement of organelles of different sizes and masses towards the
        bridge (or neck) portion from both of the sub-cells, thereby
        increasing the probability of breaking the cell membrane at the
        bridge portion. The forces exerted on the intracellular
        organelles also affect the organelles themselves and may
        collapse or break the organelles.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0027] According to one exemplary embodiment, the
        apparatus for applying the electric field is an electronic
        apparatus that generates the desired electric signals in the
        shape of waveforms or trains of pulses. The electronic apparatus
        includes a generator that generates an alternating voltage
        waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz. The generator is operatively connected to conductive
        leads which are connected at their other ends to insulated
        conductors/electrodes (also referred to as isolects) that are
        activated by the generated waveforms. The generator may provide
        each electrode with a specific selected waveform that is
        calculated for field distribution that gives optimal results.
        This can be represented in the form of an Optimal Map. The
        insulated electrodes consist of a conductor in contact with a
        dielectric (insulating layer) that is in contact with the
        conductive tissue, thus forming a capacitor. The electric fields
        that are generated by the present apparatus can be applied in
        several different modes depending upon the precise treatment
        application and physiological and anatomical characteristics of
        the patient's parts of the body undergoing treatment. <br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        [0062] Reference is made to FIGS. 1A-1E which schematically
        illustrate various stages of a cell division process. FIG. 1A
        shows a cell 10 at its normal geometry, which may be generally
        spherical (as shown in the drawings), ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
        "pancake" like, or any other cell geometry, as is known in the
        art. FIGS. 1B-1D show cell 10 during different stages of its
        division process, which results in the formation of two new
        cells 18 and 20, shown in FIG. 1E.<br>
        <br>
        [0063] As shown in FIGS. 1B-1D, the division process of cell 10
        is characterized by a slowly growing cleft 12 which gradually
        separates cell 10 into two units, namely, sub-cells 14 and 16,
        which eventually evolve into new cells 18 and 20 (FIG. 1E). As
        shown specifically in FIG. 1D, the division process is
        characterized by a transient period during which the structure
        of cell 10 is basically that of the two sub-cells 14 and 16
        interconnected by a narrow "bridge" 22 containing cell material
        (cytoplasm surrounded by cell membrane).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0064] Reference is now made to FIGS. 2A and 2B, which
        schematically illustrate non-dividing cell 10 being subjected to
        an electric field produced by applying an alternating electric
        potential, at a relatively low frequency and at a relatively
        high frequency, respectively. Cell 10 includes intracellular
        organelles, e.g., a nucleus 30. Alternating electrical potential
        is applied across electrodes 28 and 32 that may be attached
        externally to a patient at a predetermined region, e.g., in the
        vicinity of a tumor being treated. When cell 10 is under natural
        conditions, i.e., part of a living tissue, it is disposed in a
        conductive environment (hereinafter referred to as a "volume
        conductor") consisting mostly of electrolytic inter-cellular
        liquid. When an electric potential is applied across electrode
        28 and 32, some of the field lines of the resultant electric
        field (or the current induced in the tissue in response to the
        electric field) penetrate cell 10, while the rest of the field
        lines (or induced current) flow in the surrounding medium. The
        specific distribution of the electric field lines, which is
        substantially consistent with the direction of current flow in
        this case, depends on the geometry and the electric properties
        of the system components, e.g., the relative conductivities and
        dielectric constants of the system components, that may be
        frequency dependent. For low frequencies, e.g., frequencies
        considerably lower than 10 kHz, the conductance properties of
        the components dominate the current flow, and the field
        distribution is generally as depicted in FIG. 2A. At higher
        frequencies, e.g., at frequencies of between 10 kHz and 1 MHz,
        the dielectric properties of the components become more
        significant and eventually dominate the field distribution,
        resulting in field distribution lines as depicted generally in
        FIG. 2B. <br>
        <br>
        [0065] For constant (i.e., DC) electric fields or relatively low
        frequency alternating electric fields, for example, frequencies
        under 10 kHz, the dielectric properties of the various
        components are not significant in determining and computing the
        field distribution. Therefore, as a first approximation, with
        regard to the electric field distribution, the system can be
        reasonably represented by the relative impedances of its various
        components. Under this approximation, the intercellular (i.e.,
        extracellular) fluid and the intracellular fluid have a
        relatively low impedance, while the cell membrane 11 has a
        relatively high impedance. Thus, under low frequency conditions,
        only a fraction of the electric field lines (or currents induced
        by the electric field) penetrate membrane 11 of cell 10. At
        relatively high frequencies (e.g., 10 kHz-1 MHz), in contrast,
        the impedance of membrane 11 relative to the intercellular and
        intracellular fluids decreases and, thus, the fraction of
        currents penetrating the cells increases significantly. It
        should be noted that at very high frequencies, i.e., above 1
        MHz, the membrane capacitance may short the membrane resistance
        and, therefore, the total membrane resistance may become
        negligible. <br>
        <br>
        [0066] In any of the embodiments described above, the electric
        field lines (or induced currents) penetrate cell 10 from a
        portion of membrane 11 closest to one of the electrodes
        generating the current, e.g., closest to positive electrode 28
        (also referred to herein as "source"). The current flow pattern
        across cell 10 is generally uniform because, under the above
        approximation, the field induced inside the cell is
        substantially homogenous. The currents exit cell 10 through a
        portion of membrane 11 closest to the opposite electrode, e.g.,
        negative electrode 32 (also referred to herein as "sink"). <br>
        <br>
        [0067] The distinction between field lines and current flow may
        depend on a number of factors, for example, on the frequency of
        the applied electric potential and on whether electrodes 28 and
        32 are electrically insulated. For insulated electrodes applying
        a DC or low frequency alternating voltage, there is practically
        no current flow along the lines of the electric field. At higher
        frequencies, displacement currents are induced in the tissue due
        to charging and discharging of the cell membranes (which act as
        capacitors to a certain extent), and such currents follow the
        lines of the electric field. Fields generated by non-insulated
        electrodes, in contrast, always generate some form of current
        flow, specifically, DC or low frequency alternating fields
        generate conductive current flow along the field lines, and high
        frequency alternating fields generate both conduction and
        displacement currents along the field lines. It should be
        appreciated, however, that movement of polarizable intracellular
        organelles according to the present invention (as described
        below) is not dependent on actual flow of current and,
        therefore, both insulated and non-insulated electrodes may be
        used efficiently in conjunction with the present invention.
        Nevertheless, insulated electrodes have the advantage of lower
        power consumption and causing less heating of the treated
        regions. <br>
        <br>
        [0068] According to one exemplary embodiment, the electric
        fields that are used in the present apparatus are alternating
        fields having frequencies that in the range from about 50 KHz to
        about 500 KHz, and preferably from about 100 KHz to about 300
        KHz. For ease of discussion, these type of electric fields are
        also referred to hereinafter as "TC fields", which is an
        abbreviation of "Tumor Curing electric fields", since these
        electric fields fall into an intermediate category (between high
        and low frequency ranges) that have bio-effective field
        properties, while having no meaningful stimulatory and thermal
        effects. These frequencies are sufficiently low so that the
        system behavior is determined by the system's "Ohmic"
        (conductive) properties but sufficiently high enough not to have
        any stimulation effect on excitable tissues. Such a system
        consists of two types of elements, namely, the intercellular, or
        extracellular fluid, or medium and the individual cells. The
        intercellular fluid is mostly an electrolyte with a specific
        resistance of about 40-100 ohm*cm. As mentioned above, the cells
        are characterized by three elements, namely (1) a thin, highly
        electric resistive membrane that coats the cell; (2) internal
        cytoplasm that is mostly an electrolyte that contains numerous
        macromolecules and micro-organelles, including the nucleus; and
        (3) membranes, similar in their electric properties to the cell
        membranes, cover the micro-organelles. <br>
        <br>
        [0069] When this type of system is subjected to the present TC
        fields (e.g., alternating electric fields in the frequency range
        of 100 KHz-300 KHz), most of the lines of the electric field and
        currents tend away from the cells because of the high resistive
        cell membrane and therefore, the lines remain in the
        extracellular conductive medium. In the above recited frequency
        range, the actual fraction of electric field or currents that
        penetrate the cells is a strong function of the frequency.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0070] FIG. 2 schematically depicts the resulting field
        distribution in the system. As illustrated, the lines of force,
        which also depict the lines of potential current flow across the
        cell volume mostly in parallel with the undistorted lines of
        force (the main direction of the electric field). In other
        words, the field inside the cells is mostly homogeneous. In
        practice, the fraction of the field or current that penetrates
        the cells is determined by the cell membrane impedance value
        relative to that of the extracellular fluid. Since the
        equivalent electric circuit of the cell membrane is that of a
        resistor and capacitor in parallel, the impedance is function of
        the frequency. The higher the frequency, the lower the
        impedance, the larger the fraction of penetrating current and
        the smaller the field distortion. [0071] As previously
        mentioned, when cells are subjected to relatively weak electric
        fields and currents that alternate at high frequencies, such as
        the present TC fields having a frequency in the range of 50 KHz
        to 500 KHz, they have no effect on the non-dividing cells. While
        the present TC fields have no detectable effect on such systems,
        the situation becomes different in the presence of dividing
        cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0072] Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A-3C which
        schematically illustrate the electric current flow pattern in
        cell 10 during its division process, under the influence of high
        frequency alternating electric field in accordance with an
        embodiment of the invention. The field lines or induced currents
        penetrate cell 10 through a part of the membrane of sub-cell 16
        closer to electrode 28. However, they do not exit through the
        cytoplasm bridge 22 that connects sub-cell 16 with the newly
        formed yet still attached sub-cell 14, or through a part of the
        membrane in the vicinity of bridge 22. Instead, the electric
        field or current flow lines-that are relatively widely separated
        in sub-cell 16-converge as they approach bridge 22 (also
        referred to as "neck" 22) and, thus, the current/field line
        density within neck 22 is increased dramatically. A "mirror
        image" process takes place in sub-cell 14, whereby the
        converging field lines in bridge 22 diverge as they approach the
        exit region of sub-cell 14.<br>
        <br>
        [0073] It should be appreciated by persons skilled in the art
        that homogenous electric fields do not exert a force on
        electrically neutral objects, i.e., objects having substantially
        zero net charge, although such objects may become polarized.
        However, under a non-uniform, converging electric field, as
        shown in FIGS. 3A-3C, electric forces are exerted on polarized
        objects, moving them in the direction of the higher density
        electric field lines. It will be appreciated that the
        concentrated electric field that is present in the neck or
        bridge area in itself exerts strong forces on charges and
        natural dipoles and can disrupt structures that are associated
        therewith. One will understand that similar net forces act on
        charges in an alternating field, again in the direction of the
        field of higher intensity. <br>
        <br>
        [0074] In the configuration of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the direction of
        movement of polarized objects is towards the higher density
        electric filed lines, i.e., towards the cytoplasm bridge 22
        between sub-cells 14 and 16. It is known in the art that all
        intracellular organelles, for example, nuclei 24 and 26 of
        sub-cells 14 and 16, respectively, are polarizable and, thus,
        such intracellular organelles will be electrically forced in the
        direction of bridge 22. Since the movement is always from the
        lower density currents to the higher density currents,
        regardless of the field polarity, the forces applied by the
        alternating electric field to organelles such as nuclei 24 and
        26 are always in the direction of bridge 22. A comprehensive
        description of such forces and the resulting movement of
        macromolecules or intracellular organelles, a phenomenon
        referred to as dielectrophoresis, is described extensively in
        the literature, for example, in C. L. Asbury &amp; G. van den
        Engh, Biophys. J. 74, 1024-1030, 1998, the disclosure of which
        is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
        <br>
        [0075] The movement of organelles 24 and 26 towards bridge 22
        disrupts the structure of the dividing cell and, eventually, the
        pressure of the converging organelles on bridge membrane 22
        results in breakage of cell membrane 11 at the vicinity of
        bridge 22, as shown schematically in FIG. 3C. The ability to
        break membrane 11 at bridge 22 and to otherwise disrupt the cell
        structure and organization may be enhanced by applying a
        pulsating AC electric field, rather than a steady AC field. When
        a pulsating field is applied, the forces acting on organelles 24
        and 26 may have a "hammering" effect, whereby pulsed forces beat
        on the intracellular organelles at a desired rhythm, e.g., a
        pre-selected number of times per second. Such "hammering" is
        expected to enhance the movement of intracellular organelles
        towards neck 22 from both sub cells 14 and 16), thereby
        increasing the probability of breaking cell membrane 11 in the
        vicinity of neck 22. [0076] A very important element, which is
        very susceptible to the special fields that develop within the
        dividing cells is the microtubule spindle that plays a major
        role in the division process. In FIG. 4, a dividing cell 10 is
        illustrated, at an earlier stage as compared to FIGS. 3A and 3B,
        under the influence of external TC fields (e.g., alternating
        fields in the frequency range of about 100 KHz to about 300
        KHz), generally indicated as lines 100, with a corresponding
        spindle mechanism generally indicated at 120. The lines 120 are
        microtubules that are known to have a very strong dipole moment.
        This strong polarization makes the tubules susceptible to
        electric fields. Their positive charges are located at two
        centrioles while two sets of negative poles are at the center of
        the dividing cells and the other pair is at the points of
        attachment of the microtubules to the cell membrane, generally
        indicated at 130. This structure forms sets of double dipoles
        and therefore, they are susceptible to fields of different
        directions. It will be understood that the effects of the TC
        fields on the dipoles does not depend on the formation of the
        bridge (neck) and thus, the dipoles are influenced by the TC
        fields prior to the formation of the bridge (neck). <br>
        <br>
        [0077] Since the present apparatus, as described in greater
        detail hereinafter, utilizes insulated electrodes, the
        above-mentioned negative effects obtained when conductive
        electrodes are used, i.e., ion concentration changes in the
        cells and the formation of harmful agents by electrolysis, do
        not occur when the present apparatus is used. This is because,
        in general, no actual transfer of charges takes place between
        the electrodes and the medium and there is no charge flow in the
        medium where the currents are capacitive, i.e., are expressed
        only as rotation of charges, etc. <br>
        <br>
        [0078] Turning now to FIG. 5, the TC fields described above that
        have been found to advantageously destroy tumor cells are
        generated by an electronic apparatus 200. FIG. 5 is a simple
        schematic diagram of the electronic apparatus 200 illustrating
        the major components thereof. The electronic apparatus 200
        generates the desired electric field signals (TC signals) in the
        shape of waveforms or trains of pulses. The apparatus 200
        includes a generator 210 and a set of pairs of conductive leads
        220 that are attached at one end thereof to the generator 210.
        The opposite ends of the leads 220 are connected to the
        insulated conductors 230 that are activated by the electric
        signals (e.g., waveforms). The insulated conductors 230 are also
        referred to hereinafter as "isolects" 230. Optionally and
        according to one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus 200
        includes a temperature sensor 240 or sensors and a control box
        250 which are added to control the amplitude of the electric
        field generated so not to generate excessive heating in the area
        that is treated. <br>
        <br>
        [0079] The generator 210 generates multiple alternating voltage
        waveforms at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about
        500 KHz (preferably from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz)(i.e.,
        the TC fields) as instructed by a controller 300. Preferably,
        the controller 300 is a programmable unit, such as a personal
        computer or the like, that permits the user to input certain
        parameters and the controller 300 will then make the necessary
        computations. The controller 300 also distributes to each
        electrode 230 the designated potential wave. The required
        voltages are such the electric field intensity in the tissue to
        be treated is in the range of about 0.1V/cm, according to one
        exemplary embodiment, to about 10V/cm while in the other areas
        it is significantly lower.<br>
        <br>
        [0080] When the control box 250 is included, it controls the
        outputs of the generator 210 so that they will remain constant
        at the values preset by the user or the control box 250. The
        controller 300 issues a warning or the like when the temperature
        (sensed by temperature sensor 240) exceeds a preset limit.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0081] The details of the construction of the isolects 230
        is based on their electric behavior that can be understood from
        their simplified electric circuit when in contact with tissue as
        generally illustrated in FIG. 6. In the illustrated arrangement,
        the potential drop or the electric field distribution between
        the different components is determined by their relative
        electric impedance, i.e., the fraction of the field on each
        component is given by the value of its impedance divided by the
        total circuit impedance. For example, the potential drop on
        element [Delta]VA=A/(A+B+C+D+E). Thus, for DC or low frequency
        AC, practically all the potential drop is on the capacitor (that
        acts as an insulator). For relatively very high frequencies, the
        capacitor practically is a short and therefore, practically all
        the field is distributed in the tissues. At the frequencies of
        the present TC fields (e.g., 50 KHz to 500 KHz), which are
        intermediate frequencies, the impedance of the capacitance of
        the capacitors is dominant and determines the field
        distribution. Therefore, in order to increase the effective
        voltage drop across the tissues (field intensity), the impedance
        of the capacitors is to be decreased (i.e., increase their
        capacitance). This can be achieved by increasing the effective
        area of the "plates" of the capacitor, decrease the thickness of
        the dielectric or use a dielectric with high dielectric
        constant.<br>
        <br>
        [0082] In order to optimize the field distribution, the isolects
        230 are configured differently depending upon the application in
        which the isolects 230 are to be used. There are two principle
        modes for applying the present electric fields (TC fields).
        First, the TC fields can be applied by external isolects and
        second, the TC fields can be applied by internal isolects. <br>
        <br>
        [0083] Since the thin insulating layer can be very vulnerable,
        etc., the insulation can be replaced by very high dielectric
        constant insulating materials, such as titanium dioxide (e.g.,
        rutil), the dielectric constant can reach values of about 200.
        There a number of different materials that are suitable for use
        in the intended application and have high dielectric constants.
        For example, some materials include: lithium nibate (LiNbO3),
        which is a ferroelectric crystal and has a number of
        applications in optical, pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices;
        yittrium iron garnet (YIG) is a ferrimagnetic crystal and
        magneto-optical devices, e.g., optical isolator can be realized
        from this material; barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a ferromagnetic
        crystal with a large electro-optic effect; potassium tantalate
        (KTaO3) which is a dielectric crystal (ferroelectric at low
        temperature) and has very low microwave loss and tunability of
        dielectric constant at low temperature; and lithium tantalate
        (LiTaO3) which is a ferroelectric crystal with similar
        properties as lithium niobate and has utility in
        electro-optical, pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices. It will
        be understood that the aforementioned exemplary materials can be
        used in combination with the present device where it is desired
        to use a material having a high dielectric constant.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0084] One must also consider another factor that effects
        the effective capacity of the isolects 230, namely the presence
        of air between the isolects 230 and the skin. Such presence,
        which is not easy to prevent, introduces a layer of an insulator
        with a dielectric constant of 1.0, a factor that significantly
        lowers the effective capacity of the isolects 230 and
        neutralizes the advantages of the titanium dioxide (routil),
        etc. To overcome this problem, the isolects 230 can be shaped so
        as to conform with the body structure and/or (2) an intervening
        filler 270 (as illustrated in FIG. 22C), such as a gel, that has
        high conductance and a high effective dielectric constant, can
        be added to the structure. The shaping can be pre-structured
        (see FIG. 22A) or the system can be made sufficiently flexible
        so that shaping of the isolects 230 is readily achievable. The
        gel can be made of hydrogels, gelatins, agar, etc., and can have
        salts dissolved in it to increase its conductivity. The exact
        thickness of the gel is not important so long as it is of
        sufficient thickness that the gel layer does not dry out during
        the treatment. In one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of the
        gel is about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0085] In order to avoid overheating of the treated
        tissues, a selection of materials and field parameters is
        needed. The isolects insulating material should have minimal
        dielectric losses at the frequency ranges to be used during the
        treatment process. This factor can be taken into consideration
        when choosing the particular frequencies for the treatment. The
        direct heating of the tissues will most likely be dominated by
        the heating due to current flow (given by the I*R product).
        However, dielectric losses can also contribute and in addition,
        the isolect (insulated electrode) 230 and its surroundings
        should be made of materials that facilitate heat losses and its
        general structure should also facilitate head losses, i.e.,
        minimal structures that block heat dissipation to the
        surroundings (air) as well as high heat conductivity. <br>
        <br>
        [0086] As previously mentioned, a coupling agent, such as a
        conductive gel, is preferably used to ensure that an effective
        conductive environment is provided between the insulated
        electrode 230 and the skin surface 231. The coupling agent is
        disposed on the insulated electrode 230 and preferably, a
        uniform layer of the agent is provided along the surface of the
        electrode 230. One of the reasons that the units 540 need
        replacement at periodic times is that the coupling agent needs
        to be replaced and/or replenished. In other words, after a
        predetermined time period or after a number of uses, the patient
        removes the units 540 so that the coupling agent can be applied
        again to the electrode 230. <br>
        <br>
        [0087] The leads 220 are standard isolated conductors with a
        flexible metal shield, preferably grounded so that it prevents
        the spread of the electric field generated by the leads 220. The
        isolects 230 have specific shapes and positioning so as to
        generate an electric field of the desired configuration,
        direction and intensity at the target volume and only there so
        as to focus the treatment. The generation of electric field
        distribution of the desired characteristics is achieved by
        placement of numerous isolects on the body surface, and when
        necessary also inside the body. The number of electrodes 230 can
        typically be about 20-100, placed about 4-12 cm apart. The
        electrodes 230 can be positioned individually on the skin, etc.,
        (as by an adhesive), or be part of an article of clothing, such
        as elastic undershirt, as illustrated in FIGS. 8-9, that holds
        the electrodes in place. Each isolect 230 (electrode) is
        connected to the controller 300 and is provided with a voltage
        signal the amplitude and shape of which was calculated
        specifically for the particular electrode. One will also
        appreciate that the calculation for the voltage signal
        (amplitude and shape) can be made for groups of isolects as well
        instead of for individual isolects. <br>
        <br>
        [0088] According to one aspect, a method for optimizing the
        selective destruction of dividing cells is provided and the
        method includes the general steps of calculating the spatial and
        temporal distribution of electric fields for optimal treatment
        of a specific patient that has a tumor of specific
        characteristics. This calculation takes into consideration the
        location and the specific characteristics of the tumor. [0089]
        One exemplary process for computing and applying an optimal
        electric field is described with reference to the flow chart of
        FIG. 7. FIG. 7 thus gives a general overview of the present
        optimization process. In steps 400, 410, 420, the user inputs
        different types of information that is used to compute the
        optimal electric field. For example, at step 400, the user
        inputs characteristics of the tissue cells in the area to be
        treated; at step 410, the user inputs characteristics of the
        tumor cells to be treated; and at step 420, the user inputs the
        anatomy of the area to be treated, including the tumor and its
        relevant surroundings. At step 430, this inputted information is
        used to compute the necessary field intensity in the tumor. The
        relative sensitivities of the non-tumor tissues to the electric
        fields is computed in step 440. At step 450, the maximal allowed
        field intensity at the various areas is determined and then
        based on the information inputted in steps 400 through 450, an
        optimal field map is computed at step 460. At step 470, the
        selected isolects (those present in the optimal field map) are
        computed as well as their position and waveform and the voltage
        that is to be delivered to each isolect. In order to further
        minimize the field map, the number of isolects is preferably
        reduced in step 480 to produce a modified field map and then the
        deviation of the modified map from the optimum is calculated.
        The calculated deviation is then compared to an inputted
        threshold value and if the calculated deviation is below the
        inputted threshold, the process of reducing the number of
        isolects is continued until the inputted threshold is obtained.
        Once the inputted threshold is obtained, a signal is delivered
        to the controller to activate the reduced number of isolects. At
        step 490, a signal is generated and delivered to the function
        generating system (e.g., the generator that produces the
        waveforms mentioned in step 470, such as an analog wave
        generator or a digital one, e.g., a waveform generated by a PC
        and outputted through a digital to analog converter) or the
        system is otherwise instructed to provide the selected waveform
        and voltage to the isolects. The field that results from
        activation of the isolects is monitored at step 510 and any
        errors are corrected. If any errors or abnormalities are
        detected, the field is modified as necessary according to the
        treatment protocol at step 520. The various algorithms that are
        used for the necessary computations are described hereinafter.<br>
        <br>
        [0090] Since the signal that is delivered to each electrode
        (isolect) is a voltage signal that has been specifically created
        for the specific electrode or for a specific group of
        electrodes, the calculation of this voltage signal is an
        important aspect of the present invention.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0091] The voltages for the isolects are calculated as
        follows. Following the anatomical definition of the areas to be
        treated, taking into consideration the specific sensitivity of
        the different tissues to the TC fields and the target area, the
        desired field distribution map is constructed, as described in
        the flow chart of FIG. 7. The processor, which was fed the
        coordinates of all available isolects, now computes the vector
        sum of the fields generated by each isolect at each point in
        time. The computation can be made significantly faster in cases
        where an analytical expression for the electric field
        originating from arbitrary placed electrodes is available. Such
        a computation can be performed, for example, for the simple
        case; an isolect placed on a muscle, or similar tissue, for
        which an analytical expression for the electric field is:
        [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0092] Where R1 is the radius of the metallic part of the
        isolect, R2 is the isolect radius including coating [element
        of]coat and [element of]muscle are the dielectric constants of
        the isolect coating and muscle, respectively and r is the
        distance between the electrodes to the point where one wants to
        calculate the field. The fields generated in more complex
        systems are usually computed by finite element methods, as
        described below.<br>
        <br>
        [0093] Using this analytical expression, a series of iterations
        is initiated and the controller 300, more specifically the CPU
        thereof, calculates the TC field, using optimization methods, to
        optimize the voltage and the position of each electrode so that
        one gets the desired spatial arrangement of the electric field.
        The computation begins with a set of isolect locations and
        initial conditions, chosen arbitrary, or based on a set of
        assumptions or previous experience. The field maps thus
        generated are compared with the reference optimal map that was
        generated, as described in the flow chart illustrated in FIG. 7.
        In the subsequent iterations, the voltage and the position of
        the different isolects are changed and an optimal fit with the
        optimal map is sought. In other words, one optimizes the
        correlation between the calculated electric field (TC field) and
        the desired electric field (TC field). In the above optimization
        method one can use, for example, the robust numeric optimization
        method, known as the Nelder-Mead simplex method, as described in
        Neider and Mead, Computer Journal Vol. 7, p. 308 (1965);

        in their entirety. In addition, the calculations of the
        optimization method include the method "Sequential Quadratic
        Programming", and this method is intended for checking that the
        first one went fine. The references include Fletcher, R. and M.

        23-26, 1970, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference
        in their entirety. [0094] Now referring to FIGS. 8-9 in which an
        article of clothing 600 in the form of an undershirt is shown.
        Depending upon the precise location of the tumor (target
        tissue), the undershirt 600 can be of an oversized type in that,
        as illustrated, the undershirt 600 extends below the waist of
        the patient and in fact, it protrudes around a portion of the
        user's upper legs (thighs); however, it will be appreciated that
        the undershirt 600 can be of a more conventional type that lies
        above the waist. The undershirt 600 has a predetermined number
        of electrodes 230 (e.g., 20-100 in number) that are arranged
        either in an orderly manner as shown (rows and columns) or they
        can be arranged in a irregular pattern depending upon where the
        optimal positioning of the electrodes 230 is determined to be.
        The electrodes 230 are held in place by the undershirt
        construction, e.g., by adhesives or by stitching, etc. As shown
        in FIG. 9, the electrodes 230 completely extend radially around
        the body of the patient.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0095] In FIG. 10, this type of procedure was carried out
        with the aim to effectively focus the field at the selected
        area, which in this Figure is denoted by the circle 610. In this
        example, random initialization of the electrode voltage and
        positions were used.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0096] In FIG. 11, the calculated optimal position of the
        electrodes, depicted by circles 620, is illustrated around the
        tissue mass 630 where the electric field (TC field) intensity is
        minimal, as denoted by 640, while the intensity of the electric
        field increases in the vicinity of the target (tissue mass) 630.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0097] In yet another example of the procedure of
        calculating the isolect placement that would give high field
        intensity at a number of skin locations, for treatment of
        malignant melanoma's while having minimal field at the spine is
        illustrated and described with reference to FIGS. 12-18. In this
        example, one will appreciate how the anatomy, the isolect
        structure and the tissue electric characteristics are
        incorporated into the calculations. One of the advantages of
        using an electric field to repress the prosperity of cells is
        that areas inside a human being can be left outside of the
        electric field influence. According to this one example, a model
        is constructed for a human having four electrodes around the mid
        body portion and the electrodes are specifically arranged so
        that the electric field around the human's spine is zero. The
        calculations are based on finite element mesh (FEM) and the
        geometric model is described and illustrated with reference to
        FIG. 12. In FIG. 12, the axis units are in millimeters and the
        body is 0.5 m width with a 0.35 thickness. FIG. 12 shows the
        location of the spine 650 relative to four electrodes 660 that
        are spaced therearound. A skin boundary or layer of the patient
        is generally shown at 670 with muscle 680 being shown as
        occupying the area within the skin boundary 670 and around the
        spine 650. <br>
        <br>
        [0098] FIG. 13 is also a geometric model illustrating an
        enlargement of the area around one electrode 670 of FIG. 12
        showing the interaction between the electrode 670 and the skin
        layer 670. The axis units in FIG. 13 are in millimeters and in
        this exemplary embodiment, the electrode 660 includes a coating
        662 that is formed of PVC or potassium tantalate. In this
        example, the electrode 660 has a diameter of about 10 mm and the
        coating 662 that is disposed around an outer surface 661 thereof
        has a thickness of about 0.1 mm. The skin layer 670 has a
        thickness of about 1 mm. Table 1 sets forth the parameters for
        the materials that are used in the calculations that are used
        with the geometric models of FIGS. 12 and 13. TABLE 1 Material

        <br>
        [0099] In all of the calculations for this example, the voltage
        between the electrodes 660 was 1V and the frequency of the sine
        voltage was 100 KHz. <br>
        <br>
        [0100] In this example, the electrodes 660 are placed in a
        symmetric formation such that the electric field in the middle
        of the body is zero. FIG. 14 is photographic image of the
        electrodes 660 around the spine 650 illustrating the electric
        field representation in the symmetric formation of the
        electrodes. FIG. 15 is another representation of the electric
        field; however, this representation of the electric field is by
        arrows. As will be appreciated, only the electric field inside
        the body is shown. As can be seen from both FIGS. 14 and 15, the
        electric field is zero in the middle of the body and is very
        high in the area of the spine 650. This is unwanted since the
        presence of the electric field near the spine 650 can be
        potentially harmful. In FIG. 16, the electrodes 660 have been
        rearranged so that the electric field is zero in the spine area
        650 and not zero in the middle of the body. FIG. 16 is a
        schematic illustration of the arrangement of the electrodes 660
        that causes a zero electric field in the area of the spine 650.
        FIG. 17 is a photographic image of the electric field in an
        asymmetric formation of the electrodes and FIG. 18 is another
        representation of the electric field, similar to FIG. 15, in
        which the electric field is represented by arrows and only the
        electric field inside the body is drawn. As can be seen from
        FIGS. 17 and 18, the asymmetric arrangement of the electrodes
        causes a zero electric field in the area of the spine 650, while
        the field outside the spine 650 is not zero. <br>
        <br>
        [0101] Based on the above calculations, one will appreciate that
        a proper arrangement of the electrodes can shape the electric
        field so that it becomes zero at areas we choose, such as the
        spine area 650, in this example. In application, the procedure
        can entail using a CT image to position the internal organs,
        calculate on-line the electric field using the present
        methodology and automatically position the electrodes on the
        patient's body so that an area that we do not want to harm will
        not suffer from the presence of an electric field. <br>
        <br>
        [0102] The specifications of the apparatus 200 as a whole and
        its individual components are largely influenced by the fact
        that at the frequency of the present TC fields (50 KHz-500 KHz),
        living systems behave according to their "Ohmic", rather than
        their dielectric properties. The only elements in the apparatus
        200 that behave differently are the insulators of the isolects
        230 (see FIGS. 19-21). The isolects 200 consist of a conductor
        in contact with a dielectric that is in contact with the
        conductive tissue thus forming a capacitor. <br>
        <br>
        [0103] There are any number of different types of applications
        in which the apparatus 200 or one of the others disclosed herein
        can be used. The following applications are merely exemplary and
        not limiting of the number of different types of applications
        which can be used. FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary embodiment
        where the isolects 230 are incorporated in a skin patch 700. The
        skin patch 700 can be a self-adhesive flexible patch with one or
        more pairs of isolects 230. The patch 700 includes internal
        insulation 710 (formed of a dielectric material) and the
        external insulation 260 and is applied to skin surface 701 that
        contains a tumor 703 either on the skin surface 701 or slightly
        below the skin surface 701. Tissue is generally indicated at
        705. To prevent the potential drop across the internal
        insulation 710 to dominate the system, the internal insulation
        710 must have a relatively high capacity. This can be achieved
        by a large surface area; however, this may not be desired as it
        will result in the spread of the field over a large area (e.g.,
        an area larger than required to treat the tumor). Alternatively,
        the internal insulation 710 can be made very thin and/or the
        internal insulation 710 can be of a high dielectric constant. As
        the skin resistance between the electrodes (labeled as A and E
        in FIG. 6) is normally significantly higher than that of the
        tissue (labeled as C in FIG. 6) underneath it (1-10 K[Omega] vs.
        0.1-1 K[Omega]), most of the potential drop beyond the isolects
        occurs there. To accommodate for these impedances (Z), the
        characteristics of the internal insulation 710 (labeled as B and
        D in FIG. 6) should be such that they have impedance preferably
        under 100 K[Omega] at the frequencies of the present TC fields
        (e.g., 50 KHz to 500 KHz). For example, if it is desired for the
        impedance to be about 10 K Ohms or less, such that over 1% of
        the applied voltage falls on the tissues, for isolects with a
        surface area of 10 mm&lt;2&gt; , at frequencies of 200 KHz, the
        capacity should be on the order of 10&lt;-10 &gt; F, which means
        that using standard insulations with a dielectric constant of
        2-3, the thickness of the insulating layer 710 should be about
        50-100 microns. An internal field 10 times stronger would be
        obtained with insulators with a dielectric constant of about
        20-50.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0104] FIGS. 20 and 21 illustrate a second type of
        treatment using the isolects 230, namely electric field
        generation by internal isolects 230. A body to which the
        isolects 230 are implanted is generally indicated at 711 and
        includes a skin surface 713 and a tumor 715. In this embodiment,
        the isolects 230 can have the shape of plates, wires or other
        shapes that can be inserted subcutaneously or a deeper location
        within the body 711 so as to generate an appropriate field at
        the target area (tumor 715). FIG. 22 illustrates the various
        constructions of the isolects 230, including the use of internal
        insulation 710, a filler or gel 270 and external insulation 260.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0105] It will also be appreciated that the mode of
        isolects application is not restricted to the above
        descriptions. In the case of tumors in internal organs, for
        example, liver, lung, etc., the distance between each member of
        the pair of isolects 230 can be large. The pairs can even by
        positioned opposite sides of a torso 720, as illustrated in FIG.
        23. The arrangement of the isolects 230 in FIG. 23 is
        particularly useful for treating a tumor 730 associated with
        lung cancer or gastrointestinal tumors. In this embodiment, the
        electric fields (TC fields) spread in a wide fraction of the
        body. [0106] In order to achieve the desirable features of the
        isolects 230, the dielectric coating of each should be very
        thin, for example from between 1-50 microns. Since the coating
        is so thin, the isolects 230 can easily be damaged mechanically.
        This problem can be overcome by adding a protective feature to
        the isolect's structure so as to provide desired protection from
        such damage. For example, the isolect 230 can be coated, for
        example, with a relatively loose net 340 that prevents access to
        the surface but has only a minor effect on the effective surface
        area of the isolect 230 (i.e., the capacity of the isolects 230
        (cross section presented in FIG. 24B). The loose net 340 does
        not effect the capacity and ensures good contact with the skin,
        etc. The loose net 340 can be formed of a number of different
        materials; however, in one exemplary embodiment, the net 340 is
        formed of nylon, polyester, cotton, etc. Alternatively, a very
        thin conductive coating 350 can be applied to the dielectric
        portion (insulating layer) of the isolect 230. One exemplary
        conductive coating is formed of a metal and more particularly of
        gold. The thickness of the coating 350 depends upon the
        particular application and also on the type of material used to
        form the coating 350; however, when gold is used, the coating
        has a thickness from about 0.1 micron to about 0.1 mm. <br>
        <br>
        [0107] In order to avoid overheating of the treated tissues, a
        selection of materials and field parameters is needed. The
        isolects insulating material should have minimal dielectric
        losses at the frequency ranges to be used during the treatment
        process. This factor can be taken into consideration when
        choosing the particular frequencies for the treatment. The
        direct heating of the tissues will most likely be dominated by
        the heating due to current flow (given by the I*R product). In
        addition, the isolect (insulated electrode) 230 and its
        surroundings should be made of materials that facilitate heat
        losses and its general structure should also facilitate head
        losses, i.e., minimal structures that block heat dissipation to
        the surroundings (air) as well as high heat conductivity. <br>
        <br>
        [0108] The effectiveness of the treatment can be enhanced by an
        arrangement of isolects 230 that focuses the field at the
        desired target while leaving other sensitive areas in low field
        density (i.e., protected areas). The proper placement of the
        isolects 230 over the body can be maintained using any number of
        different techniques, including using a suitable piece of
        clothing that keeps the isolects at the appropriate positions.
        FIG. 25 illustrates such an arrangement in which an area labeled
        as "P" represents a protected area. The lines of field force do
        not penetrate this protected area and the field there is much
        smaller than near the isolects 230 where target areas can be
        located and treated well. In contrast, the field intensity near
        the four poles is very high. <br>
        <br>
        [0109] The present inventor has thus uncovered that electric
        fields having particular properties can be used to destroy
        dividing cells or tumors when the electric fields are applied to
        using an electronic device. More specifically, these electric
        fields fall into a special intermediate category, namely
        bio-effective fields that have no meaningful stimulatory and no
        thermal effects, and therefore overcome the disadvantages that
        were associated with the application of conventional electric
        fields to a body. It will also be appreciated that the present
        apparatus can further include a device for rotating the TC field
        relative to the living tissue. For example and according to one
        embodiment, the alternating electric potential applies to the
        tissue being treated is rotated relative to the tissue using
        conventional devices, such as a mechanical device that upon
        activation, rotates various components of the present system. <br>
        <br>
        [0110] Moreover and according to yet another embodiment, the TC
        fields are applied to different pairs of the insulated
        electrodes 230 in a consecutive manner. In other words, the
        generator 210 and the control system thereof can be arranged so
        that signals are sent at periodic intervals to select pairs of
        insulated electrodes 230, thereby causing the generation of the
        TC fields of different directions by these insulated electrodes
        230. Because the signals are sent at select times from the
        generator to the insulated electrodes 230, the TC fields of
        changing directions are generated consecutively by different
        insulated electrodes 230. This arrangement has a number of
        advantages and is provided in view of the fact that the TC
        fields have maximal effect when they are parallel to the axis of
        cell division. Since the orientation of cell division is in most
        cases random, only a fraction of the dividing cells are affected
        by any given field. Thus, using fields of two or more
        orientations increases the effectiveness since it increases the
        chances that more dividing cells are affected by a given TC
        field. <br>
        <br>
        [0111] Turning now to FIG. 26 in which an article of clothing
        800 according to one exemplary embodiment is illustrated. More
        specifically, the article of clothing 800 is in the form of a
        hat or cap or other type of clothing designed for placement on a
        head of a person. For purposes of illustration, a head 802 is
        shown with the hat 800 being placed thereon and against a skin
        surface 804 of the head 802. An intra-cranial tumor or the like
        810 is shown as being formed within the head 802 underneath the
        skin surface 804 thereof. The hat 800 is therefore intended for
        placement on the head 802 of a person who has a tumor 810 or the
        like. <br>
        <br>
        [0112] Unlike the various embodiments illustrated in the other
        Figures where the insulated electrodes 230 are arranged in a
        more or less planar arrangement since they are placed either on
        a skin surface or embedded within the body underneath it, the
        insulated electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically
        contoured and arranged for a specific application. The treatment
        of intra-cranial tumors or other lesions or the like typically
        requires a treatment that is of a relatively long duration,
        e.g., days to weeks, and therefore, it is desirable to provide
        as much comfort as possible to the patient. The hat 800 is
        specifically designed to provide comfort during the lengthy
        treatment process while not jeopardizing the effectiveness of
        the treatment. <br>
        <br>
        [0113] According to one exemplary embodiment, the hat 800
        includes a predetermined number of insulated electrodes 230 that
        are preferably positioned so as to produce the optimal TC fields
        at the location of the tumor 810. The lines of force of the TC
        field are generally indicated at 820. As can be seen in FIG. 26,
        the tumor 810 is positioned within these lines of force 820. As
        will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are positioned within the hat 800 such that a
        portion or surface thereof is free to contact the skin surface
        804 of the head 802. In other words, when the patient wears the
        hat 800, the insulated electrodes 230 are placed in contact with
        the skin surface 804 of the head 802 in positions that are
        selected so that the TC fields generated thereby are focused at
        the tumor 810 while leaving surrounding areas in low density.
        Typically, hair on the head 802 is shaved in selected areas to
        permit better contact between the insulated electrodes 230 and
        the skin surface 804; however, this is not critical. <br>
        <br>
        [0114] The hat 800 preferably includes a mechanism 830 that
        applies or force to the insulated electrodes 230 so that they
        are pressed against the skin surface 802. For example, the
        mechanism 830 can be of a biasing type that applies a biasing
        force to the insulated electrodes 230 to cause the insulated
        electrodes 230 to be directed outwardly away from the hat 800.
        Thus, when the patient places the hat 800 on his/her head 802,
        the insulated electrodes 230 are pressed against the skin
        surface 804 by the mechanism 830. The mechanism 830 can slightly
        recoil to provide a comfortable fit between the insulated
        electrodes 230 and the head 802. In one exemplary embodiment,
        the mechanism 830 is a spring based device that is disposed
        within the hat 800 and has one section that is coupled to and
        applies a force against the insulated electrodes 230, as
        described below with reference to FIGS. 27 and 28. [0115] As
        with the prior embodiments, the insulated electrodes 230 are
        coupled to the generator 210 by means of conductors 220. The
        generator 210 can be either disposed within the hat 800 itself
        so as to provide a compact, self-sufficient, independent system
        or the generator 210 can be disposed external to the hat 800
        with the conductors 220 exiting the hat 800 through openings or
        the like and then running to the generator 210. When the
        generator 210 is disposed external to the hat 800, it will be
        appreciated that the generator 210 can be located in any number
        of different locations, some of which are in close proximity to
        the hat 800 itself, while others can be further away from the
        hat 800. For example, the generator 210 can be disposed within a
        carrying bag or the like (e.g., a bag that extends around the
        patient's waist) which is worn by the patient or it can be
        strapped to an extremity or around the torso of the patient. The
        generator 210 can also be disposed in a protective case that is
        secured to or carried by another article of clothing that is
        worn by the patient. For example, the protective case can be
        inserted into a pocket of a sweater, etc. FIG. 26 illustrates an
        embodiment where the generator 210 is incorporated directly into
        the hat 800.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0116] Turning now to FIGS. 27 and 28, in one exemplary
        embodiment, a number of insulated electrodes 230 along with the
        mechanism 830 are preferably formed as an independent unit,
        generally indicated at 840, that can be inserted into the hat
        800 and electrically connected to the generator (not shown) via
        the conductors (not shown). By providing these members in the
        form of an independent unit, the patient can easily insert
        and/or remove the units 840 from the hat 800 when they may need
        cleaning, servicing and/or replacement.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0117] In this embodiment, the hat 800 is constructed to
        include select areas 850 that are formed in the hat 800 to
        receive and hold the units 840. For example and as illustrated
        in FIG. 27, each area 850 is in the form of an opening (pore)
        that is formed within the hat 800. The unit 840 has a body 842
        and includes the mechanism 830 and one or more insulated
        electrodes 230. The mechanism 830 is arranged within the unit
        840 so that a portion thereof (e.g., one end thereof) is in
        contact with a face of each insulated electrode 230 such that
        the mechanism 830 applies a biasing force against the face of
        the insulated electrode 230. Once the unit 840 is received
        within the opening 850, it can be securely retained therein
        using any number of conventional techniques, including the use
        of an adhesive material or by using mechanical means. For
        example, the hat 800 can include pivotable clip members that
        pivot between an open position in which the opening 850 is free
        and a closed position in which the pivotable clip members engage
        portions (e.g., peripheral edges) of the insulated electrodes to
        retain and hold the insulated electrodes 230 in place. To remove
        the insulated electrodes 230, the pivotable clip members are
        moved to the open position. In the embodiment illustrated in
        FIG. 28, the insulated electrodes 230 are retained within the
        openings 850 by an adhesive element 860 which in one embodiment
        is a two sided self-adhesive rim member that extends around the
        periphery of the insulated electrode 230. In other words, a
        protective cover of one side of the adhesive rim 860 is removed
        and it is applied around the periphery of the exposed face of
        the insulated electrode 230, thereby securely attaching the
        adhesive rim 860 to the hat 800 and then the other side of the
        adhesive rim 860 is removed for application to the skin surface
        804 in desired locations for positioning and securing the
        insulated electrode 230 to the head 802 with the tumor being
        positioned relative thereto for optimization of the TC fields.
        Since one side of the adhesive rim 860 is in contact with and
        secured to the skin surface 840, this is why it is desirable for
        the head 802 to be shaved so that the adhesive rim 860 can be
        placed flushly against the skin surface 840.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0118] The adhesive rim 860 is designed to securely attach
        the unit 840 within the opening 850 in a manner that permits the
        unit 840 to be easily removed from the hat 800 when necessary
        and then replaced with another unit 840 or with the same unit
        840. As previously mentioned, the unit 840 includes the biasing
        mechanism 830 for pressing the insulated electrode 230 against
        the skin surface 804 when the hat 800 is worn. The unit 840 can
        be constructed so that side opposite the insulated electrode 230
        is a support surface formed of a rigid material, such as
        plastic, so that the biasing mechanism 830 (e.g., a spring) can
        be compressed therewith under the application of force and when
        the spring 830 is in a relaxed state, the spring 830 remains in
        contact with the support surface and the applies a biasing force
        at its other end against the insulated electrode 230. The
        biasing mechanism 830 (e.g., spring) preferably has a contour
        corresponding to the skin surface 804 so that the insulated
        electrode 230 has a force applied thereto to permit the
        insulated electrode 230 to have a contour complementary to the
        skin surface 804, thereby permitting the two to seat flushly
        against one another. While the mechanism 830 can be a spring,
        there are a number of other embodiments that can be used instead
        of a spring. For example, the mechanism 830 can be in the form
        of an elastic material, such as a foam rubber, a foam plastic,
        or a layer containing air bubbles, etc. [0119] The unit 840 has
        an electric connector 870 that can be hooked up to a
        corresponding electric connector, such as a conductor 220, that
        is disposed within the hat 800. The conductor 220 connects at
        one end to the unit 840 and at the other end is connected to the
        generator 210. The generator 210 can be incorporated directly
        into the hat 800 or the generator 210 can be positioned
        separately (remotely) on the patient or on a bedside support,
        etc. [0120] As previously discussed, a coupling agent, such as a
        conductive gel, is preferably used to ensure that an effective
        conductive environment is provided between the insulated
        electrode 230 and the skin surface 804. Suitable gel materials
        have been disclosed hereinbefore in the discussion of earlier
        embodiments. The coupling agent is disposed on the insulated
        electrode 230 and preferably, a uniform layer of the agent is
        provided along the surface of the electrode 230. One of the
        reasons that the units 840 need replacement at periodic times is
        that the coupling agent needs to be replaced and/or replenished.
        In other words, after a predetermined time period or after a
        number of uses, the patient removes the units 840 so that the
        coupling agent can be applied again to the electrode 230.<br>
        <br>
        [0121] FIGS. 29 and 30 illustrate another article of clothing
        which has the insulated electrodes 230 incorporated as part
        thereof. More specifically, a bra or the like 900 is illustrated
        and includes a body that is formed of a traditional bra
        material, generally indicated at 905, to provide shape, support
        and comfort to the wearer. The bra 900 also includes a fabric
        support layer 910 on one side thereof. The support layer 910 is
        preferably formed of a suitable fabric material that is
        constructed to provide necessary and desired support to the bra
        900.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0122] Similar to the other embodiments, the bra 900
        includes one or more insulated electrodes 230 disposed within
        the bra material 905. The one or more insulated electrodes are
        disposed along an inner surface of the bra 900 opposite the
        support 910 and are intended to be placed proximate to a tumor
        or the like that is located within one breast or in the
        immediately surrounding area. As with the previous embodiment,
        the insulated electrodes 230 in this embodiment are specifically
        constructed and configured for application to a breast or the
        immediate area. Thus, the insulated electrodes 230 used in this
        application do not have a planar surface construction but rather
        have an arcuate shape that is complementary to the general
        curvature found in a typical breast.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0123] A lining 920 is disposed across the insulated
        electrodes 230 so as to assist in retaining the insulated
        electrodes in their desired locations along the inner surface
        for placement against the breast itself. The lining 920 can be
        formed of any number of thin materials that are comfortable to
        wear against one's skin and in one exemplary embodiment, the
        lining 920 is formed of a fabric material.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0124] The bra 900 also preferably includes a biasing
        mechanism 1000 as in some of the earlier embodiments. The
        biasing mechanism 1000 is disposed within the bra material 905
        and extends from the support 910 to the insulated electrode 230
        and applies a biasing force to the insulated electrode 230 so
        that the electrode 230 is pressed against the breast. This
        ensures that the insulated electrode 230 remains in contact with
        the skin surface as opposed to lifting away from the skin
        surface, thereby creating a gap that results in a less effective
        treatment since the gap diminishes the efficiency of the TC
        fields. The biasing mechanism 1000 can be in the form of a
        spring arrangement or it can be an elastic material that applies
        the desired biasing force to the insulated electrodes 230 so as
        to press the insulated electrodes 230 into the breast. In the
        relaxed position, the biasing mechanism 1000 applies a force
        against the insulated electrodes 230 and when the patient places
        the bra 900 on their body, the insulated electrodes 230 are
        placed against the breast which itself applies a force that
        counters the biasing force, thereby resulting in the insulated
        electrodes 230 being pressed against the patient's breast. In
        the exemplary embodiment that is illustrated, the biasing
        mechanism 1000 is in the form of springs that are disposed
        within the bra material 905.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0125] A conductive gel 1010 can be provided on the
        insulated electrode 230 between the electrode and the lining
        920. The conductive gel layer 1010 is formed of materials that
        have been previously described herein for performing the
        functions described above.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0126] An electric connector 1020 is provided as part of
        the insulated electrode 230 and electrically connects to the
        conductor 220 at one end thereof, with the other end of the
        conductor 220 being electrically connected to the generator 210.
        In this embodiment, the conductor 220 runs within the bra
        material 905 to a location where an opening is formed in the bra
        900. The conductor 220 extends through this opening and is
        routed to the generator 210, which in this embodiment is
        disposed in a location remote from the bra 900. It will also be
        appreciated that the generator 210 can be disposed within the
        bra 900 itself in another embodiment. For example, the bra 900
        can have a compartment formed therein which is configured to
        receive and hold the generator 210 in place as the patient wears
        the bra 900. In this arrangement, the compartment can be covered
        with a releasable strap that can open and close to permit the
        generator 210 to be inserted therein or removed therefrom. The
        strap can be formed of the same material that is used to
        construct the bra 900 or it can be formed of some other type of
        material. The strap can be releasably attached to the
        surrounding bra body by fastening means, such as a hook and loop
        material, thereby permitting the patient to easily open the
        compartment by separating the hook and loop elements to gain
        access to the compartment for either inserting or removing the
        generator 210. <br>
        <br>
        [0127] The generator 210 also has a connector 211 for electrical
        connection to the conductor 220 and this permits the generator
        210 to be electrically connected to the insulated electrodes
        230.<br>
        <br>
        [0128] As with the other embodiments, the insulated electrodes
        230 are arranged in the bra 900 to focus the electric field (TC
        fields) on the desired target (e.g., a tumor). It will be
        appreciated that the location of the insulated electrodes 230
        within the bra 900 will vary depending upon the location of the
        tumor. In other words, after the tumor has been located, the
        physician will then devise an arrangement of insulated
        electrodes 230 and the bra 900 is constructed in view of this
        arrangement so as to optimize the effects of the TC fields on
        the target area (tumor). The number and position of the
        insulated electrodes 230 will therefore depend upon the precise
        location of the tumor or other target area that is being
        treated. Because the location of the insulated electrodes 230 on
        the bra 900 can vary depending upon the precise application, the
        exact size and shape of the insulated electrodes 230 can
        likewise vary. For example, if the insulated electrodes 230 are
        placed on the bottom section of the bra 900 as opposed to a more
        central location, the insulated electrodes 230 will have
        different shapes since the shape of the breast (as well as the
        bra) differs in these areas. <br>
        <br>
        [0129] FIG. 31 illustrates yet another embodiment in which the
        insulated electrodes 230 are in the form of internal electrodes
        that are incorporated into in the form of a probe or catheter
        1100 that is configured to enter the body through a natural
        pathway, such as the urethra, vagina, etc. In this embodiment,
        the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed on an outer surface of
        the probe 1100 and along a length thereof. The conductors 220
        are electrically connected to the electrodes 230 and run within
        the body of the probe 1100 to the generator 210 which can be
        disposed within the probe body or the generator 210 can be
        disposed independent of the probe 1100 in a remote location,
        such as on the patient or at some other location close to the
        patient.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0130] Alternatively, the probe 1100 can be configured to
        penetrate the skin surface or other tissue to reach an internal
        target that lies within the body. For example, the probe 1100
        can penetrate the skin surface and then be positioned adjacent
        to or proximate to a tumor that is located within the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0131] In these embodiments, the probe 1100 is inserted through
        the natural pathway and then is positioned in a desired location
        so that the insulated electrodes 230 are disposed near the
        target area (i.e., the tumor). The generator 210 is then
        activated to cause the insulated electrodes 230 to generate the
        TC fields which are applied to the tumor for a predetermined
        length of time. It will be appreciated that the illustrated
        probe 1100 is merely exemplary in nature and that the probe 1100
        can have other shapes and configurations so long as they can
        perform the intended function. Preferably, the conductors (e.g.,
        wires) leading from the insulated electrodes 230 to the
        generator 210 are twisted or shielded so as not to generate a
        field along the shaft.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0132] It will further be appreciated that the probes can
        contain only one insulated electrode while the other can be
        positioned on the body surface. This external electrode should
        be larger or consist of numerous electrodes so as to result in
        low lines of force-current density so as not to affect the
        untreated areas. In fact, the placing of electrodes should be
        designed to minimize the field at potentially sensitive areas.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0133] FIG. 32 illustrates yet another embodiment in which
        a high standing collar member 1200 (or necklace type structure)
        can be used to treat thyroid, parathyroid, laryngeal lesions,
        etc. FIG. 32 illustrates the collar member 1200 in an unwrapped,
        substantially flat condition. In this embodiment, the insulated
        electrodes 230 are incorporated into a body 1210 of the collar
        member 1200 and are configured for placement against a neck area
        of the wearer. The insulated electrodes 230 are coupled to the
        generator 210 according to any of the manner described
        hereinbefore and it will be appreciated that the generator 210
        can be disposed within the body 1210 or it can be disposed in a
        location external to the body 1210. The collar body 1210 can be
        formed of any number of materials that are traditionally used to
        form collars 1200 that are disposed around a person's neck. As
        such, the collar 1200 preferably includes a means 1220 for
        adjusting the collar 1200 relative to the neck. For example,
        complementary fasteners (hook and loop fasteners, buttons, etc.)
        can be disposed on ends of the collar 1200 to permit adjustment
        of the collar diameter. It will be appreciated that one can
        extend this exemplary structure to accommodate any tubular part
        of the body, e.g., a limb, etc.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0134] FIGS. 33 and 34 illustrate yet another embodiment
        of the present device. In FIG. 33, a pair of electrodes 230 are
        arranged about a torso 1300. The electrodes 230 are operated in
        the same manner as was previously described and in this
        embodiment, the electrodes 230 are arranged so that the electric
        field passes through the heart and its surrounding area.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0135] The present inventor has thus appreciated that the
        above described TC fields that stop cell proliferation can be
        used to prevent restenosis of arteries after angioplasty, with
        or without introduction of stents. This also applies for other
        body tubing, such as urethra. The coronary restenosis which
        follows 20-30% of stenting, etc., is a major problem. The
        restenosis is due to the cellular reaction of the arterial wall
        and the resulting cell proliferation. This proliferation grows
        into the artery from its ends and on top of it, there is
        sedimentation, etc., that occludes the artery. The conditions
        for the effect of the TC fields are good as the stent is usually
        a bare metal conductor (but not necessarily) that will result in
        field intensification exactly where it is needed. The TC fields
        should be applied for 3-8 weeks to prevent the stenosis. <br>
        <br>
        [0136] As shown in FIGS. 33 and 34, the electrodes 230 are
        arranged about the torso 1300 so that the TC fields, indicated
        by field lines 1310, passes through the heart region 1320. A
        coronary artery 1330 is illustrated within the heart region 1320
        and within the TC fields. One or more stents 1340 are disposed
        within the coronary artery 1330 as part of the surgical
        procedure. One of the results of the angioplasty and mainly due
        to the presence of the stents 1340 is a proliferation of a mass
        of cells 1350 that is located along the artery wall. Since the
        stent 1340 acts as a conductor, the area around the stent 1340
        is an area of high density electric field due to the presence of
        the stent 1340. The stent 1340 does not necessarily have to be a
        bare metal conductor and the present method of treatment can be
        used without stents 1340 so long as the mass of proliferating
        cells 1350 is disposed within the area of the high density
        electric field.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0137] Thus, the construction of the present devices are
        particularly well suited for applications where the devices are
        incorporated into articles of clothing to permit the patient to
        easily wear a traditional article of clothing while at the same
        time the patient undergoes treatment. In other words, an extra
        level of comfort can be provided to the patient and the
        effectiveness of the treatment can be increased by incorporating
        some or all of the device components into the article of
        clothing. The precise article of clothing that the components
        are incorporated into will obviously vary depending upon the
        target area of the living tissue where tumor, lesion or the like
        exists. For example, if the target area is in the testicle area
        of a male patient, then an article of clothing in the form of a
        sock-like structure or wrap can be provided and is configured to
        be worn around the testicle area of the patient in such a manner
        that the insulated electrodes thereof are positioned relative to
        the tumor such that the TC fields are directed at the target
        tissue. The precise nature or form of the article of clothing
        can vary greatly since the device components can be incorporated
        into most types of articles of clothing and therefore, can be
        used to treat any number of different areas of the patient's
        body where a condition may be present. <br>
        <br>
        [0138] The present invention is thus for an apparatus and method
        for optimizing the selective destruction of dividing cells by
        calculating the spatial and temporal distribution of the
        electric fields for optimal treatment of a specific patient with
        a specific tumor, taking into account its location and
        characteristics of all components of the system. An optimal
        field map is generated by calculating and computing an electric
        field in terms of its strength and other characteristics for a
        given arrangement of electrodes and based on other inputted
        information, such as tumor type. This calculation can be done by
        a controller or other device, such as an integrated personal
        computer, and additional calculations are conducted for
        different arrangement of electrodes relative to the target area
        (tumor) and/or different voltages for the electrodes. Standard
        optimization methods are used to determine the optimal minimal
        field map. It is therefore desirable that the optimum field map
        not only includes a maximum electric field at the target area
        (tumor) but also that there be a maximal field strength
        difference between the electric field at the target tissue and
        the surrounding tissue that is to be protected. It will
        therefore be appreciated that the optimal field may not
        necessarily be one that has the highest electric field strength
        focused at the targeted area but it may be one where the
        electric field strength is less but the difference in field
        strength between the target area and the surrounding areas is at
        a maximum. In other words, the present method optimizes the
        correlation between the calculated electric field and the
        desired electric field (the previously calculated optimal field
        map). For optimization, standard techniques can be used, such as
        the Nelder-Mead simplex method.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0139] As used herein, the term "tumor" refers to a
        malignant tissue comprising transformed cells that grow
        uncontrollably. Tumors include leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas,
        plasmacytomas, and the like; and solid tumors. Examples of solid
        tumors that can be treated according to the invention include
        sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to:
        fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma,
        osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma,
        lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma,
        mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
        colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian
        cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell
        carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous
        gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas,
        cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma,
        renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma,
        choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor,
        cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell
        lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma,
        astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma,
        pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma,
        oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and
        retinoblastoma. Because each of these tumors undergoes rapid
        growth, any one can be treated in accordance with the invention.
        The invention is particularly advantageous for treating brain
        tumors, which are difficult to treat with surgery and radiation,
        and often inaccessible to chemotherapy or gene therapies. In
        addition, the present invention is suitable for use in treating
        skin and breast tumors because of the ease of localized
        treatment provided by the present invention.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0140] In addition, the present invention can control
        uncontrolled growth associated with non-malignant or
        pre-malignant conditions, and other disorders involving
        inappropriate cell or tissue growth by application of an
        electric field in accordance with the invention to the tissue
        undergoing inappropriate growth. For example, it is contemplated
        that the invention is useful for the treatment of arteriovenous
        (AV) malformations, particularly in intracranial sites. The
        invention may also be used to treat psoriasis, a dermatologic
        condition that is characterized by inflammation and vascular
        proliferation; and benign prostatic hypertrophy, a condition
        associated with inflammation and possibly vascular
        proliferation. Treatment of other hyperproliferative disorders
        is also contemplated.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0141] Furthermore, undesirable fibroblast and endothelial
        cell proliferation associated with wound healing, leading to
        scar and keloid formation after surgery or injury, and
        restenosis after angioplasty or placement of coronary stents can
        be inhibited by application of an electric field in accordance
        with the present invention. The non-invasive nature of this
        invention makes it particularly desirable for these types of
        conditions, particularly to prevent development of internal
        scars and adhesions, or to inhibit restenosis of coronary,
        carotid, and other important arteries. <br>
        <br>
        [0142] Thus, the present invention provides an effective, simple
        method of selectively destroying dividing cells, e.g., tumor
        cells and parasitic organisms, while non-dividing cells or
        organisms are left affected by application of the method on
        living tissue containing both types of cells or organisms. Thus,
        unlike many of the conventional methods, the present invention
        does not damage the normal cells or organisms. In addition, the
        present invention does not discriminate based upon cell type
        (e.g., cells having differing sizes) and therefore may be used
        to treat any number of types of sizes having a wide spectrum of
        characteristics, including varying dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0143] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the
        art that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments
        described thus far with reference to the accompanying drawing.
        Rather the present invention is limited only by the following
        claims. ==<br>

        shown in FIG. 1A, and a 100 kHz AC signal is applied to the
        electrodes. Preferably, the insulated electrodes have a
        conductive core and an insulating layer with a high dielectric
        constant as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,868,289, and they are
        configured to contact the surface of the body with the
        insulating layer disposed between the conductive core and the
        surface of the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] FIG. 1B, (like all the other field intensity maps
        included herein) shows the field intensity in mV/cm when 1 Volt
        AC (measured zero-to-peak) is induced between the proximal side
        of the tissue just beneath the first electrode and the proximal
        side of the tissue just beneath the second electrode (by
        applying a sufficiently large voltage between the electrodes'
        terminals). The numbers along the x and y axes in the main
        section of FIG. 1B (and in the other field intensity maps
        included herein) represent distance measured in cm. Each contour
        line represents a constant step size down from the 1 V peak, and
        the units are given in mV/cm. Note, however, that because the
        voltage changes so rapidly at the higher values, the contour
        lines run together to form what appears to be a solid black
        region. <br>
        <br>
        [0006] It is seen in FIG. 1B that, both in the air above the
        skin 15 and the tissue below the skin 15, the field intensity is
        maximal in regions that are close to the edges of the electrodes
        11, 11' and that the field intensity is attenuated rapidly with
        distance. As a result, if a tumor lies relatively deep below the
        skin 15, it may be difficult to deliver the desired field
        strength that is needed for effective treatment to that tumor to
        the target region. <br>
        <br>
        [0007] A similar situation exists in the human head. FIG. 2 is a
        schematic representation of a human head 5 in which all tissue
        components are given their corresponding electric properties.
        The head includes skin 1, bone 2, gray matter 3 and white matter
        4. FIG. 3A is a schematic representation of the positioning of
        the electrodes 11, 11' on the skin surface on the same side of
        the head, and FIG. 3A shows the electric field that is generated
        under those conditions when a 100 kHz AC field is applied
        between the electrodes. (The field calculation was done by a
        finite element simulation based on the schematic representation
        of the head shown in FIG. 2.) The field intensity is highest in
        the vicinity of the electrodes in the skin and the superficial
        areas of the brain and drops rapidly. Notably, the field
        strength near the middle of the head is very weak (i.e., less
        than 20 mV/cm). <br>
        <br>
        [0008] FIG. 4A is a schematic representation of the positioning
        of the electrodes 11, 11' on opposite sides of a human head, and
        FIG. 4B shows the electric field that is generated under those
        conditions when a 100 kHz AC field is applied between the
        electrodes. Once again, the field calculation was done by a
        finite element simulation, and once again, the field strength
        near the middle of the head is very weak (i.e., less than 24
        mV/cm). The field intensity is highest in the vicinity of the
        electrodes in the skin and the superficial areas of the brain
        and drops rapidly, so that the field intensity is relatively low
        at the center of the head. Thus, the treatment efficacy of the
        field for any tumor or lesion at a distance from the surface or
        electrodes would be correspondingly diminished. \<br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0009] A biocompatible field guide is positioned between the
        surface of the body and the target region beneath the surface.
        Electrodes are positioned on either side of the field guide, and
        an AC voltage with an appropriate frequency and amplitude is
        applied between the electrodes so that the field guide routes
        the electric field to the target region. In an alternative
        embodiment, one of the electrodes is positioned directly on top
        of the field guide. <br>

        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
          EMBODIMENTS </span><br>
        <br>
        [0037] The inventor has recognized that the field can be guided
        to the desired location in the patient's body using appropriate
        field guides.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0038] In some embodiments of the invention, an insulating
        member is introduced into the medium or tissue in a position
        that enables the member to act as a Field Guide (FG) in the
        given medium. While elongated shapes such as rods, tubes, bars,
        or threads are preferred, other shapes (e.g., sheets or plates)
        may also be used. In these embodiments, the electric impedance
        of the FG, ZFG is significantly higher than that of the medium
        ZFG (ZFG&gt;&gt;ZM). For example, the FG may be made of a
        dielectric insulating material such as plastic (e.g.
        polystyrene, PVC, Teflon), silicone, rubber, etc., while the
        medium is tissue (e.g., muscle). Insulators with a very high
        dielectric constant (see the electrode insulations of the '289
        patent) may be preferable to those with low dielectric
        properties. For use in medical application, the FG should
        preferably be made of a biocompatible material. Optionally, the
        FG may be made of a biodegradable material, as long as the
        electrical properties remain as described herein.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] FIGS. 5A and 5B are section and plan views of a first
        embodiment in which an insulated rod 12 is inserted into tissue
        10 between a pair of insulated electrodes 11, 11'. The upper end
        of the FG rod 12 is positioned just under the skin 15. The
        preferred diameter for the rod is between about 0.5 mm and about
        10 mm, but diameters outside of that range may also be used.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;[0040] FIG. 6A shows a finite element simulation of the
        electric field that is generated in the tissue when a 5 cm long,
        3 mm diameter, insulated FG rod 12a made of solid plastic with
        an impedance between 4-6 orders of magnitude higher than the
        impedance of the tissue and a dielectric constant of about 2-3
        is inserted into the tissue 10 between the pair of insulated
        electrodes 11, 11'. The upper (proximal) ends of the electrodes
        are located on the skin surface, and a 100 kHz AC voltage is
        applied between the electrodes. FIG. 6B is a magnified portion
        of the center of FIG. 6A, to show the field in greater detail.
        As seen in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the strength of the field is much
        higher just below the rod 12a. Thus, by inserting the FG so that
        it sits right above the desired target location, the field is
        directed to the desired location, along with the corresponding
        beneficial effects of that field (as described in the '289
        patent).<br>
        <br>
        [0041] The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment,
        except that a hollow insulated rod 12b is used in place of the
        solid insulated rod 12a of the first embodiment. The rod in this
        example has an outer diameter of 3 mm and an inner diameter of
        2.5 mm, and is also 5 cm long. FIG. 7A shows a finite element
        simulation of the electric field for this second embodiment, and
        FIG. 7B shows a magnified view of the center of FIG. 7A. Here
        again, the strength of the field is much higher just below the
        rod. We therefore see that a hollow insulating FG can also be
        used to direct the field to a desired location.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] Optionally, conductive gel may be placed on the surface
        of the skin in the region between the insulated electrodes. FIG.
        8A shows a finite element simulation of the electric field for
        the second embodiment (using the hollow insulated rod 12b) when
        conductive gel 42 is spread on the skin between the electrodes
        11, 11', and FIG. 8B shows a magnified view of the center of
        FIG. 8A. Here again, the strength of the field is much higher
        just below the rod. In addition, the field is also stronger in
        the region between the electrodes just below the surface of the
        skin 15 beneath the gel 42. Note that the conductive gel
        described in connection with this embodiment may also be used in
        the other embodiments described herein, with similar results.
        [0043] In a third embodiment, a hollow conducting rod is used
        instead of the hollow insulating rod of the second embodiment.
        In this third embodiment, the electric impedance of the FG, ZFG
        is significantly lower than that of the medium ZM (ZFG&lt;<zm).

          [0021] In patients, in the present invention the preventive
          treatment is achieved by means of at least one set (pair) of
          electrodes, preferably two or more sets. The electrodes are
          connected to a waveform generator and amplifier so as to
          generate TTFields in the patient. Electrodes specifically
          designed for long term application without eliciting severe
          side effects and without causing patient discomfort and having
          minimal interference with the normal everyday activities of
          the patient are preferred. The placement of the electrodes is
          made so as to generate the desired field at the location or
          locations where the chances for tumor appearance are
          statistically high. In the case that a primary tumor is also
          present, the placement is preferably made so as to cover all
          tumors. Alternatively, for the presence, or projected presence
          of more than one tumor, additional sets of electrodes can be
          activated simultaneously. In such a case, it is preferable
          that the different sets of electrodes be connected to
          different generators which are isolated from one another.
          Isolation can be achieved by separate voltage sources
          (batteries) or, for example, by using isolation transformers.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0022] FIG. 1 is a timeline of an alternative approach,
          in which the different sets of electrodes are positioned to
          treat different parts of the patient and are energized
          sequentially in a time-multiplexed manner. In the illustrated
          timeline, the primary tumor is treated in the first time slot
          12 and the remote sites where metastases are likely to appear
          (e.g., the liver and lungs) are treated in the second and
          third time slots 14, 16, respectively. After all relevant
          regions have been treated, the three-part cycle is repeated.
          For example, the field could be applied to the primary tumor
          for one second, then to the liver for one second, then to
          lungs for one second, after which the three-part cycle is
          repeated for the desired period of treatment. Optionally,
          breaks may be included in the cycles of treatment. For
          example, the field could be applied to the primary tumor for
          1-3 days, then to the liver for 1-3 days, then to the lungs
          for 1-3 days, then removed for 1-3 days, after which the
          four-part cycle is repeated for the desired period of
          treatment.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0023] Since the various regions are treated
          sequentially when this approach is used, a single field
          generator can be used for all the sets of electrodes, and
          isolation transformers are not required. Optionally, the field
          may be applied in each time slot with a plurality of
          orientations and/or a plurality of frequencies, as described
          in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/111,439, filed Apr. 21,
          2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0024] One example of a suitable electrode designed for
          comfortable long term use is shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, with
          FIG. 2a being an plan view of a flexible electrode patch 20
          and FIG. 2b being a detailed crossed section view the flexible
          electrode patch 20 along lines B-B. In this embodiment, the
          flexible electrode patch 20 is actually a composite of many
          small electrodes 40 that are mounted on a flexible substrate
          22. The flexibility of the substrate 22 and the use of
          relatively small electrodes 40 helps provide flexibility,
          which allows the patch 20 to fit the relevant body curvature.
          Optionally, perforations 26 may be provided in the substrate
          to permit the skin beneath the substrate 22 to "breathe". In
          some embodiments, the material of the substrate 22 is selected
          so that it can be cut to a desired shape to fit the skin area
          to which the flexible patch 20 will be applied. <br>
          <br>
          [0025] Depending on the location within the body that is being
          treated, one or more of the flexible electrode patches 20
          would be used. For example, to treat a shallow melanoma, a
          single patch can be used, with the field being induced by
          applying an appropriate voltage between different electrodes
          40 within the single patch 20. For deeper sites in the body,
          two or more patches 20 would preferably be placed on opposing
          sides of the site, and all the electrodes on any given patch
          would be wired together in parallel. An appropriate driving
          signal would then be applied between the various patches 20.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0026] FIG. 2b shows a detailed cross-section of the
          flexible electrode patch 20 in which all the electrodes 40 on
          the patch are wired in parallel, depicted in cross-section. In
          this embodiment, the substrate is made of a preferably
          conductive flexible layer 32 mounted beneath a flexible
          insulating layer 30. Suitable materials for the conductive
          layer 32 include conductive rubber, graphite, thin flexible
          metal sheets such as copper or aluminum, etc.; and suitable
          materials for the flexible insulating layer 30 include rubber,
          silicon, Teflon and polyethylene vinyl. A lead 38 is wired in
          electrical contact with the conductive flexible layer 32 to
          facilitate application of the appropriate AC signals to each
          patch 20.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0027] The cross-section view of FIG. 2b depicts
          electrodes 40 separated by insulators 34, which are preferably
          made of a flexible insulating material such as silicon rubber,
          vinyl, polyurethane, etc. In the illustrated embodiment, each
          electrode 40 includes conductive core 42 made of, for example,
          metal or conductive rubber, and a thin dielectric layer 46.
          Preferably, the dielectric layer is very thin (e.g., 0.1 mm)
          and has a very high dielectric constant (e.g., greater than
          1000, or more preferably greater than 5000). Preferably, one
          layer of conductive adhesive 44 is provided between the core
          42 and the conductive layer 32, and another layer of
          conductive adhesive 45 is provided between the core 42 and the
          dielectric layer 46.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0028] Optionally, the portions of the insulator 34 that
          contact the patient's body may be coated with a biocompatible
          adhesive 36 to help the patch 20 adhere to the patient's body.
          A conductive layer 48 is preferably provided between the
          dielectric 46 and the patient's body to improve the electrical
          contact with the patient's body. Examples of suitable
          materials for this conductive layer 48 include conductive gels
          and carbon (graphite) powders, which maybe imbedded in a
          suitable cream (e.g. a cosmetic base with an electrolyte).
          Graphite has the advantage in that it has a much higher
          electric conductance, as compared with gels, and that it is
          inert and has extremely high biocompatibility. Optionally, a
          suitable adhesive may be included in the conductive layer 48
          to help the patch 20 adhere to the patient's body. A number of
          alternative electrode configurations are described in U.S.
          patent application Ser. No. 11/294,780, filed Dec. 5, 2005,
          which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0029] The TTFields generated in the target regions are
          preferably in the order of 1-10 V/cm and the field frequency
          is preferably 100-300 kHz for certain types of cancers (e.g.,
          certain gliomas and melanomas) and may be outside that range
          for other types of cancer, as described in the applications
          referenced above. The electrodes can be incorporated into
          articles of clothing so as to provide maximal comfort to the
          patient, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,868,289, which is
          also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0030] FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a process for using the
          above-described approaches to treat patients. The process
          begins in step 60, where information about the patient is
          obtained. This information should preferably include racial
          information and a family history that is sufficient to
          evaluate genetic risk of developing cancer, as well as
          personal history indicating whether the patient has or is
          suspected to have a tumor that may generate metastases.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;[0031] In step 62, the process flow diverges depending
          on whether the patient is known to have a metastatic tumor. If
          the patient has a metastatic tumor, process flow continues at
          step 64, where the location or locations where metastases are
          expected to develop and the time frame when such metastasis
          may develop are determined. For example, metastases commonly
          develop in the lungs from certain types of melanomas, and in
          the liver, brain, or bone for certain other types of cancers.
          The process flow then continues in step 66, where the way to
          get the desired beneficial electrical fields to the locations
          identified in step 64 is computed (or, in alternative
          embodiments, estimated). This may be accomplished by running
          computer simulations to identify the type, size, and shape of
          the electrodes that should be used, the positions to place
          those electrodes, and the voltages that should be applied to
          those electrodes in order to induce the desired fields at the
          identified locations. The process flow then continues in step
          68, where suitable electrodes for generating the desired
          fields are constructed. Finally, in step 70, the electrodes
          are applied to the patient's body and stimulated with
          appropriate voltages in order to generate the desired fields
          in the locations identified previously in step 64. <br>
          <br>
          [0032] If, back in step 62, it turns out that the patient
          being evaluated does not have metastatic tumor, the process
          flow continues at step 80 where, based on the patient data
          that was entered in step 60, a determination is made as to
          whether the patient is at a high risk for developing cancer.
          If the patient's risk of developing cancer is not too high,
          the process stops (and the patient is not treated). If, on the
          other hand, it is determined that that patient's risk of
          developing cancer is sufficiently high, process flow continues
          at step 82, where the location or locations where cancer is
          likely to develop are determined. For example, patients with a
          strong family history of breast cancer or a genetic marker
          that is correlated with breast cancer, the determined location
          would be the breasts. The process then proceeds to step 66,
          and continues from there as described above.<br>

          &nbsp;[0033] Note that the above-described treatment may be
          advantageously combined with other cancer treatments such as
          surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc. It may also be
          convenient to implement the above-described treatment using
          electrodes that are integrated into articles of clothing
          (e.g., a bra or a hat) as described in U.S. Pat. No.

            <br>
            &nbsp;[0002] This invention concerns selective destruction
            of rapidly dividing cells in a localized area, and more
            particularly, selectively destroying dividing cells without
            destroying nearby non-dividing cells by applying an electric
            field with specific characteristics to a target area in a
            living patient. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND </span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0003] All living organisms proliferate by cell division,
            including cell cultures, microorganisms (such as bacteria,
            mycoplasma, yeast, protozoa, and other single-celled
            organisms), fungi, algae, plant cells, etc. Dividing cells
            of organisms can be destroyed, or their proliferation
            controlled, by methods that are based on the sensitivity of
            the dividing cells of these organisms to certain agents. For
            example, certain antibiotics stop the multiplication process
            of bacteria.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;[0004] The process of eukaryotic cell division is
            called "mitosis", which involves nice distinct phases (see
            Darnell et al. , Molecular Cell Biology, New York:
            Scientific American Books, 1986, p. 149). During interphase,
            the cell replicates chromosomal DNA, which begins condensing
            in early prophase. At this point, centrioles (each cell
            contains 2) begin moving towards opposite poles of the cell.
            In middle prophase, each chromosome is composed of duplicate
            chromatids. Microtubular spindles radiate from regions
            adjacent to the centrioles, which are closer to their poles.
            By late prophase, the centrioles have reached the poles, and
            some spindle fibers extend to the center of the cell, while
            others extend from the poles to the <desc clms="" page=""
              number="" 2=""> chromatids. The cells then move into
              metaphase, when the chromosomes move toward the equator of
              the cell and align in the equatorial plane. Next is early
              anaphase, during which time daughter chromatids separate
              from each other at the equator by moving along the spindle
              fibers toward a centromere at opposite poles. The cell
              begins to elongate along the axis of the pole; the
              pole-to-pole spindles also elongate. Late anaphase occurs
              when the daughter chromosomes (as they are now called)
              each reach their respective opposite poles. At this point,
              cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow begins to form
              at the equator of the cell. In other words, late anaphase
              is the point at which pinching the cell membrane begins.
              During telophase, cytokinesis is nearly complete and
              spindles disappear. Only a relatively narrow membrane
              connection joins the two cytoplasms. Finally, the
              membranes separate fully, cytokinesis is complete and the
              cell returns to interphase.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;[0005] In meiosis, the cell undergoes a second
              division, involving separation of sister chromosomes to
              opposite poles of the cell along spindle fibers, followed
              by formation of a cleavage furrow and cell division.
              However, this division is not preceded by chromosome
              replication, yielding a haploid germ cell. Bacteria also
              divide by chromosome replication, followed by cell
              separation. However, since the daughter chromosomes
              separate by attachment to membrane components; there is no
              visible apparatus that contributes to cell division as in
              eukaryotic cells.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;[0006] It is well known that tumors, particularly
              malignant or cancerous tumors, grow uncontrollably
              compared to normal tissue. Such expedited growth enables
              tumors to occupy an ever-increasing space and to damage or
              destroy tissue adjacent thereto. Furthermore, certain
              cancers are characterized by an ability to transmit
              cancerous "seeds", including single cells or small cell
              clusters (metastases), to new locations where the
              metastatic cancer cells grow into additional tumors.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;[0007] The rapid growth of tumors, in general, and
              malignant tumors in particular, as described above, is the
              result of relatively frequent cell division or
              multiplication of these cells compared to normal tissue
              cells. The distinguishably frequent cell division of
              cancer cells is the basis for the effectiveness of
              existing cancer treatments, e. g., irradiation therapy and
              the use of various chemo-therapeutic agents. Such
              treatments are based on the fact that cells undergoing
              division are more sensitive to radiation and
              chemo-therapeutic agents than non-dividing cells. Because
              tumors cells divide much more frequently than normal
              cells, it is possible, to a certain extent, to selectively
              damage or destroy tumor cells by radiation therapy <desc
                clms="" page="" number="" 3=""> and/or chemotherapy. The
                actual sensitivity of cells to radiation, therapeutic
                agents, etc. , is also dependent on specific
                characteristics of different types of normal or
                malignant cell types. Thus, unfortunately, the
                sensitivity of tumor cells is not sufficiently higher
                than that many types of normal tissues. This diminishes
                the ability to distinguish between tumor cells and
                normal cells, and therefore, existing cancer treatments
                typically cause significant damage to normal tissues,
                thus limiting the therapeutic effectiveness of such
                treatments. Furthermore, the inevitable damage to other
                tissue renders treatments very traumatic to the patients
                and, often, patients are unable to recover from a
                seemingly successful treatment. Also, certain types of
                tumors are not sensitive at all to existing methods of
                treatment.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;[0008] There are also other methods for destroying
                cells that do not rely on radiation therapy or
                chemotherapy alone. For example, ultrasonic and
                electrical methods for destroying tumor cells can be
                used in addition to or instead of conventional
                treatments. Electric fields and currents have been used
                for medical purposes for many years. The most common is
                the generation of electric currents in a human or animal
                body by application of an electric field by means of a
                pair of conductive electrodes between which a potential
                difference is maintained. These electric currents are
                used either to exert their specific effects, i. e., to
                stimulate excitable tissue, or to generate heat by
                flowing in the body since it acts as a resistor.
                Examples of the first type of application include the
                following: cardiac defibrillators, peripheral nerve and
                muscle stimulators, brain stimulators, etc. Currents are
                used for heating, for example, in devices for tumor
                ablation, ablation of malfunctioning cardiac or brain
                tissue, cauterization, relaxation of muscle rheumatic
                pain and other pain, etc. <br>
                <br>
                [0009] Another use of electric fields for medical
                purposes involves the utilization of high frequency
                oscillating fields transmitted from a source that emits
                an electric wave, such as an RF wave or a microwave
                source that is directed at the part of the body that is
                of interest (i. e., target). In these instances, there
                is no electric energy conduction between the source and
                the body; but rather, the energy is transmitted to the
                body by radiation or induction. More specifically, the
                electric energy generated by the source reaches the
                vicinity of the body via a conductor and is transmitted
                from it through air or some other electric insulating
                material to the human body.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;[0010] In a conventional electrical method,
                electrical current is delivered to a region of the
                target tissue using electrodes that are placed in
                contact with the body of the patient. The applied
                electrical current destroys substantially all cells in
                the vicinity of the target <desc clms="" page=""
                  number="" 4=""> tissue. Thus, this type of electrical
                  method does not discriminate between different types
                  of cells within the target tissue and results in the
                  destruction of both tumor cells and normal cells.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;[0011] Electric fields that can be used in
                  medical applications can thus be separated generally
                  into two different modes. In the first mode, the
                  electric fields are applied to the body or tissues by
                  means of conducting electrodes. These electric fields
                  can be separated into two types, namely (1) steady
                  fields or fields that change at relatively slow rates,
                  and alternating fields of low frequencies that induce
                  corresponding electric currents in the body or
                  tissues, and (2) high frequency alternating fields
                  (above 1 MHz) applied to the body by means of the
                  conducting electrodes. In the second mode, the
                  electric fields are high frequency alternating fields
                  applied to the body by means of insulated electrodes.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;[0012] The first type of electric field is used,
                  for example, to stimulate nerves and muscles, pace the
                  heart, etc. In fact, such fields are used in nature to
                  propagate signals in nerve and muscle fibers, central
                  nervous system (CNS), heart, etc. The recording of
                  such natural fields is the basis for the ECG, EEG,
                  EMG, ERG, etc. The field strength in these
                  applications, assuming a medium of homogenous electric
                  properties, is simply the voltage applied to the
                  stimulating/recording electrodes divided by the
                  distance between them. These currents can be
                  calculated by Ohm's law and can have dangerous
                  stimulatory effects on the heart and CNS and can
                  result in potentially harmful ion concentration
                  changes. Also, if the currents are strong enough, they
                  can cause excessive heating in the tissues. This
                  heating can be calculated by the power dissipated in
                  the tissue (the product of the voltage and the
                  current). <br>
                  <br>
                  [0013] When such electric fields and currents are
                  alternating, their stimulatory power, on nerve,
                  muscle, etc. , is an inverse function of the
                  frequency. At frequencies above 1-10 KHz, the
                  stimulation power of the fields approaches zero. This
                  limitation is due to the fact that excitation induced
                  by electric stimulation is normally mediated by
                  membrane potential changes, the rate of which is
                  limited by the RC properties (time constants on the
                  order of 1 ms) of the membrane.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;[0014] Regardless of the frequency, when such
                  current inducing fields are applied, they are
                  associated with harmful side effects caused by
                  currents. For example, one negative effect is the
                  changes in ionic concentration in the various
                  "compartments" within the system, and the harmful
                  products of the electrolysis taking place at the
                  electrodes, or the medium in <desc clms="" page=""
                    number="" 5=""> which the tissues are imbedded. The
                    changes in ion concentrations occur whenever the
                    system includes two or more compartments between
                    which the organism maintains ion concentration
                    differences. For example, for most tissues, [Ca@] in
                    the extracellular fluid is about 2#10-3 M, while in
                    the cytoplasm of typical cells its concentration can
                    be as low as 10-7 M. A current induced in such a
                    system by a pair of electrodes, flows in part from
                    the extracellular fluid into the cells and out again
                    into the extracellular medium. About 2% of the
                    current flowing into the cells is carried by the Ca@
                    ions. In contrast, because the concentration of
                    intracellular Ca@ is much smaller, only a negligible
                    fraction of the currents that exits the cells is
                    carried by these ions. Thus, Ca++ ions accumulate in
                    the cells such that their concentrations in the
                    cells increases, while the concentration in the
                    extracellular compartment may decrease. These
                    effects are observed for both DC and alternating
                    currents (AC). The rate of accumulation of the ions
                    depends on the current intensity ion mobilities,
                    membrane ion conductance, etc. An increase in [Ca++]
                    is harmful to most cells and if sufficiently high
                    will lead to the destruction of the cells. Similar
                    considerations apply to other ions. In view of the
                    above observations, long term current application to
                    living organisms or tissues can result in
                    significant damage. Another major problem that is
                    associated with such electric fields, is due to the
                    electrolysis process that takes place at the
                    electrode surfaces. Here charges are transferred
                    between the metal (electrons) and the electrolytic
                    solution (ions) such that charged active radicals
                    are formed. These can cause significant damage to
                    organic molecules, especially macromolecules and
                    thus damage the living cells and tissues.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;[0015] In contrast, when high frequency
                    electric fields, above 1 MHz and usually in practice
                    in the range of GHz, are induced in tissues by means
                    of insulated electrodes, the situation is quite
                    different. These type of fields generate only
                    capacitive or displacement currents, rather than the
                    conventional charge conducting currents. Under the
                    effect of this type of field, living tissues behave
                    mostly according to their dielectric properties
                    rather than their electric conductive properties.
                    Therefore, the dominant field effect is that due to
                    dielectric losses and heating. Thus, it is widely
                    accepted that in practice, the meaningful effects of
                    such fields on living organisms, are only those due
                    to their heating effects, i. e., due to dielectric
                    losses.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;[0016] In U. S. Pat. No. 6,043,066 ('066) to
                    Mangano, a method and device are presented which
                    enable discrete objects having a conducting inner
                    core, surrounded by a dielectric membrane to be
                    selectively inactivated by electric fields via
                    irreversible breakdown of their dielectric membrane.
                    One potential application for this is in the
                    selection and purging <desc clms="" page=""
                      number="" 6=""> of certain biological cells in a
                      suspension. According to the '066 patent, an
                      electric field is applied for targeting selected
                      cells to cause breakdown of the dielectric
                      membranes of these tumor cells, while purportedly
                      not adversely affecting other desired
                      subpopulations of cells. The cells are selected on
                      the basis of intrinsic or induced differences in a
                      characteristic electroporation threshold. The
                      differences in this threshold can depend upon a
                      number of parameters, including the difference in
                      cell size.<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;[0017] The method of the '066 patent is
                      therefore based on the assumption that the
                      electroporation threshold of tumor cells is
                      sufficiently distinguishable from that of normal
                      cells because of differences in cell size and
                      differences in the dielectric properties of the
                      cell membranes. Based upon this assumption, the
                      larger size of many types of tumor cells makes
                      these cells more susceptible to electroporation
                      and thus, it may be possible to selectively damage
                      only the larger tumor cell membranes by applying
                      an appropriate electric field. One disadvantage of
                      this method is that the ability to discriminate is
                      highly dependent upon cell type, for example, the
                      size difference between normal cells and tumor
                      cells is significant only in certain types of
                      cells. Another drawback of this method is that the
                      voltages which are applied can damage some of the
                      normal cells and may not damage all of the tumor
                      cells because the differences in size and membrane
                      dielectric properties are largely statistical and
                      the actual cell geometries and dielectric
                      properties can vary significantly.<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;[0018] What is needed in the art and has
                      heretofore not been available is an apparatus for
                      destroying dividing cells, wherein the apparatus
                      better discriminates between dividing cells,
                      including single-celled organisms, and
                      non-dividing cells and is capable of selectively
                      destroying the dividing cells or organisms with
                      substantially no effect on the non-dividing cells
                      or organisms.<br>

                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;SUMMARY</span><br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;[0019] While they are dividing, cells are
                      vulnerable to damage by AC electric fields that
                      have specific frequency and field strength
                      characteristics. The selective destruction of
                      rapidly dividing cells can therefore be
                      accomplished by imposing an AC electric field in a
                      target region for extended periods of time. Some
                      of the cells that divide while the field is
                      applied will be damaged, but the cells that do not
                      divide will not be harmed. This selectively
                      damages rapidly dividing cells like tumor cells,
                      but does not harm normal cells that are not
                      dividing. Improved results may be achieved by
                      using a field with two or more frequencies.<br>

                        A major use of the present apparatus is in the
                        treatment of tumors by selective destruction of
                        tumor cells with substantially no effect on
                        normal tissue cells, and thus, the exemplary
                        apparatus is described below in the context of
                        selective destruction of tumor cells. It should
                        be appreciated however, that for purpose of the
                        following description, the term "cell" may also
                        refer to a single-celled organism (eubacteria,
                        bacteria, yeast, protozoa), multi- celled
                        organisms (fungi, algae, mold), and plants as or
                        parts thereof that are not normally classified
                        as "cells". The exemplary apparatus enables
                        selective destruction of cells undergoing
                        division in a way that is more effective and
                        more accurate (e. g., more adaptable to be aimed
                        at specific targets) than existing methods.
                        Further, the present apparatus causes minimal
                        damage, if any, to normal tissue and, thus,
                        reduces or eliminates many side-effects
                        associated with existing selective destruction
                        methods, such as radiation therapy and
                        chemotherapy. The selective destruction of
                        dividing cells using the present apparatus does
                        not depend on the sensitivity of the cells to
                        chemical agents or radiation. Instead, the
                        selective destruction of dividing cells is based
                        on distinguishable geometrical characteristics
                        of cells undergoing division, in comparison to
                        non-dividing cells, regardless of the cell
                        geometry of the type of cells being treated.<br>
                        <br>
                        [0021] According to one exemplary embodiment,
                        cell geometry-dependent selective destruction of
                        living tissue is performed by inducing a
                        non-homogenous electric field in the cells using
                        an electronic apparatus.<br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;[0022] It has been observed by the present
                        inventor that, while different cells in their
                        non-dividing state may have different shapes, e.
                        g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical,
                        "pancake-like", etc. , the division process of
                        practically all cells is characterized by
                        development of a "cleavage furrow" in late
                        anaphase and telophase. This cleavage furrow is
                        a slow constriction of the cell membrane
                        (between the two sets of daughter chromosomes)
                        which appears microscopically as a growing cleft
                        (e. g., a groove or notch) that gradually
                        separates the cell into two new cells. During
                        the division process, there is a transient
                        period (telophase) during which the cell
                        structure is basically that of two sub-cells
                        interconnected by a narrow "bridge" formed of
                        the cell material. The division process is
                        completed when the "bridge" between the two
                        sub-cells is broken. The selective destruction
                        of tumor cells using the present electronic
                        apparatus utilizes this unique geometrical
                        feature of dividing cells.<br>

                        &nbsp;[0023] When a cell or a group of cells are
                        under natural conditions or environment, i. e.,
                        part of a living tissue, they are disposed
                        surrounded by a conductive environment <desc

                          electrolytic intra-cellular liquid. When an
                          electric field is induced in the living
                          tissue, by applying an electric potential
                          across the tissue, an electric field is formed
                          in the tissue and the specific distribution
                          and configuration of the electric field lines

                          The distribution and configuration of the
                          electric field is dependent on various
                          parameters of the tissue, including the
                          geometry and the electric properties of the

                          constants (that may be frequency dependent) of

                          &nbsp;[0024] The electric current flow pattern
                          for cells undergoing division is very
                          different and unique as compared to
                          non-dividing cells. Such cells including first

                          cell and a newly formed cell, that are
                          connected by a cytoplasm "bridge" or "neck".
                          The currents penetrate the first sub-cell
                          through part of the membrane ("the current
                          source pole") ; however, they do not exit the
                          first sub-cell through a portion of its
                          membrane closer to the opposite pole ("the
                          current sink pole"). Instead, the lines of
                          current flow converge at the neck or cytoplasm
                          bridge, whereby the density of the current

                          the current flow lines diverge to a lower
                          density configuration as they depart from the
                          bridge, and finally exit the second sub-cell
                          from a part of its membrane closes to the

                          &nbsp;[0025] When a polarizable object is
                          placed in a non-uniform converging or
                          diverging field, electric forces act on it and
                          pull it towards the higher density electric
                          field lines. In the case of dividing cell,
                          electric forces are exerted in the direction
                          of the cytoplasm bridge between the two cells.
                          Since all intercellular organelles and
                          macromolecules are polarizable, they are all
                          force towards the bridge between the two
                          cells. The field polarity is irrelevant to the
                          direction of the force and, therefore, an
                          alternating electric having specific
                          properties can be used to produce

                          appreciated that the concentrated and
                          inhomogeneous electric field present in or
                          near the bridge or neck portion in itself
                          exerts strong forces on charges and natural
                          dipoles and can lead to the disruption of
                          structures associated with these members.<br>

                          &nbsp;[0026] The movement of the cellular
                          organelles towards the bridge disrupts the
                          cell structure and results in increased
                          pressure in the vicinity of the connecting
                          bridge membrane. <desc clms="" page=""

                            expected to break the bridge membrane and,
                            thus, it is expected that the dividing cell
                            will "explode" in response to this pressure.
                            The ability to break the membrane and
                            disrupt other cell structures can be
                            enhanced by applying a pulsating alternating

                            about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz. When this

                            effect, whereby force pulses (or beats) are
                            applied to the organelles numerous times per
                            second, enhancing the movement of organelles

                            &nbsp;[0027] According to one exemplary
                            embodiment, the apparatus for applying the
                            electric field is an electronic apparatus
                            that generates the desired electric signals
                            in the shape of waveforms or trains of
                            pulses. The electronic apparatus includes a
                            generator that generates an alternating
                            voltage waveform at frequencies in the range
                            from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz. The
                            generator is operatively connected to
                            conductive leads which are connected at

                            internal type application in that the

                              utilizes electric fields that fall into a
                              special intermediate category relative to
                              previous high and low frequency
                              applications in that the present electric
                              fields are bio-effective fields that have
                              no meaningful stimulatory effects and no
                              thermal effects. Advantageously, when
                              non-dividing cells are subjected to these
                              electric fields, there is no effect on the
                              cells; however, the situation is much
                              different when dividing cells are
                              subjected to the present electric fields.
                              Thus, the present electronic apparatus and
                              the generated electric fields target
                              dividing cells, such as tumors or the
                              like, and do not target non-dividing cells
                              that is found around in healthy tissue
                              surrounding the target area. Furthermore,
                              since the present apparatus utilizes
                              insulated electrodes, the above mentioned
                              negative effects, obtained when conductive
                              electrodes are used, i. e., ion
                              concentration changes in the cells and the
                              formation of harmful agents by
                              electrolysis, do not occur with the
                              present apparatus. This is because, in
                              general, no actual transfer of charges
                              takes place between the electrodes and the
                              medium, and there is no charge flow in the
                              medium where the currents are capacitive.

                              of tumors in the living body. In fact, the
                              selective destruction utilizing the
                              present apparatus can be used in
                              conjunction with any organism that
                              proliferates by division, for example,
                              tissue cultures, microorganisms, such as
                              bacteria, mycoplasma, protozoa, fungi,
                              algae, plant cells, etc. Such organisms
                              divide by the formation of a groove or
                              cleft as described above. As the groove or
                              cleft deepens, a narrow bridge is formed
                              between the two parts of the organism,
                              similar to the bridge formed between the
                              sub- cells of dividing animal cells. Since
                              such organisms are covered by a membrane
                              having a relatively low electric
                              conductivity, similar to an animal cell
                              membrane described above, the electric
                              field lines in a dividing organism
                              converge at the bridge connecting the two
                              parts of the dividing organism. The
                              converging field lines result in electric
                              forces that displace polarizable elements
                              and charges within the dividing organism.<br>

                                      dependent. For low frequencies, e.

                                        and, therefore, the total
                                        membrane resistance can become

                                        generally uniform because, under

                                          cells is mostly homogeneous.
                                          In practice, the fraction of

                                          determined by the cell

                                            objects, moving them in the

                                            organelles, for example,

                                            polarizable and, thus, such
                                            intracellular organelles are
                                            electrically forced in the
