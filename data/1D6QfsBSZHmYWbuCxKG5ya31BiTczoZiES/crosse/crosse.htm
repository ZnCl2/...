      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1837, Andrew Crosse
          reported to the London electrical Society concerning the
          accidental spontaneous generation of life in the form of
          Acurus genus insects while he was conducting experiments on
          the formation of artificial crystals by means of prolonged
          exposure to weak electric current. Throughout numerous strict
          experiments under a wide variety of conditions utterly
          inimical to life as we know it, the insects continued to
          manifest. The great Michael Faraday also reported to the Royal
          Institute that he had replicated the experiment. Soon
          afterwards, all notice of this phenomenon ceased to be
          reported, and the matter has not been resolved since then.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description of some
          Experiments made with the Voltaic Battery; by Andrew Crosse,
          esq., of Broomfield, near Taunton, for the purpose of
          producing Crystals; in the process of which Experiments
          certain Insects constantly appeared. [Reprinted from the
          Transactions of the Electrical Society of London]</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My dear Sir -- I trust that
          the gentlemen who compose the "Electrical Society" will not
          imagine that I have so long delayed answering their request,
          to furnish the Society through you, as its organ, with a full
          account of my electrical experiments, in which a certain
          insect made its unexpected appearance, that such delay has
          been occasioned by any desire of withholding what I have to
          state, from the Society in particular, or the public at large.
          I am delighted to find that at last, late, though not the less
          called for, a body of scientific gentlemen have linked
          themselves together for the sake of exploring and making
          public those mysteries, which hitherto, under a variety o
          names, and ascribed to all causes but the true one, have
          eluded the grasp of men of research, and served to perplex,
          perhaps, rather than to afford sufficient data to theorize
          upon. It is true that much has been done in the course of a
          few years, and that which has been done only affords the
          strongest reason for believing that vastly more remains to be
          done. It would be presumptuous in me to enumerate the services
          of a Davy, a Faraday, and many other great men at home, or a
          Volta and an Ampere, with a host of others abroad. These
          distinguished men have laid the foundations, on which their
          successors ought to endeavor to erect a building worthy of the
          scale in which it has been commenced. Electricity is no longer
          the partly confined science which it was once fancied to be,
          making its appearance only from the friction of glass or wax,
          employed in childish purposes, serving as a trick for the
          schoolboy, or a nostrum for the quack. But it is, even now,
          though in its infancy, proved to be most intimately connected
          in all operations in chemistry, with magnetism, with light and
          caloric; apparently a property belonging to all matter,
          perhaps ranging through all space, from sun to sun, from
          planet to planet, and not improbably the secondary cause of
          every change in the animal, mineral, vegetable, and gaseous
          systems. It is to determine whether this be or not the case,
          as far as human faculties can determine, to ascertain what
          rank in the tree of science electricity is to hold; to
          endeavor to find out to what useful purpose it might be
          applied, that I conceive is the object of your Society, and I
          shall at all times be ready and willing, as a member, to
          contribute my quota of information to its support, knowing
          well, that however little it might be, it will be as kindly
          received as it is humbly offered. It is most unpleasing to my
          feelings to glance at myself as an individual, but I have met
          with so much virulence and abuse, so much calumny and
          misrepresentation, in consequence of the experiments which I
          am about to detail, and which it seems in this 19th century a
          crime to have made, that I must state, not for the sake of
          myself (for I utterly scorn all such misrepresentations), but
          for the sake of truth and the science which I follow, that I
          am neither an "atheist", nor a "Materialist", nor a "self
          imagined creator", but a humble and lowly reverencer of that
          Great Being, whose laws my accusers seem wholly to have lost
          sight of. More than this, it is my conviction, that science is
          only valuable as a means to a greater end. I can assure you,
          sir, that I attach no particular value to any experiment that
          I have made, and that my feelings and habits are much more of
          a retiring than an obtruding character; and I care not I what
          I have done be entirely overthrown, if truth be elicited. The
          following is a plain and correct account of the experiments
          alluded to.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the course of my
          endeavors to form artificial minerals by a long continued
          electric action on fluids holding in solution such substances
          as were necessary to my purpose, I had recourse to every
          variety o contrivance which I could think of, so that, on the
          one hand, I might be enabled to keep up a never-failing
          electrical current of greater or lesser intensity or quantity,
          or both, as the case seemed to require; on the other hand,
          that the solutions made use of should be exposed to the
          electric action in the manner best calculated to effect the
          object in view. Amongst other contrivances, I constructed a
          wooden frame, of about 2 feet in height, consisting of 4 legs
          proceeding from a shelf at the bottom, supporting another at
          the top, and containing a third in the middle. Each of these
          shelves was about 7-inches square. The upper one was pierced
          with an aperture, in which was fixed a funnel of Wedgwood
          ware, within which rested a quart basin on a circular piece of
          mahogany placed within the funnel. When this basin was filled
          with a fluid. A strip of flannel wetted with the same, was
          suspended over the edge of the basin and inside the funnel
          which, acting as a siphon, conveyed the fluid out of the
          basin, through the funnel, in successive drops. The middle
          shelf of the frame was likewise pierced with an aperture, in
          which was fixed a smaller funnel of glass, which supported a
          piece of somewhat porous red oxide of iron from Vesuvius,
          immediately under the dropping of the upper funnel. The stone
          was kept constantly electrified by means of 2 platina wires on
          either side of it, connected with the poles of a Voltaic
          battery of 19 pairs of 5-inch zinc and copper single plates,
          in two porcelain troughs, the cells of which were filled at
          first with water and 0.3% of hydrochloric acid, but afterwards
          with water alone. I may state here, that in all my subsequent
          experiments relative to these insects, I filled the cells of
          the batteries employed with nothing but common water. The
          lower shelf merely supported a wide-mouthed bottle, to receive
          the drops as they fell from the second funnel. When the basin
          was nearly emptied, the fluid was poured back again from the
          bottle below into the basin above, without disturbing the
          position of the stone. It was by mere chance that I selected
          this volcanic substance, choosing it from its partial
          porosity; or do I believe that it had the slightest effect in
          the production of the insects to be described. The fluid with
          which I filled the basin was made as follows.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I reduced a piece of black
          flint to powder, having first exposed it to a red heat and
          quenched it in water to make it friable. Of this powder I took
          two ounces, and mixed them intensely with 6 ounces of
          carbonate of potassa, exposed them to a strong heat for 15
          minutes in a black lead crucible in an air-furnace, and then
          poured the fused compound on an iron plate, reduced it to a
          powder while still warm, poured boiling water on it, and kept
          it boiling for some minutes in a sand bath. The greater part
          of the soluble glass thus fused, was taken up by the water,
          together with a portion of alumina from the crucible. I should
          have used one of silver, but had none sufficiently large. To a
          portion of the silicate of potassa thus fused, I added some
          boiling water to dilute it, then slowly added hydrochloric
          acid to supersaturation. A strange remark was made on this
          part of the experiment, at the meeting of the British
          Association in Liverpool, it being then stated, that it was
          impossible to add an acid to a silicate of potassa without
          precipitating the silica! This, of course, must be the case,
          unless the solution be diluted with water. My object in
          subjecting this fluid to a long-continued electric action,
          through the intervention of the porous stone, was to form, if
          possible, crystals of silica at one of the poles of the
          battery, but I failed in accomplishing this by those means. On
          the 14th day from the commencement of the experiment, I
          observed, through a lens, a few small white excrescences or
          nipples projecting from about the middle of the electrified
          stone, and nearly under the dropping of the fluid above. On
          the 18th day, these projections enlarged, and 7 or 8
          filaments, each of them longer than the excrescence from which
          t grew, made their appearance on each of the nipples. On the
          22nd day, these appearances were more elevated and distinct,
          and on the 26th day, each figure assumed the form of a perfect
          insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its
          tail. Till this period I had no notion that these appearances
          were any other than an incipient mineral formation; but it was
          not until the 28th day, when I plainly perceived these little
          creatures move their legs, that I felt any surprise, and I
          must own that when this took place, I was not a little
          astonished. I endeavored to detach, with the point of a
          needle, one or two of them from its position on the stone, but
          they immediately died, and I was obliged to wait patiently for
          a few days longer, when they separated themselves from the
          stone, and moved about at pleasure, although they had been for
          some time after their birth apparently averse to motion. In
          the course of a few weeks, about a hundred of them made their
          appearance on the stone. I observed that at first each of them
          fixed itself for a considerable time in one spot, appearing,
          as far as I could judge, to feed by suction; but when a ray of
          light from the sun was directed upon it, it seemed disturbed,
          and removed itself to the shaded part of the stone. Out of
          about a hundred insects, not above 5 or 6 were born on the
          south side of the stone. I examined them with the microscope,
          and observed that the smaller ones appeared to have only 6
          legs, but the larger ones 8. It would be superfluous to
          attempt a description of these little mites, when so excellent
          a one has been transmitted from Paris. It seems that they are
          of the genus Acarus, but of a species not hitherto observed. I
          have had 3 separate formations of similar insects at different
          times, from fresh portions of the same fluid, with the same
          apparatus. As I considered the result of my experiment rather
          extraordinary, I made some of my friends acquainted with it,
          amongst whom were some highly scientific gentlemen, and they
          plainly perceived the insect in various states. I likewise
          transmitted some of them to one of our most distinguished
          physiologists in London, and the opinion of this gentleman, as
          well as of other eminent persons to whom he showed them,
          coincided with that of the gentleman of the Academie des
          Sciences, as to their genus and species. I have never ventured
          an opinion as to the cause of their birth, and for a very
          simple reason -- I was unable to form one. The most simple
          solution of the problem which occurred to me, was that they
          arose from ova deposited by insects floating in the
          atmosphere, and that they might possibly be hatched by the
          electric action. Still, I could not imagine that an ovum could
          shoot out filaments, and that those filaments would become
          bristles; and moreover, I could not detect, on the closest
          examination, any remains of a shell. Again, we have no right
          to assume that electric action is necessary to vitality, until
          such fact shall have been most distinctly proved. I next
          imagined, as others have done, that they might have originated
          from the water, and consequently made a close examination of
          several hundred vessels, filled with the same water as that
          which held in solution the silicate of potassa, in the same
          room, which vessels constituted the cells of a large Voltaic
          battery, used without acid. In none of these vessels could I
          perceive the trace of an insect of that description. I
          likewise closely examined the crevices and most dusty parts of
          the room with no better success. In the course of some months,
          indeed, these insects so increased, that when they were strong
          enough to leave their moistened birthplace, they issued out in
          different directions, I suppose in quest of food; but they
          generally huddled together under a card or piece of paper in
          their neighborhood, as if to avoid light and disturbance. In
          the course of my experiments upon other matters, I filled a
          glass basin with a concentrated solution of silicate of
          potassa without acid, in the middle of which I placed a piece
          of brick, used in the neighborhood for domestic purposes, and
          consisting mostly of silica. Two wires of platina connected
          either end of the brick with the poles of a Voltaic battery of
          63 pairs of plates, each about 2 inches square. After many
          months action, silica in a gelatinous state formed in some
          quantity round the bottom of the brick, and as the solution
          evaporated, I replaced it by fresh additions, so that the
          outside of the glass basin, being constantly wet by repeated
          overflowings was, of course, constantly electrified. On this
          outside, as well as on the edge of the fluid within, I one day
          perceived the well known whitish excrescence, with its
          projecting filaments. In the course of time, they increased in
          number, and as they successively burst into life, the whole
          table on which the apparatus stood, at last was covered with
          similar insects, which hid themselves wherever they could find
          a shelter. Some of them were of different sizes, there being a
          considerable difference in this respect between the larger and
          the smaller; and they were plainly perceptible to the naked
          eye, as they nimbly crawled from one spot to another. I
          closely examined the table with a lens, but could perceive no
          such excrescence as that which marks their incipient state, on
          any part of it. While these effects were taking place in my
          electrical room, similar formation were making their
          appearance in another room, distant from the former. I had
          placed on a table three Voltaic batteries, unconnected with
          each other. The first consisted of 20 pairs of 2-inch plates,
          between the poles of which I placed a glass cylinder, filled
          with a concentrated solution of silicate of potassa, in which
          was suspended a piece of clay slate by 2 platina wires
          connected with either pole of the battery. A piece of paper
          was placed on top of the cylinder, to keep out the dust. After
          many months’ action, gelatinous silica in various forms was
          electrically attracted to the slate, which it coated in a
          rather singular manner, unnecessary here to describe. In the
          course of time, I observed similar insects, in their incipient
          state, forming around the edge of the fluid within the jar,
          which, when perfect, crawled about the inner surface of the
          paper with great activity. The second battery consisted of 20
          pairs of cylinders, each equal to a 4-inch plate. Between the
          poles of this, I interposed a series of seven glass cylinders,
          filled with the following concentrated solutions: (1), nitrate
          of copper; (2) subcarbonate of potassa; (3) sulfate of copper;
          (4) green sulfate of iron; (5) sulfate of zinc; (6) water with
          a minute portion of hydrochloric acid; (7) water poured on
          powdered metallic arsenic, resting on a copper cup, connected
          with the positive pole of the battery. All these cylinders
          were electrically united together by arcs of sheet copper, so
          that the same electric current passed through the whole of
          them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After many months’ action,
          and consequent formation of certain crystalline matters, which
          it is not my object here to notice, I observed similar
          excrescences with those before described at the edge of the
          fluid in every one of the cylinders, excepting the two which
          contained the carbonate of potassa, and the metallic arsenic;
          and in due time a host of insects made their appearance. It
          was curious to observe the crystallized nitrate and sulfate of
          copper, which formed by slow evaporation at the edge of the
          respective solutions, doted here and there with these hairy
          excrescences. At the foot of each of the cylinders, I had
          placed a paper ticket on the table, and on lifting them up, I
          found a little colony of insects under each, but no appearance
          whatever of their having been born under their respective
          papers, or on any part of the table. The third battery
          consisted of 20 pairs of cylinders, each equal to a 3-inch
          plate. Between the poles of this I interposed likewise a
          series of 6 glass cylinders, filled with various solutions, in
          only one of which I obtained the insect. This contained a
          concentrated solution of silicate of potassa. A bent iron
          wire, one-fifth of an inch in diameter, was plunged some
          inches into this solution, and connected with the positive
          pole, whilst a small coil of fine silver wire joined it with
          the negative.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After some months’
          electrical action, gelatinous silica enveloped both wires, but
          in much greater quantity at the positive pole; and in about 8
          months from the commencement of the experiment, on examining
          these two wires very minutely by means of a lens, having
          removed them from the solution for that purpose, I plainly
          perceived one of these incipient insects upon the gelatinous
          silica on the silver wire, and about half an inch below the
          surface of the fluid, when replaced in its original position.
          In the course of time, more insects made their appearance,
          till at last, I counted at once 3 on the negative and 12 on
          the positive wire. Some of them were formed on the naked part
          of the wires, that is, on that part which was partially bare
          of gelatinous silica, but they were mostly imbedded more or
          less in the silica, with 8 or 10 filaments projecting from
          each beyond the silica. It was perfectly impossible to mistake
          them, after having made one’s self master of their different
          appearances; and an occasional motion in the filaments of
          those that had been the longest formed was very perceptible,
          and observed by many of my visitors, without my having
          previously noticed the fact to them. Most of these productions
          took place from half to three-quarters of an inch under the
          surface of the fluid, which, as it evaporated very slowly, I
          kept to the same level by adding fresh portions. As some of
          these insects were formed on the inverted part of the
          siphon-shaped wire, I cannot imagine how they contrived to
          arrive at the surface, and to extricate themselves from the
          fluid: yet this they did repeatedly; their old places were
          vacated, and others were born in new ones. Whether they were
          in an imperfect state (except just at the commencement of
          their formation), or in a perfect one, they all had the
          distinguishing characteristic of bristles projecting from
          their bodies, which occasioned the French savant to remark
          that they resembled a microscopic porcupine. I must not omit
          to state, that the room in which these three batteries were
          acting was kept almost constantly darkened. It was not my
          intention to make known these observations until I myself
          should be better informed about the matter. Chance led to the
          publication of an erroneous account of them, which I was under
          the necessity of explaining. It is so difficult to arrive at
          the truth, that mankind would do better to lend their
          assistance to explore what may be worth investigating, than to
          endeavor to crush in its bud that which might otherwise expand
          into a flower. In giving this account, I have merely stated
          those circumstances regarding the appearance of insects, which
          I have noticed during my investigations into the formation of
          mineral matters; I have never studied physiology, and am not
          aware under what circumstances the birth of this class of
          insects is usually developed. In my first experiment I had
          made use of flannel, wood, and a volcanic stone; in the last,
          none of these substances were present. I never, for a moment,
          entertained the idea that the electric fluid had animated the
          organic remains of insects, or fossil eggs, previously
          existing in the stone or the silica; and have formed no
          visionary theory which I would travel out of my way to
          support. I have since repeated these latter experiments in a
          third room, in which there are now two batteries at work. One
          consists of 11 pairs of cylinders, made of 4-inch plates,
          between&nbsp; the poles of which is placed a glass cylinder,
          filled with silicate of potassa, in which is suspended a piece
          of slate between two wires of platina, as before, and covered
          loosely with paper. Here, again, is another crop of insects
          formed. The other battery consists of 20 pairs of cylinders,
          the electric current of which is passed through six different
          solutions in glass cylinders, in 3 of which only is the insect
          forming, viz., ist, in nitrate of copper, 2nd, in sulfate of
          copper, in each of which the insect is only produced at the
          edge of the fluid, as far as I can make out; and 3rd, by the
          old apparatus of coiled silver and iron wire in silicate of
          potassa, as before. There are now forming on the bottom of
          this positively electrified wire similar insects, at the
          distance of fully 2 inches below the surface of the fluid. On
          examining these, I have lately noticed a peculiar quality they
          possess whilst in the incipient state. After being kept some
          minutes out of the solution, they contract their filaments, so
          as, in some cases, wholly, and in others partially, to
          disappear. I at first thought they were destroyed, but on
          examining the same spots, on the next day, they were as
          perceptible as before. In this respect, they seem not unlike
          the zoophytes, which adhere to the rocks on the seashore, and
          which contract on the approach of a finger. I may likewise
          remark, that I have not been able to detect their eyes, even
          when viewed under a powerful microscope, although once I
          fancied I perceived them. The extreme heat of summer and cold
          of winter do not appear to favor their production, which
          succeeds best, I think, in spring and autumn. As in the above
          account I have occasionally made use of the word "formation",
          I beg that it might be understood that I do not mean creation,
          or any thing approaching it. I am not aware that I have
          anything more to add, except a few remarks I shall conclude
          with.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1st: I have not observed a
          formation of the insect, except on a moist and electrified
          surface, or under an electrified fluid. By this I do not mean
          to assert that electricity has anything to do with their
          birth, as I have not made a sufficient number of experiments
          to prove or disprove it; and besides, I have not taken those
          necessary precautions which present themselves even to an
          unscientific view. It is, however, my intention to repeat
          these experiments, by passing a stream of electricity through
          cylinders filled with various fluids under a glass receiver
          inverted over mercury, the greatest possible care being taken
          to shut out extraneous matter. Should there be those who blame
          me for not having done this before, to such I answer that,
          independent of a host of other hindrances, which it is not in
          my power to put aside, I have been closely pursuing a long
          train of experiments on the formation of crystalline matters
          by the electric agency, and now different modifications of the
          Voltaic battery, in which I am so interested, that none but
          the ardent can conceive what is not in my power to describe.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2nd: These insects do not
          appear to have originated from others similar to themselves,
          as they are formed in all cases with access of moisture, and
          in some cases 2 inches below the surface of the fluid in which
          they are born; and if a full grown and perfect insect be let
          fall into any fluid, it is infallibly drowned.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3rd: I believe they live for
          many weeks: occasionally I have found them dead in groups,
          apparently from want of food.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4th: It has been frequently
          suggested to me to repeat these experiments without using the
          electric agency; but this would be by no means satisfactory,
          let the event be what it would. It is well know that saline
          matters are easily crystallized without subjecting them to the
          electric action; but it by no means follows that, because
          artificial electricity is used, such crystals are formed
          without the electric influence. I have made so many
          experiments on electrical crystallization, that I am firmly
          convinced in my own mind, that electric attraction is the
          cause of formation of every crystal whether artificial
          electricity be applied or not. I am, however, well aware of
          the difficulty of getting at the truth in these matters, and
          of separating cause from effect. It has often occurred to me,
          how it is that such numbers of animacules are produced in
          flour and water, in pepper and water? Also, the insects which
          infest fruits after a blight? Does not a chemical change take
          place in the water, and likewise in the sap of the tree
          previous to the appearance of these insects, and is or is not
          every chemical change produced by electric agency? In making
          these observations I seek to mislead no one. The book of
          Nature is opened wide to our view by the Almighty power, and
          we must endeavor, as far as our feeble faculties will permit,
          to make good use of it, always remembering, that however the
          timid may shrink from investigation, the more completely the
          secrets of nature are laid bare, the more effectually will be
          the power of that Great Being be manifested, who seems to have
          ordained that, "Order is Heaven’s first law".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I beg to remain, in the mean

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yours, very sincerely,</font>

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Broomfield, Dec. 27, 1837</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">P.S. -- Since writing the
          above account, I have obtained the insects on a bare platina
          wire plunged in fluo-silicic acid, one inch below the surface
          of the fluid at the negative pole of a small battery of 2-inch
          plates in cells filled with water. This is a somewhat singular
          fluid for these insects to breed in, who seem to have a flinty
          taste, although they are by no means confined to siliceous
          fluids. This fluo-silicic acid was procured from London some
          time since, and consequently made from London water, so that
          the idea of their being native to Broomfield water is quite
          set aside from this result. The apparatus was arranged as
          follows: (1), in Figure 7, a glass basin (a pint one) partly
          filled with fluo-silicic acid to the level 1. (2) is a small
          porous pan, made of the same materials as a garden pot, partly
          filled with the same acid to the level 2, with an earthen
          cover (3) placed upon it, to keep out the light, dust, &amp;c.
          (4), a platina wire connected with the positive pole of the
          battery, with the other end plunged into the acid in the pan,
          and twisted round a piece of common quartz; on which quarts,
          after many months’ action, are forming singularly beautiful
          and perfectly formed crystals of a transparent substance, not
          yet analyzed, as they are still growing. These crystals are of
          the modification of the cube, and are of 12 or 14 sides. The
          platina wire passes under the cover of the pan.&nbsp; (5), a
          platina wire connected with the negative pole of the same
          battery, with the other end dipping into the basin, an inch or
          two below the fluid, and, as well as the other, twisted around
          a piece of quartz. By this arrangement it is evident that the
          electric fluid enters the porous pan by the wire (4),
          percolates the pan, and passes out by the wire (5). It is now
          upwards of 6 or 8 months (I cannot at this moment put my hand
          on the memorandum of the date) since this apparatus has been
          in action, and though I have occasionally lifted out the wires
          to examine them by a lens, yet it was not until the other day
          that I perceived any insect, and there are now three of the
          same insects, in their incipient state, appearing on the naked
          platina wire at the bottom of the quartz in the glass basin at
          the negative pole. These insects are very perceptible and may
          be represented thus (magnified) Figure 8, (1) the platina
          wire, 92) the quartz, (3) the incipient insects. It should be
          observed that the glass basin, Figure 7, has always been
          loosely covered with paper. The incipient appearance of the
          insect has already bee described. The filaments which project
          are in the course of time seen to move, before the perfect
          insect detaches itself from its birthplace.</font> </p>

          conveyed out o it by the strip of flannel (I), hanging over

          consequently falls in successive drops through the funnel (G)

          1837. Translated by Mr. J. H. Lang.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Extract:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The acarus of Mr. Crosse, a
          single specimen of which was preserved in spirit of wine
          contained in a small phial, offered for our examination the
          following characteristics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Seen by the naked eye, when
          enclosed in the vessel, it appeared merely as a whitish speck,
          which from its specific gravity always occupies the bottom of
          the phial.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A small oval body, bristled
          with long and diverging hairs, is seen by means of a lens.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Taken out of the alcohol,
          dried as much as possible, and then placed between two plates
          of glass, in a fine bed of white varnish, so as to render all
          its parts more transparent, and consequently more easy to
          study, we submitted it to the action of the microscope, which
          magnified about 280 times.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By this mode of observation
          we perceived that the body was of an oval form, the belly
          slightly flattened, and the back very round, particularly
          towards the hind end of the body.\</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The skin of the back
          appeared chagrined, or as strewed with an infinite number of
          very small tubercles, of which a certain number, larger than
          the others, distributed here and there, serve as a base or
          bulb for long hairs or silks, which are at least as long as
          the body of the animal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All these hairs fixed and
          raised on the protuberant back of this kind of acarus, give it
          the appearance of a microscopic porcupine, to which the
          elongated snout also contributes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have not been able to
          discover, by transparency, any trace of stomach, ovary, or
          lateral pulmonary organs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The anus is feebly
          distinguishable by a slight inclination situated in the
          direction of the median line, and the posterior part of the
          abdomen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But a large oval egg is
          clearly seen, like these, often to the amount of two, three,
          or eve four, which are seen in the transparent body of the
          domestic female acari of cheese and meal (Acarus siro Fab.),
          and in those of the same sex, of the acarus of human mange
          (Acarus scabici Fab.), as is seen in the drawing we have the
          honor to lay before the Academy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This egg, both ends of which
          are equal, and whose length is 1-7th of a millimeter, is so
          far remarkable, that it is found in the single individual sent
          by Mr. Crosse, as if chance had intended to furnish us with a
          material proof of the manner of reproduction, well known among
          the Acarians, of this acarus which is thought to be produced
          at pleasure, without a mother preceding it, and by the aid
          only of elementary molecules floating in the space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the front part of the
          body emanates an elongated snoutish head, very difficult to
          study in its composition; but in which we can clearly see an
          upper lip sloping to its extremity, under which is situated a
          tongue in the form of a stiletto; and beneath which again, but
          situated laterally, are perceived two large moveable jaws,
          pointed and slightly bent from without and within. It is
          probable these jaws terminate in a point. Further in, and
          directed in the same way, appear two palpes, shorter than the
          jaws, and almost hidden by them and the lip which protects
          them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having only a single
          individual at our disposal, it was impossible for us to prove
          the existence of an underlip, so large and apparent in the
          acarus of the human scab.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have not been more
          fortunate in regard to the two small smooth eyes, situated on
          the neck of the species of this genus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From a sort of elongated
          narrow breast bone proceed eight appendicular locomotive
          members, joined and directed, the four anterior ones before,
          and the four posterior ones behind. They are all composed of
          the same number of pieces; but one thing which may be remarked
          in many insects, arachnids and crustaces, the two pair of
          anterior paws are shorter, thicker, and more robust than the
          inferior ones, which are longer, and at the same time more
          thin. This difference, scarcely perceptible in the acari of
          cheese and meal, is very great in the acarus of the human
          scab, when, without an attentive examination, we should be
          almost tempted to see different organs in the two posterior
          pair of paws, which, in fact, are only rudimentary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the eight limbs of
          the acarus sent by Mr. Crosse, was formed of seven joints,
          exclusive of the tarsus; a first, which is triangular and may
          be considered as the hip;&nbsp; a second and third, longer
          than the hip; a fourth, longer than the two preceding ones; a
          fifth, shorter than the fourth; a sixth and seventh, longer
          and thinner than the others, and the latter of which
          terminated by a small transparent tarsus, which appeared to us
          bi-lobed, and provided with a single claw bent underneath.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the upper edge of the
          joints, with the exception of that forming the hip, were found
          one or two straight hairs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Te real length of the body
          and head was half a millimeter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The arachnide of Mr. Crosse
          appears to constitute anew species of the acarus race. The
          species described and figured, to which it nearest approaches,
          are those of cheese and meal, and perhaps more particularly
          the acarus dimidiatus of Hermann (Hermann, Mem. Apt. VI.4). It
          differs from the two first by the absence of the false
          corslet, by the two longest and most slender joints which
          precede the tarsus, the form of the body which is more oval,
          shorter and more bent, and finally by the numerous and long
          hairs which cover the whole of the back. It is distinguished
          from the acarus dimidiatus, which has a spherical body, with
          an appearance of corslet more colored than the rest of the
          abdomen, by the want o small short hairs which cover the
          surface of the eight appendicular limbs of the latter; but it
          approaches it by the numerous hairs which cover in rays the
          whole of the back.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus far we have strictly
          confined ourselves to natural history. We have observed,
          described, drawn, counted and measured all the constituent
          parts of this little animal. We have, by this means, proved
          that the small phial presented to the Academy by M. Robertson,
          contained the animicule or acarus spoke of; which also might
          be seen at a simple view as a whitish point.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We may now say something on
          the singular origin, and more on the singular fabrication of
          so complicated an animal, although microscopic, so exalted on
          the organic scale, and whose structure, as we have seen, is
          composed of 1st a body; 2nd&nbsp; a head, formed of two lips,
          two jaws, two palpe, a sucker, a mouth and two eyes; 3rd a
          stomach and an anus; 4th two lateral pulmonary organs (The
          contraction of the animal, for some time immersed in alcohol,
          prevented us from distinctly seeing the eyes and pulmonary
          organs); 5th an ovary, containing eggs, ovary, containing
          eggs, in the female ones; 6th eight appendicular limbs, each
          composed of eight joints, including the tarsus; 7th a skin
          bristled with long and numerous hairs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As we see it, we could
          scarcely increase the complication of this animal, though in
          addition to what we have just said, there are distinct sexes;
          among which there is a coupling and fecundation necessary for
          the reproduction of individuals of the species, and
          consequently we must admit that there are genital organs; and
          finally, the females make and lay eggs, whence the young ones
          are hatched, which at first have only six claws, until,
          changing their skin, they show two more, which were developed
          by degrees under this cutaneous skin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before attempting to make
          animals a complicated as the acarus, let us only try to create
          or obtain globules of Protospheries, and filaments of
          Protonemes; the two organic productions, which appear to us
          the most simple of the organic reign, which are the
          commencement of organization; and which mark the moment that
          matter globulizes and arranges itself, to serve the next
          instant for the formation or texture of different tissue
          masses of all other beings, whether vegetable or animal.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In these extremely simple
          globules or filaments, no interior granulation can be
          perceived, able to serve for their reproduction. Hence we may,
          perhaps, believe that these two sorts of beings, really
          elementary for those of a superior order, are organized
          productions, formed immediately from the matter. But who can
          assure us that these Protospheries and Protonemes do not
          contain reproductive globules, which escape the action of even
          our most powerful microscopes; or also, which will almost come
          to the same thing, who can say that these vegetables, so
          simple and a the same time so small, are not divided into
          particles immediately the life of association abandons them;
          so that each of the particles, animated with a new and
          independent life, becomes a sort of slip which reproduces the
          species, If these are only suppositions, they have at least
          the merit of being in perfect accordance with what everywhere
          takes place, besides these two single productions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All our microscopic studies
          on organized beings, whether vegetable or animal, the smallest
          in their dimensions, as well as the simplest in their
          structure, have always shown us that their mode of
          reproduction was entirely submitted to the power of a similar
          mother which, alone, can, by placing her nutritive materials
          in space, conceal herself in a destined germ, by insulation,
          for the reproduction and maintenance of the species.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is thus that, in
          proportion as we further study organized beings comparatively,
          and as we approach the smallest by the aid of the microscope,
          we see these numerous presumed spontaneous generations
          successively disappear, sprung from phantoms which could not
          support the light of a true and constant observation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From our own knowledge,
          acquired by a long series of labors, in organization and
          physiology, we should say that the means which Mr. Crosse has
          employed, even supposing them in this case indispensable to
          the appearance of the animal, have only been simple
          stimulants, which, like those which excite and favor the
          germination of a grain of wheat, have hastened the hatching of
          the eggs, similar to those contained by the female individual
          sent by Mr. Crosse himself; eggs which were lain or brought on
          the surface of the Vesuvian stones used in the experiment.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ignorant of the works
          written by Mr. Crosse, on the artificial and voluntary
          production of his acarus, we do not know whether the animal
          comes from the experiment in its most complete state, or
          whether, as would be more in accordance with the law presiding
          over the development of all organized beings, it passes
          through all the phases of developments and metamorphoses we so
          well know among all species of acarus. If, in the experiment,
          it begins by being only a point, then a globule, then an egg,
          afterwards a young acarus, having as yet only six claws, and
          finally a perfect acarus with eight, male or female without
          eggs, or containing some like that in the figure which we have
          had the honor to show the Academy. But in this way of viewing
          the fabrication of Mr. Crosse’s acarus, there would still
          remain a very great difficulty -- that of knowing where and
          how these animals, naturally so voracious, would find the
          nourishment necessary for their development; for organized
          beings can only increase in size and weight, by taking the
          nutritive matter which they find about them, and assimilating
          it themselves, by a mysterious power which belongs to them.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While examining with a
          microscope a thick plate of mica from Siberia, about 5 inches
          long and 3 inches wide, Sir David was surprised to observe the
          remains of minute animals, some the 70th of an inch, and
          others only the 150th of an inch in size. Some of these were
          enclosed in cavities, round which the films of mica were in
          optical contact. These acari were, of course, not fossil, but
          must have insinuated themselves through openings between the
          plates of mica, which afterwards closed over.</font> </p>
