      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matter may be temporarily
          turned into a state of anisotropy* in relation to the
          gravitational field by a novel physical process. A
          gravitation-like force emerges, the kineto-baric force.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(* Anisotropy refers to the
          exhibition of properties&nbsp; --- as velocity of light
          transmission, conductivity of heat or electricity,
          compressibility --- with different values when measured along
          axes in different directions)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For its generation, pulses
          of a hitherto unknown and non-electromagnetic "trigger energy"
          are fed into the substance of an activator whose gravitational
          characteristics are to be changed by "steps of activation".
          The trigger energy is gained from electromagnetic moving
          fields.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The direction of the feed-in
          determines the direction of the force. This kineto-baric force
          diminishes very slowly after a step to activation relative to
          the duration of the initiating pulse. Because of this feature,
          it is possible to accumulate the effects of a large
          number&nbsp; (up to 10<sup>10</sup> have been measured) of
          activation steps into measurable and technically useful
          magnitudes.(15)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Empirically, no known
          interaction of activated matter with its surrounding has been
          determined. In this respect, the process appears to represent
          a new phenomenon. (1, 2, 3, 15)</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Characteristics of the
            New Prime Mover</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The phenomenon is
          accompanied with its own ratio: the mean kineto-baric force
          times its period of decay determines a motive impulse: the new
          prime mover.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kineto-baric force
          accelerates freely movable, activated matter; such dynamic
          processes occur in an open physical system. The trigger energy
          itself does not contribute to the impulse gain. Rather, it
          produces the anisotropy of the gravitational field, causing an
          exchange of impulses between the immense store of baric**
          (mechanical tension) within the range of effectiveness of
          geometrodynamics (7) and mechanical events in our habitual
          mass distribution. Experimental investigations reveal a
          gain-of-impulse-to-energy ratio whose value surpasses the
          values of conventional propulsion methods by several powers of
          ten. (1, 3)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(** Related to gravitational
          actions)</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            No-Common-Center-Of-Gravity Principle</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mechanical effects run
          in physical systems ("Y-Systems") whose range of effectiveness
          is foreign to conventional knowledge. Within Y-systems,
          Newton's Principle of Action and Reaction is still valid, but
          there is no definable common center of gravity between both
          reaction partners of the dynamic processes. One of them is the
          activated matter which can be attributed with a center of
          gravity in the usual manner. The other one --- conventionally
          labeled as reaction-mass --- is the local origin of the
          gravitational moving orders (for mass) which cannot be
          attributed with a center of gravity by definition. There are
          several well known mathematical "pictures", for example "the
          guide-field property of space", the "the density- and
          pressure-gradients" in the hydrodynamic presentation, or "the
          locally altered geometry of space". (6, 7, 10, 12)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Common to them is that the
          notion of natural lengths is not applicable, thus no localized
          center of gravity can be defined: within a Y-system the
          center-of-gravity law cannot be employed, thus the laws of
          impulse and energy with respect to the = "related to
          gravitational actions" trigger energy lose their physical
          realities as they are based on the assumption the
          center-of-gravity law is applicable; neither can energy be
          defined as force times distance traveled under the action of
          that force, nor as kinetic or heat energy as the latter is
          kinetic energy of the random motion of molecules. Kinetic
          energy implies a differentiation of lengths, hence this notion
          is not applicable. Only the above-mentioned baric tension
          exists in Y-systems. With "normal" gravitation it is in an
          isotropic state; no energy can be derived.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In contrast, energy can be
          produced from gravitational fields in the anisotropic state of
          activated matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As there are no natural
          lengths in Y-systems, it follows that velocity relative to any
          inertial system does not enter into the balance of trigger
          energy of activated matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Furthermore, the reaction
          "mass" (the guide-field property of space, etc.) cannot absorb
          kinetic energy as compared with jet propulsion where the jet
          carries away most of the fuel's energy, most of it in the form
          of kinetic energy, then heat and noise.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gaining Energy from
            Redistributions of Mass</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How does the gain of energy
          come about in the mass-distribution? This "mental experiment"
          may explain:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let the origin of a
          coordinate system be anchored in a force-free particle and the
          matter to be activated be within that inertial system. Now an
          activation step is applied; a Y-system arises. The impulse
          emerging from it accelerates the activated matter during the
          period of decay; a gain velocity&nbsp; XXX occurs in the
          initial system but not in the Y-system as explained above. The
          Y-system ceases to exist at the end of the decline, and no
          dynamic record survives. A second step of activation is
          applied, a new Y-system arises which accelerates the activated
          matter, adding a further XXX during its decay. The velocity is
          now 2 XXX. When <i>n</i> activation steps have been applied,
          <i>n</i> independent Y-systems have acted one after another;
          the velocity in the inertial system rises to <i>n</i> XXX.
          Obviously, the kinetic energy grows by the square of <i>n</i>.
          Let E be the trigger energy used up for each step of
          activation. Then it is true that the kinetic energy in the
          initial system grown Ek = <i>n</i>2E, while the input of
          trigger energy was <i>n</i>E. Hence the energy gain = <i>n</i>(<i>n</i>E-E).





          With a typical repetition rate r = 40 Mc of the activation
          steps it is easy to see that the gain --- which is derived
          from the range of effectiveness of geometrodynamics ---
          surpasses the input by may powers of ten.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Key for Practical
            Applications</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suitable physical measures
          permit the application of activation steps at a high
          repetition rate, and let a large number of Y-systems act
          separately (just as in the mental experiment) yet
          simultaneously. Thus a similar gain of impulse and energy can
          be obtained in a much shorter space of time while the force
          component of the impulse-gain rises to measurable and finally
          technically useful magnitudes of accumulation. (15)</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experimental Results</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A main difficulty has been
          reproducibility as not all the physical parameters were
          recognized or obvious. Most activators had a mass between 200
          gr and 500 gr. The mass affected by primary activation was
          between estimated 5 and 50 mg. Stored impulses of 10<sup>4</sup>
          to 10<sup>5</sup> dyne-sec had been observed with a useful
          effect of 6 Newton-sec per Watt-sec of energy. On some
          occasions 10<sup>6</sup> and more dyne-sec with force
          components of 100 dyne to over one pond were observed. (1, 2,
          3, 15)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why was it so difficult to
          reproduce primary force components of more that 2 to 4 dyne?
          During the last 10 years or so, primary activation was done
          with relatively crude apparatus whose continuous systematic
          development would literally require a team of unavailable
          technicians and scientists. On the other hand, the art of
          measurement was intensively developed and tested over a period
          of several years. The specially devised and developed bifilar
          torsion and strip suspended balances (no static friction when
          standing still) proved to be fully reliable. In this way it
          was ascertained that the experimenter is not misled by
          "dirt-effects". The measured value to dead weight ratio is of
          the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>. Balances with these properties
          are not commercially available.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Propulsion Applications</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Replacement of ion or plasma drives ~</i> Force components
          of the impulse of between 1 and 5 pounds as observed during
          exploratory experiments suggest an early application for
          replacement of existing ion or plasma drives, and/or those
          which are in the stage of development. Ion or plasma drives
          are intended to "spiral" telecommunication satellites from a
          low (and fuel-saving) parking orbit into a geostationary one
          some 36,000 km up. This procedure saves a lot of fuel as the
          power for the "electric" drive is taken from solar cells over
          a long period of time. The payload can be increased
          accordingly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MEGA-propulsion is superior:
          electric energy requirements would be down to about 1% as
          observed during experiments. If larger force parameters were
          employed the time taken would be cut accordingly. Furthermore,
          no reaction mass such as mercury is required. Hence the new
          propulsion units could be operational for indefinite periods,
          in contrast to ion or plasma drives whose operation life is
          limited by the reaction mass.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistance
            to jet propulsion of planes ~</font></i><font face="Times
          New Roman,Times"> An increase of the force parameter could be
          envisaged in the form of hybrid propulsion saving over 75% of
          the fuel in jets. The relatively small advantage compared with
          example (1) is due to the need for directional maneuverability
          of the force component within, say 30 sec. This demands its
          correspondingly fast decline. To maintain the required thrust
          more trigger energy has to be used up, yet still at powers of
          ten less than with conventional drives.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Interplanetary space travel ~</i> The working hypothesis or
          theory of the propulsion had been evolved before experimental
          work began in the early 1950s and permitted the prediction of
          the primary effects --- the new prime mover --- within
          tolerable quantitative&nbsp; limits. This success suggests
          that further extrapolations are permissible. An example, in
          interplanetary space travel: for a return flight,
          Jupiter-Ganymede, the mass ratio of fuel + oxidizer to fully
          equipped ship with crew can be smaller than 7:1. Powered
          flight throughout with 1 g (earth) acceleration, hence no
          weightlessness. On reaching halfway, change to deceleration,
          once again with 1 g. One-way travel time of about 7 days
          depending on the relative positions of the planets. No
          ballistic flight path, almost proceeding in a straight line.
          Return to Earth in a similar fashion, hovering at low speed
          back into atmosphere. No reentry heat problem.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Transfer and Call-Off
            Effects</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activated matter transfers
          neutral matter of any kind in its vicinity more or less
          quickly into a state of anisotropy. The speed of the process
          depends upon the magnitude of anisotropy of the originally
          activated matter and its proximity. The transfer effect may be
          termed secondary activation, or for short, "infection effect".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Call-off effects from
          activated or infected matter: impulses of 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>
          and more dyne-sec can be called by known, other one by still
          unexplained, stimuli.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tiny accelerations which
          cannot be registered by neutral measuring arrangements (as the
          latter's sensitivity is a few powers of ten too small) cause
          random mechanical unrest of the force indicating parts. The
          unrest can be called by tiny movements of air in the casings
          of the balances or even the impulsive force of the movement of
          single air molecules. Provisionally considered, the unrest has
          nuisance value for the art of mensurating. With force
          components of the impulse smaller than, say 5 dynes it is
          difficult to distinguish between call-off and primary effects.
          The unrest has been observed over a period far longer than one
          year with power off.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the other hand, the
          movements of the balance is converted into heat by the brakes
          (damping) of the balances) One can compute the flow of energy
          into the brakes: it is several powers of ten higher than had
          been spent for the primary activation even over a relative
          short period of observation of a few months. (4)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It appears to be possible to
          control and optimize the energy gain by artificial mechanical
          stimulation in vacuo.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Measurements revealed
          horizontal accelerations of less than 10 <sup>-7</sup> g
          (gravitational acceleration) can cause significant effects as
          observed on bifilar torsion balances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The component of unrest
          which is stimulated by tiny air movements could not be

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Unclarified "Come-In"

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When persons who were
          present during a primary activation of the converter under
          observation approach the arrangement after a sufficiently long
          period of absence, an impulse of similar value as above is
          released. When persons who were not present during the primary
          activation approach the balance without the experimenter, no
          effects are observed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The come-in effect appeared
          also when the setup was placed inside a high-vacuum chamber.
          (14)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a possible
          interpretation it is suggested: with the primary activation a
          certain baric pattern may have arisen and stored partly by the
          activated matter and partly by the mass of the experimenter.
          When reapproaching, the similarity of both pattern could
          perhaps be "Recognized" and trigger the effect. It is strange,
          however, that with inorganic matter such as a transformer plus
          metal ballast, or furniture of similar mass as a man and under
          similar circumstances the effect could not be repeated so far.</font>

          clarified. The observed force component of the impulses
          measure between 3 and 10 dynes, and last for about one to
          several hours. One particularly interesting sequence of
          periodic effects was registered during 4 days, from Nov. 8 to
          Nov. 11, 1979 when it disappeared into the background unrest.
          Its periodicity was about 24 hr 20 min, and thus not pointing
          towards the sidereal day. Other records indicate a period of

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIELD &amp; BACKGROUND OF
            THE INVENTION:</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention relates to a
          pulse generator for producing a pulse train with a given pulse
          duty factor and a relatively small pulse width.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pulse generators for
          producing pulse trains are known in manifold designs. In pulse
          generators of this type, the steepness of the pulses is
          determined by the upper limiting frequency of the active
          elements. When the upper limiting frequency is reached, the
          amplification becomes smaller than 1 so that the oscillator in
          the pulse generator ceases to oscillate when the limiting
          frequency is exceeded. For the manufacture of pulse generators
          with very short pulses and very steep edges, it is therefore
          necessary to provide active elements which have an upper
          limiting frequency which is above the component frequencies
          determining the steep edges. The development and the
          manufacture of active elements of this type for high
          frequencies in the megahertz or gigahertz range are very
          involved and cost-intensive. It is thus desirable to provide a
          pulse generator which can be operated with active elements,
          the upper limiting frequency of which is very much lower than
          the highest component frequencies determining the steep edges.
          It is immaterial here whether thermionic tubes or
          semi-conductor devices are used as the active elements in the
          oscillator part of the pulse generator.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:</font></i>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the invention,
          this object is achieved by an oscillator comprising a resonant
          circuit which has multiple resonances and which is tuned to
          the fundamental frequency of the oscillator and to at least
          the first and second harmonics and, if appropriate, to higher
          harmonics in such a way that, on the output side, a saw-tooth
          wave is generated, each steep leading edge of which has an
          inflexion point, and by coupling the resonant circuit via
          differentiation members to a load in such a way that, as a
          result of appropriate differentiation of the steep leading
          edge of the particular saw-tooth, a pulse with a pulse width
          corresponding approximately to the pulse time of the leading
          edge acts on the load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A development of the
          invention provides that the amplitude of the highest harmonic,
          determing the pulse width, is substantially smaller, and
          preferably about 1/4 or 1/6 and less, than the amplitude of
          the fundamental frequency determining the pulse repetition
          rate, and that the intermediate lower harmonics have an
          amplitude which is smaller than that of the fundamental
          frequency and which also decreases to the value of the highest
          harmonic as the ordinal number of the harmonic increases.
          However, it is also provided that the amplitude of the higher
          harmonic, determining the pulse width, is substantially
          smaller, and preferably about 1/4 or 1/6 and less, than the
          amplitude of the fundamental frequency determining the pulse
          repetition rate, and that the lower intermediate harmonics
          have an amplitude which is equal to the amplitude of the
          highest harmonics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is already known that a
          saw-tooth wave with a linear rise can be resolved into an
          infinite series of sinusoidal waves. For the present
          invention, however, only a limited smaller number of harmonics
          is necessary, the particular highest harmonic together with
          the fundamental frequency determining the pulse duty factor of
          the pulse train. The amplitudes of the fundamental frequency
          and of the individual harmonics can be in a mutual
          relationship, such as can be derived for the corresponding
          component waves by a Fourier analysis of a saw-tooth. However,
          it is by no means necessary that these amplitude relationships
          apply. Rather, a multiplicity of alternative amplitude
          relationships can be used and it has been found that it is
          sufficient for optimum operation if the amplitudes of the
          harmonics each are 1/4 and less than the amplitude of the
          fundamental frequency. Neither is it necessary that all the
          harmonics between the fundamental frequency and the highest
          harmonic are utilized, as will be explained in more detail in
          the following text.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The pulse generator
          according to the invention has the advantage that it enables a
          pulse train of very short and steep as well as powerful pulses
          to be generated at a relatively high pulse repetition rate.
          For the pulse generator, it is thus possible to use powerful
          active elements which have a relatively low upper limiting
          frequency and which hence ensure reliable operation of the
          pulse generator. It is a further advantage of the pulse
          generator that the pulse amplitude and hence the power are
          mainly derived from the fundamental frequency, while the
          harmonic oscillations in the main only contribute to the
          steepness of the pulse edges, the highest harmonic determining
          the pulse width and hence, in cooperation with the fundamental
          frequency, the pulse duty factor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a further
          development of the invention, it is also provided that the
          oscillator circuit is connected to a supply voltage via band
          stop filters which are connected in series and which have a
          high transfer resistance for the base frequency and for the
          particular frequencies of the harmonics. In this way, the
          draining of energy, associated with individual frequencies,
          from the multiple resonant circuit is avoided, and this is
          important for optimizing the operation of the pulse generator.</font>

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DESCRIPTION OF THE
            PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 1</font> shows the
        circuit diagram of a pulse generator which consists of a
        push-pull oscillator 10 with a multiple resonant circuit 11 and
        a circuit 12 which couples it to a load 13. The oscillator part
        of the pulse generator is connected to the supply voltage +V via
        a chain 14 of filters. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the exception of the
          multiple resonant circuit 11, the oscillator circuit is
          constructed in the conventional manner as a push-pull
          oscillator, the illustrative embodiment described operating
          with two thermionic tubes 20 which feed back crosswise from
          the anode to the grid via coupling capacitors 21 in such a way
          that the tubes are operating with high gain. This part of the
          oscillator circuit can be built up in any desired manner as
          long as, in cooperation with the multiple resonant circuit 11,
          it results in an oscillator circuit. The active elements used
          here will be those which have an upper limiting frequency
          above the frequency of the fundamental. In the type EL 152
          tubes used in the illustrative embodiment, the upper limiting
          frequency is about 120 MHz, whilst the pulse repetition rate
          generated by the pulse generator is about 45 MHz, the fifth
          and higher harmonics being utilized depending on the design of
          the multiple resonant circuit 11. It is also not necessary
          that the active elements consist of tubes. Rather,
          semi-conductor elements can also be used in their place.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The multiple resonant
          circuit 11 of the oscillator circuit is built up in such a way
          that it consists of a multiplicity of resonant circuits, each
          of which is tuned to particular frequencies. These are the
          fundamental frequency which determines the pulse repetition
          rate and the harmonics associated with this fundamental
          frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In FIG. 1</font>, the
        multiple resonant circuit is built up symmetrically and
        comprises an inductance 25 to which a capacitor 26 is connected
        in parallel. These two elements are tuned to the fundamental
        frequency f<sub>o</sub>. A secondary resonant circuit which is
        tuned to the second harmonic 2f<sub>o</sub> comprises a part of
        the inductance 25 and a capacitor 28. Attenuators 29 are
        connected to this secondary resonant circuit in order to adjust
        the amplitude of the second harmonic to a value which is smaller
        than the amplitude of the fundamental frequency. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secondary resonant
          circuit for the third harmonic 3f<sub>o</sub> is sub-divided
          and comprises the capacitors 30 and 32, each of which is
          connected in parallel to a respective end section of the
          inductance 25. This secondary resonant circuit is also
          attenuated with the aid of attenuators 31 in order to adjust
          the amplitude to a value which is smaller than that of the
          fundamental frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secondary resonant
          circuits for the fourth and fifth harmonics 4f<sub>o</sub> and
          5f<sub>o</sub> comprise a capacitor 34 or a capacitor 36,
          respectively, which are connected in parallel to a respective
          section, corresponding to the harmonic, of the inductance 25.
          These secondary resonant circuits are also connected to
          attenuators 35 or 37 respectively. The individual attenuators
          of the secondary resonant circuits can be designed in the
          customary manner and can consist, for example, of adjustable
          ohmic resistances which are connected in the customary manner
          to the associated secondary resonant circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ratio of the amplitude
          of the harmonics, the magnitude of which has been adjusted by
          the attenuators, to the amplitude of the fundamental frequency
          does not have to follow any particular set pattern. However,
          since the fundamental frequency in the main determines the
          pulse power of the pulse generator and the harmonics in the
          main only have an influence on the shape of the pulse, that is
          to say the steepness of the edge, the fundamental frequency
          must have the largest possible amplitude value, whilst it
          suffices if the harmonics have an amplitude of 1/4 and less.
          In an actual circuit, good results could be obtained using the
          following functional relationship:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A(f<sub>o</sub>); A/4(2f<sub>o</sub>);






          A/4(3f<sub>o</sub>); A/4(4f<sub>o</sub>); A/4(5f<sub>o</sub>)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other amplitude ratios, with
          the amplitude decreasing as the order of the harmonics
          increases, have also given satisfactory results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As already mentioned, the
          amplitude of the harmonics primarily affects the steepness of
          the edge and in particular the trailing edge of the pulse. The
          steepness of the latter is completely independent of the
          limiting frequency or the characteristic properties of the
          active element.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The pulse duty factor of the
          pulse train is determined by the highest harmonic which is
          used, since the latter determines the pulse width, as will be
          explained in more detail later by reference to <a
            href="#uspfig3">FIG. 3</a>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to <a
            href="#uspfig1">FIG. 1</a>, the oscillator circuit is
          connected to the load 13 via the coupling circuit 12. This
          coupling circuit consists in each case of a quarter-wave line
          which is connected to the decoupling taps of the inductance 25
          and joins the differentiation capacitors 40 to the multiple
          resonant circuit 11. These differentiation capacitors are of
          an order of magnitude of about 1 to 5 pF when the pulse
          repetition rates are of an order of magnitude of about 45 MHz
          and at least the fifth harmonic is used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The saw-tooth potential
          applied via the quarter-wave lines is differentiated by these
          differentiation capacitors 40 so that the pulses derived from
          the saw-tooth by the differentiation come to act on the load
          13. For optimum operation it is advantageous if there is
          matching between the multiple resonant circuit 11 and the load
          13, but satisfactory pulses can still be produced even in the
          case of mismatching.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 2</font> shows a
        further embodiment of a multiple resonant circuit 111 which can
        be used in place of the multiple circuit 11 in the circuit
        according to FIG. 1. This multiple resonant circuit 111 is built
        up asymmetrically and differs from the embodiment according to
        FIG. 1 in that the secondary resonant circuit tuned to the
        harmonic 4f<sub>o</sub> is lacking. This results in a saw-tooth
        wave which has a somewhat modified shape but from which the same
        pulse repetition rate and the same pulse duty factor as in the
        embodiment according to FIG. 1 are derived if the same frequency
        of the fundamental is used. The elements corresponding to the
        build-up of the multiple resonant circuit 111 are characterized
        in FIG. 2 by corresponding reference numerals augmented by the
        value 100. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For satisfactory operation
          of the pulse generator, it is also necessary, in the
          embodiment according to FIG. 2</font>, that the amplitudes of
        the harmonics are reduced relative to the fundamental frequency.
        The same amplitude relationships as mentioned in connection with
        FIG. 1 can be used. In an actual circuit build-up, the following
        amplitude relationship was provided and used very successfully:
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A(f<sub>o</sub>);
          A/.sqroot.2(2f<sub>o</sub>); A/2 (3f<sub>o</sub>); A/4 (5f<sub>o</sub>)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, satisfactory
          results are also obtained with many other relationships which
          differ from the amplitude relationship indicated, since, as
          already mentioned, the harmonics make only a minor
          contribution to the total power of the generated pulse train,
          the energy of which is in the main derived from the
          fundamental frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The asymmetrical build-up of
          the multiple resonant circuit 111 according to FIG. 2</font>
        has an advantage because the spacially different couplings of
        the capacitors, associated with the individual secondary
        resonant circuits, to the inductance 125 facilitate the
        adjustment of the relative phase position of the secondary
        oscillations and hence facilitate the tuning of the multiple
        resonant circuit. The most favorable conditions are established
        when the relative phase angle of the individual secondary
        oscillations is 0. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In such a pulse generator,
          built up in accordance with the examples illustrated, pulses
          with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 400 V could be generated
          using type EL 152 tubes, the frequency of the fundamental
          being about 45 MHz. As will be explained in more detail in the
          following text, the pulse duration is derived from half the
          period of the highest harmonic. However, pulses with
          peak-to-peak amplitudes between 600 V and 800 V and a pulse
          width of 2.5 nanoseconds are also possible using the same
          tubes. At lower powers, it is also possible to generate pulses
          with a pulse width of about 0.5 nanoseconds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to explain the
          pulse generator circuit, reference is made to FIG. 3</font>
        which, in part a), shows a saw-tooth oscillation which is built
        up from a base oscillation with the frequency f<sub>o</sub> and
        also the second harmonic with the frequency 2f<sub>o</sub> and
        the third harmonic with the frequency 3f<sub>o</sub>. On top of
        the time axis, the third harmonic 3f<sub>o</sub> is drawn in
        dotted lines with the relative phase position 0. This
        representation clearly shows that the superposition of the
        second and third harmonics on to the fundamental frequency
        already leads to a saw-tooth wave which has a leading edge with
        markedly steeper and markedly flatter slopes. In the region of
        the steep leading edge, the saw-tooth wave has an inflexion
        point which preferably lies approximately in the middle of the
        steep leading edge. By differentiating this saw-tooth
        oscillation with the aid of the differentiation capacitor 40
        according to FIG. 1, a curve of potential is obtained, such as
        can be seen from the diagram b), which makes it possible to see
        that the differentiation of the steeper leading edge with the
        inflexion point produces a pulse, the pulse duration of which
        depends on half the period of the highest harmonic 3f<sub>o</sub>
        used. In building up the saw-tooth wave from a fundamental
        frequency and higher harmonics, the steepness of the steep edge
        can be further increased and the pulse duration can thus be
        further reduced, the pulse duration resulting, as mentioned,
        from half the period of the highest harmonic (for consistency).
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If, as compared with the
          mode of representation according to FIG. 1</font>, a modified
        build-up of the multiple resonant circuit is used, either by
        omitting the secondary resonant circuit with the fourth harmonic
        or by adding further secondary resonant circuits with higher
        harmonics, the chain 14 of band stop filters must be adapted
        correspondingly and, in the band stop filters connected in
        series, a band stop filter tuned to the missing harmonic
        (consistency) must be omitted or, respectively, when further
        secondary resonant circuits are added, band stop filters must be
        added which are tuned to the frequency of the corresponding
        harmonics. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the preceding text, a
          pulse generator has been described which, with different types
          of build-up, is suitable for generating pulses of very short
          duration at a relatively high repetition rate, it being
          possible for the uppermost limiting frequency of the active
          elements in the oscillator circuit to be substantially lower
          than the component frequencies corresponding to the steepness
          of the edge of the pulses. By an appropriate design of the
          multiple resonant circuits it is possible to vary the pulse
          duty factor for a given pulse repetition rate and to create
          pulses with a very small pulse width. The pulse generator
          according to the invention is very stable with respect to the
          pulse repetition rate and to the set pulse duty factor and, in
          the case of a sufficiently high power of the fundamental
          frequency, also yields powerful pulses.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Im folgenden wird ber
          Versuchsergebnisse berichtet, deren experimenteller Befund
          vllig eindeutig ist, deren Erklrung bzw. Zurckfhrung auf
          bekannte Phnomene bisher nicht gelungen ist. Der Gedanke und
          die Ausfhrung derartiger Untersuchungen stammen ursprnglich
          von R.G. Zinsser), der im Laufe zehnjhriger sorgfltiger
          experimenteller Arbeiten bemerkenswerte Ergebnisse erzielt
          hat. Dabei soll das Auftreten dynamischer Effekte also
          Kraftwirkungen an entsprechenden Proben festgestellt worden
          sein. Wir wurden gebeten, eine experimentelle Prfung dieses
          Sachverhaltes durchzufhren.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Zunchst erschien die
          experimentelle Prfung relativ einfach. Im Verlauf der
          Arbeiten zeigte es sich jedoch, da die Ausschaltung uerer
          Streinflsse derartig schwierig war, da nunmehr erst nach
          drei Jahren Arbeit diese dynamischen Effekte als gesichert
          gelten knnen. Hierbei handelt es sich im wesentlichen um
          statistische Aussagen aufgrund von Auswertungen anhand einer
          groen Anzahl durchgefhrter Versuche. Die Aussicht, hier
          mglicherweise einem neuen Phnomen, welches bisher unbekannte
          Kraftwirkungen auf Krper ausben kann, gegenber zu stehen
          was Anwendungen in der Raumfahrt denkbar machen knnte -, bot
          Anla und Berechtigung, diese Arbeiten in entsprechendem
          Rahmen, zumindest bis zur Klrung des weiteren experimentellen
          Tatbestandes, fortzufhren.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Prinzip des
            Experimentes</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Es wurden Proben bentzt,
          die im wesentlichen Schwingkreiselemente, also Induktivitten
          und Kapazitten, oder aber hochfrequente Leitungsbauelemente
          wie beispielsweise Viertelwellenleitungen darstellen (Bild 1
          ). Diese Schwingkreise bzw. Leitungsbauelemente befinden sich
          in Wasser (Leitungswasser oder entsalztes Wasser). Diese
          Anordnung bildet mit dem dazu gehrigen Behlter als
          Isoliermaterial die Probe. Es zeigte sich, da hierbei nicht
          ausschlielich Wasser zur Erzielung dieser Effekte
          erforderlich ist. Der Vorteil in der Verwendung von Wasser
          liegt in seiner groen Dielektrizittskonstante, wodurch
          relativ kleine Abmessungen der Proben unter Bercksichtigung
          der zur Verwendung gelangenden Frequenzen und Wellenlngen
          mglich werden. Neben anderen Erscheinungen, auf welche in
          diesem Rahmen nicht eingegangen werden kann, zeigen diese
          Proben nun bei induktiver oder kapazitiver Einkopplung von
          Hochfrequenzenergie dynamische Wirkungen. Die Proben
          unterliegen also Kraftwirkungen. Zum Nachweis derartiger
          dynamischer Wirkungen, die bei unseren Versuchen relativ klein
          waren (Krfte im Gebiet von 1 bis 10 dyn), wird die Probe auf
          einer Drehwaage entsprechender Empfindlichkeit gelagert. Diese
          Versuchsanordnung wurde nicht von uns entwickelt, sondern in
          wesentlich verbesserter Form bernommen.</font> </p>

          ferromagnetisch oder paramagnetisch, sondern besteht im
          wesentlichen aus Aluminium und Messing. Die Aufhngung ist aus

          wurde ein Gegentakt-Oszillator, der einen Gegentakt-

          Einflu uerer statischer Magnetfelder feststellbar. Zu

          Leitungswasser -, aber auch entsalztes Wasser von
          Raumtemperatur in die Probe unter Bentzung einer

          die Drehwaage gesetzt und zustzliche Null-Lufe gefahren. Sie
          waren einwandfrei und entsprachen den blichen Erwartungen.
          Dann wurde die Probe durch Hochfrequenzeinspeisung (Dauer im
          allgemeinen ca. 1 bis 2 Minuten) aktiviert. In einigen Fllen
          wurde diese Aktivierung mehrmals in Pausen von einigen Minuten
          wiederholt. Die eingespeiste Leistung betrug im allgemeinen
          etwa 20 Mikrowatt bis 100 Milliwatt. Im Verlauf von drei

          haben, wie sie etwa bei elektrischen Triebwerken auftreten, so

          Kraftwirkungen, fr die eine sinnvolle bereinstimmung mit den
          Axiomen der Mechanik erst gefunden werden mu, Anla genug fr
          weitere Untersuchungen - auch im Hinblick auf neue, sehr
          unkonventionelle Antriebsprinzipien. Beispielsweise konnte an
          Proben, die 120 s einem Hochfrequenzfeld mit einem Energieflu
          von etwa 1 Milliwatt ausgesetzt waren, Kraftwirkungen zwischen
          5 und 10 dyn ber 2 Stunden beobachtet werden. Dem entspricht

          3.6*10e4 bzw. 7.2*10e4 s oder auf die eingespeiste Energie
          bezogen ein gespeicherter Impuls von(vgl. BILD 7). Dieser Wert
          bertrifft denjenigen konventioneller Antriebsverfahren um
          mehrere Zehnerpotenzen (BILD 7). Diese Tatsache bietet Anla
          genug, dieses Phnomen weiter zu untersuchen.
          Selbstverstndlich mu versucht werden, die Frage zu
          beantworten, inwieweit dieses Phnomen sich auf bekannte
          physikalische Effekte zurckfhren lt. Eine sorgfltige
          Analyse aller Mglichkeiten zeigt jedoch, da bisher noch kein
          physikalischer Effekt bekannt ist, der zur Erklrung dieses
          Phnomens herangezogen werden kann. Ursprnglich wurde
          versucht, diese dynamischen Effekte durch Drehmomente zu
          erklren, die durch Spin-Umklapp-Prozesse (Vernderung des
          Drehimpulses) - beispielsweise bei Kern-Spin-Resonanz bzw.

          dieser Hypothese wrde durch Zufuhr von Hochfrequenzenergie
          bei Vorliegen entsprechender Resonanzfrequenzen in der Probe
          eine Spin-Orientierung auftreten, die mit entsprechender
          Relaxationszeit abgebaut wird und zufolge der

          Entwicklungsmglichkeiten. Ferner lassen sich Grundlagen
          schaffen, die zur Basis eines zuknftigen experimentellen und
          theoretischen Versuchsprogrammes dienen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Zweifellos handelt es sich
          hier um einen elektromagnetischen Effekt, welcher in Materie
          Vernderungen bewirkt. Diese Vernderungen sind ber lngere
          Zeit hin in gespeicherter Form vorhanden und knnen von
          dynamischen Effekten begleitet sein. ber die Natur dieser
          dynamischen Effekte kann derzeit noch nichts ausgesagt werden.
          Zunchst wurde versucht, diese dynamischen Effekte durch
          Drehmomente zu erklren, die durch Spinumklapprozesse
          (Vernderung des Drehimpulses) - eben bei Kernspinresonanz
          -.hervorgerufen werden. Bei Gltigkeit dieser Hypothese wrde
          durch Zufuhr von Hochfrequenzenergie und bei Vorliegen
          entsprechender Resonanzfrequenzen in der Probe eine
          Spinorientierung auftreten, die mit entsprechender
          Relaxationszeit im Verlauf von 1 bis 2 Stunden abgebaut wird
          und zufolge der Drehimpulsnderung Drehmomente und damit
          dynamische Effekte auf die Probe ausben wrde. Abschtzungen
          zeigen jedoch, da diese Hypothese aus verschiedenen, hier
          nicht angefhrten Grnden zu Widersprchen fhrt und fr den
          vorliegenden Fall nicht anwendbar sein drfte. Es steht
          derzeit lediglich fest, da die Drehwaage als Detektor fr
          irgendwelche Vorgnge dient, welche mit nahezu lcherlich
          geringen Hochfrequenzleistungen ausgelst werden knnen.
          Gerade die Mglichkeit, hier mit auerordentlich geringen
          Leistungen Effekte zu erzielen, ist von hchster Bedeutung.
          Das Auftreten dynamischer Effekte bei Vorliegen uerer
          Strquellen, die relativ weit von der Versuchsanordnung
          entfernt sein knnen, zeigt, wie empfindlich diese Anordnung
          auf derartige Hochfrequenzeinflsse anspricht. Das ebenfalls
          festgestellte Auftreten dynamischer Effekte bei Anwesenheit
          von Versuchspersonen im Raum knnte mglicherweise durch das
          von Lebewesen erzeugte uerst schwache Hochfrequenzfeld
          erklrt werden. Die hohe erforderliche Frequenzkonstanz lt
          ferner darauf schlieen, da in der Probe Resonanzvorgnge mit
          sehr geringer Halbwertbreite ablaufen knnen (wie es ja auch
          bei Kernspinresonanz und Dipol-Dipolresonanz in Flssigkeiten
          und Gasen der Fall ist, wo Halbwertbreiten von einigen Hertz
          durchaus realisiert sind). Dies legt den Schlu nahe, da
          zufolge dieser geringen Halbwertbreiten einerseits die
          Mglichkeit besteht, mit auerordentlich geringen
          Hochfrequenzleistungen Effekte zu erzielen, wenn nur die
          Frequenz gengend konstant gehalten wird. Eine untere Grenze
          fr die erforderliche Hochfrequenzleistung andererseits ist
          gegeben, wenn die eingespeiste Hochfrequenzleistung den auf
          das Frequenzintervall der Halbwertbreite entfallenden Anteil
          der thermischen Rauschleistung grenordnungsmig erreicht.
          Bei Halbwertbreiten von einigen Hertz sind die Leistungen von
          etwa 10e-20 Watt.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wenngleich hiermit die
          dynamischen Wirkungen nicht erklrt werden knnen, geben diese
          berlegungen doch Hinweise dafr, weshalb die verwendete
          experimentelle Anordnung auf uere elektromagnetische
          Streinflsse so empfindlich reagieren kann. Beispielsweise
          ist die Leistungsfludichte eines Senders von 1 Watt
          Sendeleistung in einer Entfernung von 10e5 km = 10e-21
          Watt/cm2, so da Signalquellen unter diesen Umstnden noch auf
          auerordentlich groe Entfernung wirken knnen. Die
          Mglichkeiten, die sich hier fr eine Informationsbertragung
          ergeben knnen, gehen aus dem bisher Gesagten wohl unmittelbar
          hervor und bedrfen keiner weiteren Andeutungen. Betrachtet
          man ferner die Ausbreitung elektromagnetischer Energie unter
          den hier vorliegenden Bedingungen, dann ergeben sich ebenfalls
          sehr interessante Aspekte. Normalerweise wird die
          elektromagnetische Energie bei Ausbreitung in Materie
          absorbiert. Dies geschieht einerseits in Isolatoren durch
          dielektrische Verluste und andererseits in elektrischen
          Leitern durch Wechselwirkung von Elektronen mit dem
          Kristallgitter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Betrachten wir zunchst die
          Ausbreitung in Isolatoren (keine Verlustmechanismen, die durch
          Leitungselektronen verursacht werden). In diesem Fall besteht
          die Mglichkeit, da in hnlicher Weise wie beim Maser
          Inversion von Besetzungszustnden vorliegen kann, was zusammen
          mit der einfallenden elektromagnetischen Welle induzierte
          Emission und damit einen kohrenten Verstrkungsmechanismus
          ermglicht. Dies kann zu einer Verringerung der bei der
          Ausbreitung auftretenden Dmpfungsverluste (dielektrische
          Verluste) fhren. Die Inversion der Besetzungszustnde knnte
          durch stets vorhandene Hochfrequenzenergie hherer Frequenz
          zustande kommen (Pumpfrequenz). Bei Ausbreitung einer
          elektromagnetischen Welle in Wasser beispielsweise wrde dies
          bedeuten, da zufolge Absorption von geeigneter
          Hochfrequenzenergie, die entweder von der Sonne, von
          Gewitterttigkeit oder anderer atmosphrischer Ttigkeit oder
          aber auch von der weltweiten Verwendung elektrischer Energie
          stammen kann, im Wasser Energiezustnde in entsprechenden
          Inversion auftreten. Wird nunmehr ein Hochfrequenzsignal mit
          geeigneter Frequenz in das Wasser eingeleitet, so wre es
          durchaus denkbar, da durch induzierte Emissionen die
          Ausbreitung elektromagnetischer Wellen entsprechend dem oben
          Gesagten ber weite Entfernungen mglich wird. Die Intensitt
          der hochfrequenten elektrischen bzw. magnetischen Feldstrke
          kann dabei auerordentlich gering sein - ja mglicherweise
          sogar unterhalb des thermischen Rauschpegels liegen. Es ist
          dabei nur erforderlich, da die Halbwertbreite der mit der
          induzierten Emission verknpften Resonanzvorgnge entsprechend
          gering, d. h. die Lebensdauer der Inversionszustnde
          entsprechend hoch ist. Hieraus knnte sich eine Mglichkeit
          ergeben, Signale und damit Informationen ber weite
          Entfernungen durch Wasser, mglicherweise sogar durch
          wasserfhrende Schichten zu bertragen. Voraussetzung fr eine
          wirkungsvolle Informationsbertragung wre jedoch ein
          geeignetes schmalbandiges Empfangssystem mit Bandbreiten in
          der Grenordnung von einigen Hertz. Derzeit knnen noch keine
          genauen Aussagen ber die zur bertragung erforderlichen
          Frequenzen gemacht werden. Nach den bisherigen experimentellen
          Ergebnissen knnen dieselben im Ultrakurzwellengebiet und
          mglicherweise auch im Mikrowellengebiet liegen. Auch die
          Ausbreitung elektromagnetischer Energie in metallischen
          Leitern kann gegenber der herkmmlichen Auffassung
          Modifikationen aufweisen, wenn die Intensitt des
          elektromagnetischen Feldes der Welle sehr klein wird. Fllt
          beispielsweise eine elektromagnetische Welle mit hoher
          Intensi.t auf eine Metalloberflche, dann werden die freien
          Elektronen im Metall durch den elektrischen Feldvektor zum
          Mitschwingen mit der Welle angeregt. Dieses Mitschwingen
          erfolgt bei groen Feldamplituden kohrent, d. h. es besteht
          innerhalb grerer lokaler Bereiche eine eindeutige
          Phasenbeziehung zwischen den schwingenden Elektronen. Dies hat
          zur Folge, da sich die durch die oszillierenden Elektronen
          erzeugten elektromagnetischen Felder der einfallenden
          elektromagnetischen Welle berlagern und diese durch
          Superposition auslschen. Dies ist letzten Endes der bekannte
          Skineffekt. Das Auslschen durch Interferenz wird gestrt,
          wenn die eindeutige Phasenbeziehung zwischen den schwingenden
          Elektronen gestrt ist, was dann der Fall ist, wenn die
          Elektronen durch Ste Energie an das Gitter abgeben. Da diese
          Stoprozesse vllig irregulr verlaufen, wird die Kohrenz
          gestrt, so da die Eindringtiefe beim Skineffekt mit
          zunehmender Wechselwirkung der Leitungselektronen mit dem
          Gitter - also mit zunehmendem spezifischen Widerstand des
          Materials - ebenfalls zunimmt.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Betrachten wir nun eine
          elektromagnetische Welle, wo der elektrische Feldvektor dem
          Betrag nach so gering ist, da der Energiezuwachs der
          Leitungselektronen klein gegenber der thermischen Energie der
          Elektronen ist. In diesem Fall lt sich zeigen*, da hier ein
          andersartiges Verhalten als beim normalen Skineffekt vorliegt.
          Bei Erklrung des Skineffektes wird bekanntlich stets
          angenommen, da die Energie der schwingenden Elektronen gro
          gegenber ihrer mittleren thermischen Energie ist.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bei Bercksichtigung der
          thermischen Energie der Leitungselektronen ist eine grere
          Eindringtiefe als beim normalen Skineffekt mglich. Diese
          Eindringtiefe ist durch die Thermalisierung der einfallenden
          elektromagnetischen Energie durch Streuung an den
          Leitungselektronen gegeben. Der Unterschied gegenber dem
          gewhnlichen Skineffekt ist nun augenscheinlich. Beim Einfall
          einer elektromagnetischen Welle entsprechend schwacher
          Intensitt werden Elektronen zum Mitschwingen angeregt. Diese
          Elektronenschwingungen stellen aber nur eine kleine Strung
          der stochastischen Bewegung der Elektronen zufolge ihrer
          thermischen Eigenbewegung dar. Auf diese Weise besteht keine
          Kohrenz zwischen den schwingenden Elektronen, und eine
          Auslschung der einfallenden Welle durch Interferenz kann auf
          diese Weise nicht stattfinden, da sich diese Anteile der
          schwingenden Elektronen zeitlich und rumlich gesehen
          ausmitteln. Hiermit soll nur gezeigt werden, da auch in
          metallischen Leitern durchaus die Mglichkeit einer
          Ausbreitung elektromagnetischer Energie unterhalb des
          Rauschpegels ber grere Entfernungen mglich ist. Dies wrde
          bedeuten, da sich elektromagnetische Energie nicht auf so
          einfache Weise wie bisher angenommen durch metallische Leiter
          vollstndig abschirmen lt. Im Rahmen des Skineffektes ist
          natrlich eine Abschirmung mglich. Diese kann aber nur bis
          zum Rauschpegel gehen. Innerhalb des Rauschpegels besteht
          durchaus die Mglichkeit einer Ausbreitung von
          elektromagnetischer Energie. Es ist einzusehen, da diese
          Aspekte fr die bertragung von Signalen und Informationen von
          grter Bedeutung sein knnen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Die bisher geuerten
          Gedanken und Mglichkeiten knnen jedoch erst dann Bedeutung
          erlangen, wenn extrem schmalbandige Empfnger fr
          elektromagnetische Energie bekannt sind, welche auf extrem
          schwache Signale unterhalb des thermischen Rauschpegels
          ansprechen knnen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Diese Ergebnisse, die
          mglicherweise Zugnge in vllig neuartige und noch nicht
          bersehbare Regionen menschlichen Wissens erffnen knnen,
          werden in ihrer Bedeutung noch gesteigert, wenn man bedenkt,
          da hier auch biologische Aspekte bercksichtigt werden
          mssen. Die Erzeugung sowie Absorption von elektromagnetischer
          Energie derart geringer Intensitt im entsprechenden
          Frequenzbereich ist auch in der Molekularstruktur der Zelle
          mglich und drfte bei der Evolution des Lebens eine nicht zu
          unterschtzende Rolle gespielt haben. Bercksichtigt man in
          der UdSSR verffentliche Arbeiten auf diesem Gebiet, dann
          besteht die Mglichkeit einer Informationsbertragung zwischen
          Zellen unter Bentzung elektromagnetischer Wellen. Es zeichnet
          sich hier die Entwicklung einer Wissenschaft im Grenzbereich
          zwischen Physik, Psychologie und Biologie ab, der sicher in
          etwa 20 Jahren eine zentrale Rolle zugewiesen sein wird.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">8. Zuknftiges Programm</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ein zuknftiges Programm mu
          hier vor allem eine Sicherung der experimentellen Ergebnisse
          unter Anwendung allerstrengster Mastbe einschlieen. Konkret
          gesprochen bedeutet dies die Anbringung der Drehwaage im
          Hochvakuum, um Luftbewegungen auszuschlieen, wobei die
          Vakuumkammer gleichzeitig so weit wie mglich als Abschirmung
          fr uere elektromagnetische Strahlung dient. Die
          Wiederholung der bisher durchgefhrten Versuchsreihe mit einer
          derartig verbesserten Anordnung wrde dann bei positivem
          Ergebnis die unanfechtbare</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Besttigung der beschriebenen
          Effekte bedeuten. Zustzlich sind die Untersuchungen ber
          einen greren Frequenzbereich als bisher auszudehnen.
          Untersucht wurde der Frequenzbereich von etwa 30 Megahertz bis
          1,4 Gigahertz. Die in Abschnitt 5 angefhrten Langzeiteffekte
          lassen einen starken Einflu von elektromagnetischer Strahlung
          der Sonne mglich erscheinen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Demzufolge mu der
          untersuchte Frequenzbereich auf das Mikrowellenspektrum der
          Sonne, d. h. bis etwa 20 Gigahertz, ausgedehnt werden.
          Abgesehen von der Messung der dynamischen Effekte mit der
          Drehwaage entspricht dies im wesentlichen der Anwendung von
          Hochfrequenzspektroskopie mit entsprechenden Gerten und
          Nachweismethoden.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dabei mu vor allem die
          Absorption von Hochfrequenzenergie in der Probe selbst mit
          entsprechenden Methoden untersucht werden. Ferner mu ein
          Empfnger fr elektromagnetische Wellen zur Verfgung stehen,
          der schwchste Signale aus dem thermischen Rauschen heraus
          nachweisen kann. Ein derartiges Gert kann unter Bentzung der
          Erkenntnisse auf dem Gebiet der Kernspinresonanzspektroskopie
          entwickelt werden. Bekanntlich stellen bestimmte, in der
          Kernspinresonanzspektroskopie verwendete Proben
          Resonanzsysteme mit Halbwertbreiten bis zu 1 Hertz hinunter
          dar, wobei sich thermische Strungen, die eine Erhhung dieser
          Bandbreite bewirken wrden, zeitlich und rumlich ausmitteln.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">9. Zusammenfassung</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Es wird ber Arbeiten
          berichtet, die einem dynamischen Effekt zugrunde liegen, der
          auftritt, wenn entsprechende wasserhaltige Proben
          Hochfrequenzfeldern ausgesetzt werden. Im Rahmen der
          experimentellen Mglichkeiten konnten dynamische Effekte sowie
          ein Einflu schwchster uerer Strfelder auf diese Proben
          nachgewiesen werden. Die dynamischen Wirkungen, deren
          experimenteller Befund vllig eindeutig ist, deren Erklrung
          bzw. Zurckfhrung auf bekannte Phnomene bisher nicht
          gelungen ist, entsprechen Krften in der Grenordnung von 1
          bis 10 dyn. Die beobachteten Kraftwirkungen bauen sich bei
          Einkopplung von Hochfrequenzenergie auf und knnen nach
          Abstellung der Energiezufuhr anhalten. Zeitkonstanten bis zu 2
          Stunden konnten dabei festgestellt werden. Obgleich die bisher
          nachgewiesenen Kraftwirkungen noch nicht die Grenordnung
          erreicht haben, wie sie etwa bei elektrischen Triebwerken
          auftreten, bietet das Vorhandensein derartiger, bisher
          unbekannter Kraftwirkungen, fr die eine sinnvolle
          bereinstimmung mit den Axiomen der Mechanik gefunden werden
          mu, Anla genug fr weitere Untersuchungen auch im Hinblick
          auf sehr unkonventionelle Antriebsprinzipien.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hervorzuheben ist dabei das
          uerst geringe Leistungsniveau (20 Mikrowatt bis einige 100
          Milliwatt), welches diesen Effekt hervorrufen kann. Diie
          Frequenz der eingespeistenHochfrequenzenergie mu
          auerordentlich konstant gehalten werden, wenn Effekte erzielt
          werden sollen. Es bestehen Hinweise darauf, da es sich
          hierbei um charakteristische Eigenschaften der Probe handelt.
          Ferner gibt es Hinweise, da hierbei periodische Signale
          nachgewiesen werden knnen, die im thermischen Rauschen
          untergehen. Es wurde darauf hingewiesen, da die Ausbreitung
          derartig schwacher Hochfrequenzsignale sowohl in Isolatoren
          als auch in Leitern eine gegenber dem bisher Gebten
          abweichende Betrachtungsweise verlangt. Dies vor allem
          deshalb, weil durch induzierte Emission ein
          Verstrkungsmechanismus existieren kann, der eine Ausbreitung
          schwchster elektromagnetischer Signale ber weite
          Entfernungen ermglichen kann. Hinsichtlich der Ausbreitung
          schwchster elektromagnetischer Signale in Leitern wurde
          darauf hingewiesen, da hier ebenfalls gegenber dem bisher
          Bekannten abweichende Betrachtungsweisen erforderlich sind,
          weil hier die durch das elektromagnetische Feld auf die
          Elektronen bertragene Zusatzenergie klein gegenber der
          thermischen Energie der Elektronen ist. Dadurch ist eine
          vllige Abschirmung elektromagnetischer Energie, wie sie bei
          Verwendung von Metallen allgemein angenommen wird, nur bedingt
          mglich.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Auf die Aspekte, die sich
          hinsichtlich der Bedeutung elektromagnetischer Energie bei
          biologischen Prozessen ergeben, wurde hingewiesen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obwohl die bisherigen
          experimentellen Ergebnisse bei Anlegung allerstrengster
          Mastbe noch nicht als vollstndig gesichert gelten knnen,
          ergeben sich bemerkenswerte Hinweise auf daraus erwachsende
          Konsequenzen. Zweifellos handelt es sich um ein Phnomen, bei
          dem durch Zufuhr von elektromagnetischer Energie Vernderungen
          in Materie bewirkt werden, welche ber lngere Zeit latent
          vorhanden sind und dynamische Effekte zur Folge haben knnen,
          wobei Gravitationswechselwirkung nicht auszuschlieen ist.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Derzeit bleibt die Frage
          unbeantwortet, ob die hier geschilderten Phnomene eine
          Erweiterung unseres physikalischen Weltbildes zur Folge haben
          knnen. Die einzige Mglichkeit, hier zu weiteren Aussagen zu
          gelangen, besteht darin, mehr Versuchsergebnisse zur Verfgung
          zu haben.</font></p>
