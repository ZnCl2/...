      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A Fascination with Flow</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Scientists, philosophers, and artists have been captivated by
      fluid flow for hundreds of years. Da Vinci spent the last 10 years
      of his life painting spiraling whirlpools and Bernoulli was
      fascinated by the curves he saw in natural flow. With the advent
      of powerful mathematical tools and the Navier Stokes equations,
      scientists such as Theodore von Karman, G.K. Batchelor, and Hans
      J. Lugt carried out comprehensive studies of fluid movement and
      vortical flow.<br>
      <br>
      PAX Scientific CEO Jay Harman is the first person to isolate the
      geometries that underlie natural flow and adapt those geometries
      to technology. As a naturalist with the Australian Department of
      Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW), he developed a fundamental
      understanding of the flow geometries of ocean and air currents. He
      repeatedly encountered the effectiveness of natural flow. From his
      observations, he asked a simple question: “If fluids always tend
      to follow a particular path, is there a way to design equipment
      that takes advantage of this fact?”<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Streamlining Principle</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The answer to Harman's question is what we call the Streamlining
      Principle. This approach translates nature's flow efficiencies
      into streamlined design geometries. PAX can then employ these
      geometries to significantly improve the performance, output, and
      energy usage of a wide range of technology. This conscious
      emulation of natural solutions, dubbed biomimicry by author Janine
      Benyus, gives PAX a distinct commercial advantage.<br>
      <br>
      Harman first applied the Streamlining Principle to nautical
      design, producing the award-winning Goggleboat and WildThing
      series of watercraft. Built using Harman's streamlining
      geometries, these boats confirmed many of the underlying theories
      of the Streamlining Principle.&nbsp; In 1997, PAX Scientific was
      founded to bring the exceptional efficiencies of natural flow to
      fluid-handling technology, such as fans, mixers, pumps, turbines,
      heat exchangers, ducts, propellers, and other applications.&nbsp;
      To validate the Streamlining Principle, the company entered a
      research relationship with Cascade Technologies and Stanford
      University. This research confirmed theories underlying Harman's
      discoveries and identified substantial improvements in the
      performance of PAX technology when compared with traditional
      technology.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Field of the Invention </span><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to nozzles, diffusers and venturis.
      It may be applied in any application in which conventional
      nozzles, diffusers and venturis are used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background Art </span><br>
      <br>
      Nozzles, diffusers and venturis are specific types of ducts used
      in relation to the flow of fluid. For the purpose of this
      specification, a nozzle is intended to mean a duct of varying
      cross-sectional area which is designed so that fluid flow is
      accelerated by a pressure differentiated between the inlet and the
      outlet. A diffuser is intended to mean a duct of varying
      cross-sectional area which is designed so that fluid flow is
      decelerated by an increase of pressure between the inlet and the
      outlet. A venturi can be seen as a duct comprising a nozzle
      section and diffuser section abutted in tandem.<br>
      <br>
      Nozzles are widely used in the field of fluid flow as a means to
      provide an accelerated stream of fluid and have many applications.
      Diffusers are used to decelerate fluid flow and again have many
      applications. Venturis are used to cause a short region of
      accelerated flow in a duct. It is a well known law of
      thermodynamics that the accelerated fluid flow is accompanied by a
      reduced pressure, and that many applications of venturis are
      directed to utilising the reduced pressure.<br>
      <br>
      While nozzles, diffusers and venturis are widely used, it is also
      well known that their performance is affected considerably by
      turbulence and frictional losses.<br>
      <br>
      These factors significantly limit the uses to which such devices
      can be applied.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description of Specific
        Embodiments </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention is directed to a flow controller, the structure of
      which is configured to cause the rate of a fluid flow to be
      altered during passage through the controller. Each of the
      embodiments is directed to a flow controller adapted to alter the
      rate of flow of a fluid.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that all fluids when moving under the influence
      of the natural forces of Nature, tend to move in spirals or
      vortices. These spirals or vortices generally comply to a
      mathematical progression known as the Golden Ratio or a
      Fibonacci-like Progression.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the embodiments serves, in the greater part, to enable
      fluids to move in their naturally preferred way, thereby reducing
      inefficiencies created through turbulence and friction which are
      normally found in apparatus commonly used for propagating fluid
      flow. Previously developed technologies have generally been less
      compliant with natural fluid flow tendencies.<br>
      <br>
      The greater percentage of the surfaces of the flow controller of
      each of the embodiments described herein are generally designed in
      the greater part, in accordance with the Golden Section or Ratio
      or are designed to ensure the volume of fluid flowing through the
      flow controller expands or contracts in the greater part in
      accordance with the Golden Section and therefore it is a
      characteristic of each of the embodiments that the flow controller
      provides a fluid pathway which is of a spiralling configuration
      and which conforms at least in greater part to the characteristics
      of the Golden Section or Ratio. The characteristics of the Golden
      Section are illustrated in Figure 1 which illustrates the
      unfolding of the spiral curve according to the Golden Section or
      Ratio. As the spiral unfolds the order of growth of the radius of
      the curve which is measured at equiangular radii (eg E, F, G, H, I
      and J) is constant. This can be illustrated from the triangular
      representation of each radius between each sequence which
      corresponds to the formula of a: b = b: a+b which conforms to the
      ratio of 1: 0.618 approximately and which is consistent throughout
      the curve.<br>
      <br>
      It is a characteristic of each of the embodiments that the
      curvature of the surfaces which form the flow controller takes a
      two dimensional or three dimensional shape equivalent to the lines
      of vorticity or streak lines found in a naturally occurring
      vortex. In general, the curvature of the surfaces substantially or
      in the greater part conform to the characteristics of the Golden
      Section or Ratio and that any variation in cross-sectional area of
      the flow controller also substantially or in greater part conforms
      to the characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio. In at least
      some of the embodiments, the curvature of the active surface
      conforms to an equiangular spiral. Furthermore it has been found
      that the characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio are found
      in nature in the form of the external and internal configurations
      of shells of the phylum Mollusca, classes Gastropoda and
      Cephalopoda and it is a common characteristic of at least some of
      the embodiments that the fluid pathway defined by the flow
      controller corresponds generally to the external or internal
      configuration of shells of one or more of the genera of the phylum
      Mollusca, classes Gastropoda and Cephalopoda.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that it is a characteristic of fluid flow that,
      when it is caused to undergo a fluid flow through a pathway having
      a curvature substantially or in greater part conforming to that of
      the Golden Section or Ratio that the fluid flow over the surfaces
      is substantially non-turbulent and as a result has a decreased
      tendency to cavitate. As a result, fluid flow over the surface is
      more efficient than has been encountered in previous instances
      where the pathway does not substantially or in greater part
      correspond to that of the Golden Section. As a result of the
      reduced degree of turbulence which is induced in the fluid in its
      passageway through such a pathway, the flow controllers according
      to the various embodiments can be used for conducting fluid with a
      greater efficiency than has previously been possible with
      conventional flow controllers of equivalent dimensional
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that it is impossible to illustrate the
      features of the embodiments by simple two-dimensional drawings. To
      assist the reader's understanding of the embodiments, the outer
      surfaces of the embodiments in the drawings are depicted in a way
      whereby they would correspond with the inner surfaces, such as
      would be the case if the walls of the embodiments are of constant
      thickness. In this way some concept of the helical/spiral
      configurations of the inner surfaces is conveyed. In practical
      fluid flow control devices, the configuration of the outer surface
      is not of significance to the embodiments and thus the outer
      surface could be configured as a simple surface such as a cone.,
      leaving the inner surface complex as suggested in these drawings.<br>
      <br>
      The first embodiment takes the form of a nozzle as shown in Figure
      2. The nozzle 11 has a nozzle body 21, an outlet 22 and an inlet
      23 which is adapted to be joined to a duct (not shown) such as a
      pipe, hose or similar providing a source of fluid under pressure.
      The nozzle body 21 has an internal surface 25 which reduces in
      cross-sectional area to the outlet 22. In addition, the internal
      surface of the nozzle may be seen to twist in a combination
      helical manner and spiralling manner between the input and the
      output. As indicated above, this twist is in a configuration which
      provides an active surface which conforms at least in greater part
      to the characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio. It will be
      seen that as a result of the twist, fluid flowing in the nozzle is
      caused to be given a rotational motion about the longitudinal axis
      of the nozzle to thereby induce vortical motion in the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the vortical motion, the turbulence and friction in
      the nozzle are reduced considerably from that observed in a
      conventional nozzle having a simple conical internal surface.<br>
      <br>
      A second embodiment takes the form of a nozzle as shown in Figure
      3. The second embodiment is of substantially similar construction
      to that of the first embodiment, and therefore in the drawings
      like parts are denoted with like numerals. The second embodiment
      differs from the first only in the particular design of the nozzle
      in that it is relatively longer and has greater twist. By varying
      the parameters of the nozzle, the formation of the vortical flow
      emitted from the nozzle outlet can be controlled. In certain
      applications, it will be desirable for the outlet to comprise a
      narrow vortical stream while in others, a diverging stream will be
      required to promote mixing of the output with the surrounding
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      A third embodiment takes the form of a nozzle as shown in Figure
      4. In this embodiment, the twist in the flow surfaces causes the
      direction of flow to be diverted transversely to that of the
      incoming flow stream. This redirection is achieved without
      significant loss because the internal surface of the nozzle is
      still configured to conform at least in greater part to the
      characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio. As a result,
      turbulence is substantially avoided.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that a whole class of embodiments are
      possible whereby the output flow is directed obliquely relative to
      the direction of the input flow stream.<br>
      <br>
      A fourth embodiment takes the form of a diffuser as shown in
      Figure 5. It may be appreciated that a diffuser may comprise a
      flow controller substantially identical to a nozzle but with
      direction of flow reversed. In this regard, the diffuser of Figure
      5 corresponds with the nozzle of Figure 2 but having an internal
      surface 25 which increases in cross-sectional area to the outlet
      22.. Therefore, in the drawings like numerals are again used to
      depict like features. As with the nozzle, while the diffuser of
      Figure 4 will induce vortical motion in the fluid flow, the
      precise characteristics of the output flow can be controlled by
      varying the design properties of the diffuser while maintaining
      the inner surface to conform at least in greater part to the
      characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio.<br>
      <br>
      It has been previously been noted that the cross-sectional area of
      the previous embodiments varies between the inlets to the outlets
      ; for the nozzles, the area decreasing and for the diffusers, the
      area increasing. In a further development of the previous
      embodiments, it has been found advantageous, at least in certain
      circumstances to vary the incremental volume of the controller
      along the fluid pathway in a manner that conforms to the
      characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio. To take advantage
      of this aspect, further embodiments of the fluid flow control
      devices as previously described are configured to conform with
      this constraint. As a result, the volume of fluid flowing through
      the flow controller expands or contracts in the greater part in
      accordance with the Golden Ratio.<br>
      <br>
      A fifth embodiment takes the form of a modified venturi tube as
      shown in Figure 7. The modified venturi tube is best appreciated
      by comparison with a conventional venturi tube which is depicted
      In Figure 6. In the conventional venturi tube of Figure 6, a
      venturi 51 comprises an inlet 52, an outlet 53 and a constricted
      region 54. The constricted region 54 comprises an entry 55, an
      exit 56 and a region of maximum constriction 57. In the drawings,
      the flow is represented by flow lines 58.<br>
      <br>
      When fluid is caused to flow into the inlet 52 of venturi 21, it
      is affected by the entry 55 wherein the diameter of the fluid
      pathway is progressively reduced until the region of maximum
      constriction 57 is reached. This constriction within the fluid
      pathway causes the speed at which the fluid is travelling to be
      increased. In accordance with well known laws of thermodynamics,
      this increase in fluid speed is accompanied by a reduction in
      pressure of the fluid. Subsequent to the region of maximum
      constriction 57, the fluid flow is affected by the exit 56 wherein
      the diameter of the fluid pathway is progressively increased to
      the outlet 53. In the exit 56, the fluid is progressively slowed.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the energy losses at a venturi are very
      significant. As mentioned above, these losses are caused both by
      friction and turbulence. In particular, it is well known that
      while the performance of a venturi can be increased by increasing
      the ratio of the inlet diameter relative to the diameter of
      maximum constriction 57, it is also known that in practice that
      any gains achieved by so reducing the region of maximum
      constriction are rapidly cancelled by the increased losses which
      result.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Fig. 7, the modified venturi 61 comprises an
      inlet 62, an outlet 63, a region of maximum constriction 64, an
      entry 65 and an exit 66. It will be readily perceived that these
      portions conform generally to corresponding portions of the
      conventional venturi tube of Figure 6. In contrast however, the
      entry 64 and exit 65 are specifically designed to induce the fluid
      to move in accordance with the laws of Nature. As mentioned
      previously, the flow controller is designed with a pathway having
      a curvature substantially or in greater part conforming to that of
      the Golden Section or Ratio. The fluid is thereby induced into
      vortical flow the greater part of which conforms to the Golden
      Section or Ratio. The energy losses caused as a result of this
      vortical flow are considerably lower than those which result from
      a conventional venturi.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the considerably reduced energy losses caused by
      the modified venturi of the fifth embodiment, the apparatus may be
      used more effectively than previously has been possible. Firstly,
      it is possible to increase the ratio of the area of inlet relative
      to the area of maximum constriction. This increases the relative
      pressure difference that may be generated between the inlet and
      the region of maximum constriction. This broadens the scope of use
      of the device.<br>
      <br>
      A sixth embodiment takes the form of a modified venturi tube as
      shown in Figure 8. The sixth embodiment, although somewhat
      different in appearance, operates in substantially the same manner
      as that of fifth embodiment and so, in the drawings, like parts
      are denoted with like numerals. The sixth embodiment again
      comprises a duct, the area of cross-section of which reduces from
      an inlet to a portion of maximum constriction, and then increase
      to the outlet. The difference between the sixth embodiment and the
      fifth is that in the fifth embodiment the flow induces a vortex
      which has an axis of rotation which is co-linearly aligned with
      the central axis of the inlet, whereas in the sixth embodiment,
      the axis of rotation of the vortex is disposed substantially
      transversely to the central the axis of the inlet.<br>
      <br>
      It has been noted previously that in the embodiments of the
      modified venturi tube, the cross-sectional area of the duct varies
      along the flow path, decreasing in the entry and increasing in the
      exit. As in the examples of the nozzles and diffusers, it has been
      found advantageous, at least in certain circumstances to vary the
      incremental volume of the controller along the fluid pathway in a
      manner that conforms to the characteristics of the Golden Section
      or Ratio. To take advantage of this aspect, further embodiments of
      the modified venturi tubes as previously described are configured
      to conform with this constraint. As a result, the volume of fluid
      flowing through the entry and exit of the venturi contracts or
      expands in the greater part in accordance with the Golden Ratio.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that, in at least certain configurations of the
      embodiments, the arrangements promote substantially radial laminar
      flow and it is believed that this assists the efficiency of the
      fluid flow within those arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the scope of the present invention
      need not be limited to the particular scope of the embodiments
      described above.<br>
      <br>

      Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the field
      of fluid mechanics and more particularly to the circulation within
      a body of fluid. More particularly, this invention seeks to
      provide an improved system of circulation within a body of fluid.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background Art </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      There are many applications wherein it is desirable to cause
      circulation within a body of fluid. Common reasons for providing
      circulation are for mixing, to prevent stratification and to
      aerate a body of liquid. Examples of these will be discussed later
      within this specification.<br>
      <br>
      A large number of methods have been devised to cause the desired
      circulation. In one example, in the case of liquids, it is common
      to hold the liquid body within a cylindrical tank having its
      central axis oriented vertically and to cause the liquid to be
      moved within the tank by the action of an impeller driven by a
      motor. Many other means have been devised to cause the body of
      liquid to rotate. Nevertheless, these techniques require the
      expenditure of significant energy and often give rise to
      associated problems. Many of these inefficiencies and problems
      arise because such systems have not been designed to cause the
      fluid to be circulated in accordance with the natural flow
      tendencies found in nature.<br>
      <br>
      In nature, fluid flow is essentially turbulent or vortical. A
      vortex ring cross- sectionally rolls, much like a wheel, rather
      than slides. Famed hydrodynamisist, Reynolds once stated, in
      reference to ring vortices, that"Nature prefers to roll rather
      than glide".<br>
      <br>
      It is this feature that greatly contributes to ring vortex
      efficiency.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description of Specific
        Embodiments </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The applicant has previously disclosed rotors designed in
      accordance with the principles of nature in international
      applications PCT/AU96/00427 (WO 97/03291) which has matured to US
      5, 934, 877 and others, PCT/AUOO/01438 (WO 01/38697) and
      PCT/AU03/00002 (WO 03/056139). The rotors of each of the
      embodiments described in those specifications are generally
      designed in all respects, substantially in accordance with the
      Golden Section or the Golden-Section-like centre or parts of a
      volute or other seashell and therefore it is a characteristic of
      each of the embodiments that the rotor provides a fluid pathway
      which is of a spiraling configuration and which conforms at least
      generally to the characteristics of the Golden Section. While it
      was envisaged that the rotors disclosed in these specifications
      would be suitable for use in pumps, turbines, fans, propellers and
      the like, it has been discovered that where at least certain
      embodiments are permitted to rotate at a fixed location in a body
      of fluid, the fluid is caused to circulate and that after a short
      period of time, the circulation will take the form of a ring
      vortex.<br>
      <br>
      A ring vortex is a mechanism with interesting properties and an
      example is diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 1. In a free
      environment, the ring vortex 11 has a doughnut shape with a
      central funnel region 12. The vortex lines 13 attempt to give an
      impression of the fluid flow within the ring vortex although it
      must be appreciated that this is impossible via a two dimensional
      illustration. A smoke ring is an example of a ring vortex. Once
      established, a ring vortex requires very little energy input to
      maintain it indefinitely. It also has a flow structure wherein the
      fluid flow is slowest at the outer perimeter. Thirdly, because of
      its peculiar, multi- directional flow, it is highly effective and
      efficient at mixing the fluid. Advantage is taken of these
      properties in the embodiments described below.<br>
      <br>
      It can also reach a resonance point and accumulate energy which
      thereby, over time, may reduce the energy input required to
      maintain the ring vortex.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the embodiments of the present invention comprises a
      system for inducing within a body of fluid a circulation that
      follows the path of a ring vortex. A ring vortex is nature's
      preferred, most common, most efficient manner of circulatory flow
      of a fluid. It is a mechanism that is highly efficient compared
      with other patterns of flow and has several advantageous
      properties ;-as are-discussed-above.<br>
      <br>
      Once found, its inertia becomes integrally part of the"flow
      device"comprising the liquid flow field and impeller with all
      sharing the same geometry of movement that is essentially a radial
      laminar flow path.<br>
      <br>
      While it is possible to induce a body to circulate as a ring
      vortex in a number of different ways, it is a common feature of
      the embodiments that they are caused to circulate by means of an
      impeller designed in accordance with the principles disclosed by
      the applicant in his previous applications as mentioned above,
      having surfaces designed in accordance with the Golden Section. it
      is a characteristic of such an impeller that the curvatures of the
      surfaces, which form the impeller, take a two-dimensional or
      three-dimensional form which substantially conforms with the
      characteristics of the"Golden Section"and any variation in
      cross-sectional area also conforms substantially to the
      characteristics of the"Golden Section".<br>
      <br>
      Examples of impeller that has been found to be particularly
      suitable shown in Figure 2a and 2b. In these, this impeller is
      designed in the form of a whorl and comprises an impeller 21
      having twin vanes 22 which have a helical configuration with
      active surfaces 23 and 24 substantially conforming to that of
      the"Golden Section"and which is adapted to be supported upon a
      central shaft 25 to be driven by a motor. The configuration of the
      vanes of these impellers correspond to the lines of vorticity of
      the central or"funnel"portion of a ring vortex and it is this fact
      that makes such an impeller effective in producing a ring vortex.
      It should be noted that alternative configurations of the impeller
      may also be used, such as an impeller with a single vane, or
      multiple vanes with active surfaces configured substantially in
      accordance with the Golden Section. These active surfaces may
      substantially conform to the Golden Section along the X-axis or
      along the Y-axis or along the Z- axis, along two of the X and Y
      and Z axes, or along the X, Y, and Z axes.<br>
      <br>
      When the impeller is first caused to rotate within a body of
      fluid, it induces both an axiai fibw to the fluid and"a rotatioha
      ! fibw. tnitiaiiy, the impetier creates a high degree of
      turbulence as the body of fluid is initially stationary. However,
      as the impeller is allowed to operate for a little time, the fluid
      is caused to circulate, as indicated diagrammatically in Figure 3.
      Because the impeller is designed to conform to the natural flow of
      the fluid, a progressively higher proportion of energy input by
      the impeller is imparted to the fluid as kinetic energy rather
      than turbulence as the fluid body accelerates and the fluid is
      thereby induced to flow in its natural way which is in the form of
      a ring vortex. Once the ring vortex is established sufficiently,
      the impeller shows little or no tendency to cause cavitation over
      a wide range of operating speeds. This is. in contrast to a
      conventional impeller where the operation at a speed above its
      designed level rapidly leads to cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      In the first embodiment of the present invention as
      diagrammatically represented in Figures 4 there is depicted a body
      of liquid 31 held in a cylindrical tank 32, the tank 32 being
      oriented with its central axis vertical. Within the tank 32, there
      is mounted a submersible motor 33 having an impeller 34, the axle
      of the motor and impeller being substantially co-axially aligned
      with the central axis of the tank 32. The motor 33 may be
      conveniently mounted to the base of the tank 35. As mentioned
      above, the impeller 34 is designed so that its active surfaces
      conform to the Golden Section as shown in Figure 2a or Figure 2b.
      Operation of the impeller 34 causes the fluid to circulate as a
      ring vortex and indicated by the flow lines 36, as discussed
      above. If the liquid 31 is a mixture which must be mixed
      homogeneously, such mixing is achieved efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the present system will be better appreciated by
      a comparison with a conventional mixing system of similar
      arrangement. Such a system again uses a cylindrical tank having a
      motor driving an impeller. However, the impeller of such a system
      is designed to cause the body of liquid to rotate about the
      central axis of the tank. This results in a number of problems.<br>
      <br>
      In such a system, the speed of liquid flow is greatest at the
      perimeter of the fluid body, that is ;-at the-wall of-the--tank:-
      As-a result, considerable energy is expended due to frictional
      losses in moving the liquid relative to the wall. In contrast, in
      a ring vortex, the speed of liquid flow is at its lowest at the
      perimeter, that is, at the tank wall, so that frictional losses
      are minimised. Also as a result of rotating flow in conventional
      systems, the water tends to"climb up"the wall, at the perimeter as
      a result of the"centrifugal"force. When fluid flow is in
      accordance with a ring vortex as in the case of the embodiments,
      the surface level remains substantially constant, around the
      edges. It is to be noted that, while in both cases, the water
      level is reduced at the centre, the fluid dynamics involved is
      very different. It should be noted that, at least in a relatively
      small tank, once the ring vortex is established and excessive
      power is input it is possible to establish a rotating wave which
      circulates around the surface of the liquid. The fluid dynamics of
      this wave motion are not yet fully understood but it is to be
      recognized that it is the wave that rotates, not the liquid
      itself. In addition, mixing is inefficient in a conventional
      system. In such a system, once rotational motion is established,
      the liquid tends to rotate as a fixed mass like a wheel with
      little relative movement within the liquid. This is known as solid
      body rotation. Mixing must be continued for a relatively long
      time. In contrast, relative fluid movement is inherent within a
      ring vortex and mixing time is minimised.<br>
      <br>
      The conventional mixing process requires substantial power to get
      it started. This requires that the motor be sized accordingly. In
      certain chemical and pharmaceutical mixing processes, it is
      necessary to mix large batches of material over a prolonged
      period, in the order of one month. It has been found that in some
      cases, if the process is stopped before the completion of mixing,
      for instance due to power failure, it has been found impossible to
      restart the process because of limiting start-up inertia. The
      motor is not powerful enough to restart so that the whole batch
      must be scrapped. The other alternative, historically, is to fit a
      larger motor in the first place. Obviously, this results in
      considerable economic loss. In contrast, mixing by means of the
      present invention does not require excess power for starting. The
      ring vortex is an energy reservoir. As energy is added, it is
      stored in the vortex ring. Therefore, at starting, energy is added
      in progressively, until the ring vortex is functioning at a level
      such that the energy dissipated in losses in the system is similar
      to the energy being input.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, in any real system some losses will exist. In a simple
      example of the embodiment, where the tank is of cylindrical shape,
      it is believed that some losses occur because of the abrupt change
      between the floor and the wall. It is believed that such losses
      are reduced by providing a tank with a curved base, such as a
      spherical section, rather than a flat base. Nevertheless, even in
      a standard cylindrical tank, an effective ring vortex can be
      established with high efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, it is quite possible to establish fluid flow in the form
      of a ring vortex even in a tank which is non-cylindrical, even of
      very irregular shape.<br>
      <br>
      It is a peculiar characteristic of the system that a ring vortex
      will be established whether the liquid is made to rise at the
      centre or whether it is made to fall, with only the direction of
      internal flow of the ring vortex being reversed. It is believed
      that there may be some applications where flow in a particular of
      the two directions may be slightly advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      It is also believed that there are applications, particularly in
      relatively shallow tanks where the performance will be improved by
      an appropriate positioning of the impeller between the base and
      the liquid surface.<br>
      <br>
      In a second embodiment as shown in Figure 5, there is provided a
      water remediation system for a water tower of the type used in
      water reticulation systems for municipal supplies. Water towers
      are widely used by water authorities as a means to provide an
      adequate supply of water at the desired pressure during periods of
      peak demand. During non-peak periods, water is pumped by a pumping
      station, with a portion of the water meeting the demand and a
      portion being pumped into an elevated water tower. During peak
      periods when the demand exceeds the capacity of the pumping
      system, additional supply is obtained from the water tower.<br>
      <br>
      It is normal design with such towers for water to be input and
      withdrawn through the same pipe which is connected at or near the
      floor of the water storage. However, this leads to a problem.
      Through much of the year, the volume of water added to the tank
      and withdrawn from the tank is only a small proportion of the
      total capacity.<br>
      <br>
      At least in the warmer months, it is normal for water to be warmed
      above the temperature of the water being provided by the supply.
      Water which is added to the tank at such times is added at the
      base of the tank, and, as it is cooler than the general body of
      water in the tank, will remain adjacent to the base of the tank.<br>
      <br>
      When water is removed from the tank it is the cool water at the
      base of the tank which is removed first. As a result,
      stratification of the water body occurs and the water in the upper
      levels of the tank is not circulated, nor withdrawn and replaced
      by fresh water, as is the case for the lower water. This
      stagnation results in the upper water fouling. To prevent such
      fouling, supply authorities have found it necessary to add
      chemicals, which is relatively expensive and also undesirable from
      the perspective of water quality. Alternatively pumps or paddle
      agitators can be used but are far less efficient than this
      invention as they create turbulent flow instead of a primary ring
      vortex.<br>
      <br>
      According to the second embodiment, an impeller 42 of the type
      described with respect to the first embodiment and driven by a
      suitable motor is positioned centrally within the water tower 41,
      the rotational axis of the impeller 42 and motor being aligned
      vertically. The impeller 42 may be positioned at a relatively low
      level within the water body so as to be operable without problem
      when the water level is low. A level switch 43 is provided within
      the circuitry of the motor to isolate the motor when the water
      level in the water tower 41 drops too low, thereby preventing the
      motor from operating when the impeller 42 is not covered by water.
      As a result of the operation of the impeller 42, a ring vortex
      will be established within the water body, ensuring circulation of
      the water held within the water tower at very low power
      consumption levels. Due to this circulation, stratification of the
      water will either be prevented or dispersed. As a result of the
      efficiencies of the ring vortex and in the impeller designed
      substantially in accordance with the Golden Section, it is
      expected that a motor of power in the range of 20 watts to 100
      watts will be adequate for most water towers. The expense of
      operating such a motor is considerably less than the cost of
      adding chemicals to control the fouling. The power use is so low
      that solar power is an economic option.<br>
      <br>
      In a third embodiment as shown in Figure 6, there is provided a
      water remediation and/or maintenance system for a pond, such as
      may be found in municipal parks. It is well known that such ponds
      suffer fouling due to lack of aeration which results in the death
      of fish and aerobic plants and the build up of unpleasant mould,
      fungi, botulism, and mosquito breeding. With a still pond, water
      stratifies with the cold water remaining at the bottom and the
      warmer water at the top which accentuates the problems. Attempts
      to reduce the fouling by aeration or other means have been only
      partially effective because they do not fully circulate the water
      but rather rely on diffusion of compressed air into the stagnant
      lower layers. Because of the stratification, this diffusion is not
      very successful.<br>
      <br>
      In the third embodiment, a pond 51 is provided with a small motor
      52 driving an impeller 53 of the type described for the first
      embodiment. The motor 52 is located approximately in the centre of
      the pond 51 with its axis vertical and the impeller 53 submerged
      somewhat in the pond water. Water circulation is established by
      running the motor 52 continuously. In doing so, after some time,
      fluid flow adopts the pattern of a ring vortex. As a result, the
      pond water circulates and mixes the whole body of water of the
      pond 51. The circulation removes the stratification and results in
      the aerated surface layer being continuously mixed with all other
      water, thereby providing aeration to the total water body. These
      advantages displayed by the embodiment are realized with a motor
      of very small, relative size. In testing, rejuvenation of a pond
      having a surface area of approximately one acre (1.7 million
      gallons) was achieved within two weeks by operation of a motor of
      40 watts. It is believed that even lower power will be required to
      maintain the pond in a healthy state. If this power is provided
      from mains supply, the electrical cost would be less than $50.00,
      annually, significantly less and more effective than applying
      chemical treatments. In addition, while the circulation will
      effect the whole pond, due to the nature of fluid flow within the
      ring vortex, the flow at the perimeter of the pond will be very
      slow and indeed, almost imperceptible to the naked eye. Thus, the
      fluid circulation will not cause an erosion problem about the pond
      edges.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative test, a one-half acre, 16-foot deep,
      million-gallon water supply reservoir was fully mixed in 20 hours
      with a 24-watt motor.<br>
      <br>
      In one adaptation of the third embodiment, the motor and impeller
      assembly could be mounted to a stand which also supports a
      photoelectric panel to provide the power to drive the motor. This
      arrangement could be combined with a battery to provide continuous
      flow. Alternatively, it is believed that the water will be
      maintained at a satisfactory quality level in many environments by
      operation of the impeller intermittently, only when there is
      sufficient sunlight to drive the motor. By this arrangement, the
      need to provide mains electrical power supply to an installation
      in the centre of a large body of water is removed.<br>
      <br>
      In another adaptation of the third embodiment, the motor, impeller
      and photoelectric panel are supported by a floatation device and
      the whole assembly moored to the pond floor by a suitable
      anchoring device. Such an arrangement would be suitable for a
      relatively deep pond, where it was impractical to support the
      assembly from the pond floor, or in a pond in which the level of
      water fluctuates significantly.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that, in the case of the embodiments, while the
      best performance can be expected to be achieved when the impeller
      is positioned centrally relative to the pond or to the vertical
      axis of the tank or the water tower, it has been found that the
      systems operate effectively even when the funnel portion of the
      ring vortex is disposed significantly away from the respective
      central feature.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the various forms of the third embodiment, it will
      be recognized that the many ponds have a shape in plan that is
      very irregular. Indeed in some cases, the pond may comprise two or
      more main pools linked by a relatively narrow channel. It will be
      recognized that in these circumstances, it may be appropriate to
      operate more than one impellor, positioned to establish more than
      one vortex. It will be important in such situations to ensure that
      the vortices cooperate with each other by creation of vortices
      having correct rotations.<br>
      <br>
      A further application of the third embodiment is in relation to a
      fish farm. The relatively low water speed across most of the pond,
      except in the vicinity of the funnel region while providing a high
      level of circulation and aeration make the embodiment an ideal
      environment for the farming of fish. Interestingly, it has been
      observed that fish will even pass through the funnel portion of
      the ring vortex without any noticeable distress.<br>
      <br>
      The impeller expands logarithmically from inlet to outlet and
      thereby provides the following unique benefits: it will not harm
      fish and other organisms and does not easily foul from weeds or
      plastics as other conventional devices do.<br>
      <br>
      The thorough circulation and excellent aeration of the fluid body
      as demonstrated in the third embodiment also render the process
      most suitable for sewerage treatment facilities. In each of the
      embodiments described, if the impeller is rotated at higher speeds
      it creates a vortex evacuation tube in the centre of the liquid
      movement. It will draw this tube of air right down to the impeller
      and vigorously disperse air throughout the liquid in an efficient
      and homogeneous way. This is a very inexpensive way to aerate
      liquids and has particular relevance to sewerage treatment, fish
      farms and many industrial applications.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that, in the various embodiments described
      above, the height and width of the ring vortex can be controlled
      by adjusting the stagger angle of the impeller.<br>
      <br>
      In certain applications, it has been found desirable to produce
      the ring vortex by positioning the impeller to rotate about a
      substantially horizontal axis. Indeed, a ring vortex can be set up
      with the axis of the impeller oriented at other angles,
      intermediate vertical and horizontal. The application will
      determine the optimum angle.<br>
      <br>
      The above embodiments identify but a few of the potential
      applications to which the invention may be adapted. By making use
      of the ring vortex, the applications get the benefits derived from
      using the natural flow pattern. It should be appreciated that the
      scope of the present invention need not be limited to the
      particular scope of the embodiments described above.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the word "comprise"or variations such
      as"comprises"or"comprising", will be understood to imply the
      inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the
      exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to the field of fluid
      mechanics and more particularly to the flow of a fluid relative to
      a body. More particularly, this invention seeks to reduce drag on
      a body or fuselage during relative movement of the body with
      respect to a fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The invention is described herein by reference to its use
      in respect to any mobile body or fuselage, such as, including, but
      not limited to, projectiles, missiles, torpedoes, submarines and
      aircraft. However, the invention is not restricted to mobile
      fuselages, but may also be used to reduce drag on stationary
      bodies such as buildings, bridge pilings, and fixed obstacles in
      watercourses, airways or other fluid flow fields. Such
      applications are intended to be within the scope of the invention
      although not specifically described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] 2. Background Art<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The greatest obstacle to obtaining optimum efficiency in
      streamlining a fuselage is surface friction. This can be in
      several forms but typically is one of or a combination of boundary
      layer drag, skin friction, viscosity, surface tension, cavitation
      and turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Existing technologies seek to reduce this drag and optimise
      the energy efficiency of a moving body or fuselage by altering its
      surface to be as smooth as possible with the least possible
      protuberances or alternatively to roughen the smooth surface or to
      give it a rippling surface similar to that of a shark, dolphin or
      golf ball. The objective is to minimise the effects of drag from
      fluids flowing past. Another attempt to cut drag has included the
      fitting of small vortex generators to wings and other parts of the
      fuselage. A further attempt has been to fit a spike-like
      protuberance extending forwardly in the direction of travel of the
      fuselage through the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In general, it has been an objective of these attempts to
      maintain straight, laminar flow over the body of the fuselage, and
      to suppress separation or turbulence as far as is possible.
      Alternatively, through the use of dimpled or roughen surfaces and
      vortex generators, the objective has been to create myriad eddies
      in close proximity to the fuselage surface to break up the
      boundary layer. Essentially, all these approaches are designed to
      assist fluids slide past the body with a minimum of friction.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0009] A first embodiment of the claimed invention provides for a
      vortex ring generating system inclusive of a body and spiraled
      surfaces affixed to the body. The body propels fluid from a
      forward portion to a rear portion when in motion. The spiraled
      surfaces are alternately concave and convex surfaces. A portion of
      each surface conforms substantially to a logarithmic spiral,
      wherein the radius of the logarithmic spiral measured at
      equiangular radii unfolds at a constant order of growth. The
      spiraled surfaces commence near the forward portion of the body
      and terminate near a rear portion of the body. The surfaces
      generate a vortex ring surrounding the body as the body propels
      the fluid from the forward portion toward the rear portion.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A second embodiment of the claim invention provides for a
      vortex ring generator that includes a mobile body and vanes
      extending outward from the body, which includes a nose and a tail.
      The vanes commence near the nose and end near the tail. The vanes
      define a spiral path around the body and are alternately
      configured as concave and convex surfaces. A portion of each
      surface of the plurality of vanes conforms substantially to a
      logarithmic spiral, wherein the radius of the logarithmic spiral
      measured at equiangular radii unfolds at a constant order of
      growth. The vanes generate a vortex ring with respect to a fluid
      incident to the mobile body and propel the fluid from the nose of
      the body toward the tail of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A third claimed embodiment of the present invention
      includes a mobile body configured to reduce drag in a flowing
      fluid. The mobile body includes an axis aligned with a direction
      of the flowing fluid relative to the mobile body. The mobile body
      includes a nose and tail. A vortex ring generator coupled to the <br>
      body includes a helical vane disposed around a central axis
      aligned with the axis of the body, the vane extending from the
      nose to the tail of the body. The vane includes alternately
      configured concave and convex surfaces. A portion of the helical
      vane conforms to a logarithmic curve, wherein the radius of the
      logarithmic curve measured at equiangular radii unfolds at a
      constant order of growth. The vortex ring generator induces a
      vortex ring around the body whereby the drag of a flowing fluid
      against the body is reduced as the body propels the flowing fluid
      along the axis aligned with a direction of the flowing fluid
      relative to the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A method for reducing drag on a mobile body in a fluid is
      provided and claimed. The method includes configuring the mobile
      body with spiraled surfaces affixed to the mobile body. The
      spiraled surfaces are alternately configured as concave and convex
      surfaces. A portion of each of the spiraled surfaces conforms
      substantially to a logarithmic spiral, wherein the radius of the
      logarithmic spiral measured at equiangular radii unfolds at a
      constant order of growth. The spiraled surfaces commence near the
      forward portion of the mobile body and terminate near the rear
      portion of the mobile body. The spiraled surfaces induce the
      formation of a vortex ring surrounding the mobile body. The mobile
      body is then subject to a fluid. Vortex rings are then generated
      to reduce drag on the mobile body as the fluid flows over the
      mobile body, the fluid being propelled by the mobile body.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A further claimed method is for generating a vortex ring to
      reduce drag on a mobile body in a fluid. The body is configuring
      with spiraled surfaces affixed to the body. The spiraled surfaces
      are alternately configured as concave and convex surfaces. A
      portion of each of the spiraled surfaces conforms substantially to
      a logarithmic spiral, wherein the radius of the logarithmic spiral
      measured at equiangular radii unfolds at a constant order of
      growth. The spiraled surfaces commence near the forward portion of
      the body and terminating near the rear portion of the body. The
      body is subjected to a fluid and rotated, which propels the fluid
      from the forward portion of the body toward the rear portion of
      the body. The rotation of the body generates a vortex ring. As a
      result, drag is reduced on the body as the fluid flows from the
      forward portion of the body toward the rear portion of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a final claimed embodiment, a vortex ring generator
      comprising a body and a surface is provided. The body is subjected
      to relative translational movement with a fluid along a line of
      movement. The body has no substantial rotational movement about an
      axis parallel to the line of movement. The surface is three
      dimensional and spiraling in form and coupled to the body. A
      portion of the surface conforms to a logarithmic curve. The
      surface generates a vortex ring in the fluid in relation to the
      body, the vortex ring having an axis substantially parallel to the
      line of movement.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0028] Each of the embodiments comprises a vortex ring generator
      associated with a body and adapted to generate a vortex ring in
      the fluid moving relative to the body. In each embodiment, the
      vortex ring generator comprises a fluid pathway having an active
      surface adapted to influence the flow of the fluid to form the
      vortex rings flowing past the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As stated previously all fluids when moving under the
      influence of the natural forces of Nature, tend to move in spirals
      or vortices. These spirals or vortices generally comply with a
      mathematical progression known as the Golden Ratio or a Fibonacci
      like Progression.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The greater percentage of the surfaces of the active
      surfaces of each of the embodiments described herein are generally
      designed in the greater part, in accordance with the Golden
      Section or Ratio and therefore it is a characteristic of each of
      the embodiments that the active surfaces are of a spiralling
      configuration and which conform at least in greater part to the
      characteristics of the Golden Section or Ratio. The
      characteristics of the Golden Section are illustrated in FIG. 1
      which illustrates the unfolding of the spiral curve according to
      the Golden Section or Ratio. As the spiral unfolds the order of
      growth of the radius of the curve which is measured at equiangular
      radii (eg E, F, G, H, I and J) is constant. This can be
      illustrated from the triangular representation of each radius
      between each sequence which corresponds to the formula of
      a:b=b:a+b which conforms to the ratio of 1:0.618 approximately and
      which is consistent through out the curve.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A characteristic of the embodiments is that not only do the
      X and Y axis conform to Golden Section geometry, but also the Z
      axis or depth conforms, that is the vanes conform to the Golden
      Section in three dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] It is an objective of the embodiments to duplicate the
      lines of vorticity found in a ring vortex. To that end, the active
      surfaces expand or contract logarithmically in any direction in an
      equiangular, Golden Section spiral. If any two points are taken on
      the surface of these active surfaces they will bear a ratio to
      each other of approximately 1:0.618. The active surfaces can be
      any length or number of rotations. They are specifically designed
      to match the internal, streamlined flow lines of vorticity of a
      vortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In the first embodiment, and as shown in FIGS. 2 to 5, the
      vortex ring generator (11) comprises a set of vanes located at the
      nose (13) of a body (12). In this specification, the term nose is
      used to identify the portion of the body which is intended to face
      the direction from which the relative flow of fluid is approaching
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The vortex ring generator (11) is adapted to generate a
      vortex ring by influencing the flow of the fluid relative to the
      body in a way which produces a vortex ring. The vanes comprising
      the vortex ring generator extend forwardly from the nose of the
      body and have the configuration of a whorl. Each of the vanes are
      formed with an internal reactive face (14) which is of a concave
      configuration and which has a three dimensional curvature of a
      concave nature whereby the curvature in each direction is in
      accordance with a logarithmic curve conforming to the Golden
      Section. As a result, the vanes (11) jointly define a generally
      concave internal face of the vortex ring generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In addition, each vane has a remote reactive face (15)
      which is remote from the internal reactive face (14) and which
      also has a three dimensional curvature of a convex nature whereby
      the curvature in each dimension conforms with a logarithmic curve
      according to the Golden Section, and whereby the curvature in each
      dimension is of the same form as the curvature of the internal
      reactive face (14) in each dimension. As a result, the remote
      reactive faces (15) jointly define a generally convex surface of
      the vanes.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In an adaptation of the first embodiment, the vortex ring
      generator is not fixedly mounted to the nose but rather is adapted
      to rotate coaxially with the axis of the body. In addition, the
      generator may be driven mechanically to rotate thereby providing
      propulsion to the body whilst simultaneously generating vortex
      rings.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In the second embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the
      vortex ring generator comprises a set one or more grooves or
      flutes (21) in the surface of the body, commencing at or near the
      nose (23) of the body (22) and ending at or near the tail (24) of
      the body. The paths of the grooves or flutes along the body spiral
      around the body in a manner designed to conform to the Golden
      Ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In the third embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, the
      vortex ring generator comprises a set one or more vanes (31)
      extending outwardly from the surface of the body, commencing at or
      near the nose (33) of the body (32) and ending at or near the tail
      (34) of the body. The paths of the vanes along the body spiral
      around the body in a manner designed to conform to the Golden
      Ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The body in each of the above embodiments is ideally
      designed in accordance with a logarithmic, equiangular, Phi
      spiral. Its shape is optimally compatible with Phi vortex
      geometry, which is common to all vortices. In other words the body
      occupies that space which is seen in the cavitation tube of a
      visible vortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] As depicted in FIG. 11, the body, 13, is accommodated
      within the core of the vortex, 16. The nose of the body, by use of
      embodiment one, two or three above exactly fits the geometry of a
      ring vortex. The body may be cone-shaped with a hollow centre
      allowing fluid incoming to the vortex ring to travel through its
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate the creation of ring vortices,
      16, which travel/roll along the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In operation, with relative movement between the fluid and
      the body, the fluid is engaged by the active surfaces 11, 21 or 31
      and commences rotating in a logarithmic vortical fashion. As the
      fluid engages the active surfaces, the rotary motion creates a
      low-pressure area at the base of the vortex generator (the
      interface between the generator and the nose of the body). This
      reduces the boundary layer drag of the body. A ring and/or
      potential vortex is established. As can be seen in FIG. 10, the
      ring vortex rolls up the boundary layer, like ball bearings, along
      the body walls. In many applications vortex rings will shed and
      give rise to a stream of shed vortex rings. The wake left behind
      the body is in the shape of vortex rings.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 12 illustrates the vortex ring generator, 11 of the
      first embodiment creating a ring vortex, 16. To do so, there must
      be relative motion between the vortex ring generator, 11, and the
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] This motion can be created by rotation of the vortex ring
      generator; the movement of fluid past a stationary vortex ring
      generator, or the propulsion of the body and vortex ring generator
      through the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] It should be appreciated that the scope of the present
      invention need not be limited to the particular scope described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Throughout the specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises"
      or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
      stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any
      other integer or group of integers.<br>

      <br>
      The invention comprises a development of rotors which are
      disclosed in Australian Patent 694679 (AU-B-62946/96) and
      International Patent Application PCT/AU00/01438 (WO 01/38697)
      which comprise a rotor which has a configuration which conforms
      generally to the curve of a logarithmic configuration
      substantially conforming to an equiangular spiral of the Golden
      Section which is also known as the Phi ratio. The contents of
      Australian patent 694679 and WO 01/38697 are incorporated herein
      by reference.<br>
      <br>
      Rotors such as impellors, propellers turbine blades and fan blades
      have scarcely changed over the years and are relatively
      inefficient. In addition, it is a common characteristic of such
      fan blades that their use results in the generation of a
      considerable amount of noise and in turbulence. Furthermore, where
      rotors are used in a liquid environment, if the rotors are caused
      to rotate too fast, this can result in cavitation on the surface
      and tips of the rotor which not only reduces the operational
      efficiency of the rotor but can result in destructive influences
      on the rotor and the surrounding housing associated with the
      rotor. Typically, rotors force fluids into centrifugal moments,
      flinging the fluid to the extremities. This is used to advantage
      in centrifugal pumps, but also results in inefficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to provide a single or
      multi-bladed rotor which can react to or induce a fluid flow and
      whereby the usage of that rotor results in a reduction of the
      degree of extraneous turbulence and tip vortices exerted on the
      fluid in its passage past the rotor with the resultant energy loss
      and noise generation when compared to conventional rotors which
      are currently in use. Typically rotors according to the invention
      cause fluids to flow centripetally rather than centrifugally and
      subsequently are able to exploit associated efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclosure of the Invention </span><br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief Description of the Drawings
      </span><br>
      <br>
      The description is made with reference to the accompanying
      drawings of which : Figure 1 is an isometric view of a rotor
      according to the first embodiment; Figure 2 is a side elevation of
      the rotor according to the first embodiment; Figure 3 is a plan
      view of the rotor according to the first embodiment; Figure 4 is
      an inverted end view of the rotor according to the first
      embodiment as shown at Figure 3;<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 is a schematic isometric view of the first embodiment
      illustrating the fluid flow that it is believed is generated by
      the rotation of the rotor Detailed Description of Several
      Embodiments Each of the embodiments of the invention comprises a
      rotor having a hub supporting at least one blade. While
      embodiments having single blades are capable of operating
      satisfactorily, additional balancing would be required to enable
      satisfactory operation. it is envisaged that multi-bladed
      embodiments would generally be preferred to avoid the difficulties
      in balancing a single bladed rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The rotors of the embodiments differ from prior art rotors by
      virtue of the blade or blades extending from the hub in an axial
      direction as well as extending transversely outwardly. Each blade
      defines a first and second surface of substantially corresponding
      configuration which conforms to at least one logarithmic curve
      conforming to the Golden Section.<br>
      <br>
      The first embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4 of the drawings
      comprises a rotor which has particular application as a propeller
      for a water craft. Alternatively, the rotor can be used as a fan,
      turbine, propeller, pump or mixer.<br>
      <br>
      As shown at Figures 1 to 4, the rotor comprises a hub (112) which
      supports a set of two blades (111) extending both radially and
      axially from the hub. The hub (112) is formed with a central shaft
      or tube which is adapted to be mounted to a rotatable shaft or
      tube which comprises, in the case of a fan blade intended to
      induce fluid flow, a drive shaft driven from a suitable motor.
      Each of the blades are formed with an internal reactive face (114)
      which is of a concave configuration and which has a three
      dimensional curvature whereby the curvature in each dimension is
      about an axis which is radial to the central axis of the rotor, an
      axis which is tangential to the central axis of the rotor and an
      axis which is coincidental or parallel to the central axis of the
      rotor. In each case the curvature is in accordance with a
      logarithmic curve conforming to the Golden Section. As a result,
      the blades (111) jointly define a generally concave internal face
      of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, each blade has a remote reactive face (115) which is
      remote from the reactive face (114) and which also has a three
      dimensional curvature of a convex nature whereby the curvature in
      each dimension conforms with a logarithmic curve according to the
      Golden Section, and whereby the curvature in each dimension is of
      the same form as the curvature of the reactive face (114) in each
      dimension. As a result, the remote faces (115) jointly define a
      generally convex surface of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of this blade arrangement, the transverse displacement
      of the surfaces at an intermediated location along the length of
      the rotor is greater than the transverse displacement at either
      end.<br>
      <br>
      It may be seen that the general appearance of the embodiment as
      shown at Figure 1 generally takes the form of pairs of shells of
      the phylum Mollusca, classes Gastropoda and Cephalopoda.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the rotation of the rotor induces a fluid
      flow which is centripetal rather than centrifugal and subsequently
      are able to exploit associated efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      It is a particular characteristic which results from the
      configuration of the blades of the rotor as described above, that
      fluid flowing relative to the blades will be directed
      centripetally, that is inwardly towards the axis. This surprising
      effect which follows from the vortical motion of the fluid
      provides a number of advantages. In particular, it is found that
      when a rotor according to the embodiment is used as a propeller
      for a water craft, it is not necessary to use a shroud or the
      extent of shrouding required is significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor according to the first embodiment is suitable for use in
      many applications such as pumping of liquids or gases, whereby
      with rotation of the rotor blade such that the one edge (116)
      forms the leading edge of each blade, fluid flow will be induced
      past the fan blade from the convex face to the concave face.
      Alternatively, the other edge (117) may form the leading edge for
      opposite rotation. Because of the curvature of the reactive face
      of each of the radial blades of the embodiment, the fan blade
      induces a vortical fluid flow in the fluid medium as it both
      approaches the rotor and as it exhausts from the rotor as
      illustrated at Figure 5.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that in use of the first embodiment the rotation
      of the rotor generates a fluid flow through the rotor in which the
      flowing fluid maintains its own inertia and if the rotor is
      stopped the fluid flow will continue through the rotor for a
      period of time because of such inertia. It is believed that this
      is at least in part due to the circumstance that the use of the
      rotor of the first embodiment results in the generation of a fluid
      flow in which the pathway for the fluid flow though the rotor (as
      distinct from conventional rotors) is constant in its geometry
      from a position in advance of the entry to the rotor to a position
      beyond the exit from the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The second embodiment shown in Figures 6 to 9 of the drawings
      comprises a rotor which also has application as a propeller for a
      water craft. Again it may also be used as a fan, pump, turbine,
      pond circulator or mixer.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in the drawings, the rotor of the second embodiment has a
      very different appearance from that of the first embodiment.
      Nevertheless, the blades have a configuration which conform in
      most respects to the configuration described in relation to the
      first embodiment. To clarify the similarities, in identifying the
      features of the embodiment as shown in the drawings, like numerals
      are used to denote like parts.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor of the second embodiment also comprises a hub (12) which
      supports a set of two blades (11) extending both radially and
      axially from the hub. The hub (12) is formed with a central shaft
      or tube which is adapted to be mounted to a rotatable shaft or
      tube which comprises, in the case of a fan blade intended to
      induce fluid flow, a drive shaft driven from a suitable motor.
      Each of the blades are formed with an internal reactive face (14)
      which is of a concave configuration and which has a three
      dimensional curvature whereby the curvature in each dimension is
      about an axis which is radial to the central axis of the rotor, an
      axis which is tangential to the central axis of the rotor and an
      axis which is coincidental or parallel to the central axis of the
      rotor. In each case the curvature is in accordance with a
      logarithmic curve conforming to the Golden Section. As a result,
      the blades (11) jointly define a generally concave intemal face of
      the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, each blade has a remote reactive face (15) which is
      remote from the intemal reactive face (14) and which also has a
      three dimensional curvature of a convex nature whereby the
      curvature in each dimension conforms with a logarithmic curve
      according to the Golden Section, and whereby the curvature in each
      dimension is of the same form as the curvature of the reactive
      face (14) in each dimension. As a result, the remote faces (15)
      jointly define a generally convex surface of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      While these features are identical to those of the first
      embodiment, the blades of the second embodiment have the
      configuration of a whorl. It will be seen from the drawings that
      the blades provided a maximum diameter near to the hub but the
      diameter then diminishes further from the hub. Figure 10
      illustrates the vortical flow induced by the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      According to a third embodiment of the invention a rotor of a
      similar form to that of the first or second embodiment is used as
      the impeller of a fluid mixer, pond circulator or bioreactor.<br>
      <br>
      According to a fourth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a
      similar form to that of the first or second embodiment is used as
      the impeller of a fluid pump.<br>
      <br>
      According to a fifth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a
      similar form to that of the first or second embodiment is used as
      the impeller of a compressor.<br>
      <br>
      According to a sixth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a
      similar form to that of the first or second embodiment is used as
      the turbine blade of a turbine.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the scope of the present invention
      need not be limited to the particular scope described above.<br>
