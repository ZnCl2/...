            Note on present frontiers of knowledge ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Gravitics is likely to follow a number of separate lines of
          development: the best known short term proposition is Townsend
          Brown's electrostatic propulsion by gravitators (details of
          which are to be found in the Appendix I). An extreme
          extrapolation of Brown's later rigs appears to suggest a Mach
          3 interceptor type aircraft. Brown called this basically force
          and motion, but it does not appear to be the road to a
          gravitational shield or reflector. His is the brute force
          approach of concentrating high electrostatic charges along the
          leading edge of the periphery of a disk which yields
          propulsive effect. Brown originally maintained that his
          gravitators operate independently of all frames of reference
          and it is motion in the absolute sense - relative to the
          universe as a whole. There is however no evidence to support
          this. In the absence of any such evidence, it is perhaps more
          convenient to think of Brown's disks as electrostatic
          propulsion which has its own niche in aviation. Electrostatic
          disks can provide lift without speed over a flat surface. This
          could be an important advance over all forms of airfoil which
          require induced flow; and lift without air flow is a
          development that deserves to be followed up in its own right,
          and one that for military purposes is already envisaged by the
          users as applicable to all three services. This point has been
          appreciated in the United States and a program in hand may now
          ensure that development of large sized disks will be
          continued. This is backed by the US Government, but it is
          something that will be pursued on a small scale. This
          acceptance follows Brown's original suggestion embodied in
          Project Winterhaven. Winterhaven recommended that a major
          effort be concentrated on electrogravitics based on the
          principle of his disks. The U.S. Government evaluated the
          disks wrongly, and misinterpreted the nature of the energy.
          This incorrect report was filed as an official assessment, and
          it took some three years to correct the earlier misconception.
          That brings developments up to the fairly recent past, and by
          that time it was realized that no effort on the lines of
          Winterhaven was practical, and that more modest aims should be
          substituted. These were re-written around a new report which
          is apparently based on newer thoughts and with some later
          patents not yet published which form the basis of current U.S.
          policy. It is a matter of some controversy whether this
          research could be accelerated by more money but the impression
          in Gravity Rand is that the base of industry is perhaps more
          than adequately wide. Already companies are specializing in
          evolution of particular components of an electrogravitics
          disk. This implies that the science is in the same state as
          the ICBM - namely that no new breakthroughs are needed, only
          intensive development engineering. This may be an optimistic
          reading of the situation: it is true that materials are now
          available for the condensers giving higher k figures than were
          postulated in Winterhaven as necessary, and all the
          ingredients necessary for the disks appear to be available.
          But industry is still some way from having an adequate power
          sources and possessing any practical experience of running
          such equipment.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The long term development of gravity shields, absorbers, and
          'magic metals' appears at the moment however to be a basically
          different problem, and work on this is not being sponsored, so
          far as is known. The absorber or shield could be intrinsically
          a weapon of a great power, the limits of which are difficult
          to foresee. The power of the device to undermine the
          electrostatic forces holding the atom together is a
          destructive by-product of military significance. In
          unpublished work Gravity Rand has indicated the possible
          effect of such a device for demolition. The likelihood of such
          work being sponsored in small countries outside the U.S. is
          slight, since there is general lack of money and resources and
          in all such countries quick returns are essential.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Many people hold that little or no progress can be made until
          the link in the Einstein unified field theory has been found.
          This is surely a somewhat defeatist view, because although no
          all embracing explanation of the relationship between the
          extraordinary variety of high energy particles continually
          being uncovered is yet available much can be done to pin down
          the general nature of anti-gravity devices.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          There are several promising approaches one of them is the
          search for negative mass, a second is to find a relationship
          between gravity and heat, and a third is to find the link
          between gravitation and the coupled particles. Taking the
          first of these: negative mass, the initial task is to prove
          the existence of negative mass, and Appendix II outlines how
          it might be done. This is Mozer's approach, which is based on
          the Schroedinger time independent equation with the center of
          mass motion removed. As the paper shows, this requires some
          100 bev - which is beyond the power of existing particle
          accelerators: however the present Russian and American nuclear
          programs envisage 50 bev bevatrons within a few years and at
          the present rate of progress in the nuclear sciences it seems
          possible that the existence of negamass will be proved by this
          method of a Bragg analysis of the crystal structure - or
          disproved.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          If negamass is established, the precise part played by the
          subnuclear particles could be quickly determined. Working
          theories have been built up to explain how negative masses
          would be repelled by positive masses and pairs would
          accelerate gaining kinetic energy until they reach the speed
          of light and then assume the role of the high energy
          particles. It has been suggested by Ferrell that this might
          explain the role of neutrino, but this seems unlikely without
          some explanation of the spin ascribed to the neutrino. Yet the
          absence of rest mass or charge of the neutrino makes it
          especially intriguing. Certainly, further study of the
          neutrino would be relevant to gravitational problems. If,
          therefore, the aircraft industry regards anti-gravity as part
          of its responsibilities it cannot escape the necessity of
          monitoring high energy physics or the neutrino. There are two
          aircraft companies definitely doing this; but little or no
          evidence that most of the others know even what a neutrino is.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The relationship between electrical charges and gravitational
          forces however will depend on the right deductions being drawn
          from excessively small anomalies (*App. VI). First clues to
          such small and hitherto unnoticed effects will come by study
          of the unified field theory. Such effects may be observed in
          work on the gravithermals, and interacting effect of heat and
          gravity. Here, at least, there is firmer evidence materials
          are capable of temperature changes depending on gravity. This,
          as Beams says, (see Appendix III) is due to results from the
          alignment of the atoms. Gravity tensions applied across the
          ends of a tube filled with electrolyte can produce heat or be
          used to furnish power. The logical extension of this is an
          absorber of gravity in the form of a flat plate and the
          gravitative flux acting on it (its atomic and molecular
          structure, its weight density and form are not, at this stage,
          clear) would lead to an increase in heat of the mass of its
          surface and subsurface particles.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The third approach is to aim at discovering a connection
          between nuclear particles and the gravitational field. This
          also returns to the need for interpreting macroscopic
          relativistic phenomena at one extreme in terms of microscopic
          quantum mechanical phenomena at the other. Beaumont in
          suggesting a solution recalls how early theory established
          rough and ready assumptions of the characteristics of electron
          spin before the whole science of the atomic orbital was worked
          out. These were based on observation and they were used with
          some effect at a time when data was needed. Similar
          assumptions of complex spin might be used to link the
          microscopic to the macroscopic. At any rate, there are some
          loose ends in complex spin to be tied up, and these could
          logically he sponsored with some expectation of results by
          companies wondering how to make a contribution.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          If a real spin or rotation is applied to a planar geoid the
          gravitational equipotentials can be made less convex, plane or
          concave. These have the effect of adjusting the intensity of
          the gravitational field at will which is a requirement for the
          gravity absorber. Beaumont seemed doubtful whether external
          power would have to be applied to achieve this. but it seems
          reasonable to suppose that power could be fed into the system
          to achieve a beneficial adjustment to the gravitational field,
          and conventional engineering methods could ensure that the
          weight of power input services would be more than offset by
          weightlessness from the spin inducer. The engineering details
          of this are naturally still in the realms of conjecture; but,
          at least, it is something that could be worked out with
          laboratory rigs; and, again, the starting point is to make
          more accurate observations of small effects. The technique
          would be to accept any anomalies in nature and from them to
          establish what would be needed to induce a spin artificially.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          It has been argued that the scientific community faces a
          seemingly impossible task in attempting to alter gravity when
          the force is set up by a body as large as this planet and that
          to change it might demand a comparable force of similar
          planetary dimensions. It was scarcely surprising therefore
          that experience had shown that while it has been possible to
          observe the effects of gravity it resisted any form of control
          or manipulation. But the time is fast approaching when for the
          first time it will be within the capability of engineers with
          bevatrons to work directly with particles that it, is
          increasingly accepted, contribute to the source of
          gravitation; and whilst that in itself may not lead to an
          absorber of gravity, it will at least throw some light on the
          sources of the power.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another task is solution (*
          See Appendix IV) of outstanding equations to convert
          gravitational phenomena to nuclear energy. The problem, still
          not yet solved may support the Bondi-Hoyle theory that
          expansion of the universe represents energy continually
          annihilated instead of being carried to the boundaries of the
          universe. This energy loss manifests itself in the behavior of
          the hyperon and K-particles which would, or might, form the
          link between the microcosm and macrocosm. Indeed Deser and
          Arnowitt propose that the new particles are a direct link
          between gravitationally produced energy and nuclear energy.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          If this were so it would be the place to begin in the search
          for practical methods of gravity manipulation. It would be
          realistic to assume that the K-particles are such a link. Then
          a possible approach might be to disregard objections which
          cannot be explained at this juncture until further unified
          field links are established. As in the case of the spin and
          orbital theories, which were naive in the beginning, the
          technique might have to accept the apparent forces and make
          theory fit observation until more is known.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Some people feel that the chances of finding such a unified
          field theory to link gravity and electrodynamics are high; yet
          think that the finding of a gravity shield is slight because
          of the size of the energy source, and because the chances of
          seeing unnoticed effects seem slender. Others feel the
          opposite and believe that a link between nuclear energy and
          gravitational energy may precede the link between the Einstein
          general relativistic and Quantum Theory disciplines. Some hope
          that both discoveries may come together; while a few believe
          that a partial explanation of both may come about the same
          time, which will afford sufficient knowledge of gravitational
          fields to perfect an interim type of absorber using field
          links that are available.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This latter seems the more likely since it is already
          beginning to happen. There is not likely to be any sudden full
          explanation of the microcosm and macrocosm; but one strand
          after another joining them will be fashioned, as progress is
          made towards quantizing the Einstein theory.</font>

            Note on the Gravitics Situation ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The present anti-gravity situation as one of watching and
          waiting by the large aircraft prime contractors for lofting
          inventions or technological breakthroughs. Clarence Birdseye
          in one of his last utterances thought that an insulator might
          be discovered by accident by someone working on a quite
          different problem; and in 500 years gravity insulators would
          be commonplace. One might go further than Birdseye and say
          that principles of the insulator would, by then, be
          fundamental to human affairs; it would be as basic to the
          society as the difference today between the weight of one
          metal and another. But at the same time it would be wrong to
          infer from Birdseye's remark that a sudden isolated discovery
          will be the key to the science. The hardware will come at a
          time when the industry is ready and waiting for it. It will
          arrive after a long period of getting accustomed to thinking
          in terms of weightlessness, and naturally it will appear after
          the feasibility of achieving it in one form or another has
          been established in theory. (* But this does not mean that
          harnessed forces will be necessarily fully understood at the
          outset.)</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The aim of companies at this stage must therefore surely be to
          monitor the areas of progress in the world of high energy
          physics which seem likely to lead to establishment of the
          foundations of anti-gravity. This means keeping a watchful eye
          on electrogravitics, magnetogravitics, gravitics isotopes; and
          electrostatics in various forms for propulsion or levitation.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This is not at the present stage a very expensive business,
          and investment in laboratory man-hours is necessary only when
          a certain line of reasoning which may look promising comes to
          a dead-end for lack of experimental data, or only when it
          might be worth running some laboratory tests to bridge a chasm
          between one part of a theory and another or in connecting two
          or more theories together. If this is right, anti-gravity is
          in a state similar to nuclear propulsion after the NEPA
          findings, yet before the ANP project got under way. It will be
          remembered that was the period when the Atomic Energy
          Commission sponsored odd things here and there that needed
          doing. But it would be misleading to imply that hardware
          progress on electrostatic disks is presently so far along as
          nuclear propulsion was in that state represented by ANP. True
          the NEPA men came to the conclusion that a nuclear-propelled
          aircraft of a kind could be built, but it would be only a
          curiosity. Even at the time of the Lexington and Whitman
          reports it was still some way from fruition: the aircraft
          would have been more than a curiosity but not competitive
          enough to be seriously considered.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          It is not in doubt that work on anti-gravity is in the realm
          of the longer term future. One of the tests of virility of an
          industry is the extent to which it is so self confident of its
          position that it can afford to sponsor R&amp;D which cannot
          promise a quick return. A closing of minds to anything except
          lines of development that will provide a quick return is a
          sign of either a strait-laced economy or of a pure lack of
          prescience, (or both).</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Another consideration that will play its part in managerial
          decision is that major turning points in anti-gravity work are
          likely to prove far removed from the tools of the aircraft
          engineer. A key instrument for example that may determine the
          existence of negamass and establish posimass-negamass
          interaction is the super bevatron. It needs some 100 bev
          gammas on hydrogen to perform a Bragg analysis of the
          elementary particle structure by selective reflection to prove
          the existence of negamass. This value is double as much the
          new Russian bevatron under construction and it is 15 times as
          powerful as the highest particle accelerations in the Berkeley
          bevatron so far attained. Many people think that nothing much
          can be done until negamass has been observed. If industry were
          to adopt this approach it would have a long wait and a quick
          answer at the end. But the negamass-posimass theory can be
          further developed; and, in anticipation of its existence,
          means of using it in a gravitationally neutralized body could
          be worked out. This, moreover, is certainly not the only
          possible approach: a breakthrough may well come in the
          interaction between gravitative action and heat theory at the
          moment suggests that if gravity could produce heat the effect
          is limited at the moment to a narrow range (* See Appendix V).
          But the significant thing would be establishment of a
          principle.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          History may repeat itself thirty years ago, and even as
          recently as the German attempts to produce nuclear energy in
          the war, nobody would have guessed that power would be
          unlocked by an accident at the high end of the atomic table.
          All prophecies of atomic energy were concerned with how
          quickly means of fusion could be applied at the low end. In
          anti-gravity work, and this goes back to Birdseye, it may be
          an unrelated accident that will be the means of getting into
          the gravitational age. It is a prime responsibility of
          management to be aware of possible ways of using theory to
          accelerate such a process. In other words, serendipity.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          It is a common thought in industry to look upon the nuclear
          experience as a precedent for gravity, and to argue that
          gravitics will similarly depend on the use of giant tools,
          beyond the capabilities of the air industry and that companies
          will edge into the gravitational age on the coat-tails of the
          Government as industry has done, or is doing, in nuclear
          physics. But this over looks the point that the two sciences
          are likely to be different in their investment. It will not
          need a place like Hanford or Savannah River to produce a
          gravity shield or insulator once the knowhow has been
          established. As a piece of conceptual engineering the project
          is probably likely to be much more like a repetition of the
          turbine engine. It will be simple in its essence, but the
          detailed componentry will become progressively more complex to
          interpret in the form of a stable flying platform and even
          more intricate when it comes to applying the underlying
          principles to a flexibility of operating altitude ranging from
          low present flight speeds at one extreme to flight in a vacuum
          at the other. This latter will be the extreme test of its
          powers. Again the principle itself will function equally in a
          vacuum - Townsend Brown's saucers could move in a vacuum
          readily enough - but the supporting parts must also work in a
          vacuum. In practice, they tend to give trouble, just as gas
          turbine bits and pieces start giving trouble in proportion to
          the altitude gained in flight.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          But one has to see this rise in complexity with performance
          and with altitude attainment in perspective: eventually the
          most advanced capability may be attained with the most
          extremely simple configurations. As is usual however in
          physics developments the shortest line of progress is a
          geodesic, which may in turn lead the propulsion trade into
          many roundabout paths as being the shortest distance between
          aims and achievement.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          But aviation business is understandably interested in knowing
          precisely how to recognize early discoveries of significance
          and this Gravity Rand report is intended to try and outline
          some of the more promising lines. One suggestion frequently
          made is that propulsion and levitation may be only the last -
          though most important - of a series of others, some of which
          will have varying degrees of gravitic element in their
          constitution. It may be that the first practical application
          will be in the greater freedom of communications offered by
          the change in wave technique that it implies. A second
          application is to use the wave technique for anti-submarine
          detection, either airborne or seaborne. This would combine the
          width of horizon in search radar with the underwater precision
          of Magnetic Airborne Detection, and indeed it may have the
          range of scatter transmissions. Chance discoveries in the
          development of this equipment may lead to the formulation of
          new laws which would define the relationship of gravity in
          terms of usable propulsion symbols. Exactly how this would
          happen nobody yet knows and what industry and government can
          do at this stage is to explore all the possible applications
          simultaneously, putting pressure where results seem to warrant
          it.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In a paper of this kind it is not easy to discuss the details
          of the wave technique in communications, and the following are
          some of theories, briefly stated which require no mathematical
          training to understand, which it would be worth management
          keeping an eye on. In particular, watch should be made of
          quantitative tests on lofting, and beneficiation of material.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Even quite small beneficiation ratios are likely to be
          significant. There are some lofting claims being made of 20%
          and more, and the validity of these will have to be weighed
          carefully. Needless to say much higher ratios than this will
          have to be attained. New high-k techniques and extreme-k
          materials are significant. High speeds in electrostatic
          propulsion of small discs will be worth keeping track of (by
          high speed one means hundreds of mph) and some of these
          results are beginning to filter through for general
          evaluation. Weight mass anomalies, new oil-cooled cables,
          interesting megavolt gimmicks, novel forms of electrostatic
          augmentation with, hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon fuels are
          indicative, new patents under the broadest headings of force
          and motion may have value, new electrostatic generator
          inventions could tip the scales and unusual ways of turning
          condensers inside-out, new angular propulsion ideas for
          barycentric control; and generally certain types of saucer
          configuration are valuable pointers to ways minds are working.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Then there is the personnel reaction to such developments.
          Managements are in the hands of their technical men, and they
          should beware of technical teams who are dogmatic at this
          state. To assert electrogravitics is nonsense; is as unreal as
          to say it is practically extant. Management should be careful
          of men in their employ with a closed mind - or even partially
          closed mind - on the subject.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This is a dangerous age: when not only is anything possible,
          but it is possible quickly. A wise Frenchman once said you
          have only to live long enough to see everything 'and the
          reverse of everything;' and that is true in dealing with very
          advanced high energy physics of this kind.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Scientists are not politicians: they can reverse themselves
          once with acclaim - twice even with impunity. They may have to
          do so in the long road to attainment of this virtually perfect
          air vehicle. It is so easy to get bogged down with problems of
          the present; and whilst policy has to be made essentially with
          the present in mind - and in aviation a conservative policy
          always pays - it is management's task and duty to itself to
          look as far ahead as the best of its technicians in assessing
          the posture of the industry.</font>

          member (Townsend Brown's definition).</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Lofting: the action of levitation where gravity's force is
          more than overcome by electrostatic or other propulsion.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Beneficiation: the treatment of an alloy or substance to leave
          it with an improved mass-weight ratio.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Counterbary: this, apparently, is another name for lofting.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Barycentric control: the environment for regulation of lofting
          processes in a vehicle.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Modulation: the contribution to lofting conferred on a vehicle
          by, treatment of the substance of its construction as distinct
          from that added to it by outside forces. Lofting is a
          synthesis of intrinsic and extrinsic agencies.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Absorber; insulator: these terms - there is no formal
          distinction between them as yet - are based on an analogy with
          electromagnetism. This is a questionable assumption since the
          similarity between electromagnetic and gravitational fields is
          valid only in some respects such as both having electric and
          magnetic elements. But the difference in coupling strengths,
          noted by many experimenters, is fundamental to the science.
          Gravity moreover may turn out to be the only non-quantized
          field in nature, which would make it, basically, unique. The
          borrowing of terms from the field of electromagnetism is
          therefore only a temporary convenience. Lack of Cartesian
          representation makes this a baffling science for many people.</font>

          Shield: a device which not only opposes gravity (such as an
          absorber) but also furnishes an essential path along which or
          through which, gravity can act. Thus whereas absorbers
          reflectors and insulators can provide a gravitationally
          neutralized body, a shield would enable a vehicle or sphere to
          'fall away' in proportion to the quantity of shielding
          material.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Screening: gravity screening was implied by Lanczos. It is the
          result of any combination of electric or magnetic fields in
          which one or both elements are not subject to varying
          permeability in matter.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Reflector: a device consisting of material capable of
          generating buoyant forces which balance the force of
          attraction. The denser the material, the greater the buoyancy
          force. When the density of the material equals the density of
          the medium the result will be gravitationally neutralized. A
          greater density of material assumes a lofting role.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Electrogravitics: the application of modulating influences in

Summary




            of Townsend Brown's Original Patent Specification, "A Method
            of and an Apparatus or Machine for Producing Force or
            Motion" ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This invention relates to a method of controlling gravitation
          and for deriving power therefrom, and to a method of producing
          linear force or motion. The method is fundamentally
          electrical.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention also relates to
          machines or apparatus requiring electrical energy - that
          control or influence the gravitational field or the energy of
          gravitation; also to machines or apparatus requiring
          electrical energy that exhibit a linear force or motion which
          is believed to be independent of all frames of reference save
          that which is at rest relative to the universe taken as a
          whole, and said linear force or motion is furthermore believed
          to have no equal and opposite reaction that can be observed by
          any method commonly known and accepted by the physical science
          to date.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such a machine has two major
          parts A and B. These parts may be composed of any material
          capable of being charged electrically. Mass A and mass B may
          be termed electrodes A and B respectively. Electrode A is
          charged negatively with respect to electrode B, or what is
          substantially the same, electrode B is charged positively with
          respect to electrode A, or what isusually the case, electrode
          A has an excess of electrons while electrode B has an excess
          of protons.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          While charged in this manner the total force of A toward B is
          the sum of force g (due to the normal gravitational field),
          and force e (due to the imposed electrical field) and force x
          (due to the resultant of the unbalanced gravitational forces
          caused by the electro-negative charge or by the presence of an
          excess of electrons of electrode A and by the electro-positive
          charge or by the presence of an excess of protons on electrode
          B).</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          By the cancellation of similar and opposing forces and by the
          addition of similar and allied forces the two electrodes taken
          collectively possess a force 2x in the direction of B. This
          force 2x, shared by both electrodes, exists as a tendency of
          these electrodes to move or accelerate in the direction of the
          force, that is, A toward B and B away from A. Moreover any
          machine or apparatus possessing electrodes A and B will
          exhibit such a lateral acceleration or motion if free to move.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In this Specification I have used terms as 'gravitator cells'
          and 'gravitator cellular body' which are words of my own
          coining in making reference to the particular type of cell I
          employ in the present invention. Wherever the construction
          involves the use of a pair of electrodes, separated by an
          insulating plate or member, such construction complies with
          the term gravitator cells, and when two or more gravitator
          cells are connected in series within a body, such will fall
          within the meaning of gravitator cellular body.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The electrodes A and B are shown as having placed between them
          an insulating plate or member C of suitable material, such
          that the minimum number of electrons or ions may successfully
          penetrate it. This constitutes a cellular gravitator
          consisting of one gravitator cell.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          It will be understood that, the cells being spaced substantial
          distances apart, the separation of adjacent positive and
          negative elements of separate cells is greater than the
          separation of the positive and negative elements of any cell
          and the materials of which the cells are formed being the more
          readily affected by the phenomena underlying my invention than
          the mere space between adjacent cells, any forces existing
          between positive and negative elements of adjacent cells can
          never become of sufficient magnitude to neutralize or balance
          the force created by the respective cells adjoining said
          spaces. The uses to which such a motor, wheel or rotor may be
          put are practically limitless, as can be readily understood,
          without further description. The structure may suitably be
          called a gravitator motor of cellular type.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In keeping with the purpose of my invention an apparatus may
          employ the electrodes A and B within a vacuum tube. Electrons,
          ion, or thermions can migrate readily from A to B. The
          construction may be appropriately termed an electronic, ionic,
          or thermionic gravitator as the case may be.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In certain of the last named types of gravitator units it is
          desirable or necessary to heat to incandescence the whole or a
          part of electrode A to obtain better emission of negative
          thermions or electrons or at least to be able to control that
          emission by variation in the temperature of said electrode A.
          Since such variations also influence the magnitude of the
          longitudinal force or acceleration exhibited by the tube, it
          proves to be a very convenient method of varying this effect
          and of electrically controlling the motion of the tube.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The electrode A may be heated to incandescence in any
          convenient way as by the ordinary methods utilizing electrical
          resistance or electrical induction.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Moreover, in certain types of the gravitator units, now being
          considered it is advantageous or necessary also to conduct
          away from the anode or positive electrode B excessive heat
          that may be generated during the operation. Such cooling is
          effected externally by means of air or water cooled flanges
          that are in thermo connection with the anode, or it is
          effected internally by passing a stream of water, air, or
          other fluid through a hollow anode made especially for that
          purpose.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The gravitator motors may be supplied with the necessary
          electrical energy for the operation and resultant motion
          thereof from sources outside and independent of the motor
          itself. In such instances they constitute external or
          independently excited motors. On the other hand, the motors
          when capable of creating sufficient power to generate by any
          method whatsoever all the electrical energy required therein
          for the operation of said motors are distinguished by being
          internal or self-excited. Here it will be understood that the
          energy created by the operation of the motor may at times be
          vastly in excess of the energy required to operate the motor.
          In some instances the ratio may be even as high as a million
          to one. Inasmuch as any suitable means for supplying the
          necessary electrical energy, and suitable conducting means for
          permitting the energy generated by the motor to exert the
          expected influence on the same may be readily supplied, it is
          now deemed necessary to illustrate details herein. In said
          self-excited motors the energy necessary to overcome the
          friction or other resistance in the physical structure of the
          apparatus, and even to accelerate the motors against such
          resistance, is believed to be derived solely from the
          gravitational field or the energy of gravitation. Furthermore,
          said acceleration in the self excited gravitator motor can be
          harnessed mechanically so as to produce usable energy or
          power, said usable energy or power, as aforesaid, being
          derived from or transferred by the apparatus solely from the
          energy of gravitation.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The gravitator motors function as a result of the mutual and
          unidirectional forces exerted by their charged electrodes. The
          direction of these forces and the resultant motion thereby
          produced are usually toward the positive electrode. This
          movement is practically linear. It is this primary action with
          which I deal.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          As has already been pointed out herein, there are two ways in
          which this primary action can accomplish mechanical work.
          First, by operating in a linear path as it does naturally, or
          second, by operating in a curved path. Since the circle is the
          most easily applied of all the geometric figures, it follows
          that the rotary form is the important.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          There are three general rules to follow in the construction of
          such motors.First, the insulating sheets should be as thin as
          possible and yet have a relatively high puncture voltage. It
          is advisable also to use paraffin saturated insulators on
          account of their high specific resistance. Second, the
          potential difference between any two metallic plates should be
          as high as possible and yet be safely under the minimum
          puncture voltage of the insulator. Third, there should in most
          cases be as many plates as possible in order that the
          saturation voltage of the system might be raised well above
          the highest voltage limit upon which the motor is operated.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Reference has previously been made to the fact that in the
          preferred embodiment of the invention herein disclosed the
          movement is towards the positive electrode. However, it will
          be clear that motion may be had in a reverse direction
          determined by what I have just termed 'saturation voltage' by
          which is meant the efficiency peak or maximum of action for
          that particular type of motor; the theory, as I may describe
          it, being that as the voltage is increased the force or action
          increases to a maximum which represents the greatest action in
          a negative to positive direction. If the voltage were
          increased beyond that maximum the action would decrease to
          zero and thence to the positive to negative direction.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The rotary motor comprises, broadly speaking, an assembly of a
          plurality of linear motors fastened to or bent around the
          circumference of a wheel. In that case the wheel limits the
          action of the linear motors to a circle, and the wheel rotates
          in the manner of a fireworks pin wheel.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          I declare that what I claim is:</font> <br>

            Quantum Mechanical Approach to the Existence of Negative
            Mass and Its Utilization in the Construction of
            Gravitationally Neutralized Bodies ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Since the overwhelming majority of electrostatic quantum
          mechanical effects rely for their existence on an interplay of
          attractive and repulsive forces arising from two types of
          charge, few if any fruitful results could come from a quantum
          mechanical investigation of gravity, unless there should be
          two types of mass. The first type, positive mass; (hereafter
          denoted a posimass) retains all the properties attributed to
          ordinary mass, while the second type, negative mass (hereafter
          denoted as negamass) differs only in that its mass is an
          inherently negative quantity.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          By considering the quantum mechanical effects of the existence
          of these two types of mass, a fruitful theory of gravity will
          be developed. Theory will explain why negamass has never been
          observed, and will offer a theoretical foundation to
          experimental methods of detecting the existence of negamass
          and utilizing it in the production of gravitationally
          neutralized bodies.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To achieve these results,
          recourse will be made to Schroedinger's time independent
          equation with the center of mass motion removed. This equation
          is:</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          -h2/2µ?2ß+Vß = Eß</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          where all symbols represent the conventional quantum
          mechanical quantities. Particular attention will be paid to
          the reduced mass µ=(m1m2)/(m1+m2) where m1 and m2 are the
          masses of the two interacting bodies.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          One can approach the first obstacle that any theory of
          negamass faces, namely the explanation of why negamass has
          never been observed, by a consideration of how material bodies
          would be formed if a region of empty space were suddenly
          filled with many posimass and negamass quanta. To proceed
          along these lines, one must first understand the nature of the
          various possible quantum mechanical interactions of posimass
          and negamass.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Inserting the conventional gravitational interaction potential
          into Schroedinger's equation and solving for the wave function
          ß, yields the result that the probability of two posimass
          quanta being close together is greater than the probability of
          their being separated. Hence, there is said to be an
          attraction between pairs of posimass quanta. By a similar
          calculation it can be shown that while the potential form is
          the same two negamass quanta repel each other. This arises
          from the fact that the reduced mass term in Schroedinger's
          equation is negative in this latter case. The type of negamass
          posimass interaction is found to depend on the relative sizes
          of the masses of the interacting posimass and negamass quanta,
          being repulsive if the mass of the negamass quantum is greater
          in absolute value than the mass of the posimass quantum, and
          attractive in the opposite case. If the two masses are equal
          in absolute value the reduced mass is infinite and
          Schroedinger's equation reduces to (V - E)ß - 0. Since the
          solution ß - 0 is uninteresting physically, it must be
          concluded that V - E, and, hence, there is no kinetic energy
          of relative motion. Thus, while there is an interaction
          potential between the equal mass posimass and negamass quanta,
          it results in no relative acceleration and thus, no mutual
          attraction or repulsion while much could be said about the
          philosophical implications of the contradiction between this
          result and Newton's Second Law, such discussion is out of the
          scope of the present paper, and the author shall, instead,
          return with the above series of derivations to a consideration
          of the construction of material bodies in a region suddenly
          filled with many posimass and negamass quanta.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Because of the nature of the posimass-posimass and
          negamass-negamass interactions, the individual posimass quanta
          soon combine into small posimass spheres, while nothing has,
          as yet, united any negamass quanta. Since it is reasonable to
          assume that a posimass sphere weighs more than a negamass
          quantum in absolute value, it will attract negamass quanta and
          begin to absorb them. This absorption continues until the
          attraction between a sphere and the free negamass quanta
          becomes zero due to the reduced mass becoming infinite. The
          reduced mass becomes infinite when the sphere absorbs enough
          negamass quanta to make the algebraic sum of the masses of its
          component posimass and negamass quanta equal to the negative
          of the mass of the next incoming negamass quantum. Thus the
          theory predicts that all material bodies after absorbing as
          many negamass quanta as they can hold, weigh the same very
          small amount, regardless of size.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Since this prediction is in violent disagreement with
          experimental fact, one must conclude that the equilibrium
          arising as a result of the reduced mass becoming infinite has
          not yet been reached. That is, assuming that negamass exists
          at all, there are not enough negamass quanta present in the
          universe to allow posimass spheres to absorb all the negamass
          they can hold. One is thus able to explain the experimental
          fact that negamass has never been observed by deriving the
          above mechanism in which the smaller amounts of negamass that
          may be present in the universe are strongly absorbed by the
          greater amounts of posimass producing bodies composed of both
          posimass and negamass, but which have a net positive,
          variable, total mass.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Having thus explained why negamass has never been observed in
          the pure state, it is next desirable to derive an experimental
          test of the existence of negamass through considering the
          internal quantum mechanical problem of small amounts of
          negamass in larger posimass spheres. One is able to gain much
          physical insight into this problem by simplifying it to the
          qualitatively similar problem of one negamass quantum in the
          field of two posimass quanta that are fixed distance apart.
          Further simplification from three dimensions to one dimension
          and replacement of the posimass quanta potentials by square
          barriers, yields a solution in which the ground state energy
          E0 of the negamass quantum in the field of one posimass
          quantum, is split into two energy levels in the field of the
          two posimass quanta. These two levels correspond to even and
          odd parity solutions of the wave equation where Eeven lies
          higher and Eodd lower than E0. The magnitudes of the
          differences Eeven-E0 and E0-Eodd depend on the separation
          distance between the two posimass quanta, being zero for
          infinite separation and increasing as this separation distance
          is decreased.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the energy of a system
          involving negamass tends to a maximum in the most stable
          quantum mechanical configuration, the negamass quantum will
          normally be in state Eeven. When the system is excited into
          state Eodd, the negamass quantum will favor the situation in
          which the two posimass quanta are as far apart as possible,
          since Eodd increases with increasing separation distance
          between the two posimass quanta, and the system tends toward
          the highest energy state. Thus independent of and in addition
          to the attractive posimass posimass gravitational interaction,
          there is a repulsive quantum mechanical exchange interaction
          between pairs of posimass quanta when the system is in state
          Eodd. The result of these two oppositely directed interactions
          is that the two posimass quanta are in stable equilibrium at
          some separation distance.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Since this equilibrium occurs between all posimass pairs in an
          elementary particle, a necessary consequence of the existence
          of negamass is that when in the first excited state elementary
          particles have a partial crystal structure.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This theoretical conclusion is capable of experimental
          verification by performing a Bragg analysis of the elementary
          particle crystal structure through shining high energy gamma
          rays on hydrogen. Part of the gamma ray energy will be
          utilized in lowering the system from energy Eeven to Eodd, and
          if selective reflection is observed, it will constitute a
          striking verification of the existence of negamass. An order
          of magnitude calculation shows that, if the equilibrium
          distance between pairs of posimass quanta is one one-millionth
          the radius of an electron, 100 bev gamma rays will be required
          to perform this experiment.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Having discussed why negamass has never been observed, and
          having derived an experimental test of its existence it is
          next desirable to develop an experimental method of utilizing
          negamass in the production of gravitationally neutralized
          bodies by further consideration of some ideas previously
          advanced. It has been pointed out that if a source of negamass
          is present, aposimass sphere continues to absorb negamass
          quanta until equilibrium is reached as a result of the reduced
          mass becoming infinite. Because the sphere thus produced is
          practically massless and because the gravitational interaction
          between two bodies is proportional to the product of their
          respective masses, it follows that the sphere is practically
          unaffected by the presence of other bodies. And thus, the
          problem of making gravitationally neutralized bodies is
          reduced to the problem of procuring a source of negamass
          quanta. This will be the next problem discussed.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The binding energy of a negamass quantum in a posimass sphere
          may be obtained as one of the eigenvalue solutions to
          Schroedinger's Equation. If the negamass quanta in a body are
          excited to energies in excess of this binding energy by
          shining sufficiently energetic gamma rays on the body these
          negamass quanta will be emitted and negamass source will thus
          be obtained.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          To estimate the gamma ray energy required to free a negamass
          quantum from a posimass body, certain assumptions must be made
          concerning the size and mass of posimass and negamass quanta.
          Since these quantities are extremely indefinite, and since the
          whole theory is at best qualitative, attempting to estimate
          the energy would be a senseless procedure. Suffice it to say
          that because of the intimate, sub-elementary particle nature
          of the posimass-negamass interaction, it seems reasonable to
          assume that quite energetic gamma rays will be required to
          break this strong bond.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          To briefly review what has been shown a quantum mechanical
          theory of negamass has been developed based on the assumptions
          that gravitational interactions obey the laws of quantum
          mechanics and that all possible interactions of negamass and
          posimass with themselves and each other follow the well known
          inverse square law. This theory explains the experimental fact
          that negamass has never been observed, and outlines plausible
          experimental methods of determining the existence of negamass
          and utilizing it in the construction of gravitationally
          neutralized bodies. While these experimental methods may
          perhaps be out of the realm of practicality at the present,
          there is every reason to hope that they will be performable in
          the future. At that time, the plausibility of the existence of
          negamass and the theory behind the construction of
          gravitationally neutralized bodies from it, will meet their
          final tests.</font> <br>

Gravity




            Effects ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          The order of magnitude of the heat given off by an alloy as a
          result of the separation by gravity tension can be reliably
          estimated. Suppose we assume that an alloy of half tin and
          half lead completely fills a tube 5 meters long and 100 cm2
          cross section which is maintained accurately at a temperature
          277° C. At this temperature the alloy is liquid suppose next
          that the tube is raised from a horizontal plane into a
          vertical position, i.e. to a position where its length is
          parallel to the direction of gravity. If, then, the alloy is
          free from convection as it would be if it is maintained at
          uniform temperature and if it is held in this position for
          several months, the percentage of tin at the bottom of the
          tube will decrease while the relative amount at the top will
          increase. A simple calculation shows that the concentration of
          tin at the top is about one tenth of one percent greater than
          at the bottom and that approximately one calorie of heat is
          given off in the separation progress. If after several months
          the tube is again placed so that its length is in a horizontal
          plane the tin and lead will remix due to the thermal agitation
          of the atoms and heat is absorbed by the alloy.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Another interesting effect occurs when an electrolyte is
          subjected to gravity tension. Suppose a five meter glass tube
          is filled with a water solution of say barium chloride and the
          electrical potential between its ends is measured first when
          the length of the tube is parallel to the horizontal and
          second when its length is vertical. The difference in
          potential between the two ends is practically zero when the
          tube i horizontal and approximately eighty five microvolts
          when it is vertical.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          This effect was discovered by Des Coudres in 1892. If a
          resistor is attached across the ends when the tube is
          vertical, heat of course is produced. If the tube is
          maintained at constant temperature the voltage decreases with
          time and eventually vanishes. The effect is believed to result
          from the fact that the positively charged barium ions settle
          faster than the lighter negatively charged chlorine ions as a
          result of gravity tension.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In conclusion, we have seen that gravity tension effects an
          alloy in such a way that it gives off heat. This phenomenon
          results from the alignment of the atoms and from their
          separation by the gravitational field, the contribution of the
          latter being larger than that of the former. Also, the gravity
          tension sets up a potential across the ends of a tube filled
          with an electrolyte and this potential when applied across an
          external circuit may produce heat or drive an electric motor
          to furnish power. Several other small thermal effects possibly
          may arise from gravity tension in addition to those discussed
          above but space is not available to consider them in this
          essay. Also, studies of the effect of gravitational fields and
          their equivalent centrifugal fields upon matter will no doubt
          be of great value in the future.</font> <br>

            Between Gravitation &amp; Nuclear Energy ~</font></b> <br>

          by Dr Stanley Deser &amp; Dr Richard Arnowitt</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Quantitatively we propose the following field equations:</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          -kTuv = Ruv +.5Rguv + Cuv(Ø)</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          (.5u?ju + m + LPuvKuv(X)) = 0</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          with a similar equation for Ø. In the above,  represents the
          hyperon wave functions and Ø the K-particle quantized field
          operators. The first three terms in the first equation are the
          usual structures in the Einstein General Relativity. The last
          term, Cuv is the "creation" tensor which is to give us our
          conversion from gravitational to nuclear energy. It is like
          Tuv in being an energy momentum term. In the second equation
          ?ju represents the covariant derivative while u is a
          generalized Dirac matrix arranged so that the second equation
          is indeed covariant under the general group of coordinate
          transformations. The PuvKuv term will automatically include
          the higher hyperon levels. Cuv is a functional of the hyperon
          and K-field variables  and Ø. As can be seen these equations
          are coupled in two ways first the creation term Cuv depends
          upon the field variables  and Ø while the gravitational
          metric tensor guv enters through the covariant derivative,
          etc. L is a new universal constant giving the scale of the
          level spacings of the hyperons. Rigorously speaking the field
          equations should be, of course, second quantized. For purposes
          of obtaining a workable first approximation it is probably
          adequate to take expectation values and solve the
          semi-classical equations. The creation tensor Cuv must be a
          bilinear integral of the Ø and  fields and may have cross
          terms as well of the form Ø(dx). These equations will
          indeed be difficult to solve; but upon solution will give the
          distribution of created energy and, hence, lead eventually to
          the more practical issues desired.</font>

Gravity/Heat




            Interaction ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          Let us suppose that we have to investigate the question
          whether gravitative action alone upon some given substance or
          alloy can produce heat. We do not specify its texture, density
          nor atomic structure; we assume simply the flux of gravitative
          action followed by an increase of heat in the alloy.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          If we assume a small circular surface on the alloy, then the
          gravitative flux on it may be expressed by Gauss' theorem and
          it is 4¼M,where M represents mass of all sub-surface
          particles; the question is, can this expression be transformed
          into heat. We will assume it can be. Now recalling the
          relativity law connecting mass and energy:</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          M = m0 + T/c2 (by Einstein)</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          where:- T = Kinetic energy</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          m = Initial mass</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          c = Velocity of Light</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          we set 4¼M = m0 +T/c2 = m0 + (m0v2)/2c2</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          But v2/c2 is a proper fraction: hence M = m0 + m0/2k</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          In the boundary case v=c, M=m0(1+1/k) for all other cases
          4¼M=m0((k+1)/k)k k0. Strictly M should be preceded by a
          conversion factor 1/k but if inserted, it does not alter
          results. Thus if gravity could produce heat, the effect is
          limited to a narrow range, as this result shows.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          It merits stress that in a gravitational field the flow lines

Weight-Mass




            Anomaly ~</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><br>
          There is a great need for a precise experimental determination
          of the weight to mass ratio of protons or electrons. Since the
          ratio for a proton plus an electron is known already, the
          determination of the ratio for either particle is sufficient.
          The difficulty of a direct determination of the gravitational
          deflection of a charged particle in an experiment similar to
          the neutron or neutral atom experiment is due to electrical
          forces being much greater than gravitational forces. For
          example, one electron five meters away from a second electron
          exerts as much force on that second electron as the
          gravitational field does. Thus stray electrons or ions which
          are always present on the walls of an apparatus can exert
          sufficient force to completely mask the gravitational force.
          Even if the surface charges are neglected, image charges of
          the electron beam itself and self-repulsion in the beam may
          obscure the gravitational deflection. An additional problem is
          the Earth's magnetic field. Electrons of even a few volts
          energy will feel a force due to the Earth's field a thousand
          billion times larger than the gravitational deflection. This
          last problem is avoided in a static measurement of the ratio
          such as a weighing of ionized matter. However, this last
          method has the additional difficulty of requiring a high
          proportion of ionized to unionized matter in the sample being
          weighed. Of course all these problems can be resolved to some
          extent; but it is questionable if an experiment of either of
          the above types can be designed in which all the adverse
          effects can simultaneously be sufficiently minimized. Probably
          a completely new type of experiment will have to be devised to
          measure the weight to mass ratio of the proton or electron.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such a measurement may detect
          a deviation from the law of constant weight to mass ratio. If
          such an anomaly can be shown to exist there is the possibility
          of finding a material which would be acted upon in an unusual
          manner in a gravitational field.</font> <br>
