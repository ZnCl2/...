      <i>A British invention can cut energy costs by up to 20pc, reports
        Rebecca Burn-Callander</i><i>. Steve Lindsey, founder of Lontra,
        hopes to revolutionise the engine with his energy-saving
        invention. </i><br>
      <br>
      The internal combustion engine has seen little innovation since
      Felix Wankel’s contentious rotary effort back in the 1950s. That
      is not for want of trying. According to Google’s patent library,
      which indexes data from the European Patent Office, the World
      Intellectual Property Organization and patent agencies in China,
      Germany, Canada, there are as many as 10m piston and
      compressor-related patents on record.<br>
      <br>
      After more than half a century of stagnation, however, the engine
      is getting a makeover. Entrepreneur and technologist Steve Lindsey
      has spent the past 10 years testing a new invention that aims to
      make engines up to 20pc more efficient. “Most industries try to
      optimise for a 1pc to 2pc increase in efficiency – 20pc is unheard
      of,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      His Blade Compressor replaces the old “up and down” piston
      technology with a circular widget that compresses the air – or gas
      – in front and induces the air behind in continuous motion,
      minimising wastage. The technology can be applied to any kind of
      engine, from the compressor in your fridge to a car engine,
      potentially revolutionising everything from coffee machines to
      battleships.<br>
      <br>
      “Every compressor out there gets something wrong,” says Mr
      Lindsey. “Either the air is wasted, or it’s not compressed
      properly. But the beauty of this design is that it is so simple.
      There’s no magic in terms of material. If the Victorians had
      thought of it, they could have made it.”<br>
      <br>
      To commercialise the technology, Mr Lindsey created Lontra, an
      intellectual property (IP) company based in Napton, near Coventry.
      The Midlands location was key. “This is where the UK’s high- tech
      engineering skills are,” he says. “Lots of ex-Cosworth, [Mahle]
      Powertrain and Formula One engineers are based in the area.”<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The decision to launch an IP firm, rather than a manufacturer, was
      based on the sheer volume of applications for the Blade
      Compressor. “You have to be pragmatic about these things,” says Mr
      Lindsey. “We didn’t want to sell to consumers, we wanted to work
      with global companies from the outset. But big corporates like to
      buy from other big corporates, not small start-ups. There’s an
      access to market issue. The logical route, therefore, was
      licensing to a global engineering group.”<br>
      <br>
      Mr Lindsey decided to set his sights on the water industry. Sewage
      processing is very energy-intensive. Waste water is cleaned using
      aeration, whereby air is pumped into tanks to encourage the growth
      of bacteria that then consume waste matter. Over 1pc of the UK’s
      total energy consumption goes on waste water treatment, and well
      over half of that goes on blowers alone.<br>
      <br>
      But finding a big water company to take a chance on your untried
      technology – on an industrial scale, too – can be tricky. Luckily,
      Lontra’s green credentials opened doors at the Carbon Trust, which
      helped to broker a deal with Severn Trent to test the technology
      in one of the company’s blowers.<br>
      <br>
      In November 2012, a prototype Blade Compressor went into a Severn
      Trent production plant at Worcester sewage works. The water group
      originally agreed to keep the prototype installed for a limited
      period, but the trial was so successful that chief executive Tony
      Wray decided to keep it running. The machine has now logged more
      than 10,000 hours.<br>
      <br>
      In his annual results statement last year, Mr Wray credited the
      Lontra technology for a 3pc reduction in the firm’s electricity
      bill. He added that if all of Severn Trent’s blowers were equipped
      with the Blade Compressor, its £9m spend on energy would shrink by
      £1.8m. The experiment won Mr Lindsey the most innovative new
      technology of the year award at the Water Industry Achievement
      Awards and the Carbon Trust hailed him as “the next Dyson”.<br>
      <br>
      These endorsements enabled Mr Lindsey to sign a global licensing
      deal with a worldwide manufacturer. “Before you can license
      technology, you have to have a working prototype and, ideally, a
      customer. We had both,” says Mr Lindsey. “The first of our waste
      water machines are already rolling off the production line.” The
      company cannot be named yet, for legal reasons.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike Dyson, Mr Lindsey is no engineer. A chemistry graduate, he
      credits his industrial nous to his father, who worked at the
      National Physical Laboratory. “We were always trying new
      inventions when I was growing up, like [recumbent] bicycles,” he
      says.<br>
      <br>
      “I’m not your traditional mad inventor in a shed,” he adds,
      admitting that he started researching compression technology for
      “spurious” reasons.<br>
      <br>
      “I was a reading a history of the engine and was amazed by how
      many people had tried and failed to make progress. The consensus
      was that everything that could be attempted with the technology
      had already been tried. I love a challenge, so I thought I’d have
      a go.”<br>
      <br>
      To date, his invention has received £3m in equity investment and
      £500,000 in grants from the likes of the Technology Strategy
      Board. This financial year, the company will turn over £600,000.
      “We’re an IP business, so our margins are very high,” says Mr
      Lindsey. “And that’s money flowing into the UK economy from around
      the world.”<br>
      <br>
      Revenues are expected to double the following year and could
      increase exponentially once Lontra increases the number of
      applications. “James Dyson has made a fantastic business, but the
      applications for our technology are actually much broader,” he
      says.<br>
      <br>
      The next big project for 2014 is to expand into industrial
      compressors, he says. Compressed air systems in general account
      for about 10pc of total industrial electricity consumption, but
      can amount to as much as 40pc of the electricity bill for certain
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      In order to meet demand, Lontra is increasing its headcount from
      12 to 28 over the next two years.<br>
      <br>
      “A design like this has the potential to change the world for the
      better,” says Mr Lindsey. “It can improve access to clean water
      and save energy, both key drivers for society.<br>
      <br>
      “And this world-beating machine has been built right here in the
      UK using UK skills and parts cast and machined in the UK. The UK
      has been the test-bed for the technology. All of this goes to
      prove that this is still a great place to make things.”<br>

      <br>
      The Blade Compressor™ is an innovative design which delivers 20%
      efficiency gains over competing technologies.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor is designed for high volumetric and thermal
      efficiency, and the geometry of the compressor allows high
      efficiency heat recovery. It is oil free, and other features
      include small size, low vibration and quiet operation. A key
      feature is the compressor's ability to vary flow and pressure with
      minimal efficiency loss, without the use of Variable Speed Drive.<br>
      <br>
      It is a rotary device with a wrapped toroidal chamber. The key
      features are a rotating blade, which passes through a slot in a
      rotating disc once per cycle. The unit is therefore a compact,
      double acting rotary compressor.<br>
      <br>

      The compressor has very substantial markets, and is suitable for
      various industrial air markets, blowers and specific process gas
      applications. Lontra’s initial focus is on waste water aeration,
      automotive superchargers and the industrial air market.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>The Blade Supercharger</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      The Blade Supercharger™ is an efficient, variable mass flow,
      positive displacement supercharger.<br>
      <br>
      It uses the core design of the Blade Compressor™, optimised for
      engine package and performance requirements. The technology has
      unique abilities in matching the requirements for heavily
      downsized powertrains, both gasoline and diesel. The variable port
      design allows for real-time variation of mass-flow and internal
      compression ratio (without changing rotational speed), enabling
      precise matching of the boost requirements of the engine
      throughout the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The Lindsey Engine® is a patented, clean sheet design for an
      engine that could potentially deliver very significant
      improvements in efficiency and fuel economy. Our initial modelling
      indicates an improvement in efficiency at part load of up to 37%
      over traditional engines. The engine could be configured to run on
      petrol, or a range of alternative fuels including hydrogen and
      various biofuels. Small, lightweight, quiet, with fewer parts than
      a traditional engine and using well-understood materials and
      technology, the engine has very significant potential.<br>
      <br>
      The engine has diverse potential applications, from electricity
      generation through marine power and potentially the automotive
      sector. Initial priority markets include 2-stroke replacement,
      Combined Heat and Power and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.<br>

      <br>
      The Lindsey Engine® is a development from the Blade Compressor™,
      and shares the basic mechanical design. Two units are connected to
      create a traditional four stroke cycle, one performing
      induction/compression the other combustion/exhaust. The engine
      therefore offers the potential to optimise compression/combustion
      ratios and temperatures which, together with improved airflow,
      significantly improve energy efficiency over traditional engines.
      <br>
      <br>
      A spin-out from the engine development programme is the Blade
      Expander™, a positive displacement expander with a high thermal
      efficiency which is capable of efficiently handling variable
      loads.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it potentially valuable in a number of steam
      applications, and potentially for use in new biofuel applications.

      <b>Design of innovative Blade Compressor™ released</b><b><br>
      </b><b>10 May 2010</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Clean Tech developer Lontra has provided the first glimpse of the
      innovative Blade Compressor™, a technology that has been in
      development by the company since 2004.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor, which was designed by Lontra’s Technical Director
      Steve Lindsey, is a rotary device with a wrapped toroidal chamber.
      The key features are a rotating blade, which passes through a slot
      in a rotating disc once per cycle. The unit is therefore a
      compact, double acting rotary compressor. An animation of the
      design, and an explanation of the technology, are at Lontra’s
      website www.lontra.co.uk<br>
      <br>
      Prototypes demonstrate a 20% efficiency gain over traditional
      compressors, and has an innovative variable port design which
      allows it to meet changing application requirements whilst
      maintaining constant speed. The company has development projects
      underway with leading partners, including a development project
      for waste water compressors jointly funded by the Carbon Trust and
      Severn Trent Water.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor is the core mechanical geometry of the range of
      Lontra’s applications, including the Blade Supercharger™, Blade
      Expander™ and Lindsey Engine®. technology. <br>

          Lontra releases BladeBoost supercharger demonstrator results;
          next generation under development</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The BladeBoost demonstrator was the third iteration of the
      compressor for a vehicle application. Click to enlarge.<br>
      <br>
      UK-based clean technology developer Lontra has released
      performance results of the BladeBoost supercharger demonstrator—an
      efficient, variable mass flow, positive displacement supercharger
      for heavily downsized engines—following the conclusion of a
      development project supported by the UK’s Technology Strategy
      Board, in partnership with Ford Motor Company and Ricardo.
      (Earlier post.)<br>
      <br>
      The BladeBoost uses the core design of the Blade Compressor,
      optimized for engine package and performance requirements. A key
      feature of the compressor is its ability to use a simple variable
      inlet port that allows dynamic control of mass flow rate and
      internal compression ratio without changing rotational speed. This
      enables the boost of downsized engines to be completely controlled
      at any point on the operating cycle, including part-load.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor is designed for high volumetric and thermal
      efficiency, and the geometry of the compressor allows high
      efficiency heat recovery. It is oil free, and other features
      include small size, low vibration and quiet operation. The
      compressor is a rotary device with a wrapped toroidal chamber. Key
      features include are a rotating blade, which passes through a slot
      in a rotating disc once per cycle. The unit is therefore a
      compact, double-acting rotary compressor.<br>
      <br>
      The BladeBoost vehicle demonstrator developed as part of the
      project with Ford and Ricardo represents the third iteration of
      the compressor for a vehicle application. <br>
      <br>
      The chart to the right plots the measured performance of the
      BladeBoost against the latest Eaton R900 TVS supercharger, using
      the published map of thermal efficiency. At a drive ratio of 3:1
      the R900 theoretically delivers similar flow rate to BladeBoost.
      Assumptions were that the engine mass flow rate is proportional to
      absolute manifold pressure; when throttled, Eaton supercharger
      efficiency is same as un-throttled (despite higher PR);
      theoretical power is calculated from PR and mass flow rate,
      without friction; and inlet air was assumed at a constant 20 °C.<br>
      <br>
      The detailed data set shows how the Blade Supercharger is able
      uniquely to deliver the pressure and flow required for downsized
      engines, Lontra says.<br>
      <br>
      In parallel to the physical hardware development, Lontra has been
      developing a detailed mathematical model of the compressor over
      the past four years. This is now a powerful tool that allows the
      company to test modifications to existing devices, or new devices
      for customers, before committing to costly hardware.<br>
      <br>
      During the build of BladeBoost, the team identified four key,
      simple areas for improvement:<br>
      <br>
      The chamber bleed hole was in the wrong position and so should be
      moved to the correct position.<br>
      The abradeable coating could be run-in more effectively in one key
      area (outer rotor).<br>
      The remaining clearances could be reduced to the design
      specification (some components were machined outside of
      specification).<br>
      The outlet port could be optimized.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis model allows the developers to see what the effect of
      these improvements will be.<br>
      <br>
      The next generation of Blade Supercharger (beyond BladeBoost) is
      under development. The new system will be smaller and more tightly
      packaged with a number of improvements including the capability to
      accept boosted inlet air for a post turbo-charger installation.
      This design of this device is complete including manufacturing
      drawings with some parts already manufactured, the company said.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Blade process design and operation</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      According to Lontra, the design, common to the compressor,
      supercharger, expander and engine, is "novel positive displacement
      geometry". The basic unit uses a ring shaped chamber with a
      continually open inlet port and an outlet port valved by the
      action of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The principal components are a blade ring, which rotates and
      rotating disc. The blade cuts through the disc.<br>
      <br>
      The compression chamber is formed as the blade, rotating in the
      housing, works against the disc. The blade passes through the disc
      and is double acting, drawing gas in behind the compressing head.
      The compressed gas then exits through a port in the housing.<br>
      <br>
      Product design allows for a variable flow device where the intake
      area, and pumped capacity and compression ratio, can be controlled
      through a sliding port.<br>
      <br>
      The 1800 m3/hour Blade Compressor is a 35kW unit, producing 0.5

      <br>
      <b>[0001] ROTARY PISTON AND CYLINDER DEVICES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention relates to rotary piston and cylinder
      devices which may be, for example, in the form of an internal
      combustion engine, or a pump such as a supercharger or fluid pump,
      or as an expander such as a steam engine or turbine replacement.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The term 'piston' is used herein in its widest sense to
      include, where the context admits, a partition capable of moving
      relative to a cylinder wall, and such partition need not generally
      be of substantial thickness in the direction of relative movement
      but can often be in the form of a blade. The partition may be of
      substantial thickness or may be hollow.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The invention relates in particular to a rotary piston and
      cylinder devices of the type comprising a rotor and a stator, the
      stator at least partially defining an annular cylinder space, the
      rotor is in the form of a ring, and the rotor comprising at least
      one piston which extends from the rotor ring into the annular
      cylinder space, in use the at least one piston is moved
      circumferentially through the annular cylinder space on rotation
      of the rotor relative to the stator, the rotor body being sealed
      relative to the stator, and the device further comprising cylinder
      space shutter means which is capable of being moved relative to
      the stator to a closed position in which the shutter means
      partitions the annular cylinder space, and to an open position in
      which the shutter means permits passage of the at least one
      piston, the cylinder space shutter means comprising a shutter
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In a highly preferred embodiment the at least one piston
      extends generally inwardly from the rotor ring and the stator is
      positioned generally internally of the ring. The stator may have
      portions which extend generally radially outwardly beyond the ring
      if desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Preferably the shutter disc presents a partition which
      extends substantially radially of the annular cylinder space.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Although in theory the shutter means could be reciprocable,
      it is much preferred to avoid the use of reciprocating components,
      particularly when high speeds are required, and the shutter means
      is preferably at least one rotary shutter disc provided with at
      least one aperture which in the open condition of the shutter
      means is arranged to be positioned substantially in register with
      the circumferentially-extending bore of the annular cylinder space
      to permit passage of the at least one piston through the shutter
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Preferably the at least one aperture is provided radially
      in the shutter disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Preferably the rotor is adapted to receive the shutter
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The shutter disc is preferably driven from the rotor
      through a suitable transmission means.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Preferably the axis of rotation of the rotor is not
      parallel to the axis of rotation of the shutter disc. Most
      preferably the axis of rotation of the rotor is substantially
      orthogonal to the axis of rotation of the shutter disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Preferably the piston is so shaped that it will pass
      through an aperture in the moving shutter means, without balking,
      as the aperture passes through the annular cylinder space. The
      piston is preferably shaped so that there is minimal clearance
      between the piston and the aperture in the shutter means, such
      that a seal is formed as the piston passes through the aperture. A
      seal is preferably provided on a leading or trailing surface or
      edge of the piston. In the case of a compressor a seal could be
      provided on a leading surface and in the case of an expander a
      seal could be provided on a trailing surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The rotor body is preferably rotatably supported by the
      stator rather than relying on co-operation between the pistons and
      the cylinder walls to relatively position the rotor body and
      stator.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] It will be appreciated that this is distinct from a
      conventional reciprocating piston device in which the piston is
      maintained coaxial with the cylinder by suitable piston rings
      which give rise to relatively high friction forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The rotor ring is preferably rotatably supported by
      suitable bearing means carried by the stator.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Preferably the stator comprises at least one inlet port and
      at least one outlet port.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Preferably at least one of the ports is substantially
      adjacent to the shutter means.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Preferably the ratio of the angular velocity of the rotor
      to the angular velocity of the shutter disc is 1: 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Multiple connected devices (whether in the form of
      compressors, expanders or other form) may be joined to one or more
      common intake outlet manifolds. This may be to so that a more
      continuous flow of gas is input or outputted (as the multiple
      devices may have different intake phases etc.) . An example is a
      supercharger or compressor where two or more devices may be joined
      to a common output manifold to produce a nearly continuous output
      flow<br>

      [0052] Figure 1 shows a rotary piston and cylinder assembly 1
      forming a combustion engine. The assembly 1 comprises two piston
      and cylinder devices 2a and 2b which are connected by a transfer
      passage 14. The engine may be considered as two conjoined positive
      displacement pumps, with one chamber providing induction and
      compression and the other combustion and exhaust. This separation
      of cycles allows for their optimisation without compromise, and
      significant benefits are achieved. The transfer passage 14 may be
      of construction or material such as ceramic to thermally insulate
      the devices 2a and 2b from one another to some extent. Since one
      of the options is to run the two devices at different
      temperatures. The engine combines the advantages of both a turbine
      and a reciprocating engine. It allows efficient operation over a
      wide range of speeds and conditions while at the same time all
      motions are purely rotary and the intake and exhaust are
      continually open as in a turbine engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d show the principal components of
      each of the piston and cylinder devices 2a and 2b. Figure 2a shows
      a stator 10 which is provided with a port 11 in the side wall 12
      and the two side walls 12 and base 13 defining an annular cylinder
      space 3. The stator 10 has a radial slot 4 which is dimensioned to
      receive a shutter disc 5 whose purpose is to partition the annular
      cylinder space 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Figure 2b shows the shutter disc 5 which fits into the slot
      4 in the stator 10 and partitions the annular cylinder space 3.
      The shutter disc 5 is provided with a slot 6 to allow a suitably
      shaped piston 8 to pass therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Figure 2c shows a rotor ring 7 and extending inwardly
      thereof is attached the piston 8. The ring 7 fits around the
      outside of the stator 10 to enclose the annular cylinder space 3.
      The ring 7 and the piston 8 rotate around the stator 10 on
      suitable bearings (not shown) provided on the stator 10. The ring
      7 is provided with a grilled port 9 which is adjacent to the
      piston 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The width of each of the openings forming the grilled port
      9 in the direction of the rotor is less than the thickness of the
      shutter disc 5. The shutter disc may incorporate an extension on
      its edge to increase its thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Figure 2d shows a static outer housing 30 which fits around
      the outside of the rotor ring 7 and is provided with a port 31.
      The combined action of the port 9 in the rotor ring 7 and the port
      31 in the static outer housing forms a valve, which, is in an open
      condition when the two parts are aligned (or at least in fluid
      communication) and closed when they are not. Rotation transmission
      means (not shown) rotationally connects axle 4 of the shutter disc
      5 to the rotor ring 7 to ensure a suitable relative speed so that
      the piston 8 can pass through the slot 6 without balking.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Returning to Figure 1 the transfer passage 14 connects the
      outlet port 31a of the compressor device 2a and to the inlet port
      31b of the expander device 2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The port 11a in the side wall of the stator 10a on the
      device 2b forms the intake port through which fresh charge is
      drawn.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The port lib in the side wall of the stator 10b of the
      expander device 2b forms an exhaust port through which spent
      charge is exhausted.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Forming an engine by conjoining a compressor device and an
      expander device in this way allows the compression cycle and the
      expansion cycle to be optimised independently. For example the
      compressor device 2a can be run at a different temperature to the
      expander, the compressor device 2a may use different sealing or
      different lubrication strategies to the expander, and/or the
      compression ratio of the device 2a and the expansion ratio of the
      device 2b can be different.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The engine assembly 1 can be configured so that the
      transfer occurs at constant volume or alternatively the gas can
      continue to be compressed during transfer (possibly a small amount
      to make up for any leakage) or even expanded.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Exhaust gas from the expander device 2b can be transferred
      from the exhaust port lib through a manifold 19 to a heat
      exchanger 20. The heat exchanger 20 extends through the transfer
      passage 14. More particularly the heat exchanger 20 comprises a
      plurality of relatively narrow conduits 40 which are spaced by
      gaps 41. The gaps 41 allow the fluid in the transfer passage to
      pass therethrough and accordingly enhance the heat transfer to
      said fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The heat exchanger 20 exchanges heat between the exhaust
      gas from the expander device 2b and the gas in the transfer
      passage 14 which is yet to enter the expander device 2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Importantly the heat exchanger 20 does not allow the
      exhaust gas therein to mix with the gas in the transfer passage
      14.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The transfer of heat from the hot exhaust gas to the
      transfer passage gas allows some of the energy to be recovered,
      and so increases the overall efficiency of the engine assembly 1.
      In addition such heat recycling could be used to 'tune' the engine
      temperature and so reduce the warm-up time of the expander device
      2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] This heat recycling does not affect the volumetric
      efficiency of the compressor device 2a because the intake air to
      the compressor device 2a remains unheated.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In use of the engine assembly 1 the compressor device 2a,
      draws fluid through the open port 11a as the piston 8a and rotor
      ring 7 rotate. At the same time as inducing air behind the piston
      8a, fluid induced in the last complete rotation of the rotor ring
      7 is compressed in front of the piston 8a against the shutter disc
      5a.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] As the port 9a in the rotor ring 7a and the port 31a in the
      static outer housing 30a come into register, the valve so formed
      opens and the compressed fluid is discharged into the transfer
      passage 14. In the expander device 2b, pressurised fluid enters
      the cylinder space of the device through the port 31b in the outer
      housing 30b and the port 9b in the rotor ring 7b. As the rotor
      ring 7b rotates, the valve closes and the pressurised fluid is
      expanded. Ignition means (not shown) , such as a spark plug
      provided in the stator 10b, then ignites the fuel mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] After further rotation the port lib allows the remaining
      gas to escape into the manifold 19. Further remaining fluid is
      forced through the port lib during the next expansion cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] It will be appreciated that a rotational output of the ring
      7b drives both the shutter disc 5b and, by way of suitable
      rotational transmission means (not shown) the rotor ring 7a and
      the shutter disc 5a of the compressor device 2a.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In an alternative embodiment a heat exchanger is not
      provided and exhaust gas from the expander device is merely
      channelled away from the transfer passage towards an exhaust
      manifold (not shown) .<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Figure 3 shows device 2a of an internal combustion engine
      100, in which like reference numerals indicate like features and
      wherein a proportion of exhaust gas is re-circulated to the
      transfer passage 14. A route for exhaust gas to pass from exhaust
      manifold 21 back to the transfer passage 14 is provided by an
      additional manifold 23. A pump 22 is operative to control the flow
      of exhaust gas between the exhaust manifold 21 and the transfer
      passage 14. It will be appreciated that further valves, pumps or
      other fluid control means may be employed to control this flow.
      This exhaust gas recirculation may be used to control combustion
      or burn rate. It may also be used to control the temperature in
      the expander device 2b. Further it may be used to control
      emissions or to help control a controlled auto-ignition (CAI)
      cycle. These are just some of the reasons that exhaust gas
      recirculation into the transfer passage 14 may be used.
      Recirculation in this way does not affect the volumetric
      efficiency of the compressor device 2a.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Attention is now given to the location of ignition means in
      an expander device of an engine. With reference to Figure 20 there
      is shown a combustion engine 1000 comprising two conjoined rotary
      piston and cylinder devices 2a and 2b. The expander device 2b is
      provided with a spark plug 950. Specifically the electrodes of the
      spark plug 950 are located in a recess or nacelle 952 of the base
      13 of the stator.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Figure 21 shows a combustion engine 1100 in which the spark
      plug 950 is located in a recess of the outer housing 30 of the
      expander device 2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Accordingly the working fluid in the chamber is only
      exposed to the electrodes of the spark plug when the intake port
      9b is in register with the spark plug. Advantageously since the
      spark plug is only exposed to the hot combustion mixture for a
      short time the lifetime of the spark plug should be improved. In
      one embodiment a glow plug may be provided in place of a spark
      plug and the ignition timing being provided by the interaction of
      the glow plug with the intake port 9b.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Figure 22 shows a combustion engine 1200 in which a spark
      plug 950 is provided in a recess of a side wall 12 of the stator.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Figure 4 shows an internal combustion engine 200 which
      includes an arrangement 24 which is adapted, in use, to modify the
      flow of gas within the transfer passage 14 so as to encourage
      turbulent fluid flow in the passage. The arrangement 24 may be
      realised in numerous ways and may be static, movable and/or
      powered. The arrangement (shown schematically at 24) may comprise
      a flap or flaps extendible into the transfer passage space or a
      number of other features or shapes having surface portions on
      which the gas impacts in order to modify the fluid flow
      characteristics thereof. The arrangement 24 may be described as an
      aerodynamic device. The turbulence created in the transfer passage
      may comprise one or a combination of a swirling motion and/or a
      tumbling motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The arrangement 24 may be deformable such that its
      configuration presented to the fluid changes as the rate of fluid
      flow through the passage 14 and on to the device changes. The
      arrangement 24 may be dynamically controllable (in real time) by
      way of user controllable motive means or settable at the time of
      manufacture (to account for different fuels etc) . Accordingly the
      position, shape, configuration and/or orientation may be set or
      dynamically controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The amount of turbulence generated may be modified to
      control the mixing of fluids in the transfer passage 14 so as to
      control the mixing of fuel and air in the transfer passage 14 or
      to affect conditions later in the cycle, in the expander device 2b
      (which is downstream of the arrangement 24) .<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Alternatively the turbulence generated could be used to
      control the mixing of the transfer passage fluid and any
      recirculated exhaust fluid, either within the transfer passage or
      downstream of the arrangement 24 in the expander device 2b. The
      control of turbulence could be used to allow the heat transfer
      rate between a heat exchanger (such as heat exchanger 20) and the
      gas in the transfer passage 14 to be controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Importantly, the degree of turbulence of fluid in the
      transfer passage 14 controls at least in part the combustion in
      the expander device 2b and so appropriate control of the
      turbulence could be used to maximise the efficiency of combustion.
      The optimum amount of turbulence varies for different engine
      operating speeds, different engine loads and different fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A particular benefit of the location of the arrangement 24
      in the transfer passage 14 is that the turbulence is generated
      just before the charge is combusted allowing for minimal energy
      loss (to effects such as viscous flow) from the fluid. This is in
      contrast to a traditional reciprocating engine in which turbulence
      is generated by the flow of gas through the intake valves and then
      must go through a compression cycle before combustion (giving more
      time for a loss of turbulence energy) .<br>
      <br>
      [0084] A turbulence generating arrangement 24a is shown in Figure
      14, and comprises a vane of substantially helical form which
      extends radially inwardly from inner wall 60 of the transfer
      passage 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] A further turbulence generating arrangement 24b is shown in
      Figure 15 which comprises two rotatably mounted flap devices 25.
      Each flap device 25 comprises a stem 26 which is torsionally
      flexible (as indicated by the double-headed arrows) and the stem
      is connected to a flap portion 27. The arrangement is such that in
      use at low fluid flow rates each flap device would present a large
      surface to the fluid and so increased turbulence is generated.
      However, if the fluid rate increased then the stems 26 would be
      caused to flex and so the surface area presented to the fluid flow
      would decrease. In yet a further alternative 'passive&lt;1&gt;
      arrangement a stem of a rotatably mounted flap device is
      engageable with resilient biasing means (for example a spring)
      wherein the flap device is biased towards presenting a higher
      surface area to the fluid flow. In an alternative embodiment the
      stems 26 are of substantially rigid construction and each flap
      portion is of a sufficiently flexible construction to provide
      flexure in response to variations in the fluid flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In an alternative arrangement each of the flap devices is
      connected to motive means (not shown) which means is operative to
      control the inclination of each device relative to the direction
      of fluid flow in the transfer passage. In the above described flap
      device embodiments, although two flap devices are described, one
      or more such devices may be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Figure 5 shows an internal combustion engine 300 in which a
      fuel injector 25 injects fuel 26 directly into the transfer
      passage 14. Alternatively or in addition, however, the fuel may be
      injected into the compressor intake port 4a, into the compressor
      intake manifold, into the annular cylinder space itself or into
      the expander chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Injection into the transfer passage 14 has the benefit not
      reducing the volumetric efficiency of the compressor device 2a.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Injecting into the transfer passage 14 also means that
      there is no fuel in the compressor 2a to wet the walls thereof,
      which would affect lubricants or damage coatings. Advantageously
      the absence of fuel in the compressor device 2a allows
      optimisation of the materials of construction thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Further injection of fuel into the transfer passage 14 may
      allow further control of charge stratification (by injecting more
      fuel into some of the charge passing through the transfer passage
      than other) . This has the benefit in controlling combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Multiple injectors may be used, as may multiple transfer
      passage manifolds.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Figure 6 shows an internal combustion engine 400 comprising
      a receptacle/storage tank 27 which is attached to the transfer
      passage 14 by valve means 28 which allows compressed fluid to be
      stored between cycles .<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In use, during a braking cycle of the engine, the valve 28
      would allow the compressed gas to be stored in the receptacle 27.
      Then, when re- accelerating, a variable intake port (not shown) or
      other suitable means could reduce the pressure attained in the
      compressor device 2a reducing the compression work required. Gas
      would be allowed to re-enter the transfer passage 14 from the
      receptacle 27 to make up the pressure difference (as if the
      variable port had not been used to reduce the compression ratio) .
      Overall this would advantageously allow an increase in efficiency
      as the energy from engine braking would be re-captured and this
      forms a type of 'weak' hybrid. This is just one example of the use
      of the receptacle 27 and the valve means 28. In addition or
      alternatively, compressed gas captured during the engine braking
      cycle could be used for one or more devices, either attached to
      the engine 400 or otherwise, for example a pneumatic braking
      system. The valve means 28 may be operatively connected to control
      means such that compressed gas received from the device 2a (when
      the valve means 28 is opened) could be released from the tank 27
      towards the device 2b in subsequent cycles of the device 2a so
      performing gas storage and gas release steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In an alternative embodiment a chamber 29 may be in the
      form of an expansion chamber, wherein at a specific frequency a
      sudden change in cross-sectional area of the chamber 29 is brought
      about so as to reflect waves towards the transfer passage.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] It is possible that the engine 400 could be powered purely
      on compressed gas from the receptacle 27 in some instances with
      power derived from expanding the compressed air in the expander
      device 2b. This would require either bypassing the compressor
      stage or using variable porting (as hereinafter described) to
      reduce the compression ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In yet another alternative embodiment the receptacle 27 is
      in the form of a source of compressed gas which gas is not
      provided from the compressor device 2a. In such an embodiment the
      valve 28 is a one-way valve allowing only gas to enter into the
      passage 14 and not vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Figure 7 shows an internal combustion engine 500 comprising
      chambers 29 of substantially cylindrical shape which are attached
      to the transfer passage 14. These chambers allow the regulation of
      the resonance of the transfer passage and/or other parts of the
      engine caused by the interaction of pressure waves in the fluid
      which occurs as a result of the valves 31a and 31b being
      periodically opened and closed. Element 50 is a baffle/plate
      member which is operative to modify the effect of the resonant
      chamber. Two chambers 29 are shown, however there may be one or
      multiple resonant chambers. Entry of fluid into one or more of the
      resonant chambers may be controlled by valves (not shown) which
      are selectively operable to isolate the chamber(s) from the
      transfer passage. In use, one or more resonant chambers act to
      damp the resonant effects of fluid in the transfer passage and so
      improve fluid flow and reduce noise. Various embodiments of
      chambers 29 may be envisaged. In one embodiment a chamber is in
      the form of a Helmholtz resonator-type arrangement, wherein at a
      specific frequency of pressure wave in the fluid the chamber
      resonates and waves are emitted towards and into fluid in the
      transfer passage so as to alternate resonance of pressure waves in
      the transfer passage. A further possibility is that a mechanism
      may be employed to allow the volume or length of the chamber (s)
      to be varied. One realisation of such an arrangement comprises a
      telescopic chamber. An alternative embodiment comprises a piston
      which is controllably moveable within a chamber. Further
      embodiments could be envisaged where multiple sub-chambers are
      fluidically connected by valves to allow the resonant volumes of
      the chambers to be modified. Such sub- chambers may be connected
      to the transfer passage so provide a return route thereto. In an
      embodiment the resonant chambers are adapted to amplify the
      resonant effect on the transfer passage such that, in use,
      constructive interference of pressure waves in the transfer
      passage is brought about.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In an alternative embodiment an acoustically absorbent
      material is provided in acoustic communication with the transfer
      passage such that, in use, pressure waves are dissipated as they
      pass through the transfer passage. In one realisation of such an
      embodiment the transfer passage is surrounded by acoustically
      absorbent material. Although only one transfer passage is shown
      between the devices 2a and 2b, multiple transfer passages may be
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the
      invention comprise two rotary piston and cylinder devices 2a and
      2b, a transfer passage therebetween and at least two of the heat
      exchanger arrangements of Figure 1 , the exhaust gas recirculation
      arrangement of Figure 3, the turbulence generating arrangement of
      Figure 4, the fuel injection arrangement of Figure 5, the
      compressed fluid receptacle of Figure 6 and the resonant chamber
      of Figure 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Although in the above described embodiments the inlet and
      outlet ports of the devices 2, 2a and 2b are shown as being of
      fixed size, various further embodiments will now be described
      relating to control of port size using variable port arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] With reference to Figure 8 there is shown a stator assembly
      600 of a rotary piston and cylinder device comprising a variable
      port arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The arrangement comprises a slidable cover member 602 of
      substantially curved planar form which is adapted to slide in the
      arcuate aperture 601a provided in side wall 603. The surface of
      the cover member 602 that faces into the cylinder space is
      arranged to be substantially flush with adjacent inwardly facing
      surface portions of the side wall. Accordingly the cover member
      602 is intended to 'replace' a side wall portion, at least from
      the piston's perspective such that no leakage path is created as
      the piston passes over the cover member. The side wall 603 in
      Figure 8 may be substantially planar. This plane may be
      substantially radial to the disc axis or may be offset from a
      radius of the disc axis. When discussing the angular extent of the
      ports, it is the axis about which the rotor ring 7 rotates and the
      axis around which the annular cylinder space 3 is formed which is
      referred to as a basis for determining angular coverage.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The slidable cover member 602 is adapted to be slid through
      an arc so as to selectively control the angular extent of the
      aperture 601a.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The stator assembly 600 is further provided with a second
      aperture 601b, the angular extent of which is not capable of being
      altered by movement of the slidable cover member 602.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The adjustability of the slidable cover member 602 relative
      to the aperture 601a allows the compression ratio to be altered.
      The point at which the compression stage starts is controlled in
      part by the angular position at which the piston 8 on the rotor
      ring 7 passes the end of the angular extent of the apertures 601a
      and 601b. If the angular extent of the aperture 601a port is
      increased, then the compression will start later in the rotation
      of the rotor ring. If all other parameters are the same this will
      lead to a reduction in the compression ratio. The volume of gas
      delivered from the outlet port of the device will remain the same
      if the timing of the interaction of the port provided in the rotor
      ring and the aperture provided in the outer housing from the
      outlet valve, remain the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] With regard to Figure 8 it will be appreciated that
      although the slidable cover member 602 is shown as being rotatable
      towards the centre of the device, in an alternative embodiment the
      cover member may be arranged to be rotatable outwardly of the
      device. Control of the compression ratio in this way could be used
      in a compressor to control the outlet pressure in response to
      system demands.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Control of the port in this way in a supercharger
      embodiment would allow the mass flow of the supercharger to be
      varied without a variation in the supercharger rotational speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Control of the compression ratio in this way could be used
      to allow a form of engine throttling, reducing the power generated
      by the engine without the losses associated with a conventional
      throttle. A conventional throttle acts as a restriction in the
      intake of an engine, reducing the pressure downstream of it. The
      engine induces the same volume of air but at lower pressure, so
      that there is a net reduction in the number of air molecules and
      hence a reduction in the amount of fuel that can be burnt leading
      to a reduction in power. However, by using a controllable intake
      port (as formed by the slidable cover member 602 in combination
      with the aperture 601a) instead, increasing the angular extent of
      the aperture 601a effectively reduces the amount of air that is
      compressed, without a large reduction in the intake pressure. The
      overall effect is that fewer air molecules are delivered to the
      combustion chamber as with the conventional throttle, but
      importantly the pumping losses of the throttle restriction are
      avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Similarly, modifying the exhaust port of the stator of an
      expander device (eg device 2b) allows the expansion ratio to be
      altered. The angular position at which the expansion within the
      chamber ends is controlled by the point at which the piston on the
      rotor ring passes the start of the exhaust port. If the angular
      extent of the exhaust port is increased, then the expansion will
      end earlier in the rotation of the rotor ring. If all other
      parameters are the same this will lead to a reduction in the
      expansion ratio . The volume of gas delivered through the inlet
      port of the device will remain the same if the timing of the
      interaction of the port provided in the rotor ring and the
      aperture provided in the outer housing that form the outlet valve
      and all other parameters, remain the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Reducing the expansion ratio in an engine could reduce the
      amount of work produced by the engine and increase the temperature
      of the exhaust. Where the engine is used as part of a Combined
      Heat and Power (CHP) apparatus, this would allow the heat to power
      ratio of the system to be controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Temporarily increasing the exhaust energy by reducing an
      engine embodiment's expansion ratio could be used to heat up a
      downstream catalyst more quickly. This could reduce 'light-off
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Temporarily increasing the exhaust energy by reducing the
      engine embodiment's expansion ratio could be used to provide more
      energy for a downstream turbocharger to 'spool up' , reducing
      'lag' or the time that it takes to respond to a change in engine
      operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Control of the expansion ratio in this way could be used in
      a single rotary piston and cylinder device forming an expander
      (such as a steam expander) to control the amount of work produced
      by the expander. It could also be used to control the outlet
      pressure of an expander.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] These are only a few of the many possible advantages that
      could be gained from expansion ratio control.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] With reference now to Figure 9 there is shown a variable
      port arrangement provided in the outer housing of the stator of a
      rotary piston and cylinder device in which the port 711 is
      variably valved by a slidable member 712. The wall has formed
      therein a channel of substantially part helical form defined by
      wall portions 713. The slidable member 712 is intended to
      "replace" a portion of the outer housing, at least from the
      piston's perspective such that no leakage path is created as the
      piston passes over the slidable member. The aperture in the outer
      housing 711 and the port 9 in the rotor ring 7 forms a valve which
      is open when the port 9 and aperture 711 are substantially in
      register. The slidable member 712 allows the timing of this valve
      to be varied. The slidable member allows the angular extent of the
      aperture 711 to be controlled, in the same way as the variable
      aperture 601a in Figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] In an alternative embodiment a port is provided in the
      outer housing, and a curved slidable member is designed to move
      substantially circumferentially (ie substantially co-axially of
      the axis of the outer housing) around the cylinder space within
      the port (rather than helically or in part axially) .<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In a variant embodiment the port 711 is provided in the
      radially innermost base wall 13 of the stator of the rotary piston
      and cylinder device.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In a variant embodiment a port controlled by a slidable
      member is provided in the rotor ring 7 in addition to or replacing
      a port 9. This allows the timing of the valve formed by the
      interaction of the first mentioned port and an aperture in the
      outer housing to be adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In a compressor device the interaction of the port in the
      rotor ring and the port 711 can be used to control the compression
      ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] If the compression ratio is reduced in the compressor by
      increasing the inlet port angular extent (described above) , the
      volume compressed is reduced and the volume delivered from the
      outlet port remains the same (if no other parameters are changed)
      . If instead the compression ratio can be reduced by sliding the
      member 712 so as to increase the angular extent of the port 711
      which may replace either the port 9 in the rotor ring 7 or the
      aperture 31 in the outer housing 30, the volume compressed remains
      the same, but the volume delivered from the outlet port is
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In one embodiment both the angular extent of the port 9 in
      the rotor ring 7 and the angular extent of the aperture 31 in the
      outer housing 30 may be variable.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] If both the inlet port angular extent and the outlet valve
      timing (which timing is controlled by the angular extents of the
      port 9 and the aperture 31) can be varied, the compressed volume
      or mass flow and the compression ratio can be independently
      varied. For example if the angular extent of the inlet port is
      increased, the volume compressed is reduced. If the outlet valve
      timing remained the same, the compression ratio would be reduced,
      but if the extent of one or both of the ports forming the outlet
      valve is reduced, the compression ratio can be maintained. This
      means that the mass flow has decreased without a change in the
      compression ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] In an expander device, the inlet port is formed by the
      interaction of the port in the rotor ring and the port 711 and by
      sliding movement of the member 712 the angular extent of the port
      711 can be used to control the expansion ratio. For example, the
      expansion ratio can be reduced by increasing the angular extent of
      the port 711, the volume expanded increases, but the volume
      delivered from the outlet port remains the same. With reference to
      Figure 16 there is shown an outer housing 830 of a rotary piston
      and cylinder device. The outer housing comprises two housing
      components 831 and 832, which are provided with apertures 841 and
      842 respectively. The apertures 841 and 842 combine to serve as an
      input port for an expander device and an output port for a
      compressor device. The housing component 832 is mounted for
      rotational movement relative to the housing component 831. As
      shown in Figure 17 the housing component 832 has been rotated
      relative to the housing component. In so doing the position of the
      aperture 842 has now changed relative to the aperture 841.
      Accordingly the timing of when an aperture of the rotor of the
      device comes into (at least partial) register with the other
      aperture (and in particular the aperture 842) is altered. It will
      be appreciated that more than two rotatable outer housing
      components could be provided, with each component being provided
      with one or more respective apertures.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Figure 18 shows an outer housing 930 of a rotary piston and
      cylinder device. The outer housing 930 comprises multiple aperture
      regions 940 which together form an output port. The outer housing
      930 is mounted for rotation relative to the cylinder space.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Figure 19 shows the outer housing 930 in an adjusted
      position in which the timing of the aperture of the rotor comes
      into register with the aperture regions 940 is altered (as
      compared to that for the position shown in Figure 18) .<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In Figure 10, a stator 630 comprising an alternative
      variable port arrangement is shown. The arrangement comprises two
      removable plug elements 631 and 632 which can be secured to or
      moved from the stator and so vary the angular extent of the port
      634. The elements can be selectively moved to form a continuous
      port or alternatively can be arranged to be separated such that
      multiple ports may be opened.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] As best seen in Figure 11 the port 634 is provided by a
      grill or grating structure in a side wall of the stator which is
      adapted to receive projections 635 of each plug element 631 and
      632. In an alternative embodiment the port 634 may not have a
      grill structure, for example as single opening.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In an alternative embodiment the plug elements could be
      hinged at one end (either the radially innermost end or the
      radially outermost end) to the stator so as to be capable of
      pivoting towards and away from the port 634 so as to allow them to
      be opened or closed and thus selectively alter the angular extent
      of the port.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In a further embodiment multiple port cover elements are
      hingedly attached to a side wall of the stator whereby hinges are
      provided at one of the sides (as opposed to the ends) of each port
      cover element. In yet a further embodiment multiple angularly
      spaced port cover elements are slidably mounted in a side wall of
      the stator, such that in use, each element can be slid either
      substantially radially inwardly towards the rotational axis of the
      rotor or substantially radially outwardly from the rotational
      axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Figure 12 shows a further variable port arrangement of a
      stator 640 which comprises a pivotable cover 641 hinged at 642 so
      as to be able to selectively control the angular extent of port
      643 that is provided in the stator side wall. A further port 644
      of fixed angular extent is also provided in the stator side wall.
      The port 643 is best seen in Figure 12a in which the pivotable
      cover 641 has been omitted. The wall in which the port 643 is
      formed may be a substantially planar wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Figure 13 shows a variable port arrangement provided in the
      outer housing 24 in which one edge is formed by multiple slidable
      valve members 725, 726, 727 and 728 which can slide relative to
      the port 724. In an alternative embodiment the variable port
      arrangement shown in Figure 13 may be used to vary the angular
      extent of a port 9 in a rotor ring 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] In an alternative embodiment the variable port arrangement
      shown in Figure 13 may be provided in a radially innermost base
      wall 13.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] In an alternative embodiment one or more of the valve
      members 725, 726, 727 and 728 are capable of moving towards and
      away from the port 724 in a direction generally radial of the
      annular cylinder space.&lt;"&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0134] In a further alternative embodiment one or more of the
      valve elements 725, 726, 727 and 728 could be hinged at one end or
      side, or mounted on another pivot to allow the elements to be
      opened or closed. In yet a further alternative embodiment one or
      more of the valve elements 725, 726, 727 and 728 could reciprocate
      substantially radially with respect to the chamber axis or in
      another direction to vary the extent of the port.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] In a further alternative embodiment the multiple elements
      725, 726, 727 and 728 could be joined pivotally to one another so
      that they can 'unwrap&lt;1&gt; from the port in the form of a
      'chain' . Specifically, adjacent edges 729 of each element are
      connected by way of a hinge arrangement (not shown). In use, if it
      is required to increase the size of the opening, then the
      appropriate number of elements are folded against each other in
      concertina fashion into a ' stack' whilst the other element/ s
      remain in position to cover part of the port opening. Conversely
      if it is required to decrease the size of the port opening then
      the required number of elements is/are 'unwrapped' from the stack
      to close the opening. Other embodiments are possible in which the
      elements can be lifted away from the opening rather that folding
      into a stack.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] In an alternative embodiment to those shown in Figures 9
      and 13, the angular extent of port provided in the rotor ring (eg
      port 9a) could be adapted to be capable of being varied so as to
      alter the angular extent of the aperture. This could be achieved
      by providing one or more plug members (not shown) which are
      adapted to be capable of being removeably inserted into one or
      more of the openings which form the grill structure of the port of
      the rotor ring 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] If both inlet ports and outlet ports of a rotary piston and
      cylinder device were provided with a variable port arrangement,
      then the compression ratio (for example) , the volume compressed
      and the volume delivered could be independently controlled by
      control of one or both of the inlet and outlet ports.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] In the case of a rotary piston and cylinder device used as
      a compressor, the volume compressed could be reduced by increasing
      the angular extent of the inlet port of the stator. If the angular
      extent of the outlet port of the outer housing (forming the outlet
      valve) remained the same the compression ratio would be reduced.
      If, however, the angular extent of one or both of the outlet ports
      which together form the outlet valve were reduced, then the
      compression ratio could be maintained. This would result in a
      reduction of the volume compressed without a change in the
      compression ratio or delivery power. This effectively allows the
      compressor capacity or mass flow to be changed.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] In the case of an engine embodiment such a valving strategy
      could be used to provide an advanced throttling capability.
      Maintaining the compression ratio while reducing the volume
      compressed would increase the engine efficiency over simply
      reducing the compression ratio and volume compressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] In the case of an engine embodiment a variable inlet port
      in the outer housing of the expander device could be used in
      conjunction with a variable outlet port from the compressor
      device. The variable outlet port from the compressor device would
      allow the compression ratio to be controlled (independent of the
      volume compressed) , the variable inlet port to the expander
      device would allow the port timings to be matched as the
      compressor outlet port was changed.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] It will be appreciated that a plurality of one or more
      different types of any of the variable port arrangements described
      above could be distributed around the annular cylinder space, for
      example multiple angularly spaced inlet ports may be provided. Any
      of the variable port arrangements above may be provided on their
      own or in conjunction with one or more ports of fixed size. Any of
      the variable port arrangements described above may be used in
      combination for the same rotary piston and cylinder device or for
      an assembly comprising two conjoined devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The variable port arrangements described above may be
      controlled in a variety of ways. For example a variable port
      arrangement could be controlled by way of manual intervention,
      either at the time of manufacture and/or as part of a subsequent
      adjustment or tuning procedure. A variable port arrangement could
      be controlled by way of suitable actuation means, such as a
      servo-device, in which a control signal sent to the actuation
      means adjusts the angular extent of the port. Such actuation means
      could be arranged to be controlled in real-time during operation
      of the respective rotary piston and cylinder device in response to
      control signal from one or more sensors and/or in response to data
      stored in memory means. The actuation means could be controlled by
      an engine management system which comprises a data processor and
      memory means, for example in the form of a firmwave device.
      Accordingly, operation of the rotary piston and cylinder device
      could be optimised by way of control of the variable port
      arrangement in response to varying demands on the device. For
      example in an engine embodiment such a change could occur as a
      result of cruising at steady power/speed to accelerating. In a
      compressor such a change may be constituted by a change in the
      flow of fluid demanded or the required delivery pressure required.
      In a supercharger (that may be attached to a conventional engine,
      for example) , such a change in porting may occur to increase the
      mass flow in response to increased engine power demand.<br>

      A transmission assembly for a rotary piston and cylinder device,
      comprising a first gear (120) and a gear sub-assembly (15, 16, 17,
      18, 19), the first gear connectable to a rotatably mounted shutter
      (12) of the device, and the first gear extending from a side of
      the shutter, and the first gear connected to the gear sub-assembly
      which converts rotation to an axis of rotation different to that
      of the shutter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to rotary piston and
      cylinder devices.<br>
      <b><br>
        Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Rotary piston and cylinder devices can take the form of an
      internal combustion engine, or a pump such as a supercharger or
      fluid pump, or as an expander such as a steam engine or turbine
      replacement.<br>
      A rotary piston and cylinder device comprises a rotor and a
      stator, the stator at least partially defining an annular cylinder
      space, the rotor is in the form of a ring, and the rotor
      comprising at least one piston which extends from the rotor ring
      into the annular cylinder space, in use the at least one piston is
      moved circumferentially through the annular cylinder space on
      rotation of the rotor relative to the stator, the rotor body being
      sealed relative to the stator, and the device further comprising
      cylinder space shutter means which is capable of being moved
      relative to the stator to a closed position in which the shutter
      means partitions the annular cylinder space, and to an open
      position in which the shutter means permits passage of the at
      least one piston, the cylinder space shutter means comprising a
      shutter disc.<br>
      The term 'piston' is used herein in its widest sense to include,
      where the context admits, a partition capable of moving relative
      to a cylinder wall, and such partition need not generally be of
      substantial thickness in the direction of relative movement but
      can often be in the form of a blade. The partition may be of
      substantial thickness or may be hollow. The shutter disc may
      present a partition which extends substantially radially of the
      annular cylinder space.<br>
      <br>
      Although in theory the shutter means could be reciprocable, it is
      preferred to avoid the use of reciprocating components,
      particularly when high speeds are required, and the shutter means
      is preferably at least one rotary shutter disc provided with at
      least one aperture which in the open condition of the shutter
      means is arranged to be positioned substantially in register with
      the circumferentially-extending bore of the annular cylinder space
      to permit passage of the at least one piston through the shutter
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      The at least one aperture of the shutter is provided substantially
      radially in the shutter disc.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the axis of rotation of the rotor is not parallel to
      the axis of rotation of the shutter disc. Most preferably the axis
      of rotation of the rotor is substantially orthogonal to the axis
      of rotation of the shutter disc.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the piston is so shaped that it will pass through an
      aperture in the moving shutter means, without balking, as the
      aperture passes through the annular cylinder space. The piston is
      preferably shaped so that there is minimal clearance between the
      piston and the aperture in the shutter means, such that a seal is
      formed as the piston passes through the aperture. A seal is
      preferably provided on a leading or trailing surface or edge of
      the piston. In the case of a compressor a seal could be provided
      on a leading surface and in the case of an expander a seal could
      be provided on a trailing surface.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor body is preferably rotatably supported by the stator
      rather than relying on co-operation between the pistons and the
      cylinder walls to relatively position the rotor body and stator.
      It will be appreciated that a rotary piston and cylinder device is
      distinct from a conventional reciprocating piston device in which
      the piston is maintained coaxial with the cylinder by suitable
      piston rings which give rise to relatively high friction forces.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor ring is preferably rotatably supported by suitable
      bearing means carried by the stator.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the stator comprises at least one inlet port and at
      least one outlet port.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably at least one of the ports is substantially adjacent to
      the shutter means.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the ratio of the angular velocity of the rotor to the
      angular velocity of the shutter disc is 1 : 1.<br>
      <br>
      We seek to provide a transmission assembly for rotary piston and
      cylinder devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a
      transmission assembly for a rotary piston and cylinder device,
      comprising a first gear and a gear sub-assembly, the first gear
      connectable to a rotatably mounted shutter of the device, and the
      first gear extending from a side of the shutter, and the first
      gear connected to the gear sub-assembly which converts rotation to
      an axis of rotation different to that of the shutter.<br>

      rotary piston and cylinder device, comprising a rotor and an
      annular cylinder space, and the rotor is provided with a housing

      </b><b>Detailed Description</b><br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows a stator 1 of a rotary piston and cylinder device.
      The stator comprises three walls 2, 3 and 4. Specifically, there
      is provided a planar or flanged wall 2, a curved wall 3 and a
      cylindrical wall 4. The stator 1 comprises a slot 5 which is
      provided to receive a shutter 12, described below whose purpose is
      to divide an annular cylinder space 6 formed between the stator 1
      and a rotor 8.<br>
      A port 7 is provided in the wall 2 of the stator. Other ports may
      also be provided in the other walls 3, 4 either instead of or in
      addition to the port 7.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 shows the rotor 8, which comprises a dished ring. The
      rotor 8 fits over the stator 1 to define an annular cylinder space
      6. The rotor 8 is provided with an array of holes collectively
      forming a port 9. The port 9 can correspond with a further port in
      an outer stator (not shown) , which comprises a structure arranged
      to be outermost of both the stator 1 and the rotor 8, to form a
      valved port. Alternately, another form of valving or porting may
      be used. With reference now to Figure 3 there is the rotor 8 and
      the stator 1. As shown by the arrow, the stator is urged towards
      the rotor 8, and the walls 3 and 4 are received thereby.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows another view of the rotor 8. A piston 10 is
      attached to an inner surface 11 of the rotor 8. The piston 10
      partitions the annular cylinder space 6 which is formed by the
      inner surfaces of the walls 2, 3 and 4 and the inner surface 11 of
      the rotor ring 8.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 shows a shutter 12 which is accommodated in the slot 5 in
      the stator 1 and partitions the annular cylinder space 6. The
      shutter is provided with a slot 13 which allows the piston 10 to
      pass therethrough. As described below a transmission assembly is
      provided to synchronise the rotation of the rotor 8 and the
      shutter 12.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 shows the shutter 12 in situ in the slot 5 of the stator
      1 , dividing the annular cylinder space 6.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7 shows a reverse angle view of the shutter 12, the stator
      1 and the rotor 8 in an assembled condition. The port 7 in the
      stator 1 can also be seen.<br>
      <br>
      Various embodiments of the transmission assemblies suitable for
      the rotary piston and cylinder device set out above are now
      described.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 8 and 9 show a first transmission assembly for
      transmission from the rotor 8 to the shutter 12. It is noted that
      the rotor 8 in these and subsequent figures is shown without the
      port holes 9 and piston 10 for reasons of clarity.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor 8 comprises a tubular portion 8a in the form of a
      cylinder which extends away from the dished portion 8b. At a
      distal end of the tubular portion there is provided a drive plate
      14 which is integral with the rotor 8.<br>
      <br>
      The drive plate 14 is attached to a main drive shaft 15 such that
      in operation there is no relative rotation between the rotor 8,
      the drive plate 14 and the main drive shaft 15.<br>
      <br>
      The main drive shaft 15 has a spur gear 16 attached to it. The
      spur gear 16 meshes with a spur gear 17 which in turn is attached
      to a secondary shaft 18. A crossed helical gear 19 is also
      attached to the secondary shaft 18. The crossed helical gear 19
      meshes with a further crossed helical gear 20 to drive the shutter
      12 either directly or via another shaft or transmission element
      (not shown) . The gear 20 is provided as extending from one side
      of the shutter 12, and is within the footprint of the shutter.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 10 shows components of the transmission assembly of Figures
      8 and 9 in which the rotor 8 and drive plate 14 have been omitted
      for clarity.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 11 shows a further view of components of the transmission
      assembly of Figures 8 and 9 as would be seen looking from the
      drive plate 14 towards the shutter 12.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that the packaging, ie the volumetric arrangement, of
      the transmission arrangement (in this case formed in part by the
      gear pairs 16 and 17 and 19 and 20) is related to the available
      space for the annular cylinder space 6. It is beneficial to
      maximise the annular cylinder space for a given overall size of
      device. As an alternative, the drive plate 14 shown in Figure 8
      may be a separate part to the rotor 8 fixed together in such a way
      that in operation the drive plate 14 and rotor 8 cannot rotate
      relative to one another.<br>
      <br>
      As a further alternative, the drive plate 14 may include an
      adjustment mechanism so that the relative rotational position of
      the rotor 8 and the drive plate 14 can be adjusted. The effect of
      this adjustment is to allow the timing between the piston 10 and
      the slot 13 in the shutter 12 to be changed. Specifically the
      adjustment mechanism allows the relative position of the piston 10
      and the slot 13 of the shutter 12 to be adjusted. As the piston 10
      passes through the shutter one face of the piston seals against
      the slot 13. The adjustment mechanism allows the sealing gap to be
      adjusted after assembly of the device (to adjust the piston to
      slot clearance and take up any manufacturing tolerances) . This
      type of adjustment mechanism is feasible for use with all of the
      transmission arrangements set out herein.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 12 and 13 show an example of a separate (ie non-integral)
      drive plate 14 attached to the rotor 8 by a ring of bolts 22. In
      the embodiment shown the bolts 22 pass through slots 23 in the
      drive plate 14 into holes in the tubular portion 8a of the rotor
      8. When tightened the bolts 22 clamp the drive plate 14 to the
      rotor 8 preventing relative rotation therebetween. When the bolts
      22 are loosened the drive plate 14 can rotate, as shown by the
      double-headed arrow, relative to the rotor 8 to allow the timing
      between the piston 10 and the slot 13 in the shutter 12 to be
      adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      An adjustment component 24 to assist in the adjustment of the
      drive plate 14 relative to the rotor 8 is also shown. The
      adjustment component 24 in Figure 12 locates in a slot 25 in the
      drive plate 14. Other methods of clamping the drive plate 14 to
      the rotor 8 are possible. The adjustment component 24 comprises an
      offset or eccentric pin 26 which locates in a hole 50 in the rotor
      8, such that as the adjustment component 24 is rotated, the drive
      plate is urged to move relative to the rotor 8. The component 24
      comprises a keying recess 60 which is adapted to receive suitable
      tool to enable the component to be rotated.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 14a and 14b show two views of the adjustment compartment
      24. This is just one example of a mechanism that could be used to
      enable the relative rotational position of the drive plate 14 and
      the rotor 8 to be changed.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrangement shown in Figure 8, the shutter 12 is largely
      coincident with a radial line through the annular cylinder space 6
      about the cylinder space axis. In that arrangement the axis of the
      rotor 8, the axis of the annular cylinder space 6 and the axis of
      the main drive shaft 15 pass through or close to the shutter. This
      is clearly shown in Figure 11.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 15 shows a further view of the arrangement of Figure 8 (in
      which the tubular portion 8a has been removed) showing how the
      shutter 12 is largely co-incident with the axis of the rotor 8 and
      with the axis of the main drive shaft 15.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible for the shutter 12 to be repositioned so that it is
      no longer co-incident with a radial line through the annular
      cylinder space 6 about the cylinder space axis.<br>
      <br>
      If the shutter is moved as described it is possible to modify the
      layout shown in Figure 8 and omit one of the gear pairs 16, 17 and
      the secondary shaft 18. Figures 16, 17 and 18 show an alternative
      to the arrangement shown in Figure 8 in which the shutter 12 has
      been repositioned as described above and the transmission means
      simplified from that of the arrangement shown in Figure 8. The
      view in Figure 16 is equivalent to that of Figure 15 and clearly
      shows how the shutter 12 has been moved from the arrangement of
      Figure 8. A crossed helical gear 28, shown in Figure 16, is the
      equivalent of the crossed helical gear 20 in the arrangement of
      Figure 8<br>
      <br>
      Figure 17 shows another view of the arrangement described in
      Figure 16. The view shown in Figure 17 is similar to the view of
      the arrangement of Figure 8 shown in Figure 10. A crossed helical
      gear 27 is the equivalent of the crossed helical gear 19 in the
      arrangement of Figure 8. The crossed helical gear 28 is the
      equivalent of the crossed helical gear 20 in the arrangement of
      Figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 18 shows a representation of the arrangement shown in
      Figure 16 in which the circle 29 represents the inner wall 4
      defining part of the annular cylinder space 6.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that the packaging of the transmission arrangement (in
      this case formed in part by the gear pair 27 and 28) is related to
      the available space for the annular cylinder space 6.<br>
      <br>
      The packaging benefits shown in Figure 18 can be compared to
      Figure 11 which shows a similar view of the arrangement of Figure
      8. It will be appreciated that the circle 29 in Figure 18 is
      equivalent to the circle 21 in Figure 11.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement shown in Figure 8 uses a pair of spur gears 16 and
      17 and a pair of crossed helical gears 19 and 20 as part of the
      transmission from the rotor 8 to the shutter 12.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative arrangement shown in Figure 19, the crossed
      helical gears 19 and 20 of the arrangement shown in Figure 8 have
      been replaced with a pair of bevel gears 30 and 31. It will be
      appreciated that the teeth of the bevel gears have been omitted
      for reasons of clarity. The bevel gears 30 and 31 can allow higher
      rotational speed and lower transmission losses than the crossed
      helical gears 19 and 20 of the arrangement shown in Figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 20 shows an alternative arrangement closely based on Figure
      19 in which the bevel gear 30 has been re-positioned on the
      secondary shaft 18. In different layouts of the rotary piston and
      cylinder device set forth it may be beneficial to use either the
      arrangement shown in Figure 19 or that shown in Figure 20. One
      example would be to ensure that the gears are below the shutter so
      that gravity tends to draw any lubricant away from the shutter,
      the arrangement shown in Figure 19 or Figure 20 would be chosen
      dependant on the preferred direction of rotation of the shutter.
      It will be appreciated that the directions of rotation of the
      shutter and rotor determine the angle at which the piston 10 is
      orientated on the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 21 shows an alternative arrangement related to that of
      Figure 19 and Figure 20. The arrangement shown in Figure 21
      comprises a pair of spur gears 34 and 35 and a pair of bevel gears
      32 and 33 as part of the transmission between the rotor 8 and the
      shutter 12. In the arrangement shown the main shaft 15 has a bevel
      gear 32 attached to it. This bevel gear 32 meshes with a further
      bevel gear 33 which is directly coupled to a spur gear 34. The
      coupling between the bevel gear 33 and the spur or helical gear 34
      may be by a short shaft, or the gears may be directly fixed to one
      another as an assembly, or there may be another method of fixing
      them so that they cannot rotate relative to one another. The spur
      gear 34 meshes with a further spur gear 35 which drives the
      shutter 12 either directly or via a shaft or other transmission
      means. The layout shown in Figure 21 omits the secondary shaft 18
      of the arrangements shown in Figures 19 and 20. Omitting the
      secondary shaft provides the advantage of increasing the torsional
      stiffness of the transmission assembly.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, Figure 21 allows the use of larger gears than the
      assemblies shown in Figures 19 and 20 within a similar package
      space within the annular cylinder space 6. The use of larger gears
      can enhance the transmission accuracy and so increase the accuracy
      of timing between the piston 10 and the slot 13 in the shutter 12.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative assembly to that shown in Figure 21 reverses the
      positions of the spur gear 34 and the bevel gear 33 so that the
      bevel gear 33 is closer to the shutter 12 face than the spur gear
      34. This reduces the size of the bevel gears, but may aid
      packaging in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 22 shows a further alternative to the arrangement shown in
      Figure 20. In Figure 22, the pair of spur gears 16 and 17 of the
      arrangement shown in Figure 20 have been replaced with three spur
      gears 36, 37 and 38. This arrangement can offer a small
      improvement in the packaging of the spur gears but at the
      financial expense of an extra gear.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of spur gears 36, 37 and 38 in Figure 22, could
      also replace the spur gears 16 and 17 in the arrangement shown in
      Figure 8 or in the arrangement shown in Figure 19.<br>
      <br>
      As a further alternative the pair of spur gears 16 and 17 in the
      arrangement shown in Figure 8, in the arrangement shown in Figure
      19 or in the arrangement shown in Figure 20 or the pair of spur
      gears 34 and 35 of the arrangement shown in Figure 21 could be
      replaced with oval, elliptical or non-circular gears. The geometry
      of piston 10 and of the slot 13 in the shutter means can be
      changed with non-circular gears which can offer benefits in some
      arrangements. Possible benefits include improved sealing between
      the piston 10 and the slot 13 as the piston 10 passes through the
      shutter 12. In turn, one of the reasons for this improved sealing
      could be a change in shape of the blade due to the change in gear
      ratio. A further advantage is that the non-circular gears can be
      configured so that the transmission is accelerating or
      decelerating around the point that the piston 10 passes through
      the shutter 12, taking up backlash within the gears of the
      transmission.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 23 shows a pair of non-circular gears 39 and 40 that could
      be used to replace the spur gears 16 and 17 of the arrangements
      shown in Figure 8, Figure 19 or Figure 20. It will be appreciated
      that only some of the teeth of each of the gears are shown for the
      sake of simplicity of presentation.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 24 shows a pair of non-circular gears 41 and 42 that could
      be used to replace the spur gears 34 and 35 of the arrangement
      shown in Figure 21.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the transmission assemblies described above a single
      piston 10 is attached to the rotor 8 and a single slot 13 is
      provided in the shutter 12. This means that the overall drive
      ratio (or average drive ratio in the case of the oval gears) of
      the transmission means between the rotor 8 and the shutter 12 is 1
      : 1.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrangements described above with more than one gear pair
      (all apart from the arrangement of Figure 16) , the individual
      gear pairs may have different gear ratios, while still giving an
      overall 1 : 1 ratio for the transmission. Considering the
      arrangement shown in Figure 19, the spur gear 16 may have twenty
      five teeth and the spur gear 17 may have twenty three teeth giving
      a drive ratio for this pair 16 and 17 of gears of 25 :23. In the
      same example if the bevel gear 30 has twenty three teeth and the
      bevel gear 31 has twenty five teeth the drive ratio for this pair
      30 and 31 of gears is 23:25. The overall transmission ratio is
      still 1 : 1 but the individual gear pairs have different ratios.
      This type of arrangement is generally considered as best practice
      because the same teeth do not mesh on each rotation, and is
      generally referred to as 'hunting tooth' . In the transmission
      arrangements described above, however, there is a benefit in going
      against this best practice design and ensuring that the
      transmission ratio of all gear pairs in the transmission from the
      rotor 8 to the shutter 12 is 1 : 1 , not just the overall
      transmission ratio. If the transmission ratio of all gears in the
      transmission means is 1 : 1 , the same teeth in all gears will
      mesh every rotation. This allows higher accuracy in the timing
      between the rotor 8 and the shutter 12 at the point that the
      piston 10 passes through the slot 13 in the shutter 12. The
      potential for increased gear wear of this type of arrangement is
      reduced in the rotary piston and cylinder device set forth as the
      transmission would typically be expected to be relatively lightly
      loaded.<br>
      <br>
      A further arrangement related to that shown in Figure 20 is shown
      in Figures 25, 26 and 27. In the arrangement shown in Figure 25,
      the spur gears 16 and 17 have been replaced with a internal or
      ring gear 43 and mating gear 44. As shown in Figure 26 the ring
      gear 43 is attached to an inner surface of the tubular portion 8a
      of the rotor 8. The tooth form of these gears may be straight or
      helical or of some other form. In this arrangement the overall
      transmission ratio can be 1 : 1 but it is not possible for the
      transmission ratios of the individual gear pairs to be 1 : 1. This
      arrangement offers packaging benefits in particular embodiments.
      In any of the arrangements described above where spur gears are
      employed, these may be replaced by helical gears.<br>
      <br>
      In any of the arrangements described above employing bevel gears,
      the bevel gears may be either straight cut, or helical or employ
      some other tooth form.<br>
      <br>
      In any of the arrangements described above employing crossed
      helical gears, the crossed helical gear pair could be replaced by
      a hypoid gear pair.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 28 and 29 show an example of the shutter 12 being provided
      with an axis of rotation which is different to that of the rotor
      8, but the axes are not orthogonal to one another. The
      transmission assembly comprises a bevelled gear 70, which meshes
      with a bevel gear 71 , the bevel gear 71 being connected to the
      shaft 15. In the arrangement shown, the bevel gears 70, 71 are of
      hypoid form.<br>
      <br>
      Alternative embodiments may comprise any of a large range of
      transmission components including belts, chains, flexible joints,
      such as universal joints, or any combination of the
      aforementioned.<br>
      A rotary piston and cylinder device comprising any of the
      transmission assemblies described above achieves desirable
      requirements for packaging, transmission accuracy and transmission
      stiffness characteristics.<br>
