      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction<br>
          </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The 16th century French
          doctor <b>Michel Nostradamus</b> (de Notredame) is widely
          considered to be the greatest prophet of all time, though
          Christians balk at the claim (dogma rules that the Bible is
          foremost). <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His predictions "extend from
          now [ the 16th century ] to the year 3797". Nostradamus first
          wrote his quatrains in plain Old French, and he included names
          and dates. Then he rewrote them in a complex code of acronyms,
          anagrams, apocopes, synechdoches, ellipses, hyperbations and
          metatheses, syncopes, aphereses, epentheses, metonyms, and
          other exotic grammars and syntaxes. Nostradamus burned (or
          possibly buried) the original, explicit prose prophecies,
          because he did not want to complicate unduly humanity's
          problem of free choice, or to encourage a fatalism that might
          deter us from making our best efforts to correct ourselves.
          Nor did he wish to interfere with the fulfillment of his
          prophecies by stating them too clearly in advance. And, he had
          no desire to incur the wrath of the Holy Inquisition:</font> </p>
      Some 40 of Nostradamus' quatrains mention "plague" or
      "pestilence'. The following examples seem pertinent to the current
      so-called "Ebola" epidemic / plague ( which however bears little
      resemblance to the original form of the disease, but has been
      tagged with the same label ). There were outbreaks of bubonic
      plague after Nostradamus' day, and perhaps those can be ascribed
      to some of his quatrains, but others clearly refer to the present
      day.<br>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shortly after the
          publication of The True Centuries, Nostradamus became famous
          as some of his prophecies found fulfillment in the death of
          King Henry II. In the ensuing centuries, about half of his
          predictions have been fulfilled with acceptable (and sometimes
          startling) accuracy. Following is a partial list of historical
          events foreseen by the prophet according to a consensus of
          some of his commentators' interpretations:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>16th century:</i>

          War (C.5:12 and C.5:13); and William III of England and the

          V (C.8:31).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nostradamusâ€™ prophecies have
          gone through many editions, some of which are counterfeit.
          Most are riddled with typographic and other editorial errors.
          The definitive study is Edgar Leoni's Nostradamus and His
          Prophecies, which represents the authentic spelling and style
          of the first edition. That work was used as the primary
          reference in this study. Most other modern translations are
          travesties, and the interpretations based on them are mere
          fantasy.</font> </p>

      <b>C.1-16</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The scythe joined with the pond toward Sagittarius<br>
      At the high point of its ascendant,<br>
      Plague, famine, death by military hand,<br>
      The century approaches its renewal<br>
      <br>
      According to Line 4, this quatrain apparently pertains to the
      close of the 20th century, but that be a general benchmark. Line 1
      is an astrological indicator : the "scythe" refers to Saturn, the
      "pond" to Aquarius. Saturn will enter Aquarius in March 2020<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.1-26</b> mentions "Tuscan plague" -- Tuscany being in France.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.1-52</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The two wicked ones conjoined in Scorpio,<br>
      The Grand Seignior murdered in his hall;<br>
      Plague to the Church by the King newly joined,<br>
      Europe low and northerly.<br>
      <br>
      "The two wicked ones" are Mars and Saturn in Scorpio. Saturn is in
      Scorpio at this time ( October 2014 ), and Mars will be conjunct
      soon...<br>
      <br>
      Line 2 apparently foretells the assassination of the Pope -- good
      riddance to another Jesuit monster.<br>
      <br>
      The rather inexplicable third line refers to the plague, perhaps
      in Italy, home of the Catholic Church.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.1-55</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Under the climate opposite to the Babylonian<br>
      There will be great effusion of blood,<br>
      The unrighteous will be on land and sea, in air and sky,<br>
      Sects, famine, realms, plague, confusion.<br>
      <br>
      The above is a fair description of modern times.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.2-6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Near the gates and within two cities<br>
      There will be two scourges the like of which was never seen<br>
      Famine within plague, people put out by steel,<br>
      Crying to the great immortal God for relief.<br>
      <br>
      This quatrain is vague and undated, but self-explanatory and
      easily pertinent today.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.2-19</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Newcomers, place built without defense,<br>
      Place occupied then uninhabitable:<br>
      Meadows, houses, fields, towns to take at pleasure, <br>
      Famine, plague, war, extensive land arable.<br>
      <br>
      This quatrain is an fair description of modern Israel; line 3
      indicates the theft of Palestine by Zionists.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.2-37</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Of that great number that one will send<br>
      To relieve those besieged in the fort,<br>
      Plague and famine will devour them all,<br>
      Except seventy who will be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      Troops sent to the Middle East will be abandoned to their
      miserable fate.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.2-46</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is prepared<br>
      The Great Mover renews the ages:<br>
      Rain, blood, milk, famine, steel and plague,<br>
      In the heavens fire seen. a long spark running.<br>
      <br>
      This quatrain suggests that World War III is being brought about
      in this 21st century. Line 4 is descriptive of a major comet.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.2-53</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The great plague of the maritime city<br>
      Will not cease until there be avenged the death<br>
      Of the just blood, condemned for a price without crime,<br>
      Of the great lady unwronged by pretense.<br>
      <br>
      Marseille is a prime candidate for the "maritime city" of line 1.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.3-75</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pau, Verona. Vicenza, Saragossa,<br>
      From distant swords lands wet with blood:<br>
      Very great plague will come with the great shell,<br>
      Relief near, and the remedies very far.<br>
      <br>
      France and Italy will be at war with "distant swords" -- viz.,
      Muslim scimitars -- and struck with biological weapons delivered
      by bombs ("the great shell"). Apparently the Europeans will be
      victorious against the jihadist, but medical aid will not be
      available.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.3-84</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The great city will be thoroughly desolated,<br>
      Of the inhabitants not a single one will remain there:<br>
      Wall, sex, temple and virgin violated,<br>
      Through sword, fire, plague, cannon people will die.<br>
      <br>
      This quatrain probably refers to the destruction of Paris or Rome.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.4-48</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The fertile, spacious Ausonian plain<br>
      Will produce so many gadflies and locusts,<br>
      The solar brightness will become clouded,<br>
      All devoured, great plague to come from them.<br>
      <br>
      Ausonia refers to Naples, Italy. <br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.5-49</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Not from Spain but from ancient France<br>
      Will one be elected for the trembling bark,<br>
      To the enemy will a promise be made,<br>
      He who will cause a great plague in his realm.<br>
      <br>
      After the Pope is assassinated as predicted in C.*** above,
      negotiations will be held with the Muslims. Line 4 may well refer
      to the pathetic incompetence of Barack Obama, whose present
      failure to perform responsibly and will enable plague to ravage
      the USA.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.5-63</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From the vain enterprise honor and undue complaint,<br>
      Boats tossed about among the Latins, cold, hunger, waves<br>
      Not far from the Tiber the land stained with blood,<br>
      And diverse plagues will be upon mankind.<br>
      <br>
      Another prediction of grave troubles for Italy...<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.5-90</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the Cyclades, in Perinthus and Larissa,<br>
      In Sparta and the entire Peloponnesus:<br>
      Very great famine, plague through false dust,<br>
      Nine months it will last and throughout the entire peninsula.<br>
      <br>
      Alternative translations of the false "dust" in line 3 : "ashes",
      or "exertions". "False exertions" suggests that the plague is
      caused by biological warfare, and that government efforts to
      contain it are fraudulent, the actual intent being to reduce the
      population as demanded by proponents of the New World Order (
      e.g., Kissinger, et al.).<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>C.6-5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Very great famine through pestiferous wave,<br>
      Through long rain the length of the arctic pole:<br>
      "Samarobryn" one hundred leagues from the hemisphere,<br>
      They will live without law exempt from politics.<br>
      <br>
      This is one of the most famous of Nostradamus' quatrains; it
      appears to suggest that a colony will be established in high orbit
      above Earth and live safely while plague and famine desolate the
      planet.<br>

      Corsica, Salerno, and the Isle of Sardinia,<br>
      Famine, plague, war, end of evils remote.<br>
      <br>
      As stated in several other quatrains, the Muslim invasion will
      decimate Italy.<br>

      The super-wealthy " 1 % " will lose everything in the coming
      collapse of this "civilization", brought about by "three brothers"
      -- the Lehmans ?, or governments ( USA, UK, China ? ). The "marine
