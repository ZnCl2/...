      </b><b>Silver-loaded textile compound and silver-loading process

      The invention discloses a silver-loaded textile compound and a
      sliver-loading process thereof. The silver-loaded textile compound
      comprises a silver-loaded textile body, wherein the silver-loaded
      textile is silver sesquioxide. The process steps are as follows:
      (1) placing textile in tetrasilver tetroxide solution, keeping the
      temperature of the mixture within 40 DEG C to 95 DEG C for 20-120
      minutes; (2), getting out and drying the textile for 5-150 minutes
      within 70 DEG C to 150 DEG C; (3), placing the dried textile in
      the solution of sodium (potassium) hydroxide and sodium
      (potassium) persulfate, keeping the temperature of the solution
      within 40 DEG C to 95 DEG C for 10-100 minutes; and (4), getting
      out and washing the textile 2-3 times with water, drying the
      washed textile within 70 DEG C to 150 DEG C to acquire the
      silver-loaded textile compound. The invention has the advantage
      that the silver sesquioxide loaded on the silver-loaded textile
      compound is a trivalent silver oxide with higher positive
      electricity, which is formed by the steps of bonding tetrasilver
      tetroxide with fabric to form a coordination bond, and then
      oxidizing the coordination bond; thus the silver sesquioxide is
      bonded with fiber fabric firmer to achieve stronger bactericidal
      action.<br>

      comprises the following steps of: putting the textile into a
      solution of tetrasilver tetroxide, and keeping at the temperature
      of between 40 and 95DEG C for 20 to 120 minutes; (2) taking the
      textile out, and drying at the temperature of between 70 and

      washing with water for 2 to 3 times, and drying at the temperature
      of between 70 and 150DEG C to obtain the silver coated

      silver sesquioxide coated on the silver coating compound for the
      textile is tervalent silver oxide with higher positive charge,
      which is formed by bonding the tetrasilver tetroxide and the

      </b>The invention relates to a silver-based bactericide, and in
      particular relates to a tetrasilver-tetraoxide-loaded silica
      antibacterial material and a preparation method as well as an
      application thereof. Tetrasilver tetraoxide is uniformly
      distributed on the gap surface of silica, wherein each 1000g of
      the antibacterial material contains 0.027 to 0.94g of tetrasilver
      tetraoxide. The formed tetrasilver tetraoxide crystals are
      ultra-fine crystals which are uniformly distributed on the surface
      of silica, and are uniform in granularity, large in specific
      surface area, high in surface atom ratio as well as strong in

      adsorbing organic toxic and harmful substances is enhanced at the
      same time. In addition, active groups exist on the surfaces of the

      </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Current emphasis on elimination of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
      challenges researchers to assess the efficacy of alternative
      treatment modalities. Previous studies have been conducted using
      different silver preparations such as silver nitrate (AgNO3) and
      silver oxide hydrosol (Ag404) to treat HIV/AIDS patients. These
      studies did not use nanoparticles and used small sample sizes.
      Nanoparticle preparations hold particular promise because of their
      ability to enhance surface coverage. The present investigation is
      designed to test the efficacy of silver nanoparticle preparations
      using a pretest- posttest methodology. This research proposal is
      intended to increase awareness of a complimentary approach to HIV
      treatment and to stimulate future silver nanoparticle research.<br>

      <br>
      A method and apparatus for destroying blood borne pathogens is
      disclosed which utilizes a low intensity direct current to
      generate positive particles from various metals which destroy
      viral pathogens. A first electrode comprised of a metal such as
      silver is inserted into a patient's venous system. Then, a second
      electrode is placed on the patient's exterior in the vicinity of
      the first electrode. A low intensity direct current is applied to
      the first metal electrode which releases silver cations to be
      bonded to the virus, resulting in the denaturing of the virus. The
      first electrode is placed in the venous system of the infected
      patient via a catheter.<br>
