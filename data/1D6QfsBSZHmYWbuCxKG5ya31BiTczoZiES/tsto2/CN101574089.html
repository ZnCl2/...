      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XIAOMIN JING, ET AL.<br>
      <br>
      The invention discloses a method for preparing a molecular crystal
      cell material for sterilizing and killing algae, which comprises
      the following preparation processes: adding tetrasilver tetraoxide
      into ammonia hydroxide solution to form ammonia hydroxide solution
      of the tetrasilver tetraoxide; dissolving acrylic resin, epoxy
      resin, polyvinyl alcohol or polyurethane in water by heating to
      form gel; mixing the ammonia hydroxide solution of the tetrasilver
      tetraoxide and the gel to form tetrasilver tetraoxide gel
      solution; and spraying the tetrasilver tetraoxide gel solution on
      the surface of a silver-carried material, and drying the
      silver-carried material to form the molecular crystal cell
      material. The process is simple; because the tetrasilver
      tetraoxide in a sol-gel form is combined with the silver-carried
      material, the anti-bacterial capability of the prepared
      tetrasilver tetraoxide molecular crystal cell material is not
      influenced by environment; and the molecular crystal cell material
      can be used for sterilizing and algae killing of landscape pools
      and household view fish jars, also can be used for sterilizing and
      algae killing of underground water source and industrial
      circulating pool, and realizes the conversion from sterilizing and
      algae killing of a fluid bed to sterilizing and algae killing of a
      fixed bed in the application of a tetrasilver tetraoxide molecular
      crystal cell.<br>

      <b>Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b>[0004]<br>
      <br>
      Silver and its compounds have antibacterial properties have been
      used in a variety of areas, such as fungicides, antimicrobial
      dressings, water purification equipment, ceramics,
      pharmaceuticals, etc.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      Currently, people bactericidal mechanism of silver and its
      compounds have been studied multi-faceted.<br>
      Its bactericidal properties and its valence and structure closely
      related to its antibacterial properties are as follows:<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4&gt; Ag3 +&gt; Ag2 +&gt; Ag +&gt; Ag.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Tetroxide four silver (Ag4O4) is composed of two trivalent silver,
      with silver valence polyvalent compound having two monovalent
      silver atoms and four oxygen atoms formed by dsp2 electrons.<br>
      <br>
      It is a semiconductor, diamagnetic crystal active electronic,
      active electrons from single and triple bond between two electrons
      exchange were to form a battery can discharge kill bacteria.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      Tetroxide four silver is stable under normal circumstances, when
      faced with something like -NHx, -SH, -SS group, it will inspire
      Ag4O4 internal Ag3 + / Ag + electronic exchange transfer, a series
      of redox reactions and electron transition, the formation of
      chelates, complexes, a voltage of about 1.48 ~ 3V.<br>
      <br>
      Killing effect to generate electricity so that bacteria, viruses
      -NHx, -SH, -SS group protein conformational change, loss of
      activity, no more copy, play sterilization, algae effect.<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Many studies show that research institutions: Ag4O4 to have
      selectively kill pathogens, but for normal human cells and the
      exterior environment showed no toxicity.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Patent US6436420B disclose the contents Ag4O4 applied
      antimicrobial fabric.<br>
      <br>
      Since tetroxide four silver powder from caking dimerization,
      binding of low factor attachments, so the antibacterial ability
      affected.<br>
