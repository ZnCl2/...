      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b>[0004]<br>
      <br>
      Current research and application of fungicides mainly in the
      chemical control of diseases caused by fungi, and chemical
      research for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by
      bacteria and viruses develop was not enough.<br>
      <br>
      Bactericidal effect of silver had been discovered in recent years
      in the crack sterilization principle of silver, but also
      increasingly want to sterilization principle applied to products
      in the silver go, but not the silver as prevent bacteria, viruses,
      fungicides on the market and applied to product examples appear.<br>
      <br>
      On the "Chinese Journal of New Drugs and Clinical" reported the
      July 2005 issue of "Advances in medical tetroxide four silver", he
      pointed out tetroxide four silver is expected to become a new type
      of anti-microbial agents and used in the treatment of AIDS, cancer
      and other diseases ???<br>

      Preparation tetroxide four silver bactericide, which comprises the
      steps of:<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      (1) PH value of the weak alkaline solution to 7.0 to 7.5 as the
      solvent, taking a weak alkaline solution 800 to 1200 parts, is
      added 0.1 to 0.5 parts tetroxide four silver sufficiently diluted;<br>

      Tetroxide four silver bactericidal additive fungicide application
      as antimicrobial coatings.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      According to the mechanism of two fungicides:&nbsp; interfere with
      the bacteria through the process of respiration, inhibit energy
      production to sterilization; bacterial life interfering substances
      such as protein biosynthesis, nucleic acids, alcohols, etc. to
      sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      Bactericide tetroxide four silver produced as a fungicide belongs
      to the second type of mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis tetroxide four silver (Ag4O4) mechanism of action,
      antimicrobial sequence silver ions are: Ag3 +&gt; Ag2 +&gt; Ag1 +,
      and tetroxide four silver (Ag4O4) is a unique conformation
      "multivalent silver" oxides, which with the protein surface
      exposed group and 2S group 2N redox reaction, thereby producing
      the protein causes a conformational change in the electrical
      killing effect and chelation.<br>
      Its mechanism of action is different from the general
      anti-microbial agents, the mode of action are unlikely to cause
      pathogen resistance or mutation, no toxicity to normal tissues,
      has anti-microbial and anti-disease cells.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      Beneficial effects: tetroxide four silver with disturbance,
      prevents bacteria, especially bacteria and viruses living matter
      biosynthesis role will tetroxide four silver in the form of
      sterilization bactericide additives in the production of
      antibacterial plastic products, antibacterial fiber products,
      anti-bacterial fabric , against a variety of plant diseases caused
      by pathogenic microorganisms, medical equipment and reagent
      additive, antibacterial paint and antibacterial sanitary and other
      widely used in these areas, with good inhibition of bacterial,
      viral effect, simple preparation method of the present invention,
      suitable for large scale industrial production, the application of
      the method is simple and practical.<br>

      </b>[0027]<br>
      <br>
      Containing the resulting tetroxide four silver bactericide agents
      in Example 1 is sprayed onto the air filter, naturally obtained
      after curing and drying antibacterial effect of air filter
      implementation.<br>
      Tetroxide four silver bactericide may also be in the form of a
      plastic coupling agent added, is about dissolved tetroxide four
      silver fungicide solution sprayed onto the plastic particles, and
      then drying can be used.<br>
      [0028]<br>
      <br>
      Upon examination, sprayed air filter tetroxide four silver
      bactericide in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella

      <br>
      Air conditioning has been formed on the housing directly in
      Example 1 was tetroxide four silver bactericide or a mist coating
      manner tetroxide four silver bactericide in combination with
      air-conditioned housing.<br>
      Since the outer surface of the air conditioning is very smooth,
      can be corona treatment, that is, under high voltage electric
      field, the electron flow on the air conditioner shell surface
      strong impact that can make the shell surface fluff becomes rough,
      increase the surface area, when the fungicide with When contact
      with the surface, can produce good wetting, it will penetrate into
      the recessed groove is galling to go, by the anchor role, firmly
      bonded in a plastic housing.<br>
      <br>
      Using this principle, the corona treatment after applying
      tetroxide four silver germicide mist or coating, dried at a
