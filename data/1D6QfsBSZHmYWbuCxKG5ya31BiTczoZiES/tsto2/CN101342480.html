      The invention has discloses a tetrasilver tetroxide coal activated
      carbon, a preparation method and an application; the tetrasilver
      tetroxide coal activated carbon contains coal activated carbon and
      tetrasilver tetroxide; the tetrasilver tetroxide is adsorbed on
      the surface or the aperture of the coal activated carbon. The
      preparation method is as follows: the coal activated carbon is
      washed and dried for stand-by; the tetrasilver tetroxide is
      blended with an alkalescent solvent; the blended liquid is sprayed
      on the coal activated carbon; a silver-loaded coal activated
      carbon is re-dried so as to obtain the tetrasilver tetroxide coal
      activated carbon. As a filter material, the tetrasilver tetroxide
      coal activated carbon is applied in a water cleaner and a direct
      drinking water supply project. The silver on the surface of the
      tetrasilver tetroxide coal activated carbon prepared by the
      preparation method cannot fall off; the tetrasilver tetroxide coal

      At present, the domestic market a wide range of filter material
      many different purposes and disadvantages.<br>
      The activated carbon is one of them, using activated carbon as the
      filter media manufactured to a certain time, because the activated
      carbon adsorption of itself only, no sterilization effect, after a
      certain period of time a large number of activated carbon
      adsorption of organic contaminants, the microbial pole easy to
      breed, decomposition of organic matter under the action of
      microorganisms on activated carbon interface, allowing the gradual
      decomposition of organic nitrogen-protein nitrogen, ammonia
      nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, making the activated carbon filter to
      increase the nitrite content of the water will be in the activated
      carbon within and filter bed hereby raw bacteria to produce
      secondary pollution, it will not only reach the purpose of water
      purification, it will pollute the water.<br>
      In recent years, with the sterilization principle of silver
      gradually recognized, emerging markets a wide range of
      permeability silver (or silver) activated carbon, the
      manufacturing method for the solution of most of the immersion
      method, there are different degrees of loss of silver, silver is a
      heavy metal , it is harmful to the body, how to solve the problem
      of silver activated carbon in the fall of silver water is a
      problem.<br>

      It said tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal
      preparation method comprises the following steps:<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      1), the activated carbon from coal after washing and drying stand;
      tetroxide four silver and a weight ratio of PH value 0.5 ~ 1 â€°
      proportions in a weak alkaline solvent 7.0 to 7.5;<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      2) the step 1) spraying the mixture to a temperature at 50 ~ 80 ?
      activated carbon from coal on;<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      3) Step 2) obtained silver activated carbon from coal at 70 ~ 90
      ?, drying in the light of the anti-seal equipment 8 to 15 minutes
      to obtain tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal.<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      The above step (1) of the weakly basic solvent is ammonia, sodium

      <br>
      Tetroxide four silver coal activated carbon as a filter material
      in water purifier and drinking water supply project equipment.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      Tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal is the use of
      activated carbon from coal-rich cellular structure, high strength,
      reasonable ratio, the four-four silver oxide coating to the
      surface of activated carbon from coal, at a certain temperature,
      time, matter free enthalpy increases, the molecule can absorb
      energy of physical adsorption and chemisorption excitation
      probability of entry, in other words, since the excitation energy
      between molecules, the surface-treated activated carbon, active
      surface free radicals, combined with silver ions close, substance
      the possibility of combining the Intermolecular transition to form
      covalent bonds increases, and thus will not fall off due to water
      erosion, thereby obtaining a can absorb and kill the harmful
      substances, bacteria tetroxide four silver activated carbon from
      coal.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      Beneficial effects: tetroxide four silver coal activated carbon of
      the present invention can effectively remove chlorine, heavy
      metals, organic pollutants, can only be solved in the prior art
      adsorption of impurities, bacteria, and not be able to kill and
      cause secondary pollution The problem.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation process of the present invention obtained
      tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal will not fall off
      the surface of the silver process is simple, can achieve
      large-scale industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      The tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal applied to
      purify water or other drinking water projects, especially in
      bottled water production, without additional ozone disinfection
      process can be long-term preservation, and the treated water is
      not easy to scale, taste significantly improved; the treated water
      retains natural minerals beneficial to human body; water quality
      alkaline; dissolved oxygen increased by an average of about 30%;
      with long-lasting inhibition of bacteria, viruses, algae effect,
      in line with domestic and foreign experts recognized health water

      Example 3: Take 9 mesh coal activated charcoal in 80kg washing
      machine cleaning, and then dried in the dryer; 1 g Ag4O4 with 1250
      grams of calcium hydroxide solution PH value of 7.5, diluted
      solvent solution, sprayed with a 75 ? 80Kg on clean coal activated
      carbon; at 85 ? temperature sealed against light dryer, through
      the fan, far-infrared heating and drying, inverter fan: 11Hz dry,
      lasted 14 minutes, was prepared 80Kg tetroxide four silver coal
      activated carbon, prepared 80Kg tetroxide four silver activated
      carbon from coal contains 0.9g tetroxide four silver.<br>

      <br>
      Tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal in the drinking
      water treatment has broad application prospects, the use of
      activated carbon from coal tetroxide four silver production of
      water treatment equipment has the following characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      (1) utilization of raw water is high (99%), no waste water
      discharge <br>
      (2) equipment, small footprint, low power consumption, in line
      with water, land, energy saving principles.<br>
      (3) Water natural, mineral, active, long-lasting antibacterial, in
      line with healthy drinking water standards.<br>
      (4) device will not self-pollution, no water treatment equipment
      and after disinfection, removing ozone equipment in the bucket of
      bottled water production process to meet the clean production,
      environmental protection requirements, so that production workers
      in a a safe working environment, and the use of the present
      invention tetroxide four silver activated carbon from coal water
      treatment systems, low operating costs, rapid return on
      investment.<br>

      <br>
      According to the present invention tetroxide four silver activated
      carbon from coal in water purifier and drinking water supply
      project equipment other substances as contrast filter material
      application with existing water treatment equipment in use as the
      effect of the filter material:<br>
      [0043]<br>
      <br>
      Control "drinking water standards" (GB5749-2006), according to
      "drinking water standard test method" (GB5750-2006) for said
      customized raw water, respectively, with wood activated carbon,
      coal activated carbon, coconut shell activated carbon tetroxide
      four silver, tetroxide four silver coal activated carbon as a
      filter material is placed in water purification for active
      "pillars" experiments, targeted determination of the above items
      and found tetroxide four silver coal activated carbon adsorption
      of color, turbidity and so superior processing Several other
      activated carbon and coal activated drawn wide price much lower
      than the coconut shell activated carbon, it reduces the cost, easy
      to promote the use.<br>
