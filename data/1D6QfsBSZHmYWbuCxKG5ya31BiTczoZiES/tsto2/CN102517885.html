      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YUANRUO LING, et al.<br>
      <br>
      The invention discloses a silver-loaded textile compound and a
      sliver-loading process thereof. The silver-loaded textile compound
      comprises a silver-loaded textile body, wherein the silver-loaded
      textile is silver sesquioxide. The process steps are as follows:
      (1) placing textile in tetrasilver tetroxide solution, keeping the
      temperature of the mixture within 40 DEG C to 95 DEG C for 20-120
      minutes; (2), getting out and drying the textile for 5-150 minutes
      within 70 DEG C to 150 DEG C; (3), placing the dried textile in
      the solution of sodium (potassium) hydroxide and sodium
      (potassium) persulfate, keeping the temperature of the solution
      within 40 DEG C to 95 DEG C for 10-100 minutes; and (4), getting
      out and washing the textile 2-3 times with water, drying the
      washed textile within 70 DEG C to 150 DEG C to acquire the
      silver-loaded textile compound. The invention has the advantage
      that the silver sesquioxide loaded on the silver-loaded textile
      compound is a trivalent silver oxide with higher positive
      electricity, which is formed by the steps of bonding tetrasilver
      tetroxide with fabric to form a coordination bond, and then
      oxidizing the coordination bond; thus the silver sesquioxide is
      bonded with fiber fabric firmer to achieve stronger bactericidal
      action.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b>[0001]<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a textile containing silver
      compounds, particularly, the present invention is to design a
      textile containing silver compounds and silver craft.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b>[0004]<br>
      <br>
      Clothing Textiles and people's daily life most closely linked
      substance in first place, but often in contact with the outside
      world on clothing, parasitic microorganisms affect not only
      clothing above beauty and life, but more importantly, they are the
      main mode of transmission of human infectious diseases.<br>
      Now researchers found the culprit hospital infection after surgery
      is textiles (doctors and patients overalls clothes, inpatient bed
      sheets, etc.), so in practice the need to kill microorganisms
      textiles to meet the people's work and life demands.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      Silver as a bactericide already known two thousand years ago, the
      researchers based on the relative efficacy of different metals
      antimicrobial efficacy experiments were determined, arranged as
      follows:<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      Ag&gt; Hg&gt; Cu&gt; Cd&gt; Ni&gt; Co&gt; Zn&gt; Fe&gt; Ca<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Silver also has the role of bactericidal activity involved in
      different valence bond forms, and now researchers have generally
      agreed that by studying the price of silver and its related
      disinfection, disinfection of high priced higher than low-cost
      silver (J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 2009, 131, 16147-16155; Burns 2007, 33,
      139-148; East China University of Technology (Natural Science),
      2008, 34 (1), 86), namely Ag (III)&gt; Ag (II)&gt; Ag (I) &gt; Ag,
      tetroxide four silver oxide from the silver nitrate, which is
      considered to be one of the earliest silver oxide (AgO), McMillan
      J A in 1960 that the substance is an oxide of a monovalent and
      trivalent silver.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Patent No. 5,223,149 announced the discovery of four silver
      tetroxide can further oxidized to the trivalent form, namely, two
      silver and silver oxide,<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 + 4NaOH + Na2S2O8 = 2Ag2O3 + 2Na2SO4 + 2H2O or<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 + 4KOH + K2S2O8 = 2Ag2O3 + 2K2SO4 + 2H2O<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Silver as the main component of the antimicrobial silver textiles
      are textiles is taken as a mature proven technology, it has now
      been widely used and a large number of listed products.<br>
      <br>
      But most are using the following two techniques: one is formed by
      the adhesive and finishing agent silver ions or silver particles,
      in the fabric finishing process will be without its crossing to
      the fabric surface, such as a Chinese patent CN101048063A; another
      way is to use a reducing agent to the silver nitrate reduction to
      elemental nanosilver is now further into silver oxide.<br>
      <br>
      These methods are solid silver low, low price of silver contained
      in the silver antibacterial poor.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b>[0012]<br>
      <br>
      Technical problems to be solved by the present invention is to
      provide a solid silver and antibacterial capabilities are strong
      of a new textiles containing silver compounds and silver craft.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      To solve the above problems, the present invention is achieved by
      the following technical solutions.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      This textile silver compounds include silver textile itself, the
      silver for the silver contained in the textile silver oxide.<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      In order to adapt to a variety of textile range, the silver
      textiles knitted, circular woven fabrics, flat woven fabric, woven
      fabrics, non-woven fabric, yarn or omentum.<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      In order to expand the sources of material, constituting the
      silver textile materials are natural fibers, synthetic fibers or
      mixtures thereof.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      In order to have a better understanding of the material, said
      natural fibers are cotton, wool, linen, silk, bamboo, leather and
      blended products; the synthetic fibers comprise polypropylene
      fibers (PP), polyacrylonitrile fibers (acrylic), polyvinyl formal
      fiber, synthetic fiber rings dimensional (vinylon), polyamide
      fibers (nylon), polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      In order to develop a new type of textile silver compound, the
      process steps are as follows: (1) take place textiles tetroxide
      four silver solution, and incubated at 40-95 ? 20-120 minutes; (2)
      Remove textiles 70-150 drying the ? 5-150 min; (3) placed in the
      drying textiles sodium (potassium) and sodium persulfate
      (potassium) was incubated at 40-95 ? 10-100 min; (4 ) Remove the
      textiles washed with water 2-3 times, drying to obtain silver
      antimicrobial textiles in the 70-150 ?.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      To form a solid silver and antibacterial textiles relatively
      strong new silver compound, the textile disposed in the solution
      bath ratio of 3-30: 1; four silver concentration tetroxide
      solution as 50-2000ppm; sodium hydroxide (K) was dissolved nights
      a concentration of 0.01% to 1%; sodium persulfate (potassium) was
      dissolved nights a concentration of 0.01% to 1%.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the prior art, the usefulness of the present
      invention is: a silver oxide silver compound contained on this
      textile by tetroxide four silver and fabrics combine to form a
      coordination bond, after further oxidized with a positive higher
      electricity trivalent silver oxide, and fabric binding more
      tightly, sterilization ability.<br>
