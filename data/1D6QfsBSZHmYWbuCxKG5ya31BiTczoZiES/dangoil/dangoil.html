      <i>TAKING A DIP --A plastic tube covered on the bottom with a new
        self-cleaning, oil-separating membrane is immersed (left) into a
        mixture of water with a 4-cm layer of red-dyed petroleum on top.
        When the membrane reaches the water (center), water soaks the
        membrane and rinses off any petroleum that might have stuck to
        it. When the tube is lifted (right), it pulls out a 4-cm-layer
        of petroleum. </i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      A steel mesh with a novel self-cleaning coating can separate oil
      and water, easily lifting oil from an oil-water mixture and
      leaving the water behind (ACS Nano 2015, DOI:
      10.1021/acsnano.5b03791). If the coated mesh gets contaminated
      with oil, it can be simply rinsed off with water and reused. The
      new membrane promises to be a practical technology to clean up oil
      spills, its developers say.<br>
      <br>
      Emergency responders typically fight oil spills by burning, using
      booms and skimmers, or releasing chemical dispersants. Oil-water
      separation membranes would be faster and more effective. Although
      various types of membranes have been studied, they aren’t
      practical yet, mainly because they are easily contaminated with
      oil, which renders them useless, says Xiaokong Liu, a polymer
      chemistry and surface science researcher at the University of
      South Australia.<br>
      <br>
      Oil-water separation membranes fall into two categories. One is a
      water-repelling membrane that selectively lets oil seep through.
      Over time, this type gets clogged with oil and loses its
      effectiveness. The other, more common type of membrane loves water
      and repels oil when it is already wet, preventing oil from
      crossing. This type has to be completely wetted before it can be
      used. If oil touches it when it’s dry or partially dry—which
      happens easily in an oil-spill environmen t— it loses its
      oil-water separation ability and must be cleaned using detergents.<br>
      <br>
      Liu and his colleagues made a membrane of the second hydrophilic
      type, but with a key improvement that makes it more practical:
      Theirs can be quickly cleaned of oil contamination simply by water
      rinsing, which also means it doesn’t need to be wetted carefully
      before use.<br>

            Overcoming the Imperative Challenge of Oil–Water Separation

      <br>
      Herein we report a self-cleaning coating derived from zwitterionic
      poly(2-methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) brushes
      grafted on a solid substrate. The PMPC surface not only exhibits
      complete oil repellency in a water-wetted state (i.e., underwater
      superoleophobicity), but also allows effective cleaning of oil
      fouled on dry surfaces by water alone. The PMPC surface was
      compared with typical underwater superoleophobic surfaces realized
      with the aid of surface roughening by applying hydrophilic
      nanostructures and those realized by applying smooth hydrophilic
      polyelectrolyte multilayers. We show that underwater
      superoleophobicity of a surface is not sufficient to enable water
      to clean up oil fouling on a dry surface, because the latter
      circumstance demands the surface to be able to strongly bond water
      not only in its pristine state but also in an oil-wetted state.
      The PMPC surface is unique with its described self-cleaning
      performance because the zwitterionic phosphorylcholine groups
      exhibit exceptional binding affinity to water even when they are
      already wetted by oil. Further, we show that applying this PMPC
      coating onto steel meshes produces oil–water separation membranes
      that are resilient to oil contamination with simply water rinsing.
      Consequently, we provide an effective solution to the oil
      contamination issue on the oil–water separation membranes, which
      is an imperative challenge in this field. Thanks to the
      self-cleaning effect of the PMPC surface, PMPC-coated steel meshes
      can not only separate oil from oil–water mixtures in a
      water-wetted state, but also can lift oil out from oil–water
      mixtures even in a dry state, which is a very promising technology
      for practical oil-spill remediation. In contrast, we show that oil
      contamination on conventional hydrophilic oil–water separation
      membranes would permanently induce the loss of oil–water
      separation function, and thus they have to be always used in a
      completely water-wetted state, which significantly restricts their
      application in practice.<br>

        <b>WO2015113106</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Disclosed herein is an oil-water separation substrate comprising a
      porous substrate and a coating formed from an epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte on said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002 ] The present invention relates to substrates, such as
      membranes, that can be used to separate mixtures of oil and water,
      to methods for preparing these substrates, and to methods for
      separating oil and water mixtures using these substrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003 ] Contamination of water with oil is a constant problem in
      natural environments as well as in industrial settings. As a
      result, there is a need for effective methods for separating oil
      from oil-water mixtures.<br>
      <br>
      [0004 ] Oil and water mixtures can be separated using separation
      tanks in which the oil is allowed to separate from the water
      naturally and the oil is then removed from the water. However,
      this method is time consuming, inefficient and not particularly
      suitable for separations using large volumes. More commonly
      nowadays efficient oil-water separation relies on cross-flow
      filtration through hydrophobic (superhydrophobic) membranes which
      allow oil to pass through the membrane whilst retaining water
      above. However, as the density of oil is lower than that of water,
      water naturally settles below the oil. Therefore, oil-water
      separation through hydrophobic membranes of this type requires
      high energy input. Recently, hydrophilic membranes which can
      completely repel oil underwater have been used for oil water
      separation driven only by gravity. However, these hydrophilic
      membranes can only be used in a water- wetted state because the
      hydrophilic membranes are easily contaminated by oil in when they
      are in a dry state. Once a membrane has been contaminated with oil
      in this way it cannot be used for oil water separation any more.<br>
      <br>
      [00051 There is a need for oil-water separation substrates that
      overcome one or more of the problems with known substrates and/or
      provide an alternative to known substrates. SUMMARY<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In a first aspect, provided herein is an oil-water
      separation substrate, said substrate comprising a porous substrate
      and a coating formed from an epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte
      on said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In certain embodiments, the oil-water separation substrate
      is a mesh, fabric, sponge, foam or other nanoporous material. In
      certain specific embodiments, the substrate is a water
      purification membrane or filter.<br>
      <br>
      10008] In certain embodiments, the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte is a poly(ammonium phosphate). In certain specific
      embodiments, the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte has
      structural formula (I):<br>
      <br>

      [0009] In certain embodiments, the coating formed from the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte is cross linked. The coating formed
      from the epoxy functionalised may be cross linked using a cross
      linking agent. The cross linking agent may be a polyamine. The
      polyamine may be a polyamine comprising more than three primary
      amino groups. In certain embodiments, the polyamine is selected
      from the group consisting of poly(allylamine), polyethylenimine
      (branched), and polyv inyl amine). In certain specific
      embodiments, the polyamine is poly(allylamine). The polyamine may
      be coated onto the porous substrate w&lt;r&gt;ith the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte or the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte may be treated with the polyamine after the former
      has been coated onto the porous substrate. The primary amine
      groups of the polyamine react with the epoxy groups of the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte to form a cross- linked composite.

      and R9is selected from the group consisting of CI and Br.<br>
      <br>
      [001 1 1 In a third aspect, provided herein is a coating
      composition for coating a porous substrate to form an oil-water
      separation substrate, the coating composition comprising an
      aqueous mixture of an epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In certain embodiments of the third aspect, the coating
      composition further comprises a cross linking agent. The cross
      linking agent may be a polyamine. The polyamine may be a polyamine
      comprising more than three primary amino groups. In specific
      embodiments, the polyamine is selected from the group consisting
      of poly(allylamine), polyethylenimine (branched), and poly(vinyl
      amine).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In certain other embodiments of the third aspect, the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte may be treated with the polyamine
      after the former has been coated onto the porous substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a fourth aspect, provided herein is a method for forming
      an oil-water separation substrate, the method comprising providing
      a porous substrate and contacting the porous substrate with the
      coating composition according to the third aspect under conditions
      to form a coating formed from the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte on said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0015 ] In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a method
      for separating oil and water from an oil- water mixture, the
      method comprising contacting the oil-water mixture with the
      substrate of the first aspect of the invention under conditions to
      separate at least some of the oil from the oil-water mixture. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] Figure 1 shows X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) wide
      scans for a stainless steel mesh without (a) and with (b) an epoxy
      functionalised PMPC coating. Inset of b: High-resolution spectra
      for P 2p from the PMPC coated stainless steel mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Figure 2 shows a time series of optical photos recorded
      during the stainless steel meshes (aperture of 100 µ??) were
      contaminated by Nile red labelled canola oil in air, and then were
      immersed into water. The left sample is a piece of raw stainless
      steel mesh and the right one is a piece of stainless steel mesh
      coated with epoxy functionalised PMPC.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Figure 3 shows photographs showing: a. the epoxy
      functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel mesh is wetted by
      water; b. oil-water mixture was poured above the epoxy
      functionalised PMPC coated mesh; c. the oil-water mixture is
      separated.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Figure 4 shows a time series of optical photos recorded
      during which stainless steel mesh covered plastic tubes were
      immersed in an oil-water mixture to skim the oil out. It can be
      observed that the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated mesh can
      successfully skim the oil out from the oil-water mixture, but the
      same result cannot be achieved with the raw mesh.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      10020] The present invention, and embodiments thereof, will now be
      described in more detail. However, before proceeding it is
      important to note that various terms that will be used throughout
      the specification have meanings that will be well understood by a
      skilled addressee. However, for ease of reference, some of these
      terms will now be defined.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As discussed, the present invention provides an oil-water
      separation substrate, said substrate comprising a porous substrate
      and a coating fonned from an epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte
      on said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As discussed previously, hydrophilic membranes are known
      for use in separating oil from oil- water mixtures. However, these
      membranes tend to be contaminated with oil in a dry state which
      then renders them not fit for purpose. Advantageously, we have
      found that the substrates of the present invention are
      hydrophilic, oil-repellent underwater and self-cleaning which
      means that oil contaminations on the substrate can simply be
      washed away with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The substrates of the present invention are particularly
      suitable for use in oil-water separations and for oil skimming
      from oil-water mixtures. The fonner property is highly desirable
      for remediating oil contaminated waters whilst the latter property
      is highly desired for oil spill remediation.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Without intending to be bound by any specific theory, we
      suggest that the functional groups of the polyelectrolyte, such as
      the phosphate and ammonium groups of the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte of formula (1), have a strong hydration ability
      and this enables the surface of the substrate to strongly trap
      water molecules. Even if the surface is contaminated by oil the
      oil can be replaced by water. The coating can be used for
      oil-water separation because it can be highly hydrated in water,
      thus forming a dense water layer which can retain oil above the
      water layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The porous substrate may be any flexible, rigid or
      semi-rigid metal, plastic or ceramic material having pores of a
      size sufficient to allow water to pass through. Advantageously, we
      have found that the coating comprising the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte can be formed on a range of substrate materials
      and, indeed, its effectiveness as a coating is largely independent
      of the material used in the substrate. By way of example only,
      suitable metal substrates that can be used include iron, titanium,
      aluminium, nickel, copper, and alloys of any of these metals such
      as steel. The metal substrate may be in the form of a mesh,
      fabric, sponge, foam or other porous material. Suitable plastic
      substrates that can be used include polytetrafluoroethylenene
      (Teflon), polyethylene, polypropylene (PP), polydimethylsiloxane
      (PDMS), polystyrene (PS), poly(ether sulfone), polyacrylonitrile,
      cellulose acetate, polyvinylidene fluoride, polysulfone,
      polyamide, polyurethane,
      poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP),
      poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and poly(4-methyl- l -pentene)
      (PMP). The plastic substrate may be in the form of a mesh, fabric,
      sponge or foam.<br>
      <br>
      10029] The substrate may be any suitable form, such as a membrane,
      filter, film, boom, and the like. It can be any shape. In specific
      embodiments, the porous substrate is in the form of a water
      purification membrane or filter. In other embodiments, the porous
      substrate is in the form of an elongate, flexible boom that can be
      used to contain oil spills and/or skim oil from the surface of a
      body of water. [0030] The average pore diameter of the substrate
      may be in the range of about 50 nm to about 5 mm. For example, the
      substrate may be a stainless steel mesh with apertures of about 25
      µ??, about 50 µ?? or about 100 µ??.<br>
      <br>
      [0031 ] The epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte may be any
      polyelectrolyte having one or more epoxy groups covalently bonded
      thereto. In embodiments, the polyelectrolyte is a poly(ammonium
      phosphate). In embodiments, the polyelectrolyte is a
      poly(tetraalkyl ammonium phosphate).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In specific embodiments, the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte has structural formula (I):<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="0032.jpg" height="161"

      <br>
      (I)<br>
      <br>
      [0033] wherein R R4, and R5are each independently C1-C3 alkyl;<br>
      <br>
      [0034] R2and R3are each independently selected from the group
      consisting of H and C i-C2alkyl; [0035] R6, R7, R8are each
      independently Cj-C2alkyl; and [0036] R9is selected from the group
      consisting of CI and Br.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The C 1 -C3 alkyl group may be selected from the group
      consisting of: -CH2-, -CH2CH2-, - CH2CH2CH2-, and -CH2(CH3)CH2-.
      The Cj-C? alkyl group may be selected from the group consisting
      of: -CH2-, and -CH2CH2-.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The term "a coating formed from an epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte" is used herein because the porous substrate is
      coated with a coating composition comprising the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte which may, in turn, react with
      functional groups on the substrate. For example, the epoxy group
      of the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte may react with hydroxy
      or amino groups on the substrate and, therefore, after coating not
      all of the molecules in the coating may be in the form of the
      epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Optionally, the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte in the
      coating may be cross linked using a cross linking agent. The cross
      linking agent may be a multifunctional molecule having two or more
      functional groups that are capable of reacting with functional
      groups of the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte. In certain
      embodiments, the cross linking agent is a polyamine and the
      coating is formed from the epoxy fiinctionalised polyelectrolyte
      and the polyamine. The polyamine may be a polyamine comprising
      more than three primary amino groups. In embodiments, the
      polyamine is selected from the group consisting of
      poly(allylamine), polyethylenimine (branched), and poly(vinyl
      amine). In specific embodiments, the polyamine is
      poly(allylamine).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte may be cross
      linked during coating of the porous substrate with the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte or the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte may be treated with the cross linking agent after
      the former has been coated onto the porous substrate. For example,
      the polyamine may be coated onto the porous substrate with the
      epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte or the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte may be treated with the polyamine after the former
      has been coated onto the porous substrate. The primary amine
      groups of the polyamine react with the epoxy groups of the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte to form a cross-linked composite.<br>
      <br>
      Polyamines comprising more than three primary amino groups are
      particularly suitable for this purpose. Polyamines that can be
      used include poly(allylamine), polyethylenimine (branched), and
      polyvinyl amine). Without intending to be bound by any specific
      theory, we suggest that the polyamine facilitates the adhesion of
      the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte onto the substrate and
      improve the coating stability because the primary amine groups
      react with the epoxy groups to cross link the epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0041 ] To coat the substrate, an aqueous coating composition
      comprising the epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte and polyamine
      (if present) is formed. The concentration of the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte in the aqueous coating composition
      may be from about 0.05 mg/mL to about 500 mg/mL. The concentration
      of the polyamine in the coating composition may be from about 0.01
      mg/mL to about 100 mg/mL. In embodiments, the concentration of the
      epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte in the aqueous coating
      composition is about 5 mg/mL and the concentration of the
      polyamine in the coating composition (if present) is about 1
      mg/mL. The mass ratio of epoxy functionalised polyelectrolyte to
      polyamine in the coating composition may be in the range of 5000:
      1 to 5: 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Optionally, the coating composition can contain solvents,
      excipients and/or additives as required. Specifically, the coating
      composition may contain conventional coating adjuvants, such as,
      for example, tackifiers, pigments, extenders, emulsifiers,
      crosslinkers, coalescing agents, buffers, neutralisers, thickeners
      or rheology modifiers, humectants, wetting agents, biocides,
      plasticisers, antifoaming agents, colorants, waxes, anti-oxidants,
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0043 ] The present invention provides an epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte having structural formula (I):<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="0043.jpg" height="177"
          width="413"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      (I) wherein R1 ;R4, and R5are each independently C 1-C3 alkyl;<br>
      <br>
      R2and R3are each independently selected from the group consisting
      of H and C i-C2alkyl;<br>
      <br>
      R6, R7, R8are each independently C|-C2alkyl; and R9is selected
      from the group consisting of CI and Br.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The present invention also provides a method for forming an
      oil-water separation substrate, the method comprising providing a
      porous substrate and contacting the porous substrate with a
      coating composition comprising an epoxy functionalised
      polyelectrolyte to form a coating formed from the epoxy
      functionalised polyelectrolyte on said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The surface of the substrate may be contacted with the
      coating composition by conventional application methods such as
      dip coating, spin coating, spray coating, curtain coating, roller
      coating, and the like. In embodiments, the surface of the
      substrate is contacted with the aqueous coating composition by
      dipping the substrate into the coating composition for a time and
      at a temperature that results in adsorption of at least some of
      the coating materials to the surface of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In embodiments, the substrate is immersed in the coating
      composition for a period of from about 1 hour to about 36 hours.
      In specific embodiments, the immersion time is 24 hours. The
      thickness of the coating that is deposited on the surface of the
      substrate will depend, at least in part, on the l ength of time
      the substrate is immersed in the coating composition. The
      thickness may be between about 2 nm and about 1000 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] After removal from the coating composition the substrate is
      typically dried, or allowed to dry, to form a film on the surface.
      Typically, the solvent can be removed by dying the coating
      composition at room temperature or at elevated temperature (e.g.
      from about 5°C to about 95°C). The substrate can also be dried
      using a stream of air or nitrogen or at reduced pressure, if
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The coating composition will normally be applied so as to
      provide a substantially uniform application of the coating
      composition onto the surface of the substrate and the formation of
      a continuous layer on the substrate. However, it is also
      contemplated that the coating composition can be applied so as to
      form a discontinuous layer on the substrate. In other words, the
      coating may cover the whole of the surface to which it is applied
      or it may cover only part of the surface to which it is applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In embodiments, the substrate is a water purification
      membrane or filter. Membranes of this type are typically made from
      poly(ether sulfone), polyacrylonitrile or polyvinylidene fluoride
      and are commonly used in water or wastewater filtration. We have
      found that the coating described herein separates oil from oil
      contaminated water that is passed through the membrane or filter.
      Advantageously, the methods of the present invention provide a
      relatively simple, and therefore inexpensive, way to separate oil
      from water and can be used for a range of applications such as
      remediation of oil contaminated industrial, domestic, municipal
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The substrates of the present invention could also be used
      to separate two immiscible oils.<br>
      <br>
      [0051 ] The present invention also provides a method for
      separating oil and water from an oil-water mixture, the method
      comprising contacting the oil-water mixture with the substrate of
      the first aspect of the invention under conditions to separate at
      least some of the oil from the oil-water mixture.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0053] A 100 mL flask was charged with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl
      phosphorylcholine (5 g, 16.96 mmol), 2,2'-bipyridine (61.7 mg, 0.4
      mmol), glycidol 2-bromopropionate ( 104.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) and 10 mL
      of methanol. The flask was then sealed and degassed using a
      freeze-thaw method for 3 cycles. Subsequently, a catalyst
      containing CuBr ( 10.1 mg, 0.070 mmol) and CuBr2(5.0 mg, 0.022
      mmol) was added rapidly. After 3 cycles of degassing again, the
      flask was charged with argon and incubated in a water bath at 30
      °C for 12h. After reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with
      ethanol and then filtered with silica column using ethanol as
      eluent to remove the residual CuBr2. The obtained ethanol solution
      was then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The concentrated
      ethanol solution was then precipitated by dropping it into a
      tenfold excess of non-solvent tetrahydrofuran (TH F). The
      precipitate was collected by centrifuge and dried in oven. [0054]
      Example 2 - Preparation of a coating composition<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A coating composition comprising an aqueous solution of the
      epoxy functionalised PMCP was prepared by dissolving the epoxy
      functionalised PMCP from Example 1 in water at a concentration of
      5mg/mL.<br>

      [0058] Example 4 - Preparation of coated stainless steel meshes
      for oil-water separation<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Stainless steel mesh with aperture of 100 µ?? was
      successively cleaned by sonication in acetone, iso-propanol and
      ethanol for 10 min for each step. The cleaned stainless steel mesh
      was dried using N2and then immersed in the coating composition of
      Example 2 for 24 h. The stainless steel mesh was then rinsed by
      water and dried by N2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0060] Results - Surface composition of the PMPC coated
        stainless steel mesh</b><br>
      <br>
      [00611 In order to confirm the stainless steel mesh was
      successfully coated with the PMPC<br>
      <br>
      polyelectrolyte, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
      were employed to analyse the surface composition of the stainless
      steel mesh before and after being coated with PMPC.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] As shown in Figure 1 , after being coated with the epoxy
      functionalised PMPC, the signal of Fe and Cr which are the typical
      elements from stainless steel mesh cannot be detected, but
      significant N and P which are from PMPC are detected, revealing
      the stainless steel mesh is successfully coated with the PMPC
      polyelectrolytes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0063] Results - Self-cleaning property of the epoxy
        functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel mesh</b><br>
      <br>
      [0064] The epoxy functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel meshes
      exhibit excellent self-cleaning properties. Specifically, the oil
      contamination on the meshes can be easily and completely washed
      away by water without aid of any surfactant.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] As shown in Figure 2, it can be observed that the two
      samples can be contaminated by canola oil in air, but when they
      were immersed into water, the oil would spread on the raw mesh
      more aggressively, but in contrast, the oil on the epoxy
      functionalised PMPC coated mesh completely detached from the mesh.
      Therefore, the epoxy functionaliscd PMPC coated mesh exhibits
      excellent self-cleaning properties which enables oil contamination
      on the mesh to be washed away with water without the need for
      detergents or other cleaning materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0066] Results - Epoxy functionalised PMPC coated stainless
        steel mesh used for oil-water separation</b><br>
      <br>
      10067] As shown in Figure 2, the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated
      stainless steel meshes exhibit perfect oil repellence in water.
      Therefore, the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel
      meshes can be used for oil-water separation.<br>
      <br>
      10068] As shown in Figure 3, it was observed that for the water
      wetted epoxy functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel mesh only
      permitted water to pass through and it retained the oil above.
      This demonstrates that the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated
      stainless steel mesh can be used for high efficient oil-water
      separation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0069] Results - PMPC coated stainless steel mesh used for
        skimming</b><br>
      <br>
      [0070] By combining the self-cleaning property and the oil-water
      separation ability of the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated
      stainless steel mesh, the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated
      stainless steel mesh can be used for oil skimming.<br>
      <br>
      10071] As seen in Figure 4a, one end of a plastic tube was covered
      by a piece of stainless steel mesh and fixed by a hollowed screw
      cap, this setup is further used for oil skimming. In figures a, b
      and c, there are two plastic tubes with one end covered by
      stainless steel meshes. The left tube is covered by a piece of raw
      stainless steel mesh, the right one is covered by a piece of epoxy
      functionalised PMPC coated stainless steel mesh. The beaker
      contains water-hexadecane mixtures, the hexadecane was stained by
      oil red O. Figure a, b, c is a time series of optical photos
      recorded during the stainless steel meshes coved plastic tubes
      were immersed into the oil-water mixture to skim the oil out. It
      can be observed that the epoxy functionalised PMPC coated mesh can
      successfully skim the oil out from the oil-water mixture, but the
      raw mesh can not.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0072] Example 5 - Preparation of coated stainless steel meshes
